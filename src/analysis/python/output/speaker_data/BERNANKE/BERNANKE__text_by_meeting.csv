7083,2002-08-13,BERNANKE," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As we search for the signal of an   incipient recovery, we have heavy noise coming from two sides  The first source of noise is the   financial markets  Our financial markets usually exhibit controlled hysteria, but lately we   probably could drop the adjective “controlled”  The stock market in particular seems to be   searching for a consensus valuation without too much luck so far  The other source of noise is   the data Of course, revisions in the data show that the recession was worse than we thought    We were always pessimistic about forecasting, and now backcasting seems to be a problem as   well! I have a modest proposal, which is that if the BEA can restate GDP figures and firms can   restate their earnings, the Fed should have the option to go back and restate interest rates from   last time  [Laughter]            August 13, 2002 55 of 92  How should we respond to these noisy conditions?  First, regarding financial markets, I   think the best thing to do is to keep our heads while all about us are losing theirs  Monetary   policy should be directed at the underlying economy and should respond to financial markets   only insofar as they contain information about or affect the underlying economy  I think on net   the effects of financial markets on the current economy are not very large The direct effects of   the stock market are being partly offset by strong house prices, lower interest rates, and a falling   dollar  It’s true that the volatility that we’re currently observing at record levels is feeding   anxiety and caution, but volatility by its nature tends to be temporary  So on net the current   market volatility in my view is an argument for waiting to see where things settle down before   taking action   Second, regarding the other source of noise, the data revisions, we can no longer blame   the shallow recession for the weak recovery  [Laughter] The economy is not booming   obviously; but looking again beyond the financial markets, it seems to be reasonably sound  In   particular, the revision has largely left intact the growth in productivity, which I believe in some   sense is the most crucial element of the recovery and bodes well for both profits and economic   growth I note the comments that Governor Kohn made about financial conditions, but overall I   think the financial headwinds are not very strong  Banks are healthy, consumer and firm balance   sheets are reasonably strong for this stage of the cycle, and a lot of what is happening in the   markets with respect to risk spreads and the like has more to do with volatility and financial   market uncertainty than with fundamental conditions    Third, the policy stances, both monetary and fiscal, remain expansionary  It’s true that   there are some uncertainties as we look forward  Consumers and the government are doing their         August 13, 2002 56 of 92  part, but firms in particular seem relatively hesitant both on the investment side and on the hiring   side   I think it’s worth noting that there’s an awful lot of heterogeneity among industries in   terms of growth potential  Certain industries—telecommunications, aircraft, commercial real   estate, and others—are doing very poorly They are suffering from overhangs, and it’s   questionable whether small changes in interest rates, for example, would substantially affect their   activity On the other hand, residential housing, autos, and consumer goods look very strong,   and other areas like equipment and software seem to be improving   My bottom line here is that there’s a lot of uncertainty and that any of the three responses   suggested in the Bluebook would not be unreasonable  But given the uncertainty that we have   now, my inclination is to wait and see and to get more information  At the same time, I don’t   think we want to appear tone deaf to legitimate concerns among the public about the state of the   economy  And I think we ought to set the stage to respond in case conditions worsen  So I   would indicate my preference to communicate either in the statement or in the balance of risks   sentence that the Fed is vigilant and is willing and able to cut rates in the future if conditions   worsen Thank you   Mr Chairman, I concur with both parts of your recommendation  In   particular, the weakening of the economy is quite evident to the public, and I think it’s important   that we show that the Federal Reserve recognizes that and is prepared to respond to it  I’d like to   add that I also agree with you that if things take a turn for the worse, we should be prepared to   act very aggressively I’m not one who worries about zero bounds, for example  In fact, one   might interpret the expected decline in the future federal funds rate as being not a certainty of a   small decline but a small probability of a larger decline  So to summarize, I do concur with your   proposal  "
7109,2002-09-24,BERNANKE,"  The last time we had a Middle Eastern conflict, in the Gulf War, I   think currency went way up Is that right?        September 24, 2002 8 of 115  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with many speakers today that   the recovery remains disappointingly soft  The reluctance of firms to hire or invest is   particularly discouraging given continued strong spending by consumers and the remarkable   growth of productivity The consumer and business sectors can’t diverge indefinitely  That can   be resolved in one of two ways, and one of them is rather unpleasant     A particularly striking aspect of the Greenbook forecast to me is that it envisions   continuing declines in core inflation  As shown in the table on page 11 of Part 1, the rate of   increase in the core PCE deflator is projected to fall from 19 percent in 2001 to 13 percent in   2004 Over the same period the core CPI inflation is projected to fall from 27 percent to   19 percent and growth in the GDP deflator from 20 percent to 14 percent  Some alternative   Greenbook scenarios have the core PCE deflator falling to below 1 percent by 2004  I think   inflation as low as projected is potentially a serious risk for the economy  To the extent that we   believe the Greenbook projections for inflation as well as the unemployment rate, both of which                                                                September 24, 2002 74 of 115  suggest slack for the foreseeable future, this seems to me to be a prima facie case for easing   policy at this point   I understand, of course, that things are never that simple  There’s an enormous amount of   uncertainty to be reckoned with, and uncertainty suggests caution for central bankers as well as   for businesses One concern I do have about easing now is that it might exacerbate the   imbalances in the economy by further heating up sectors that are already strong, such as   residential construction and autos, while only indirectly benefiting investment and the labor   market  I also appreciate the dangers of excessive fine-tuning, oversteering, and overshooting    For these reasons, I understand that we may want to wait to see how events unfold before taking   further action  I hope, though, that we will not set the threshold for taking action too high  The   strategy of preemptive strikes should apply with at least as great a force to incipient deflation as   it does to incipient inflation  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I can support waiting for more information  I’m a   little uncertain and confused about the role of geopolitical concerns in the statement  We don’t   want to tie ourselves to saying that we would act only if certain geopolitical events occur  In   particular, if the sluggishness continues but the issue of Iraq is unresolved, would that preclude   action?     Mr Chairman, I appreciate your analysis  I’m just wondering how    you’re going to get all of that in the statement!  [Laughter]  "
7134,2002-11-06,BERNANKE," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to focus on a simple arithmetic   implication of the unusual productivity growth that we’ve been observing, which is that it creates   a wedge between the rate of output growth and the rate of input growth  As a result, we have a   situation currently in which the recovery, measured in terms of output growth and spending   growth, seems if not robust at least acceptable  But if we look at the economy from the input   growth side or the factor utilization side, we see a very, very weak economy  Indicators of labor   utilization, for example, including payroll employment, the workweek, and production worker   hours, have been basically flat for the year  Indeed, I had a comparison done between these   series for the current period and the 1991-92 jobless recovery, and they seem to be identical   Capital is likewise not being used to its capacity  Capacity utilization has not only been   flat for the past year, but its absolute level is at near-record lows in the aggregate as well as in   many individual industries  In short, the evidence from the input side of the economy suggests   that the gap between output and potential output is, if anything, widening rather than   diminishing  Continued slowing in core inflation, both at the producer and consumer levels—   which I talked about at the last meeting—is consistent with the presumption of a significant   output gap in the current economy   I think there’s agreement around the table that in the language of macro textbooks the   economy is facing a series of IS shocks—various factors that have inhibited the desire of firms to   invest and consumers to buy  The right response to that normally is to stimulate and lower            November 6, 2002 74 of 122  interest rates still further The FOMC has been quite patient  We’ve kept the funds rate   unchanged now for almost a year  So I think it is time to consider taking some action  A   significant rate cut at this point would not be a panacea obviously, but I do think it would help   Also, I’d like to take issue a bit with the view that there’s a generalized capital overhang    One would think that the story would be that certain industries—like the telecom industry, for   example—have so much capital relative to their long-term needs that there is essentially no   interest rate at which they’d be willing to invest  If you thought that was the case and if you   looked at factory utilization or capacity utilization across industries, you would expect to see   most industries close to normal, but with a few sectors at extremely low utilization levels,   suggesting that they have tremendous overhangs of capital  In fact, what we have is a relatively   normal distribution of capacity utilization across industries—that is, slack is generalized rather   than concentrated in only a few sectors  Given the availability of complementary resources,   labor in particular, I’m not sure that there can be such a thing as a generalized capital overhang    In any case, I’m more optimistic than Governor Ferguson that interest rate reductions might   increase investment spending   Another positive factor I think worth mentioning is these very weak inventories, which   suggest that if spending does increase it will be translated more directly into production rather   than into inventory reduction And finally, in contrast to 1991, there do not appear to be   significant financial headwinds in this case, although Governors Kohn and Gramlich mentioned   a few issues, to impede the effects of a rate cut at this juncture     So in short, I don’t know about pumpkins, [laughter] but while the economy hasn’t fallen   down the stairs, I think it could use a push to make it up the next few steps  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I also support both parts of the recommendation  I   think 50 basis points is just right  I would be less concerned about retaining the bias toward   weakness on the grounds that the market survey data suggest that there’s essentially a universal   expectation that we will retain that bias even when people anticipate a 50 basis point decline  So   I don’t think that we would create a shock  Nevertheless, I defer to those who have been in   markets and understand their deep psychology So I do concur with the recommendation  "
7160,2002-12-10,BERNANKE," Dino, on the mortgage-backed securities chart on page 2, I wondered   if the sharp declines might reflect a decline in refinancing risks Or do you think they reflect the   same consideration of all the risks that apply to other kinds of debt?   Thank you    May I follow up quickly?  The stochastic shocks you used are drawn   from the whole postwar period?    The volatility of these shocks has been much smaller in the last   decade or so   I guess I’m batting cleanup again  At this point there’s not a great   deal to add, but I’d like to reinforce some of the comments made by President Poole, Governor   Ferguson, and Governor Bies about the upside potential for the recovery     Although the news has not been entirely positive since our last meeting, I think the risk of   a double dip or worse has receded considerably  Consumers seem likely to continue to support   the recovery, and there are also some early signs of spring in investment and in the labor market    No doubt 2002 will go down as having been a very difficult year for the economy, but in every   cloud there’s always a bit of a silver lining  In that regard I think that there’s some evidence that   the US private sector has used the past six months or so very effectively to restructure itself and   to position itself for future growth   On the real side, the productivity numbers we’ve talked so much about indicate a great   deal of cost cutting, restructuring, and consolidation that will provide a basis for further   expansion The weakness in investment we’ve also discussed extensively; the one hypothesis is   that it’s the response to geopolitical uncertainty and other kinds of uncertainty  I think part of the   story may be that companies, particularly those in high-tech industries, are still digesting and   absorbing the investment they did in the late 1990s —learning how to use it better and looking               December 10, 2002 66 of 87  for new directions and new opportunities  There are in fact some  indications of recovery in the   high-tech sector, suggesting that perhaps that adjustment process is at least beginning to wind   down, laying the basis for a recovery in that area   On the financial side, one striking factor is that many firms have engaged in balance sheet   repair—improving liquidity, improving their debt structure, and so on  I think there’s also some   sense that the new corporate governance environment that fell upon us in the summer is   beginning to be absorbed to some extent by markets and firms  My evidence of this is only the   general calming of financial markets, the decline in spreads, and the fact that we are beginning to   see some new issuance in the market     I’ll just mention that, while still in its very early days, the new security environment is   causing both firms and government to begin to adapt, with some adjustments being made along   those lines So, while it has been a weak year, the upside is that a lot of restructuring has   occurred to prepare for the future, which may help to provide a basis for good growth in the next   year   As I mentioned, the consumer continues to hold up his end  If one looks at the details of   the consumer’s position, it is not as bad as those in the media make it out to be  Despite the up   and down movement in the stock market, wealth-to-income ratios appear to be stabilizing around   normal levels  Income continues to rise smartly  And the refinancing wave has supported not   only spending but also the consolidation of debt, with the extraction of equity from homes   helping to reduce and consolidate credit card and other debts, for example  The labor market is   still somewhat of a puzzle, but it doesn’t seem to be deteriorating, and I think there are some   grounds for optimism there                                                                   December 10, 2002 67 of 87  The main risks to the optimistic recovery scenario are largely external to the private   sector We’ve talked about war and terrorism, and there’s a lot of fiscal uncertainty as well as   fiscal possibility And conditions abroad are an issue   I think our easing last time was very well timed  It seemed clearly to have benefits on the   second moments of financial markets as well as the first moments  As we go forward, I   personally will keep a close eye on the risk premiums and other measures of stress in financial   markets that I think reflect a number of these concerns  Also, since our measures of output gaps   at this point are fairly problematic, given the uncertainty about productivity growth and so on, I   think it will be important to keep a close eye on core inflation, which may be our best indicator   of the output gap Overall, I’m quite happy about the outlook  Though the picture is mixed, on   balance I think the information that has become available over the last five weeks or so has been   positive  Thank you   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  If your brevity is   going to be a habit, though, I would like to get my tuition back  [Laughter]  "
7186,2003-01-28,BERNANKE,"  That means our value added is 004  [Laughter]    Rational expectations in terms of financial markets, not necessarily   the rest of the economy?    You referred to term structure evidence  This is different from the   fed funds evidence that Glenn was referring to or the same?    I ask because I’m very interested in this basic point that the Fed   should be more predictable in order to use the short-term rate to influence long-term rates and   whether that is an important issue  In particular, your evidence is very interesting, Glenn  I was   wondering if there had been evidence on whether or not the responsiveness of long-term interest   rates to movements in the fed funds rate was consistent with the predictability of the type that   you propose or the type that uses more partial adjustment  That would seem to be a separate test    I was wondering if you had done anything more directly on this hypothesis   January 28-29, 2003 31 of 195     One might argue that Glenn’s interpretation of the Taylor rule is   correct—that there is no inertia in the policy rule and that there should be more in order to get   more effect on long-term rates  I think that’s an open question   January 28-29, 2003 32 of 195     That’s different  That’s the interest rate responding endogenously to   the expected evolution of the economy      Thank you    Governor Ferguson, the coefficients inferred from our behavior are   much lower than the ones that were found to be optimal in the earlier exercise   Yes    Your decomposition of multifactor productivity into permanent and   temporary components is, I guess, largely statistical  I wanted to push you a bit more as to   whether you had direct evidence on the permanence of MFP growth and on technological   dynamism in the US economy more generally  You do have that graph on R&D spending, but   what information do you have, for example, on the stock of R&D investment, patents, and the   diffusion of innovation across industries or from surveys on types of innovation?  I note the   negative impact of venture capital drying up and those sorts of factors  I’m concerned about this   for a couple of reasons  One is the related issue of the extent to which innovation is capital   embodied  To the extent that we want to have an investment-led recovery, we’ll want to see a lot   of these innovations being translated into new investments  So that’s an important question     Another issue—besides, of course, the basic issue of the sustainability of productivity   growth—involves one of the leading alternative hypotheses to the geopolitical risk hypothesis,   which is what I call the real business-cycle theory  That theory says that perhaps the   January 28-29, 2003 88 of 195    technological hype of the new economy was overstated and we might have a less exciting period   now in terms of technological opportunity, which might lead to a slower growth phase in the   near future  These are very important issues  Again, my question is, To what extent do we have   more-direct evidence on the technological development of the economy?    Do you do any kind of sectoral breakdown of your MFP projections?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I continue to believe that structurally the   US economy is reasonably healthy, both financially and in real terms  So why is the economy   struggling?  A few stories have circulated  In my view, the various analyses we’ve been hearing   comparing the United States economy to the post-bubble Japanese economy are overwrought to   say the least  There’s little evidence of important remaining capital overhang except in a few   sectors  Moreover, as I’ve said before, I don’t think it’s meaningful to talk about a generalized   January 28-29, 2003 137 of 195    capital overhang  To my mind “generalized capital overhang” is just another name for   insufficient aggregate demand or low general capital utilization  In any case, the main post-  bubble problems in Japan were financial, and there is certainly no comparable set of problems   here  As my earlier question suggested, another possible explanation for the slow recovery is   that there’s a lull in the technological opportunity for growth, a real business cycle  This also   seems somewhat implausible to me, but we’ll have to wait and see  If that is the case, then   there’s not much that monetary policy can do about it     At this juncture the leading hypothesis must still be the geopolitical uncertainty and its   damping effects on hiring and investment decisions  I feel some déjà vu here  My PhD thesis   twenty-five years ago considered the problem of a firm contemplating an irreversible physical   investment in the face of uncertainty  As it happened, the example I used in my paper was   uncertainty about the long-term price of oil  I showed in my dissertation that the firm’s optimal   hurdle rate for investment not only increases with the degree of uncertainty, as might be   expected, but also was higher the nearer the expected resolution of the uncertainty  Intuitively,   uncertainty that is expected to be resolved relatively soon is a strong incentive to delay   commitment   Currently the geopolitical situation is not only one of high uncertainty but also one in   which the uncertainty may be resolved at least partially in a matter of weeks or a few months    The damping forces of uncertainty on the economy are therefore currently at their maximum   level  A reasonably likely scenario, one that we all hope for, is that the geopolitical situation will   be speedily and favorably resolved and that a significant economic recovery will therefore   follow  Frankly, therefore, I don’t think there is much we can do about this now  We’re just   going to have to wait and see what happens   January 28-29, 2003 138 of 195    There is, of course, also the possibility that the economy will continue to move sideways   into the spring either because the geopolitical uncertainties drag on or because the new   investment and hiring that we’re expecting now simply are not forthcoming, perhaps because of   continuing business pessimism  Given the ongoing slack in utilization of labor and capital and   our projection that core PCE inflation may slip to 1 percent or lower, I would hope that in such a   circumstance we would be prepared to ease aggressively earlier rather than later on the grounds   that the risk of inaction at that point would be greater than the risk of action  Thank you    I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
7216,2003-03-18,BERNANKE,"  Dino, my question is on the Japanese government yield curves   shown on page 1  Would you interpret the decline in the yield curve over the last year as a   change in inflation or deflation expectations, or is it a change in liquidity premiums as a result of   the net supply of bonds and the demand for liquidity?  Can you parse it between those two?    We don’t have any survey data or other information on long-term   deflation expectations?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many have noted, we’re currently in   a period of maximum uncertainty, with the result that the economy is almost in a state of   suspended animation  Until the world situation clarifies, the hurdle rate for investment or any   major commitment will be very high, as some of my colleagues have noted  By the same token,   any action we would take on rates today would be largely inframarginal   I continue to believe that the economy has substantial fundamental and financial   strengths  There is also a lot of accumulated slack in the economy because we’ve had essentially   no employment gains for about two years  Therefore, I think there’s a good chance that a   reasonably successful resolution of the Iraqi situation will lead to strong growth in the second   half of this year and in 2004  But in deference to President Minehan, I also agree that some   alternative, more negative scenarios are possible  Here are two   The first is what I call the “fear of fear itself” scenario—continuing pessimism  There   might be a less than satisfactory outcome to the war or continuing fear of terrorism, in which   case consumer confidence and self-confirming doubts might lead to slow growth in investment   and consumer spending  I think that’s a real possibility and one that we need to keep in mind    March 18, 2003 67 of 101    A second possibility, which is perhaps complementary to that, would be a weak profits   scenario  Firms could find that their international markets are very weak, and they could   continue to suffer from high energy costs and high costs for insurance and pensions  That   combined with structural issues in a number of major industries and perhaps a lack of   technological opportunities—or opportunities that are less good than hoped for—might result in   profits that are not strong  That in turn would lead to weaker stock market valuations and less   investment than we’re hoping for  So those are two possible scenarios  Given the amount of   slack in the economy, I think either of those situations, if they were to materialize, would be   amenable to continued stimulation from both monetary and fiscal policy   Let me say a word about timing  Over the intermeeting period there is, of course, the   possibility that the current very high level of uncertainty will be resolved one way or the other    On the one hand, we could get very good results in Iraq with strong financial market reactions, a   boost in consumer confidence, strong anecdotal reports, and so on  That would support the case   for waiting and watching with the hope that the strong recovery would commence  On the other   hand, we might get the other tail of the distribution of possible outcomes—bad results in Iraq and   much concern at home, and negative financial market responses to that  But I want to echo what   David Stockton and several others have pointed out—namely that there is a large middle area of   the distribution that we might be facing at the next meeting  There may still be considerable   uncertainty about the state of the economy going forward and whether or not the scenario in the   Greenbook will in fact be realized  I would like to caution against the situation where we are   continually waiting for uncertainty to be resolved before taking action  That situation could go   on indefinitely  If the economy is still struggling and if there is no significant improvement or   March 18, 2003 68 of 101    evidence of increasing strength by our next meeting, I hope we will at least consider the case for   easing policy at that time  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support both parts of the recommendation  "
7240,2003-03-25,BERNANKE,  There’s a report of the Desk buying TIPS  Is that correct?  
7257,2003-04-08,BERNANKE,"  This is Ben  My question is actually more for Vincent, I think, but it   follows on Karen’s comments about oil  Since March 19, oil prices have come down quite a bit,   interest rates have dropped a little, and there has been a reduction in volatility  The war news has   been generally good, and stock prices are basically where they were on March 19  Has there   been news on earnings or other medium-term or long-term news that would offset the benefits of   those macro developments on stock prices?      Thank you   April 8, 2003 7 of 31   "
7267,2003-04-16,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Everyone has talked about the real side of   the economy, so let me say a word about the other objective, which relates to inflation  The   twelve-month inflation rate as measured by the core PCE deflator is currently 14 percent  As   measured by the core chain weighted CPI, it’s 12 percent; by the so-called market-based core PCE   deflator, it’s 09 percent  All of these inflation measures have been falling in the last year  If the   US economy grows 3 percent in 2003 and 4 percent in 2004 as projected, there will still be   considerable economic slack going into 2005 and, of course, there are downside risks to that   growth forecast  So there seems to be a reasonable likelihood of further disinflation   I personally am uncomfortable with measured inflation in the range of 1 percent or   below, so I think such an outcome is worth preempting if possible  In short, I think a weak   economy with a background inflation of 1 percent is a very different situation from a weak   economy with background inflation of 3 or 4 percent  For that reason I hope that we will keep   potential further easing on the table as we go forward  I believe we could justify that as taking   out insurance, providing support for a developing recovery, or even with a specific reference to   stabilizing inflation at a desirable level  Thank you  "
7292,2003-05-06,BERNANKE,"  On the other hand, it would affect interest rates, so you wouldn’t   have that effect       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Relative to previous meetings, there has   been considerably more discussion of inflation and disinflation at this meeting  I’m gratified   May 6, 2003 64 of 115    about that because I think these considerations should be central to our policy analysis at this   point  Let me just add a few points to the discussion     Disentangling persistent from temporary changes in the rate of inflation is difficult, and   measurement issues cloud the picture further  Nevertheless, the best guess is that underlying   inflation has been declining recently  Comparing the year ending in March 2003 with the year   ending in March 2002, the Greenbook notes that inflation as measured by the core CPI has fallen   from 24 to 17 percent  In the past six months this measure has been barely above 10 percent at   an annual rate  Inflation as measured by the chain version of core CPI has fallen from   18 percent last year to 12 percent this year  Data for the past six months are not available    Inflation as measured by the core PCE deflator has been stable at 15 percent for the past two   years, but the Greenbook notes that this stability is largely a result of increases in nonmarket   imputed prices  Excluding nonmarket prices, core PCE inflation fell from 13 percent in the year   ending March 2002 to 09 percent in the year ending March 2003, and it has averaged 02 percent   over the past six months  Of course, for a given nominal funds rate, disinflation amounts to a de   facto tightening of monetary policy     Because monetary policy works with a lag, in principle we should be most concerned   about the forecast of future inflation rather than past inflation  Forecasting inflation is tricky,   though it is worth pointing out that several well-known academic studies have found that the   Greenbook’s forecasts of inflation are better than any made in the private sector  The staff   estimates that core PCE inflation will be about 10 percent in 2004, owing largely to the fact that   even with growth of nearly 4 percent in the second half of this year and in all of 2004, the   economy would still have considerable slack well into next year   May 6, 2003 65 of 115    Of course, as always there are both upside and downside risks to the staff forecast    However, our loss function with respect to the inflation forecast error should be asymmetric  A   1 percentage point undershoot of inflation from the forecast, which would bring us to the brink   of outright deflation, would be much more costly than a 1 percentage point overshoot,   undesirable as the latter might be  In short, for the first time in many decades the risks to our   inflation objective are decidedly downward  Given that the risks to employment also seem to be   downward, there appears to be a prima facie case for easing policy  I tend to agree with that   conclusion, and barring an exceptionally strong near-term turnaround in the economy, I hope that   the Committee will adopt a posture of leaning toward ease     I would like to add an important caveat, however  The chance that we will hit the zero   bound constraint at some point, though not large, is certainly not negligible  In response to   President Guynn’s earlier remarks, by the way, I believe a zero bound constraint on policy is the   major risk of a deflationary environment—one that could have real costs because it would inhibit   our ability to stabilize the economy  More generally, as noted by Governors Kohn and Ferguson,   deflation puts a floor on the real interest rate and can therefore destabilize and distort capital   markets  Theoretically the risk of the zero bound only increases the urgency of a preemptive   easing  However, it also seems important that we have a plan for how we might proceed   seamlessly from standard rate-cutting to more nonstandard operations should such operations   become necessary  For me, along the lines suggested by President Hoenig, if there is an   argument for delaying further easing at this point, that is it  A delay would give the Committee a   chance to think about how an easing action fits into a broader strategy that may involve—though   we hope it will not—nonstandard policy operations  Thank you    I can support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I like the   statement and the decoupling of the references to inflation and growth  I would note that there   are some potential and logical issues regarding the statement that will probably emerge as we get   May 6, 2003 98 of 115    more experienced with it  For example, if the two risks are in opposite directions but one is   severe and one is mild, would that be a balanced risk or would it be—?  [Laughter]  Exactly  At   some point we may have to deal with this—weighting the two objectives, for example  So I   would just point out that we may have to decapitate the swan at some point  [Laughter]    People have suggested that, Governor Ferguson   "
7318,2003-06-24,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find it useful in thinking about   monetary policy at the zero bound to view it as working in one of three broad ways  First, it   works by affecting expectations of future short-term interest rates, which affect longer-term   interest rates and other asset prices  Second, it works through mechanisms that depend on the   imperfect substitutability of different assets  That would be, for example, the purchases of   individual assets or the asset portfolio substitution effects that were described by Vincent  Third,   it works through fiscal effects, which were not much emphasized in the materials we’ve looked   June 24-25, 2003 44 of 211    at and are a form of last resort action, but which I think in the Japanese case might be called for   at this point     In my view the imperfect substitutability effects and the quantitative easing effects are   there, but they are probably weak and somewhat difficult to identify at this point  As I said, the   fiscal effects probably fall into the last resort category  So for those reasons, at the stage we’re in   now, I think we should be concentrating more on the expectational and commitment effects   looking forward  Besides the weaknesses of the other two approaches, I think the expectational   effects on the term structure, first of all, are best understood  There’s a paper I would   recommend to you, if you haven’t read it, by Eggertson and Woodford that explores the   expectational effects of short-term interest rates and their effects on long-term rates in great   detail  Indeed, that approach is more or less what we’re doing now  Of course, monetary policy   as normally practiced works primarily by affecting expectations about longer-term policy and,   therefore, longer-term interest rates   What I think has been missing from the discussion we have had here today so far is that   working on expectations of future short-term interest rates can be done through a comprehensive   package  There are many different ways to approach expectations management  One is   communications of the type we’ve been doing through our statements  There are various   targeting procedures for inflation or price level targeting  Eggertson and Woodford talk about   some reasons for price level targeting, which is their favorite approach  There is also signaling   through various kinds of market interventions of the kind Dino has talked about—options,   purchases of bonds, discount window lending, and so on  In particular, to those of you who have   argued against trying to “target” long-term interest rates—if by that you mean that we specify a   target for the five-year bond and then try to enforce it by buying  five-year bonds—I must say   June 24-25, 2003 45 of 211    that I agree with you 100 percent that that’s not going to work  But if the policy is one in which   we essentially try to lower the whole path of long-term interest rates and we enforce that with a   package of complementary actions that includes trying to manage expectations along the term   structure and taking a series of other actions such as purchasing long-term bonds and other kinds   of instruments, I think that’s one of the first things we ought to be doing  I believe that would   actually work and would in fact be a good approach     So my answers to Vince’s four questions are, in short, that I agree with Bill Poole and   Don Kohn that short-term nominal interest rates should be brought down quite low  I don’t have   much sympathy or forbearance necessarily for protecting small segments of the financial   markets  I believe our first approach should be the continuation of our current policy of working   on the management of expectations  And then I think we should consider packages of policies   that support each other to try to manage expectations in the market and thereby affect longer-  term interest rates  Thank you    Mr Chairman, the depression-era deflation ended quite smoothly    Inflation was minus 8 percent in 1932 and plus 1 percent in 1933  So there’s one example      Picking up on President Parry’s comment and looking at the central   tendency of the FOMC projections shown in chart 13, we more sage and conservative people   also are predicting something above 4 percent for real GDP next year and about 1 percent   inflation, which historically is a highly unlikely configuration  In a speech a few months ago I   suggested that a relatively easy way to improve the transparency of the FOMC would be to   detach these projections from the Chairman’s testimony and release them in a more timely way,   perhaps with the minutes of the previous meeting  It occurs to me that the numbers that we see   here would be quite useful to release to the public in two senses  One, this combination of   unusually high growth and low inflation would make very clear on what we base our balanced   risks for growth going forward combined with our downward risks to inflation  Second, I think   it would support the financial market configuration that we’re looking for, which is a strong   stock market and a strong bond market  So I think these FOMC member projections, which are   somewhat more muted but nevertheless quite strong, would be quite supportive of our objectives    I’m wondering, is it on the table that we might let those be released a tad earlier?    You could also get self-correcting deflation if you had a monetary   standard like a gold standard, which we don’t have, of course  An increase in the production of   gold—    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy seems poised for recovery   in that policy is accommodative and the financial markets are supportive  But on the ground   where it counts we have not yet seen clear evidence of a turnaround in investment or hiring    Moreover, we have more than the usual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the   economy, which implies that we face highly uncertain downward risks to the already low rate of   inflation  For these reasons, it’s extremely important that we do what we can to maintain the   supportive configuration in financial markets  That means continuing our easy monetary policy   and, even more important, using our statement to signal our willingness to keep policy easy so   long as there is a risk of further disinflation and continuing economic weakness     If you will indulge me, I’d like to take my time to add a few words on communication   policy in general  Our discussion yesterday and our experience of the past year have shown that   effective communication is a big part of successful monetary policymaking  It’s becoming   increasingly more important as the inflation risks move from one-sided to symmetric and as the   range in which we can move the funds rate narrows  We can communicate to financial markets   how we expect to manage short-term interest rates in the future  If we then follow through on   our commitments, the power of our interest rate instrument is multiplied many times over    June 24-25, 2003 130 of 211    Contrast the effects on financial markets of our 50 basis point easing of last November with our   no change policy of May 6  The difference lay entirely in the accompanying statements and not   in the decisions themselves  The May 6 statement proves that purely qualitative statements can   be effective when policy intentions are conveyed to the markets  Nevertheless, communication   that is entirely qualitative in nature also risks misunderstanding  For example, I think the May 6   statement left the mistaken impression with some that the Fed was concerned about the threat of   imminent deflation as opposed to what really concerned us—namely, the possibility of a decline   in inflation to a level that, while below the desirable range, would still be greater than zero  This   misperception may have led to unnecessary anxiety among the less sophisticated and to   skepticism about the Fed’s seriousness among the more sophisticated  This misconception can   be cleared up; but as we go forward, the subtleties will multiply, particularly as the recovery   picks up and as we make the inevitable but very tricky transition from deflation-fighting to   inflation-fighting     I expect that the need to make our public statements more precise and less ad hoc will   ultimately lead to the introduction of some elements of quantification  There are different ways   to do that  One approach would be to provide guidance to the markets by issuing a working   definition of price stability expressed as a range of measured core inflation that takes into   account measurement bias and the need for a buffer zone against deflation  In issuing such   guidance, the FOMC would not need to make any explicit commitment, only indicate that this   working definition of price stability would be used as a guidepost in its pursuit of its dual   mandate relating to price stability and sustainable growth     This is not the place to get into details about any specific proposal  I do think, however,   that this measure or similar ones would help us enlist the financial markets, particularly the bond   June 24-25, 2003 131 of 211    markets, in stabilizing the economy  The reason is that any tendency of inflation to move out of   range—either up or down—would tend to move longer-term bond yields in a stabilizing   direction in anticipation of the forthcoming policy response  Ambiguity has its uses but mostly   in noncooperative games like poker  Monetary policy is a cooperative game  The whole point is   to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us  In an   environment of low inflation and low interest rates, we need to seek ever greater clarity of   communication to the markets and to the public  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation as well as your   reasoning  I’d like to follow up briefly on your answer to President Poole  I wonder if you   might give some thought to whether or not it would make sense tactically to say publicly that we   are willing to lower the federal funds rate to zero if necessary  I realize there is some cost to   doing that, but I see two advantages  First, it might allow us to defer gracefully for a longer   period the issue of what we might do if we run out of room  That is, if the question comes up,   June 24-25, 2003 155 of 211    we could say, well, we’re still 100 basis points away from that  Second, I think it would have a   beneficial effect on expectations in that there would no longer be a feeling in the market that we   had reached the end of our rope  Obviously, we’re going to have to put some thought into that  "
7345,2003-08-12,BERNANKE,"  But that’s the ten-year compensation noted on the first page    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like most everybody else, I’m   encouraged by the recent data  The surprisingly good second-quarter GDP number looks even   better when one takes into account the big negative contributions of the foreign sector and   inventory investment, both of which should tend to reverse at least partially over time    Particularly when the normal cyclical inventory rebuilding kicks in we should see a period of   strong growth, and Secretary Snow’s analogy of the economy as a coiled spring may finally   seem apt  Despite the good news, I think it’s premature to conclude that we should not consider   further rate cuts, if not at this meeting then at some time in the near future depending on how the   August 12, 2003 63 of 110    data play out  My concern is focused on the behavior of inflation both in the short term and in   the long term   Regarding the short term, though I can see that output gaps are extremely hard to   measure, the most reasonable guess is that the current gap remains substantial  Moreover,   because of rapid productivity growth, the gap may close very slowly in coming quarters even if   output growth is quite strong  That’s bad news for workers, and it poses some risks to consumer   spending  More to the point, a persistent output gap implies that additional disinflation over the   next year remains a distinct possibility  Even if we consider actual deflation to be too remote to   worry about, further disinflation poses important risks  Disinflation offsets monetary policy ease   already in the system, and very low inflation may limit the ability of monetary policy to respond   by conventional means to future adverse shocks  In short, we should continue to consider   disinflation unwelcome and to be vigilant about its possibility       The longer-term issue can be summarized by the following question  Where do we want   the inflation rate to be when the economy returns to full employment and sustainable growth?  A   good bit of research at the Board and elsewhere has suggested that a positive steady-state   inflation rate improves economic performance by reducing the frequency at which the zero   bound is binding on the policy rate  I surveyed a number of the relevant papers in preparation   for this meeting  Virtually all conclude that zero bound considerations should lead one to choose   a steady-state inflation rate between 1 and 3 percent  Recently, several authors have become   more daring and have given point estimates of the optimal inflation rate, with the choice almost   always being 2 percent  The memo by Elmendorf, Reifschneider, and Wilcox entitled “Deflation   and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” circulated to this Committee before the June meeting, was   explicit in putting the magic number as 2 percent PCE inflation  I don’t want to take a stand   August 12, 2003 64 of 110    today on what the long-run inflation rate should be, and that’s obviously something we should   decide as a Committee  But I note that the FOMC central tendency forecast for PCE inflation for   2004 was 10 to 15 percent, somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast of under   1 percent  Is inflation of 10 to 15 percent what we want to be heading for in the long run?  If   so, fine  Otherwise it seems to me that our policy should reflect our long-term objectives     Finally, I have some concerns about our communication  Government bond yields have   risen a good bit lately; and while that rise is unlikely to derail the recovery, it does not help    Some would argue that an increase in bond yields at this stage of the recovery is normal  That   may be historically accurate, but it misses the point  Historically, inflation has typically been   higher than the Fed would like, so the FOMC has responded to strong growth by raising interest   rates to forestall any inflationary impact  This time around is different, or should be  Inflation is   not a threat  Therefore, the FOMC does not need to take away the punch bowl so early in the   party, so by rights interest rates should remain subdued despite the pickup in growth  Judging by   federal funds futures and other indicators, however, the markets have largely missed this point   and have bid up interest rates well beyond where they ought to be in some sense, to the detriment   of the recovery  To the extent that we can sharpen our message that economic growth no longer   implies an immediate and automatic policy tightening, we should make every effort to do so  I   understand, along the lines mentioned by Governor Gramlich, that communicating this subtle   point is a difficult challenge  But the economy would benefit if we could meet that challenge    Thank you    I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Let me   just say a word on the communications issue because we do need to be very careful  We’ve seen   in the last two meetings that our words have been far more powerful than our policy decision in   terms of changing markets  So, indeed, our communications are a very, very powerful tool    Now, the reaction of the Committee has been that it’s so powerful that perhaps we want to stay   away from it completely  [Laughter]  But if we give no information about our future intentions,   then somehow or another the market has to make an assumption or come to some conclusion   about what our policy is going to be  The presumption, therefore, is that we are so bad at giving   information that we better leave it to the market to draw information from nothing  I don’t want   to be that pessimistic  I would hope that in the future we could think of ways that we could fine-  tune our communication to use it productively  Particularly near the zero bound, it could become   an important part of our tool kit  Obviously, bad communication is much worse than no   August 12, 2003 81 of 110    communication, but I wouldn’t want to rule out communication completely as a way of trying to   enhance our arsenal  Thank you    The sentence is very consistent with the Chairman’s testimony    I would appeal to the Committee to retain the sentence because in   my view it makes a very big difference  I think the addition of the sentence will go some way to   bringing policy expectations in the market toward what I heard around the table during the entire   meeting today  It will have a beneficial effect on the United States economy, which is the   ultimate goal of this Committee  I understand that due process and fairness considerations would   militate toward going the bureaucratic way and having this issue on the agenda for September    But given our ultimate objective of helping the economy, I think the right thing to do is to leave   the suppressed, or shortened, version in this statement; and I would appeal to the Committee to   leave it in  "
7371,2003-09-15,BERNANKE,"  I also agree with you on that, Bill  The technical distinction you’re   making, as you mentioned in your remarks, relates to the idea that the economy is in a rational   expectations equilibrium where everyone has the same information  In that case, anything the   Fed says is going to be redundant  On the other hand, as the Chairman said, it would be harmless   as well     There are several reasons that we might not be in a rational expectations equilibrium    One is that the outside world doesn’t have all the information we have  They may not have   information about our objectives  They may not have information about our views on the   economy, which may be relevant even if they’re wrong  For those reasons, what we say might   be instructive to the public  In particular, conditional information that we provide, which   essentially gives insight into our rule, would be useful to the outside world   I might add a further thought here  I attended a very interesting conference at Jack   Guynn’s Atlanta Fed in March about learning, which is a big area of research in macroeconomics   these days  It looks at the way in which an economy gets to a rational expectations equilibrium    As you probably know, one of the most studied questions in that field is whether or not people,   using all the information they have but without being given information by the central bank, can   learn—with, say, least squares or other methodologies—the rational expectations equilibrium    What we often find in those models is that even very sophisticated players will end up in   suboptimal equilibriums—failure of equilibrium to exist, multiple equilibriums  The notion is   that because people do not know the true rule, they will behave in a very volatile way, which will   induce volatile behavior on the part of the central bank, which in turn will make it very difficult   to learn and so on    September 15, 2003 25 of 78    The point is that there are a number of reasons to think that the Fed has useful   information  I’m actually quite in agreement that we shouldn’t be giving unconditional   information about our interest rate setting  We should be trying to guide the market by providing   conditional forecasts about which direction our policy will be going in light of our objectives,   our views, or the nature of our rule    Yes, conditional on how the economy is likely to evolve      Yes, may be going   For example, our “considerable period”   statement was intended to say—and did in fact say as originally written and before it was   amended—that we think inflation will be low for a long period and if inflation remains low, we   should be able to keep interest rates low  That was in fact the way it was in the original draft and   that’s how it should be said—as a conditional statement about the way our policy is likely to be,   not an unconditional statement about policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to support the Washington   consensus, option number 4  Broadly speaking, I think the form of the statement is rather good    In particular I think the breaking up of the output and inflation risks was a very useful step,   September 15, 2003 66 of 78    although we can do some fine-tuning there  I agree that we should do some process   improvement via the Bluebook to get everyone’s input a bit earlier and to get the information out   a little earlier   I’m as responsible as anyone for the confusion about the phrase “considerable period,” so   let me just say a word about that  Governor Kohn put it exactly right, I think  The words   “considerable period” were part of a nonstandard monetary policy  When we get close to the   zero bound, we run out of traditional tools, and the only way that we can influence interest rates   is by manipulating expectations  So it’s a very, very nonstandard and unusual way to address   monetary policy  That was certainly what I had in mind when I was advocating that approach    We’re now, I hope—and it seems to be the case—no longer at great risk of deflation with a zero   bound  I certainly hope that’s the case  So I imagine that the reference to those kinds of   considerations will disappear from the statement  But let me warn you that, should we reach the   zero bound again, we would be well advised to consider using statements of that sort again   because they may become our only tool, not just an auxiliary tool   Let me say something on the minutes  I don’t think President Guynn’s comment about   the minutes taking on undue importance was in the context of eliminating the press statement  I   think we would keep the statement as our central means of communication  Then moving up the   minutes would in fact be useful because that document does, as President Moskow suggested,   contain a lot of useful information  That would not require any kind of additional blackout   period  One argument that has been made against moving up the minutes is that their release   would create an unnecessary market impact  But my experience is—and I think a correct view is   —that the market effects of Fed actions, speeches, and so on are more or less continuous    There’s no singular impact  So count me as one who thinks that moving up the minutes would   September 15, 2003 67 of 78    be a relatively effective and easy way to increase our transparency and to provide more   information to the market  Thank you  "
7391,2003-09-16,BERNANKE,"  Is “fostering” used in the sense that we are trying to create a   movement toward an objective, such as in the case of foster parents?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sometime soon we’ll be approaching a   critical juncture in this policy cycle  Output appears to be growing rapidly, but employment has   not yet begun to recover and inflation so far is quiescent  The crucial question is, At what point   September 16, 2003 72 of 106    should we begin to tighten?  There are important risks in both directions  We don’t want to   tighten too soon and short-circuit the recovery, risking further disinflation or even deflation  On   the other hand, we certainly don’t want to let inflation and inflation expectations get too high   The key element of our decision will be the view we take about the likely behavior of inflation   over the next year to year and a half  We don’t have much evidence to guide us on this, but let   me offer a little from the only other jobless recovery of recent years—and the recession that   seems broadly most like the recent one—the downturn in 1990-91     It is interesting that initially employment and inflation followed very similar patterns  in   1991 and 2001  Both recessions lasted eight months according to the NBER  Employment kept   falling after the trough in both recessions whereas labor productivity rose sharply  In the earlier   case, twelve-month growth in nonfarm payroll employment hit its minimum value, minus   15 percent, in May 1991, two months after the NBER trough date  In the more recent episode,   employment growth hit its minimum value in February 2002—also at minus 15 percent—three   rather than two months after the trough date  In both cases also, core inflation was virtually flat   during the recession itself    The closely parallel evolutions of the 1990-91 and the 2001 episodes ended, however,   shortly after the recession troughs  In particular, the rebound in employment growth was much   stronger in the earlier episode  In 1990-91, employment growth stabilized eleven months after   the trough date; and by eighteen months after the trough, employment growth had reached   1 percent annualized  In contrast, eighteen months after the trough in the current episode,   employment growth was still negative  By three years after the 1991 trough, in March 1994,   employment growth was 3 percent at an annual rate  In short, the 1990-91 and the 2001 episodes   September 16, 2003 73 of 106    looked very similar initially, but the recovery of the labor market after the trough was   considerably faster in 1991 than it has been recently   What happened to inflation subsequent to the troughs?  This is the critical point  During   the three years following the March 1991 trough, core CPI inflation fell from 52 percent to   30 percent, and core PCE inflation fell from 44 percent to 22 percent  Both inflation measures   declined further subsequently  That is, inflation fell more than 2 percentage points during the   three years following the 1991 trough  Moreover, most of this decline occurred after   employment growth had turned positive  For comparison, in the current episode core CPI   inflation has fallen about 12 percent since the November 2001 trough, and core PCE inflation   has fallen about 05 percent  Because the post-trough recovery in the labor market has been so   much slower this time around, the inflation experience in the earlier episode suggests to me that   further disinflation or at least stable inflation may be on the horizon     I realize this is a crude comparison  Inflation was more volatile in the earlier episode,   reflecting less anchored expectations  Policies were different, and it’s only one data point  But it   is at least a little evidence that a jobless recovery is likely to be associated with very weak   upward pressure on inflation even during the initial period after employment growth turns   positive  All else being equal, that suggests a strategy of vigilant patience for monetary policy    Thank you    I accept the policy recommendation  On the last sentence of the   press statement, my preference would be for this meeting to leave it as it was before—because I   think that’s the safest thing to do—and to change it next time  I’d like to add my voice to   President’s Poole’s suggestion of wording that was something to the effect of remaining   accommodative for the considerable period that we expect the risks to inflation to remain muted    The distinction is that we would be accommodative as long as inflation remains under control as   opposed to as long as inflation is actually falling  You can see the distinction  To contain   disinflationary forces means as long as inflation stops falling President Poole’s wording about   the risks to inflation remaining muted suggests that as long as inflation stays where it is, which is   actually very low, we have no reason to begin to tighten    In any event, I think that might be a good way to go     September 16, 2003 92 of 106     Well, if you start with the first difference then you might get an   expectation in the market that we’re going to begin tightening at some early point, say, just when   the difference changes  "
7416,2003-10-28,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was interested in the likely evolution of   the federal funds rate over the next two years  So I asked the staff to use their best fitting   October 28, 2003 70 of 126    estimated Taylor rules together with both Greenbook and private sector forecasts to project some   sample interest rate paths  The rules the staff chose were a backward-looking Taylor rule   estimated over the 1988-98 period and a forward-looking, or forecast-based, Taylor rule   estimated over the same period using FOMC central tendency forecasts on the right-hand side   plus some additional data assumptions  By the way, this latter rule is the one discussed in some   detail in Dave Lindsey’s magnum opus on communication  Both Taylor rules allowed for error   correction terms—that is, a lagged interest rate in the equation  The projections were run using   actual data plus either Greenbook or Blue Chip forecasts on the right-hand side and then   compared with funds rate forecasts obtained from the fed funds futures markets  Note that this   exercise treats the Greenbook forecast as given  No attempt was made to reconcile the funds rate   projection obtained with the funds rate assumptions used in deriving the forecast   Let me summarize a couple of interesting results from this exercise  First, the backward-  looking rule would have the current funds rate at about 150 percent  The actual current value of   1 percent presumably reflects in part our insurance policy against deflation  Assuming that the   extra 50 basis points are phased out in a linear way over the next two years, the path that is   suggested by the backward-looking rule would go about as follows  It’s currently at 1 percent; it   would be 125 percent by the end of the first quarter of next year, 150 percent at the end of the   second quarter, 225 percent at the end of 2004, and finally 350 percent at the end of 2005  The   backward-looking rule applied to the Blue Chip data gave a fairly similar, though slightly more   aggressive, path through 2004  The Blue Chip data don’t go out far enough to do a projection   through 2005  What I found most interesting about the results using the backward-looking   Taylor rule is that they correspond extremely closely to what comes out of the futures market    The numbers are almost exactly the same  So the main lesson I learned from this exercise is that   October 28, 2003 71 of 126    the market is using historical relationships and backward-looking type Taylor rules to figure out   what we’re going to be doing in the future     There was an interesting contrast to the results when I used the forward-looking rule  In   particular, the forward-looking Taylor rule implies a much slower tightening process  Indeed   according to that projection, the funds rate will reach only 150 percent by the end of 2004 rather   than the 225 percent forecast by both the futures market and the backward-looking rule  The   Greenbook forecast horizon doesn’t permit a projection through 2005, though, so I couldn’t   make that comparison  Why the difference?  Mechanically, the difference arises because the   forward-looking rule puts a high weight on inflation expectations, and of course, using the   Greenbook forecast we have a very low inflation rate expected over the forecast period  So   that’s the mechanical reason     Which of these rules should we take more seriously?  Personally, I see some advantages   in the forward-looking rule for two reasons  One is that it’s a true real-time rule—that is, it   estimates reaction functions given actual forecasts available at the time the policy decision was   taken  Second, as Governor Bies mentioned, we’re now in a period that is very unusual, and   historical relationships may not work  So it’s useful that the forward-looking rule can take into   account explicitly how forecasts affect current policy decisions  The implications of this, I think,   are interesting  To me it says that our policy stance is going to depend very much on what we   think inflation is going to do  Suppose we buy the Greenbook forecast on inflation  I’m not   making a judgment here; I personally think that inflation will remain low and stable over the   forecast period, but not everyone does  But if we do agree with that inflation outlook, then at   least based on this estimated rule our policy tightening should be slower and more gradual than   suggested by historical relationships or by the funds rate futures markets  That leads finally to   October 28, 2003 72 of 126    two conclusions  One is that we should be especially vigilant about the inflation rate and where   we think it’s going to go  Second, we have an ongoing communication issue  If this is the way   that policy proceeds, over time in one way or another we will have to bring expectations in the   market in line with our actual policy     Let me make one brief comment on communication  I just want to say that I very much   appreciate the contributions and thoughts people have had, and I’m very open to the kinds of   modifications that have been suggested  But I would echo Governor Ferguson’s suggestion that   for the time being we go relatively slowly  Thank you    I concur with both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m happy to wait until January if that’s   what people want to do  I would like to express a mild preference—more than a mild   preference—for Governor Gramlich’s formulation  I think it’s important to have benchmarks    Our current statement and both of the suggested statements have benchmarks in the terms   “sustainable growth,” “unwelcome,” “desirably lower,” or “desirably higher”  So that’s not the   question; all of the versions have benchmarks  I like Governor Gramlich’s formulation better   because his benchmark for output is not whether it is growing above or below the growth rate of   potential but that it has a trajectory that leads eventually toward full employment That is a   different concept, but that’s really what we should be shooting for  I think that’s a better way of   thinking about our objective  I understand Governor Ferguson’s comment about breaking the   forecast and the evaluation into two parts  But in fact the statement suggested by Vincent does   not do that because the forecast for output includes a reference to sustainable growth  There is   explicitly a benchmark for growth, symmetrically, but there should be a benchmark for inflation   in that same paragraph  To make matters more complicated, I might note that I just came from   the Bank of England, and they don’t issue any statement at all immediately after their policy   meeting  They’re very happy releasing the minutes a couple of weeks after the meeting because   they think that document conveys all the subtleties of their discussion much better than a   statement  "
7440,2003-12-09,BERNANKE,"  On page 3 of your charts you juxtapose the declining dollar with the   positive interest rate differentials with our major trading partners  The obvious question is why   hasn’t there been a sharp decline in the dollar followed by an expected appreciation of the dollar   given the interest rate parity condition  How is holding US securities at a lower interest rate   consistent with the expectation of an ongoing depreciation of the dollar?   December 9, 2003 7 of 133     It’s a puzzle    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic news since our last   meeting has been heartening  The odds that we have begun a strong and sustainable expansion   have risen significantly  Because of the rise in growth, we’re going to see even more op-ed   articles, wire stories, and editorials opining that the Fed needs to tighten soon to avoid a repeat of   1980s-style inflation  The Wall Street Journal today has an editorial along those lines  I believe   these critics are not particularly well informed and that, as a Committee, we should continue to   remain patient and not choke off growth unnecessarily  In particular, though of course we have   to be vigilant to detect any change in the inflation trend, the odds of inflation rising significantly   any time soon from its current very low level seem small    Let me make a few points  First, those on the Street and elsewhere who lately have been   worrying about inflation have tended to point primarily to raw materials prices, which have been   rising, and to the dollar, which has been falling  Here I will largely reiterate some things that   Dave Stockton said  The Board staff’s Monday briefing, which I believe has been posted   electronically, debunked the importance of the raw materials argument quite convincingly in my   view  The briefing includes a graph of the historical data, which shows that even very large   movements of raw materials prices—which are quite common by the way—appear to have   muted effects on intermediate goods prices and, most important, no discernible effects at all on   final goods inflation  Presumably this lack of inflationary impact reflects the fact that raw   materials are only a small part of total costs  As another figure in the briefing showed, unit labor   costs— which, of course, have been falling rapidly as productivity has surged and wage growth   has slowed—are far more important in inflation determination than are materials prices     An analysis similar to that for raw materials would apply to the dollar  As we’ve been   seeing, large movements of the dollar against major currencies tend to translate into smaller   December 9, 2003 79 of 133    movements against the US trade-weighted basket of currencies and into still smaller effects on   import prices because of imperfect pass-throughs  Nonoil import prices, in turn, are a relatively   modest part of the overall price index  In short, the ultimate effect of the dollar depreciation of   the magnitude we have seen on broad measures of core inflation is likely to be quite small   indeed   I noted the key role of unit labor costs in inflation  Of course, unit labor costs will not   continue to fall at the recent rate  Indeed, as employment picks up, productivity growth in   particular will slow markedly  Critics may point to this decline in productivity growth as another   incipient source of inflationary pressure  I would just note that this prospective productivity   decline is fully incorporated in the Greenbook forecast that we have before us  In particular, the   Greenbook forecast assumes that productivity growth will fall significantly below trend in 2004   and 2005 as employment picks up, specifically to 17 percent in 2004 and to only 05 percent in   2005  Given recent experience, it seems entirely possible that these assumptions are   conservative and that productivity growth, though decelerating, will nevertheless be higher than   what the staff has assumed for the next two years  If so, that would tend to increase the risks of   further disinflation   Finally, although output gaps are of course very hard to measure, the weight of the   evidence continues to support those who believe that considerable slack remains in the economy    Let me give one bit of evidence on this point  The recent New York Times article by Chicago   economist Austan Goolsbee argued that the rise in the unemployment rate in the past two years   understates the degree of labor market weakness  The reason is that today a large percentage of   job losers, a greater fraction than in the past, simply withdraw from the labor force, for example,   to apply for Social Security disability benefits  I looked at data on the ratio of employment to the   December 9, 2003 80 of 133    working age population, which combine information on both unemployment and labor force   participation and found that they confirm this general observation  Between its peak in April   2000 and its trough this past September, the employment-to-population ratio fell 28 percentage   points  With the strong gains in the household survey of the past two months, the net decline in   the employment-to-population ratio since 2000 is still 24 percentage points  For comparison,   the combination of the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions, during which the unemployment rate   peaked near 11 percent, produced a peak-to-trough move in this ratio between September 1979   and February 1983 of 30 percentage points  The decline attributed to the 1981-82 recession   alone from its local peak in April ’81 until February ’83 was 25 percentage points  So on this   particular metric—and of course it’s only one metric—the deterioration of the labor market from   2000 until now is comparable to what occurred during the deep 1981-82 recession  For   comparison, the movement in the employment-to-population ratio from its peak to its trough   during the 1990-91 recession period was 20 percentage points   Possibly the extent of the recent decline is exaggerated because employment was   unsustainably high in 1999 and 2000  However, even relative to a more neutral benchmark of   5 percent unemployment and a participation rate at its long-run trend, current household   employment—the more optimistic of the surveys—remains some 29 million jobs below normal    That number fully incorporates the rise in self-employment about which much has been made    On balance, the large decline in the share of the population that is working suggests that   employment can rise significantly before we see pressure on wages and unit labor costs       To summarize, vigilance on inflation is absolutely essential  I do not disagree with that   one bit  But we should not overreact to purported signs of inflation that are in reality no such   thing  Thank you   December 9, 2003 81 of 133     I think it would be a mistake to drop that language entirely  In my   view making it conditional is the right way to proceed, and I support your recommendation  "
7465,2004-01-27,BERNANKE,"  Thank you  This exercise shows us that achieving clarity and   transparency for a large and diverse committee is quite difficult  But it’s also very important   both in our role as a public institution and for the efficacy of monetary policy  So I hope, even   though it’s a very difficult task, that we don’t let ourselves backslide in this effort   I want to say that I’m actually sympathetic to the view of gradual evolution in the policy   statement  We saw last week a statement by the Bank of Canada that was quite a model of   clarity  In simple English it explained conditions in the economy, and it explained why policy   steps were taken  In that respect I thought it conveyed everything without the need for formulaic   language  But as we go to a simpler and shorter statement, I would hope that we would increase   the information we provide in other dimensions, particularly the minutes and our individual   projections—and we’ll come back to that later   Let me say a word about the statements  Very briefly, I agree with President Stern  My   preference among the three statements would be levels A for two reasons  The first is that I do   think it’s important to describe the outlook in terms of levels relative to benchmarks  The   changes statement requires unspecified preliminary language in order to make it clear, which I   think is a major drawback to that statement   My second point has to do with the conditioning policy assumption  A number of central   banks do use the constant interest rate assumption in making their projections  This assumption   has been very strongly criticized by a number of observers, including Glenn Rudebusch and Lars   Svenson and by Mike Woodford in his book and other places  There are two problems with the   constant interest rate assumption  One is theoretical, and the other is practical, and they’re   related  At the theoretical level, the constant interest rate assumption is usually not well defined   in the sense that many forward-looking rational expectations models simply do not have   January 27-28, 2004 28 of 238    equilibriums or they have multiple equilibriums under that assumption, whereas backward-  looking models tend to diverge and have unstable behavior  In practice, that means showing   paths in the projections that look very unrealistic  As a practical matter, the constant interest rate   assumption is really not well specified because it doesn’t specify what financial markets believe,   for example  Do they believe that interest rates are going to be constant, or do they have the   current market revealed preferences?  How long will the constant interest rate path be   maintained?  What would be the policy after that path has ended?  It’s not really a very useful   conditioning assumption, and therefore, I just warn you that there are some serious reservations   about that approach  Thank you    Thank you, Governor Ferguson  One of the reasons we find it   difficult to issue a policy statement is that there’s such a wide divergence of views around the   January 27-28, 2004 50 of 238    table  The special advantage of the minutes is that they represent the diverse views and give   some perspective and depth to the discussion  They also include a lot of valuable and interesting   information from the staff presentations about the state of the economy  So I would be very   much in favor of moving up the publication of the minutes  I would note, to address Governor   Ferguson’s concerns, that we would not be the first central bank to use the minutes this way    Many central banks around the world do that without problems as far as I’m aware   With respect to the blackout, I think extending the blackout period would be   counterproductive for many reasons  One of them is that it would be like a drum roll up to the   minutes that would in fact exaggerate the impact of the minutes  So I would favor keeping the   blackout as it is  No one has mentioned this—the Chairman might want to weigh in on it—but it   might make sense on the regularly scheduled two-day meetings to hold the minutes until after the   Chairman’s testimony but just in those two instances   Finally, with respect to the idea of dry runs, perhaps one or two might be worthwhile but   it seems to me that, if we are going to make some changes, it would nice to be able to announce   them as a package  Doing dry runs for the whole year would limit in that respect the impact of   the overall change, if there is one, in our transparency policy    Thank you, Governor Ferguson  Basically I’m just going to make a   few suggestions for marginal changes in our current practice that might be useful  But then I   want be the devil’s advocate at the end of my remarks  First, I think we should substitute or add   the core PCE because that probably is, after all, the measure more relevant to policy  Second, I   January 27-28, 2004 75 of 238    think it would be useful to add six months to the January forecast so that it has the same time   horizon as the July forecast  That would not be changing anything substantive  Third, to address   an issue that the Chairman raised, I think we should revise our forecasts as close to the release   date as possible so that they are not dated or stale when they come out  And finally, I do have a   thought on the standard errors  Concerns have been raised in earlier discussions of the   projections that they might be considered objectives or goals, for example, rather than forecasts   or that, by making a forecast, we risk our credibility in some way  Obviously, we can put in   standard errors to make it clear that they are forecasts and are subject to error and so on  One   simple way to put in standard errors would be to ask each forecaster to put a 25-75 bound around   their estimates—the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile  Then we could take the average   width of those bounds across the people whose forecasts are included in the central tendency   forecast  That would give an estimate of the average uncertainty among the forecasts of   members who are making forecasts  There are ways, I think, to add that  I just wanted to raise   that as something to be considered   Let me be the devil’s advocate for just a minute, although I’m not proposing any changes    Statements have been made that these forecasts have no meaning and that they don’t guide our   policy in any way  I think that’s an empirical question, and most of the empirical evidence that   exists goes exactly against that  Work that has done at the St Louis Fed suggests that FOMC   forecasts are better forecasts of inflation than the Blue Chip forecasts, for example, over long   periods of time    So far, and that’s all we can evaluate the forecasts on  There’s also   evidence that suggests that the Taylor rule based on FOMC forecasts is a better descriptor of   January 27-28, 2004 76 of 238    Federal Reserve behavior than other naïve type of Taylor rules  So I think it’s an empirical   question whether or not they’re useful  Again, I’m not suggesting a major change in the way we   use them, but I would ask us to leave open the issue of what information they contain      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find it amusing that yesterday everyone   denied being in the forecasting business and today there is a round of forecasts  [Laughter]      Seventeen forecasts and one guess!  One of the key issues in the   forecast, of course, is the role of the output gap, and I have a few comments to make about that   topic  The use of the output gap or the Phillips curve relationship in forecasting inflation was a   subject at our two-day meeting in June 2002  At that meeting, Art Rolnick of the Minneapolis   Fed presented research by Andrew Atkeson and Lee Ohanian suggesting that output gap   measures were no better forecasters of inflation than a simple random walk assumption that   inflation next year will equal inflation this year  In particular, Atkeson and Ohanian showed that   the Greenbook forecast of inflation, which makes heavy use of the output gap concept, did no   better than the random walk model for the period 1984 to 1996   Given our current reliance on the output gap concept for projecting inflation, I thought it   would be worthwhile to revisit this discussion briefly  In particular, I would like to call your   attention to recent work by staff members at the Board and at the Federal Reserve Bank of   Boston  Work by Board staff member Deb Lindner summarized in a memo last summer, which   I’m sure she’d be glad to make available, confirms the results regarding the accuracy of   Greenbook forecasts for the period 1984 to 1996 for inflation measured by the GDP deflator    However, she also shows that the Atkeson–Ohanian results regarding the accuracy of Greenbook   forecasts are highly fragile on a number of dimensions, notably with respect to the sample period   employed and the measure of inflation used  Using the GDP deflator to measure inflation and   using real time data only, Lindner shows that when the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period is   extended back to 1980, the Greenbook forecasts are 40 percent better in terms of root mean   squared errors than the random walk alternative  In the more recent 1997-2002 period—for   which we, of course, have the Greenbook data but they are not yet publicly available—  Greenbook forecasts of GDP deflator inflation are 35 percent better than the random walk   January 27-28, 2004 162 of 238    benchmark  Lindner shows that the results are more dramatic still when inflation is measured by   the core CPI rather than by the GDP deflator  Even for the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period,   1984 to 1996, Greenbook forecasts for core CPI inflation are 24 percent better than the random   walk alternative  For the recent period, 1997-2002, real-time Greenbook forecasts of core CPI   inflation are a full 61 percent better than the random walk  These results are consistent with   those of several published papers, including a well-known paper by Christina and David Romer   that showed that the Greenbook forecasts of inflation have outperformed private-sector forecasts   The other recent study to which I’d like to call your attention is an article by Boston Fed   economists Michelle Barnes and Giovanni Olivei in the most recent New England Economic   Review  Barnes and Olivei estimate a piecewise (linear) Phillips curve that allows the effect of   the output gap on inflation to vary depending on how far away the economy is from potential    They find little relationship between unemployment and inflation in a region close to full   employment but a robust relationship when the unemployment rate is relatively far—which they   define as 14 percentage points—away from the natural rate  Barnes and Olivei propose   economic interpretations of this finding, but I would suggest a measurement-error interpretation    Because our measures of the NAIRU are necessarily quite noisy, when the output gap is small,   the measurement noise dominates the signal  Only when the measured output gap is relatively   large can we be reasonably sure that an actual output gap exists and, therefore, that inflation will   respond    These results, by the way, are consistent with my own informal investigations of the   predictive power of the Phillips curve  For the period from 1960 to the present, I find that a very   simple Phillips curve specification does not out-predict the random walk out of sample except at   times when unemployment is at least 1 percentage point above its average for the previous six   January 27-28, 2004 163 of 238    years  In short, output-gap-based forecasts of inflation are probably the most reliable during   periods of recession  And indeed, inflation behaved as the output gap theory would suggest in   2002 and 2003  Looking forward to 2004, the unemployment rate is now less than 1 percentage   point away from the estimated value of the NAIRU and from its recent average  While a   continuing output gap may induce some further disinflation, from a statistical point of view the   random walk model may now be just as good  That is, following President Stern, a good guess is   that inflation in 2004 will be the same as in 2003      With your permission, I’d like to add one thought on the “considerable period” language   that we’ll be discussing later  A good rule of thumb is to try to look as if you know what you’re   doing even if you’re not entirely sure  We properly emphasized that “considerable period” refers   to economic time, not calendar time, and we made our commitment explicitly conditional on low   inflation and resource slack  We can debate whether or not the intermeeting data, including the   December jobs report and very low inflation numbers, suggest improvement on those two   dimensions  However, the bond markets clearly believe that they do not, as yields have fallen   significantly and the expected date of Fed tightening has been pushed further into the future    Hence, as our conditionality is not perceived to have been satisfied, we have no fig leaf for   dropping the “considerable period” language today  I would rather wait until March and the   presumption that we will see at least one good payroll number by then  In short, I’m looking   now more at long-term credibility issues rather than short-term flexibility and tactical issues  Of   course, if we don’t see a strong payroll number by March, then we might be glad that we didn’t   drop the language  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the phase-out approach  I   think it would be a mistake to drop this language suddenly  It would risk sending a signal that a   January 27-28, 2004 185 of 238    tightening is imminent and creating an overreaction in the financial markets  So I support both   your rate recommendation and your language recommendation    Am I voting on the statement or the statement and the policy action?    On both  Thank you  Yes  "
7494,2004-03-16,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will align myself with the Kohn axis—    —which proposes that monetary policy patience is appropriate for   current macroeconomic conditions  However, the issue has been raised by Vice Chairman   March 16, 2004 68 of 107    Geithner and others that our current policy stance may contribute to potential financial   imbalances down the road  The history of using the monetary policy instrument rate for   correcting financial imbalances is a very checkered one, to say the least  So I think the question   arises as to whether there is some other tool or instrument that we might use to approach the   question of potential financial imbalances, and that’s what I’d like to talk about in my few   minutes   Many of the questions and comments we receive as FOMC members have to do with   perceived and actual risks to financial stability  Just to take a few examples, we have all on   occasion been asked whether there’s a bubble in the market for residential housing; whether the   narrowing of risk spreads on corporate bonds is justified by reduced default risk or is instead the   result of investors reaching for yield; whether household and firm balance sheets will remain   strong when interest rates rise; what risks to the financial system are posed by the activities of   the government-sponsored enterprises; and how Basel II and other regulatory developments are   likely to affect the structure and profitability of the domestic banking system  There are, of   course, many others  Such questions are obviously important but are extremely difficult for each   of us as individual FOMC members to respond to, and certainly not in detail  One’s inclination   is to answer by painting a benign picture so as not to cause unnecessary public concern  On the   other hand, financial conditions do change, and it’s our collective responsibility both to monitor   those changes and to communicate truthfully to the public what we see   The central banks of most industrialized countries have responded to this challenge by   issuing regular reports known as financial stability reports, usually on a semiannual or quarterly   basis  Financial stability reports give central banks and related institutions a means to provide   systematic and objective information about financial conditions over a range of sectors  I asked   March 16, 2004 69 of 107    the staff to provide me with examples of such reports, and they quickly came up with copies of   reports from thirteen different institutions  For the record, here is the list of major institutions   whose financial stability reports were provided to me by the staff  The Bank for International   Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the Central Banks   of Australia, Austria, Canada, United Kingdom, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and   Sweden  All of these reports are on the Web, and I would be happy to provide URLs to anyone   who is interested     These reports are fascinating reading, and I commend them to you highly  Indeed, most   of them discuss the situation in the United States as well as in their own countries  The material   covered by the various reports is diverse, as you may imagine, as is the amount of analytical   detail  Typically, however, the reports begin with a general macroeconomic background and   then present both data and qualitative information on the financial conditions of banks and other   intermediaries, households, and firms  Other sections of the reports discuss developments in   security markets, international finance, and aspects of the financial infrastructure including   regulatory developments  Much of the material in these reports is in the public domain, but the   reports draw the data together and provide an analytic overview  In addition, boxes, research   notes, and even full-length articles on special topics are included  These reports allow central   banks to present their assessments of financial conditions in a way that is both objective and   responsive to the concerns and questions of the public  By calling attention to emerging   financial problems, as well as by focusing policymakers’ attention on them, these reports may   even help diffuse potential risks of financial instability     It seems to me that we might want to consider the possibility of providing the public with   some type of regular financial stability report, perhaps as part of the Monetary Policy Report to   March 16, 2004 70 of 107    the Congress or in some other existing venue or perhaps as a stand-alone document  I suspect   that much of the material in the report would be easily obtainable as a byproduct of regular   briefings in the Greenbook cycle  However, as I think under no circumstances should we impose   an unfunded mandate on the staff, an assessment of the marginal cost of providing such reports   should be a key part of any investigation of the possibility  If there is any interest in the group in   pursuing this idea either now or at some future time, I would personally be more than happy to   work with the staff to develop a more detailed proposal for the FOMC to consider  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate the anecdotes regarding   price pressures, but I’m somewhat wary of them  I think many of them reflect the salience of the   commodity and energy price changes we’ve seen  But first, we know that those are a small part   of total costs  Second, there may be some confusion between high costs and rising costs, and of   course, only rising costs contribute to inflation   Also, I want to associate myself with Governor Ferguson’s point that the news since our   last meeting has been primarily of a weakening in the expansion, particularly in terms of the   employment statistics, and of a strengthening in the dollar The latter has not been talked about a   great deal, but the downward trend in the dollar has been arrested  So, Mr Chairman, I would   March 16, 2004 85 of 107    like to support the statement you have proposed, with the bias downward, understanding that we   may well want to come to a balanced assessment on inflation sometime soon    Mr Chairman?    I do have a concern about paragraph 3  It’s not just a question of   hiding or reducing the information available; I think that paragraph actually misrepresents the   substance of the conversation in that it seems to suggest that the reason for not releasing the   minutes earlier is purely logistical, which is certainly not correct  There were arguments of   substance on both sides, and to suggest that the arguments against are purely logistical risks   giving the impression that our convenience is more important than revealing information to the   market  "
7518,2004-05-04,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, I expressed some   wariness about relying too much on anecdotes for assessing the economic situation, particularly the   inflation situation  Well, as somebody once said, the plural of anecdotes is data  The data since the   last meeting do suggest that inflation has stabilized and that the recovery is beginning to take hold  I   concur, therefore, that this Committee should begin preparing the ground for a normalization of the   federal funds rate  Based on current information, however, my sense is that this normalization can   proceed at a deliberate pace for three reasons     First, it’s a mistake to equate the stance of monetary policy with the level of the current   federal funds rate, as some seem to do  In part because of our communication strategy, which has   linked future rate changes to the level of inflation and resource utilization, monetary and financial   conditions relevant to the economy have tightened considerably since our last meeting  For   example, since the day before the March FOMC meeting, both the ten-year Treasury rate and the   high-grade corporate bond rate have risen about 75 basis points, and the thirty-year fixed rate   mortgage has risen about 60 basis points  Judging by the small increase in the TIPS spread, these   increases are largely real increases  In addition, the dollar has appreciated about 2 percent since   March and more than 4 percent since the beginning of the year  Commodity prices appear to be   decelerating  Stock prices have been flat despite strong earnings news  In short, monetary   May 4, 2004 56 of 112       conditions broadly construed have already begun the process of normalizing, and the impetus being   applied to the economy has been correspondingly reduced  Of course, absent major new   developments, we need to follow through with the tightening the market now expects, but we   should not be overly worried about having fallen behind the curve  The monetary tightening   process has begun without us, so to speak, and it will continue to evolve endogenously with   incoming news   A second reason to plan to be deliberate in our tightening is that downside as well as upside   risks to the economy do remain, in my view  We have seen only one month of strong job numbers,   and although an unwelcome disinflation now appears quite unlikely, the labor market remains in an   early stage of recovery, with essentially no increase in the employment-to-population ratio over the   past three quarters despite robust output growth  With productivity growth still strong, a high rate   of output growth as well as a conviction on the part of employers that rapid growth will be sustained   is needed to support new job creation  From a risk-management perspective, as we begin to raise   rates we should weigh the risk of significantly impeding the labor market recovery against the risk   of having to scramble to adjust to unexpectedly adverse inflation developments   Third, it is true that recent inflation has been above the desirable level  I hear what people   are saying around the table; absolutely, I hear the concerns being expressed  The question before us   is whether the situation involves a one-time adjustment or whether the pattern will persist  The data   notwithstanding, the case for believing that core inflation will remain comfortably in the 1 to   2 percent range over the next year still seems strong to me  The arguments for forecasting stable   inflation go well beyond the level of the output gap, which I recognize is impossible to measure   with precision  Besides labor market slack, the arguments for stable inflation also include the   impact of continuing productivity growth on unit labor costs, the unusually high level of price–cost   May 4, 2004 57 of 112       markups, the intensity of domestic–international competition, the likely deceleration of commodity   prices, and the recent endogenous tightening of monetary and financial conditions, which I’ve   already noted     Perhaps the principal area of risk on the inflation front is the possibility that inflation   expectations may ratchet upward  Given our struggle to improve communications and in honor of   Al Broaddus’s last meeting, I cannot resist the temptation to point out how helpful a quantitative   medium-term inflation objective would be at this juncture  [Laughter]  Clarifying our inflation   objective would increase the coherence of our policymaking  It would also help to anchor private-  sector expectations of inflation and perhaps reduce the significant inflation risk premiums now   embedded in long-term interest rates  Most important, if we provided quantitative guidance about   our inflation objective, we would now be able to make a firm, highly visible, and ultimately   verifiable commitment to maintaining price stability at this crucial moment in the expansion   Finally, returning to reality, [laughter] I endorse the Bluebook’s proposal to replace   “patience” with the phrase “can likely be removed at a measured pace”  The proposed new phrase   implies no commitment whatsoever on our part  The word “likely” clearly conveys that the new   wording is intended to be a probabilistic forecast of the evolution of policy conditional on the   currently available information  No further change in language would be necessary before   tightening—or even after the tightening process begins  In particular, with this wording we can   certainly raise the funds rate in June if the incoming data so dictate  The major benefit of this   language is that it will calm fears that the Fed is currently planning to repeat the 1994-95 pattern of   pre-emptive strikes  In communicating that that is not our present intention, the new wording will   serve the very useful function of reducing the chance of an overreaction in the bond market that   would damage both the markets and the economy  Thank you   May 4, 2004 58 of 112        Haven’t you done surveys on the market’s expectations regarding the   language?  I think you have    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I think the   debate going around the table has less to do with our differences in outlook than that there continues   to be some fundamental confusion about how we’re communicating to the market and what our   mechanisms ought to be  I just raise the point that we really ought to revisit these issues at some   time in the near future  Given where we are today, though, I think that the language being proposed   is both useful guidance to the market and protects against the risk of an overreaction in interest rates   that would be counterproductive both to the markets and to the economy  Our statement is a   forecast; it is not a commitment  And I don’t think that it constrains us unduly, even if it becomes   necessary to make larger moves  "
7542,2004-06-29,BERNANKE,"  Thank you  Joe, in modeling the current account deficit, you have to   explain where it came from  A big part of your story is that US assets and foreign assets are   June 29-30, 2004 39 of 203          imperfect substitutes, and there was a big exogenous increase in the foreign demand for US   assets  I understand why you did that, but that’s a very important assumption  The elasticity of   substitution between our assets and foreign assets is going to affect many aspects of the model    For example, if it’s inelastic, a change in the demand for US assets on the part of, say, foreign   central banks would have a large effect on the value of the dollar  So I guess my question is, Do   you accept that implication?  What would be the effect of assuming a much more elastic   relationship in demands between different assets?  How central is this to your basic story?    Yes    I was also pointing out that this assumption has important   implications for the way the model works  For example, relatively small changes of demands in   June 29-30, 2004 40 of 203          the portfolio can have large effects on relative asset prices  How sensitive are your simulations   to that assumption?    Thank you  It didn’t pass my notice that the first part of the   presentation was in the form of a financial stability report, which I found very useful, and I   commend the staff for that  I have a question about chart 4 for the household sector and about chart   5 for the business sector, where you show the average interest rate on the stock of debt vis-à-vis the   rate on new debt  I just note that that’s an average and, if we’re thinking about financial distress, we   might be concerned about the tails of the distribution  Do we have any information about the 90th   percentile or anything of that sort that would describe whether a significant portion of households   and firms are in a danger zone?    Thank you    President Stern, I asked the staff to calculate for me if we followed   exactly the path of the funds rate that is now built into markets, where the ten-year rate would be a   year from now  And their answer was 30 basis points higher than it is today  So, it is not 50 percent    of the rise in the funds rate     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to share with you Meyer’s Rules of   Forecasting, as propounded by former FOMC member and current sensationalist author, Larry   Meyer  [Laughter]  Rule 1, stick with your forecast as long as possible  Rule 2, when your forecast   becomes untenable, make a new forecast  Rule 3, know when to switch from rule 1 to rule 2    [Laughter]   There’s nothing much needed in terms of changes to our forecast for the real side of the   economy, which has thus far evolved much as this Committee predicted in both June 2003 and   January 2004  The economy has come a long way in the past year, and as we contemplate new   challenges ahead, we should pause to take some satisfaction in the Federal Reserve’s contribution to   June 29-30, 2004 135 of 203          the turnaround  Our policy actions, reinforced by innovations in our communication strategy,   helped provide crucial support to the economy during a dangerous period    As an aside, there has recently been a bit of revisionism to the effect that our concerns with   deflation a year ago were overstated on the grounds that the official statistics may have in some way   exaggerated the true extent of disinflation  Understanding last year’s inflation behavior is important   but in my view not really relevant to assessing the extent of the policy challenge the FOMC faced in   early 2003  The most salient fact about the first half of 2003 was that the economy continued to   sputter even as our policy rate declined to 1 percent  We thus faced the real possibility, whether   remote or not, that the funds rate would reach or come close to the zero lower bound, a development   that would have greatly complicated our subsequent policymaking  Avoiding those dangerous   waters on the way to robust economic growth was an important achievement indeed    Unlike the growth forecast, the inflation forecast is one to which Meyer’s rules of   forecasting may now apply  I certainly did not anticipate the pickup in inflation we have seen in the   past few months, and I congratulate my colleagues who were more astute than I in appreciating the   early change in the pricing environment  Given what we have seen in the inflation data, the   question now is whether the time has come for me to switch from Meyer’s rule 1 to rule 2  I wish   rule 3 would give more practical guidance on this question!  [Laughter]  The key issue, of course, is   whether the recent increase in inflation portends further increases or whether it was instead at least   partly temporary  Though suitably chastened by my recent forecast misses, I guess I can’t help   myself  I’m still inclined to the view that inflation, both headline and core, is likely to moderate in   the second half of the year  In particular, the stabilization of energy prices—oil prices are now more   than 15 percent off their peak—non-energy commodity prices, and the dollar bode especially well   for the inflation outlook, though it may be some months before we see the full effect     June 29-30, 2004 136 of 203          In this respect, I find the decomposition of the recent increase in inflation provided to me by   staff member Charles Fleischman and similar to the presentation this morning quite interesting    Between the second half of 2003 and the first half of 2004, core PCE inflation increased by a full   percentage point at an annual rate  Of this increase, 04 percentage point was accounted for by a   rapid acceleration in nonmarket prices—ie, made-up prices, notably the infamous deflator for   financial services  With nonmarket prices excluded, more than 100 percent of the acceleration in   core PCE inflation between 2003H2 and 2004H1 can be accounted for by higher inflation or less   deflation in goods prices, particularly durable goods prices  In contrast, the inflation in services   excluding energy, whether inclusive of housing services or not, has actually decelerated in the past   six months  As it seems likely that goods prices would be relatively more affected by changes in the   value of the dollar and in the prices of energy and raw materials, this pattern seems consistent with   the inference that the recent increase in inflation is due more to these factors than to a generalized   increase in aggregate demand or higher labor costs, for example   Moderation of inflation does require that unit labor costs remain under control  Labor   supply still seems quite elastic  The fact that the recent addition of more than a million jobs has   barely affected the unemployment rate suggests that many people stand ready to enter the labor   force as conditions improve  Wage trends are more difficult to assess  Compensation per hour in   the nonfarm business sector increased at a 47 percent annual rate in the first quarter, more than we   expected  However, because total compensation data include such items as retrospective pension   payments and the value of exercised stock options, they may overstate the true marginal cost of   labor  At the other extreme, average hourly earnings of production workers, which exclude such   items but also exclude other benefits costs such as health insurance, rose only 19 percent at an   June 29-30, 2004 137 of 203          annual rate in the first quarter  The true growth in marginal cost is no doubt bracketed by these two   figures     All this said, it has been brought home to me by recent experience that inflation forecasts as   well as output forecasts are, of course, always hazardous and seem particularly so today  Knowing   when to switch from Meyer’s rule 1 to rule 2 is not so easy  Given these uncertainties, it seems to   me that the best tactic for us at this juncture is to temporize, embarking on a program of gradual rate   increases but remaining alert and ready to adjust in response to incoming information   With respect to communication, I would simply say that I am fairly comfortable with the   configuration of expectations about future tightening that is now built into the market  So if we do   change communication, I hope we will be careful not to destabilize those expectations unduly    Thank you  "
7573,2004-08-10,BERNANKE,"  But that’s much more pronounced in the sustained interest rate—     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy appears to have lost some   momentum, and unfortunately the recent slowdown may be more pronounced than can be   accounted for by the rise in energy prices alone  For example, we would normally expect   households confronted with higher energy prices to reduce their saving in order to smooth the   impact of higher energy costs on non-energy consumption  Instead, the household saving rate has   recently risen, hinting perhaps at a more urgently felt need to rebuild wealth in the face of a flat or   declining stock market  Likewise, firms appear to be investing less and, especially, hiring less than   would seem justified by their order backlogs, raising the possibility that the excessive business   caution we saw last year is surfacing again  Some support for the business caution hypothesis is   provided by the estimates of second-quarter productivity growth released this morning—29 percent   in the nonforeign business sector and 75 percent in manufacturing—which account for a large part   of second-quarter growth and suggest that firms are still focused on cutting costs     Overall, our plan to tighten at a measured pace looks pretty good right now  The gradualist   approach moves us predictably toward rate neutrality yet leaves the economy some breathing space   and gives us some time to observe economic developments  One complication for policy, noted by   President Pianalto, has been the divergence this year between core and headline measures of   inflation  The Committee tends to focus on the core measures on the grounds that they are better   indicators of the underlying inflation trend and more likely to influence long-term inflation   expectations  But Committee members have also warned that headline inflation should not be   ignored     I would like to report very briefly on some work I’ve done with the staff that attempts to   address the relative importance of core and headline inflation measures as influences on long-term   August 10, 2004 52 of 103          inflation expectations  We did two exercises  First, staff member Jeremy Rudd and I ran a battery   of regressions relating alternative measures of expected inflation to current and lagged measures of   actual inflation  The idea was to determine which measures of inflation have the greatest influence   on inflation expectations  Our measures of long-term inflation expectations included the ten-year   inflation forecast from a survey of professional forecasters and the median expectation of inflation   five to ten years out in the Michigan survey of consumers  For comparison, we also looked at the   short-term year-ahead inflation expectations from the Michigan survey  Inflation measures whose   predictive power was tested included the total CPI, core CPI, total PCE inflation, core PCE   inflation, and market-based core PCE inflation  We examined a variety of specifications and   sample periods and used both quarterly and monthly data, as available  Many details aside, the   regression analysis suggests that core measures of inflation do seem to be better predictors of long-  term inflation expectations, as anticipated, although their advantage is not in all cases large    Moreover, in the regression analysis, core inflation measures outperformed not only headline   inflation as predictors but also real-side indicators such as industrial production and payroll   employment  In contrast, as expected, short-term inflation expectations are much better predicted   by headline inflation rather than by core inflation     The second exercise, done with Refet Gurkaynak and Andrew Levin, used high-frequency   data from financial markets  Here we measured long-term inflation expectations by TIPS inflation   compensation at the five-to-ten-year horizon, and we investigated how the market-based measure   responds within the day to various types of macroeconomic news announcements  Consistent with   both the regression results and market lore, we found again that news about core inflation has a   considerably greater effect on long-horizon inflation compensation than does news about headline   inflation  Indeed, the noncore part of inflation has a zero or even slightly negative effect on long-   August 10, 2004 53 of 103          horizon inflation compensation  Overall, these results provide support for our focus on core   inflation measures in making monetary policy   In contrast to the regression analysis, the TIPS event study also found that long-horizon   inflation compensation responds strongly not only to inflation indicators but also to real variables,   such as the advance GDP release, the ISM survey, and new home sales—a result consistent with   recent work by Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson at the Board and by Kliesen and Schmid of the   St Louis Federal Reserve Bank  Further analysis of all these results would be worthwhile    However, at face value, the finding that long-horizon inflation expectations appear to respond to   short-term economic developments, whether real or nominal, raises the possibility that long-term   inflation expectations in the United States are not as firmly anchored as we would like  This brings   me back to the current situation   If inflation expectations are, indeed, imperfectly anchored, it is very important that we   continue to demonstrate in word and deed our commitment to price stability  I earlier indicated my   support for continuing with our plan to tighten at a measured pace  If the economy continues to   weaken, we may find ourselves considering whether slowing or stopping this process is warranted    I think we would be best advised not to deviate materially from our current plan unless we are fully   persuaded that both core inflation and long-term inflation expectations are well contained  Thank   you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I think we might   encounter circumstances under which we’d want to skip a meeting in our measured pace of   removing policy accommodation—perhaps to “undisaccommodate”  [Laughter]  But I agree with   Governor Gramlich that a moderate rise in energy prices would not be a rationale for doing that    That’s a circumstance in which it’s important to maintain the anti-inflationary dimension of this   Committee’s policy   "
7598,2004-09-21,BERNANKE,"  I think the difference between us and Korea is that they borrow in   foreign currencies whereas we borrow in our own currency     So a depreciation of their currency creates balance sheet effects     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In reviewing developments so far in   2004, it’s useful to characterize the economy as having faced a medium-sized aggregate supply   shock during the first half of this year  This composite shock comprised various effects   associated with the decline in the dollar, the increase in broad indexes of commodity prices, and   the especially sharp rise in energy prices  The mixture of the supply shock and the ongoing   cyclical expansion made the economic data particularly hard to interpret this spring  This   Committee was generally more willing than outside forecasters or market participants to link   macroeconomic developments to the influences in this composite aggregate supply shock,   particularly the energy cost component  We argued on that basis that both the rise in inflation   earlier this year and the soft patch in economic activity in June were likely to prove transitory    Both of these forecasts have worked out pretty well, supporting the view that shocks to aggregate   supply were indeed the principal reason that inflation in the first half was higher and growth   lower than had been expected   September 21, 2004 67 of 100          Arguably, at this point, the effects of the supply shock may be, to a substantial degree,   behind us  The dollar has been roughly stable all year, and the rise in import prices accordingly   has decelerated  Broad indexes of commodity prices peaked in March  Oil prices are still rising,   and their volatility as well as their level may have a damping effect on the economy  However,   about three-quarters of the increase in near futures crude oil prices since late last year had   already occurred by last May, and refinery margins have fallen  The waning effects of the   supply shock can be seen directly in the moderation of core inflation and the rebound in   spending in the third quarter, as we’ve already noted  Of course, further rises in oil prices or   declines in the dollar are always possible  If no such development occurs, however, the ebbing   of the supply shock will afford us increasingly greater clarity about the underlying strength of   this expansion   My own very tentative assessment is that the recovery at this stage is proceeding at a   pace that is solid but somewhat less vigorous than we had hoped or expected  In particular,   expansion at the current pace seems unlikely to create new inflationary pressures  Looking   forward, the jobs data will be crucial  If job growth continues at the pace of the past few months,   I think we would have grounds for concern about both business confidence and the prospects for   household spending   Overall, I think our strategy of removing accommodation at a measured pace has worked   out well, not only in providing support to the economy and avoiding nasty surprises in financial   markets but also in allowing us time to assess ongoing developments  I support our current plan   of measured withdrawal of emergency stimulus  We surely can raise the funds rate today   without doing damage to the recovery  I also see no need to change the basic framework of our   statement  As we go forward, however, we should remain flexible in slowing or speeding up the   September 21, 2004 68 of 100          process as dictated by incoming data  Financial markets are well prepared for this type of   flexibility, and I believe it fits well with our declared strategy of removing accommodation at a   measured but not mechanistic pace  Thank you    I support the recommendation  "
7623,2004-11-10,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Oil prices notwithstanding, the odds that   the economy will continue to grow above trend and that core inflation will remain low and stable   seem reasonably good  Growth has been solid this year despite the headwinds created by rising   energy prices and a widening trade deficit  By the magic of GDP growth arithmetic, even if oil   prices and the trade deficit do not improve at all in 2005, so long as they don’t worsen significantly,   growth next year will receive a net boost   November 10, 2004 59 of 107    Aggregate supply constraints should not be a problem for the expansion either  Job creation   last month was substantial, but the increase in the labor force was even larger according to the   household survey  The employment-to-population ratio remains low  The number of people   working part time for economic reasons remains high, and the number of individuals who are not in   the labor force but report that they want jobs increased by a half million last month, according to the   Greenbook supplement  Wage growth does not signal much pressure on labor supply either  So in   short, I think the economy still has some room to grow   The inflation fundamentals are likewise generally encouraging  Over the past year, unit   labor costs have risen only 06 percent, and the underlying trend appears to be consistent with core   inflation at current levels  Energy costs are up, of course, but non-energy commodity prices have   declined since our last meeting and are up only about 2½ percent for 2004 as a whole, using the   CRB spot industrial index  The markup of prices over unit labor costs remains close to its 1997   peak, leaving plenty of scope for businesses to absorb higher labor and energy costs  The recent   increase in the TIPS spread puzzles me a bit, particularly as inflation compensation at the five-to-  ten-year horizon is down  It’s also interesting that, since the last FOMC meeting, both nominal   bond yields and TIPS inflation compensation have been negatively correlated with oil prices,   suggesting that investors are concerned more about the growth effect of higher oil prices than about   any possible inflationary effects   Looking forward, I think a reasonable goal for policy would be to try to keep PCE core   inflation at about its current level in 2005 and 2006  In light of the energy situation and the fact that   we are at a stage of the cycle in which inflation pressures sometimes increase, stabilizing core   inflation is important to anchor inflation expectations more firmly and to provide a sound basis for   the sustained expansion  We should keep in mind, however, that inflation can be too low as well as   too high and be aware of overkill  As an illustration of possibilities, a FRB/US simulation provided   November 10, 2004 60 of 107    to me by David Reifschneider projects that, if the FOMC were to tighten by 25 basis points at every   meeting in 2005, we could be back in the disinflation soup by 2006   What path of monetary policy is most likely to be consistent with both nominal and real   stability?  I’ll just note here that the range goes from two increases in the next year in the   Greenbook to about five increases next year in the market forecast  Although policy, of course, will   depend on incoming data, it seems not at all improbable that we will choose to stand pat at a   number of meetings next year while continuing to remove policy accommodation at a measured   pace  If this scenario seems plausible, then we should probably begin soon to signal to the public   that pauses may occur  In particular, as we reach a funds rate of 2 percent, it’s important not to give   the impression that our future funds rate increases will be automatic or that the Committee has   some goal for the funds rate that is independent of the state of the economy  Instead, we should   focus on whether the overall thrust of monetary policy as reflected in the entire term structure and   not just the funds rate is consistent with our objectives  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your   recommendation I have just two comments  One is that I think you overstate a bit the idea that the   current funds rate is outside the range of historical experience  As President Poole noted, it’s not so   unusual in real terms—   November 10, 2004 86 of 107     Oh, the 1 percent, okay  I don’t think there’s a basis to move just on an   allergy to a 2 percent funds rate; I think it should be based on the data and on the economy  I would   just note additionally that the economy responds most directly to overall financial conditions, and   there I don’t think we’re anywhere close to the border of what has been experienced in history   My second comment is on communications  As everyone knows, I disagree with President   Minehan; I think we should be trying to provide guidance  In my view it has worked very well the   last couple of years  I don’t think it was surprising that it worked well  Precisely because we are   assessing such complex matters—for example, we’re trying to assess the course of productivity—  it’s very difficult for the market to read our minds  We need to provide some kind of guidance;   whether it’s conditional or whatever it may be, I think we should  I’m personally comfortable with   dropping the “measured” language or modifying the language, but I hope we do not go back to a   completely uninformative statement, at least without some thorough discussion of what the options   might be  Thank you  "
7647,2004-12-14,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the intermeeting data suggest a   pickup in the pace of the expansion in output and employment, with fewer downside risks to   growth  Inflation risks have also moved slightly to the upside, I think, but falling oil prices help to   make any really significant increase in inflation unlikely  I don’t think the shift in the outlook   warrants a change in the balance of risks, at least not at this meeting, but for me these developments   clinch the case for continuing our policy of reducing accommodation at a measured pace   I’d like to add a few comments on the current account and the dollar  An important question   for monetary policy is how long the current configuration—the large current account deficit and   relatively slow adjustment of the dollar and real interest rates—can persist  If this configuration   were the result of cyclical forces or other short-term factors like currency manipulation, then the   expected half-life of the adjustment process might be short  However, I think the US external   deficit is largely a secular phenomenon which, consequently, is likely to evolve relatively slowly    The key factor underlying the US external deficit, in my view, is excess global savings    Advanced industrial nations with aging populations, notably Japan and Western Europe, need to   save for demographic reasons  Absent sufficient investment opportunities at home, they can do this   December 14, 2004 51 of 118           only by running current account surpluses  Ideally, the savings of these mature industrial   economies would fund investment in developing and emerging-market economies  However, in   part because of the financial crises of the 1990s, emerging-market economies are either unable or   unwilling to accept large capital inflows, resulting in an economically perverse situation in which   countries like Korea, Brazil, and Argentina have become significant exporters rather than importers   of financial capital  The United States is the recipient of massive savings inflows because, to a first   approximation, global savings have nowhere else to go  As neither the demographic factors driving   saving in mature industrial economies nor the inability of emerging markets to absorb large capital   inflows is likely to change soon, these inflows are likely to persist   Is the situation sustainable?  I think it can be sustained for some years, though time does not   permit me to seriously address that issue today  It is worth observing, however, that contrary to the   perception that the US current account is being driven by an unsustainable consumption binge,   Americans are not consuming beyond their means  As a result of rising stock and house prices,   over the past year US net national wealth—that is, net both of foreign borrowing and of   governmental saving—has increased about $33 trillion, or around 30 percent of GDP  That’s a   number which, incidentally, goes some way toward explaining the continuing strength of   consumption spending  If there is a causal relationship between the current account deficit and US   consumption, it’s principally from the former to the latter, as large savings inflows have lowered   real rates and thus raised asset values in the United States   I draw two somewhat contradictory conclusions for monetary policy  First, it’s quite   possible—even likely—that a US current account adjustment will play out gradually over a   number of years  The staff’s assumption of a slowly depreciating dollar is, therefore, the right one   for our planning purposes  We should not attempt to forecast swings in the dollar or base our policy   December 14, 2004 52 of 118           on a presumption that a rapid depreciation is likely in the near term  Let’s see what the dollar does   and then respond as necessary to fulfill our mandate    However, while a slow unwinding of the current account deficit and relatively gradual   adjustment of the dollar may be the most likely outcome, in a world of herding and momentum   trading, financial accidents can happen  A panicky flight from the dollar, whether justified in some   fundamental sense or not, would be very harmful  Hence, my second, and I should emphasize, very   tentative conclusion  When facing a closely balanced policy decision, we are probably better off   erring slightly on the side of tightness rather than on the side of ease  A higher rate makes short-  term dollar assets more attractive and raises the cost of shorting the currency, lowering the risk of a   sudden depreciation  All else being equal, a very slight bias toward a higher funds rate may thus   provide a bit of insurance against a financial accident in the foreign exchange market  Thank you    I support the recommendation    I support the expedited release of the minutes  I think we should point   out that on a number of occasions this year the delayed release of the minutes has actually confused   the market—stepped on our message from the most recent meeting by sending a somewhat different   signal  And although I don’t have a lot of market contacts, a number of them did contact me at   those times and asked, “What’s going on here?”  Second, I would put more weight on the notion   December 14, 2004 82 of 118           that we all have to go out and give speeches and talks and answer questions and we worry about   giving the wrong signal and confusing the market  It would be a comfort to have a Committee   document out there to which we can refer and which the market can use for putting our remarks in   perspective  That will reduce the risk that we all face of inadvertently moving the market or   creating a misimpression  And finally, I would just note, as Vincent’s study showed, that a number   of other central banks have used this practice effectively and have not had serious problems with it  "
7674,2005-02-01,BERNANKE," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I know I’m not the median voter on this   issue, so mostly I’d like to listen today  But I have just a couple of comments   The staff did an excellent job of laying out the costs and benefits of a specific numerical   objective for inflation They noted quite carefully that the empirical evidence is far from decisive on   the issues that they raised I think the same argument could apply, for example, to whether or not   low inflation is good in the first place It’s just very difficult to get precise empirical evidence on   these issues, and, therefore, I think we all have to take a priori reasoning as being part of the   argument here  I won’t repeat those arguments, but I think we all have to introspect on these issues   The question was raised as to how we define price stability In my public remarks, I have   occasionally referred to price stability as defined in terms of the core PCE deflator in a 1 to 2 percent                 February 1-2, 2005 16 of 177  range There are two principles here that I believe are somewhat important  The first is that the   bottom level of that range not be zero  I think maintaining some space between the zero lower   bound and our interest rate is important, and I would be uncomfortable with a lower range that   brings us to zero too frequently   The second principle is whether to use a core or a total measure, and I think that should   depend to a large extent on the time horizon  If we’re looking at a relatively short horizon, in my   view the core measure is right because it is less variable and it better measures the underlying trend   If we’re looking at a long-run objective, then I think a total measure is perfectly fine  Other than   those two comments, personally, I would put a lot of weight on trying to achieve consensus, and I   don’t take a dogmatic view on this measure   Let me make just a couple of comments about how I personally would view this innovation   if we were to go down this route First, as the staff pointed out, adopting an explicit numerical   objective would not, of course, be a full-fledged inflation targeting regime of the form undertaken by   the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, and other countries  Let me say that I think having a long-  run inflation objective that is defined first of all not as price stability per se, but rather as the long-run   inflation rate that best achieves our dual mandate, would be a major step forward  And if we were to   take that step—that is, if we were to establish a true north on the compass, so to speak, for long-run   monetary policy—I would not push for any further steps in the direction of a short-term inflation   targeting regime   The second observation I’d like to make is that I think one benefit of this approach   ultimately would be to provide a stable and quantitative method of communicating our intentions   and our plans to the public Specifically, if ultimately we went down this route, I think we’d want to   combine an inflation objective with perhaps more frequent forecasts that would help the public   assess whether or not the economy was on a path that would eventually get us back to the stable   equilibrium, so to speak  So I do think this approach would be useful eventually in terms of   communication  In light of that, again speaking for myself, if we were to go down this route, I think           February 1-2, 2005 17 of 177  I would be quite comfortable with removing the forward-looking language that currently is in the   statement and moving toward a more quantitative type of communication over time  Thank you   Does your simulation of the effect of the 10 percent decline in the dollar   include the effects on foreign countries’ income from facing a more appreciated exchange rate?   It also affects their import demands     That’s from the income effects                                   February 1-2, 2005 83 of 177  The reason I ask is because your simulation raises the question of   whether the derivative is the right sign on the current account with respect to the dollar Given the   effect that the falling dollar has on our interest rates and, therefore, on our capital income payments,   there seems to be so very little effect on the current account from the weakening dollar   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic recovery seems well   entrenched, and domestic final demand continued strong, foreshadowing healthy growth in 2005  I   don’t see inflation risks as having changed materially in recent months  In particular, labor costs   have been remarkably subdued  However, with the recovery no longer fragile, continued   withdrawal of monetary accommodation at a measured pace remains the appropriate policy, in my   view   Some have cited a possible slowdown in labor productivity growth as an upside risk for   inflation on the grounds that slower productivity growth implies a more rapid rise in unit labor costs    While lower productivity does, of course, lead to higher unit labor costs, all else equal, the links   between productivity growth and inflation, as well as the implications for policy, are actually quite   subtle I’d like to use the remainder of my time to discuss this issue briefly                     February 1-2, 2005 102 of 177  First, it’s important to note that an assumption of slower productivity growth is already   incorporated into the Greenbook forecast The staff projects output per hour in the nonfarm business   sector to rise at about a 17 percent annual rate in 2005, less than recent experience and about a   percentage point below the profession’s consensus estimate of the long-run trend  The projected   slowdown reflects both cyclical factors and the assumption that there will be some giveback of the   extraordinary recent gains As productivity growth has surprised repeatedly on the upside for almost   a decade now, I think the risks for the Greenbook productivity projections should be viewed as well   balanced, at worst   The staff projects that the deceleration in the cyclical component of output per hour should   have little effect on inflation but will instead lower profit margins  And even though the expected   slowdown in structural productivity growth will put upward pressure on prices, the staff expects the   impact on inflation of that productivity slowdown to be offset by other factors like declining energy   prices and a stabilization of the dollar   To summarize, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast shows that some slowing of productivity   growth, at least, is not inconsistent with continued stable inflation  The interesting question is   What will happen if productivity growth in 2005 comes in even lower than the 17 percent projected   by the staff?  If firms view the resulting increase in the rate of growth of unit labor costs as more or   less permanent, then historical experience suggests that these costs will be passed on to consumers   fairly quickly, thereby boosting inflation in the short run  However, it does not follow that policy   should therefore be tightened more aggressively  The appropriate response depends also on the   reaction of aggregate demand to this change in productivity growth   If a slowing in productivity growth occurs that is both perceived as permanent and is also   largely unexpected by households and firms, then stock prices should fall and households should   mark down their estimates of permanent income  The resulting decline in aggregate demand will   tend to offset the inflationary impacts of the productivity slowdown  Also, because firms will expect   a lower long-run return to capital, the neutral real fed funds rate will fall As a consequence, as                       February 1-2, 2005 103 of 177  illustrated in chart 6 of the Bluebook, the optimal policy response to a permanent slowdown in   productivity growth may well involve a slower pace of tightening rather than a faster one, despite a   possible short-run bump in inflation  This scenario is just a mirror image of the post-1995   experience in which a perceived increase in secular productivity growth sparked a stock market   boom and rapid growth in spending, and hence was not disinflationary, despite the fact that unit   labor costs declined   What if productivity growth slows substantially but aggregate demand does not respond?  In   that instance, unfortunately, we might be called upon to make a judgment about whether the   slowdown is likely to prove temporary or permanent  If it is temporary, then neither inflation nor   policy should respond very much  If the slowdown is judged to be permanent, however, the failure   of aggregate demand to adjust would suggest that households and firms anticipated the slowdown,   while the staff was too optimistic  In this case, the slowdown in productivity should indeed be met   with a tightening of policy in the short run However, the funds rate should be lower in the long run,   reflecting the fact that the neutral fed funds rate will also be lower  This scenario is the mirror image   of the 2002-2003 period in which productivity gains created disinflationary pressures that did   require aggressive easing in the short run   To summarize, slower productivity growth does not necessarily require a tighter policy    First, some slowing is already anticipated and incorporated into the Greenbook forecast  Second, if   a significant slowing occurs, the key issue is the extent to which aggregate demand responds to the   slowdown A sufficiently large decline in aggregate demand might well reverse the presumption   that tighter policy is needed when unit labor costs rise Thank you   I support the recommendation, and I promise to try to be happy   [Laughter]  "
7701,2005-03-22,BERNANKE," Mr Chairman, I just wanted to note that the index, I think, is simply   an equal weighting of all the various contracts that are traded It makes no attempt at weighting   Because there are a number of different contracts that are traded   There is no economic content weighting   Thank you, Mr Chairman  We are experiencing a mini-inflation scare   in financial markets—a development that we need to take very seriously  The primary reason for the   scare was the recent rapid increase in the prices of oil and other basic commodities  Other   determinants of inflation, it should be noted, seem to be largely under control   Still-strong productivity growth and subdued wage increases have been sufficient to induce   some recent deceleration in unit labor costs  At the sectoral level, recent increases in auto prices   seem unlikely to continue, given the industry’s inventory overhang  And I note that this morning’s   report showed a 09 percent decline in February in auto prices Prices of imported consumer goods   have also been remarkably tame, rising about 1 percent in the year to January despite the fall in the   dollar And the influx of low-cost apparel imports associated with the end of the Multifiber   Agreement should provide more help on that front  Inflation in services is stable, and far future   inflation compensation, which effectively strips out oil effects, has not risen   How serious is the inflation risk posed by rising commodity prices?  One view, which, if   correct, would be quite worrisome, is that commodity prices are the canary in the coal mine—   indicators of easy monetary policy and building inflationary pressure  I don’t find this view   persuasive, and I note that the academic literature has found essentially no support for it  Instead,   recent commodity price increases seem to be largely the result of economic developments unrelated   to US monetary policy, which I would call supply shocks, although without disagreeing with   President Poole What we’re saying here is that China is exogenous  [Laughter] In the case of oil,   for example, international agencies have recently revised downward their projections of non-OPEC   production while increasing their estimates of global demand for crude, reflecting in part the                                March 22, 2005 57 of 116  likelihood that growth in demand this year will be disproportionately concentrated in energy-  inefficient countries, such as China   The weak dollar, which I suspect is responding more to the current account situation than to   monetary policy per se, is also affecting the oil price  Since 2000, oil prices have risen 98 percent in   dollar terms, but they have also risen by 45 percent even in euro terms and by 76 percent in yen   terms   If the supply shock interpretation is correct, then the effects on core inflation of the recent   run-up should be moderate  As is well known, commodities and raw materials make up a small   share of producers’ costs For example, the staff estimates that even in a full employment situation,   in which firms have some pricing power, a 1 percent increase in the core PPI for intermediate goods   should result in less than a 5 basis point increase in the core CPI By the way, I think that fact helps   to reconcile to some extent the benign inflation numbers with the anecdotal reports of price   increases, since many of them take place at the intermediate level   An interesting datum from last week’s survey of 22 primary dealers is that, on average, they   expect core PCE inflation of 191 percent at an annual rate during the third quarter of this year, up   only 6 basis points from what they expected for the same period as of the week before the last   FOMC meeting   If we are, indeed, facing a supply shock, then to some extent the situation is analogous to   where we were last spring when inflation pressures proved transitory and policy patience paid off   However, all economists have two hands  And on my other hand, I agree that there are also   important differences from the situation last spring  The expansion has considerably more   momentum today than it did then  Core inflation is approaching the top of my comfort zone, and I                                   March 22, 2005 58 of 116  would not like to see it go much higher  Finally, futures markets suggest that this time the shocks to   commodity prices are expected to be relatively more permanent than they were last time     For these reasons, the risks to both the output and inflation objectives of a slightly more   aggressive policy posture seem fairly modest  My bottom line is that I support raising the funds rate   by only 25 basis points today However, I believe that it would behoove the Committee to modify   the statement in a way that signals the possibility of stronger actions in the near future  Thank you   I agree with President Poole   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation  I think the   addition of the phrase “appropriate policy action” is actually useful, because it will emphasize that   our forecast is conditional on continued tightening rather than being an unconditional forecast   I agree with Governor Kohn and Governor Ferguson, among others, that it’s important to   provide as much information as we have about future developments in the economy and policy    And I think perhaps we should consider the alternative C language that Vincent Reinhart has   suggested   Finally, I would just like to raise the issue of process Of course, it’s very useful to get   information out as soon as possible, but I think we have to recognize that the statement does have to                                         March 22, 2005 98 of 116  reflect the discussion at the meeting and the condition of the economy  Therefore, it needs to be   understood that we have some flexibility to make changes nearer to the meeting  I think that’s an   important point to recognize  Thank you  "
7896,2006-03-27,BERNANKE,"  Welcome, everyone  It has been about a year since I’ve been   to one of these meetings, so I’m looking forward to rejoining the conversation  I want to thank   everybody for all of the support and good wishes during this period of transition  We have some   other new members besides myself today—Governor Kevin Warsh to my left, Governor Randall   Kroszner, and First Vice President Bill Stone, who is really not a newcomer    Good  As you know, this two-day meeting has some   experimental aspects  Today we’ll be focusing on the state of the economy and the economic   outlook  Tomorrow we’ll focus on the policy issues, and then we’ll have some opportunities to talk   about the meeting itself—the structure and how we want to go forward  But we’ll start, as usual,   with the Desk  Dino    Thank you  On the end of quantitative easing, what are the   technical barriers to withdrawing the extra reserves that set three months or four months as being the   expected time?      What does the market make of this “understanding” that   inflation is between 0 and 2 percent in Japan?      Finally, how much of the movement in the long-term Japanese   government bonds reflected inflation expectations?  They have inflation-linked bonds    Other questions for Dino?  Governor Kohn    We’d like a full report on the Icelandic— [Laughter]    President Lacker    President Fisher    President Minehan      March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 10 of 167        If there are no other questions, I need a motion to ratify   domestic market operations   SEVERAL  So moved    Without objection  Mr Stockton    Are there questions?  President Lacker   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 18 of 167        President Poole    President Yellen    President Moskow    President Stern   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 25 of 167        President Fisher    President Hoenig    Any other questions?  All right  We come to the first go-  round  Let me remind you that we’re going to focus in the first round on the economic outlook and   will leave, I hope, the policy discussion until tomorrow     As you know, there has been interest in increasing the interaction in this round, so I have a   few suggestions  First, I will take the liberty of intervening occasionally and raising a question or   asking for comment  Second, and this is the risky thing, we’re going to allow two-handed   interventions  [Laughter]  If you would like to comment or ask a question about a colleague’s   remarks, please raise two hands, and you’ll be recognized to make short remarks to be perhaps   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 31 of 167       responded to  This process may work too well  [Laughter]  Therefore, I reserve the right to play   traffic cop, and we’ll take the whole thing as an experiment and see how it goes  Who would like to   go first?  [Laughter]  President Moskow      Immediate recognition    Right  For your turn in the round    If you would like to be recognized immediately out of turn,   raise two hands; otherwise, one hand    Do you want to comment on the automobile industry in   general and the prospects for production and prices?    President Yellen    You address this a bit at the end, but how do you reconcile   your optimism about core inflation with the view that you have increasing resource utilization and   that it affects inflation?    Thank you  President Guynn    Thank you  President Lacker had a comment    President Guynn, I wonder if you would say a little more   about the Katrina rebuilding—why you think that’s going to be very slow    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you    Next meeting   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 44 of 167        Thank you  Let me just highlight a theme that President   Guynn and President Minehan both mentioned, which is that some of the tightest labor market   conditions are for the most skilled workers  It seems to me that normally in a business-cycle   expansion the lower-skilled workers tend to benefit at least as much as highly skilled workers  And   I just want to raise this theme for the research people and for the other principals, to see if   something is unusual here or if we’re just misinterpreting what is going on    President Fisher   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 48 of 167        Speaking of the largest hole ever dug in history, I wonder if   you would have a view on the current account implications of some of this offshoring that you’ve   been talking about  Are you concerned about that?    Thank you  We have a timing decision to make  We could   take a break now and come back  I’d like to propose that we stay in the meeting until 600 and, at   that point, go to a reception and dinner  We will probably not finish this round by 600, but there   will be plenty of time tomorrow to do that and time to reflect  Is that acceptable to everyone, to just   stay in the meeting?  All right  Well, let’s continue then  The next person is President Stern    Thank you  President Pianalto    You mentioned nonresidential construction, and President   Fisher mentioned that  I think the Greenbook was pretty pessimistic about the near-term prospects   for nonresidential construction  Is there some dissonance there?  [Laughter]    President Minehan    President Pianalto    President Fisher    President Hoenig     Thank you  A number of people have talked about tightening   monetary conditions  President Yellen did  Of course, long-term rates have not risen, so I guess   there is a question here about the issue of how much is the term premium, how much is the change   in the equilibrium rate  I just put that question on the table because your views on it should affect   whether you think conditions are essentially easy or tightening  First Vice President Stone    Thank you  President Lacker     And yet our behavior has to be consistent with the model,   right?  We have to respond in a way that does, in fact, react to inflationary pressures    I’ll agree  Vice Chairman Geithner    Anything to report on co-op prices in Manhattan?  [Laughter]      Thank you  Governor Bies    Do you relate the corporate preference for cash to caution, to   risk aversion, and what implications would that have for capital investment?    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you, Governor Kohn  With apologies to those who   have not had a chance to speak, I think we could adjourn now  Let me just remind you that it is   especially important, given that this is a meeting in some sense still in progress, that we maintain   full confidentiality about the discussions we’re having in this room  There is a reception and dinner   on the Terrace level of the Martin Building, and I will see you there shortly   [Recess]   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 79 of 167       March 28, 2006—Morning Session    The meeting is reconvened  We want to complete our go-  round  President Poole, are you ready?    The comment and suggestion on nonresidential construction is   very helpful, very interesting  On the Wal-Mart wage increases of 1 percent—hasn’t Wal-Mart   increased health coverage and compensation overall?    Thank you  Governor Olson    Did the banks comment on the yield curve; is it affecting   them?    Thank you  Governor Warsh   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 85 of 167        Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Any two-handed interventions?  [Laughter]      Thank you  I would like now to summarize these views and   add a few comments of my own  At that point, if there are additional comments or questions, they   will be welcome   We have had, I think, a fairly upbeat group here the last couple of days, which is of course   good, both in terms of views of economic activity and in terms of keeping inflation well controlled    The economy appears to be quite strong, but my sense is that most people feel that risks on that   score are relatively balanced, which I take to imply that, after being strong in this quarter, growth   will slow to something closer to a more-sustainable pace in the remainder of the year  Perhaps the   leading source of uncertainty on the output side is the housing market, but I was reassured to hear   that most participants think that a decline in housing will be cushioned by strong fundamentals in   terms of income, jobs, and continuing low interest rates  The labor market is clearly continuing to   strengthen, but I heard not too many concerns about increasing wage pressures  There was some   discussion about shortages of more highly skilled workers, which presumably might affect wages at   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 95 of 167       some point but apparently has not so far; and there was additional discussion of productivity gains,   which are helping to keep unit labor costs down and to support growth   On the inflation side, I have not been in this conversation for a while, but I was impressed at   least relative to a year ago that the angst about inflation seems to have declined  Clearly, inflation   expectations are well anchored  Margins are high, and the sense of the group was that pass-through   to consumer inflation was likely to be limited  Still, I took from the group some sense of at least a   slight upside risk to inflation, reflecting the increasing resource utilization; the fact that inflation is   somewhat on the high side of what many people describe as their comfort zone; and the fact that, if   inflation does rise, there will be costs to bringing it back down and maintaining our credibility   So that is my overall summary of the Committee discussion  My own views, you will   probably not be surprised to hear, are not radically different from what we have heard around the   table  I would point out, first, that except for housing, the economy continues to be very strong    One might be tempted to average the expected rate of growth of the first quarter at about 4½ percent   with the 1½ percent of the fourth quarter and say we’re at a pace of about 3 percent, but then I   would remind you that we had 41 percent in the third quarter despite Katrina and about 37 percent   average growth in the first three quarters of ’05   We have a strengthening world economy  We have consumption that looks likely to be well   supported by income and jobs  Several people have talked about the strength of investment in   nonresidential construction  Job creation at about 200,000 a month is clearly above the long-run   sustainable rate  So except for housing—and that is, of course, a critical sector—it looks as though   the economy is, if anything, growing more quickly than potential   Housing is the crucial issue  To get a soft landing, we need some cooling in housing  So far   there is a good bit of evidence that there has been a peak, but we do not know a great deal more than   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 96 of 167       that  So obviously we are going to have to watch carefully  The range of possible outcomes is quite   wide  I agree with most of the commentary that the strong fundamentals support a relatively soft   landing in housing  A pessimist might point out that the expectation of future price increases is   itself an important part of the user cost of housing  A sea change in people’s views about what is   going to happen to house prices in the future might significantly affect their perceived cost of   owning a house and lead to lower prices and to weaker activity  On the other side, residential   investment is, of course, only about 6 percent of GDP, and so long as consumption is well   maintained by incomes, jobs, and other factors, I think it would take a very strong decline in the   housing market to substantially derail the strong momentum for growth that we are currently seeing   in the economy   What we might see in the next few quarters is some quarter-to-quarter variation  We may   not have the stability of growth that we have had the last couple of years  If that happens, we should   be willing to accept it  I might offer a very rough analogy to the way we think about energy prices   and core inflation  With core inflation, our goal is to accommodate energy prices but to make sure   that they do not get into the underlying rate of inflation  Again, this might be a rough analogy, but if   the housing market moves significantly, we should perhaps not try to upset that movement but   rather just try to ensure that the resources that are released are deployed in the rest of the economy   and that the rest of the economy remains on a stable path  Again, I think we are unlikely to see   growth being derailed by the housing market, but I do want us to be prepared for some quarter-to-  quarter fluctuations  So, broadly speaking, I agree with the Committee that we should see some   cooling for the remainder of the year and that we should approach a more-sustainable pace of   growth  But I think there is some upside volatility risk, if you will, because of the fluctuations in   residential investment   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 97 of 167       On inflation, like most of you, I am struck by how well behaved core inflation has been    Indeed, in 2005, core inflation was even slightly lower than it was in 2004, and we have all pointed   to a number of explanations, including well-anchored inflation expectations, international   competition, productivity growth, and since I wasn’t here, I can say good Fed policy  [Laughter]    One area of uncertainty in trying to look forward is unit labor costs  Remarkably, unit labor costs in   the nonfarm business sector grew only 13 percent in 2005, but as was already mentioned in the staff   presentation, I think that understates the trend because it is coming off the surge in the fourth quarter   of ’04 in bonuses, stock options, and other types of one-time compensation  If you smooth through   that bulge, it looks as though the underlying trend of unit labor costs is more like 17 percent, and   perhaps that may have some upward bias  There is certainly a lot of uncertainty about that, though    We have seen some indicators, such as average hourly earnings, rising  Other indicators, such as   the employment cost index, are slowing  I just point this out as a significant source of uncertainty,   given how difficult it is to forecast both compensation and productivity going forward  So, again,   the stability of inflation in the last couple of years is very reassuring    I would note, however, that over the past three years, since 2003, we have seen a pickup in   inflation  That was, of course, by design, but I think it is important for us to think about why that   happened  There’s something of an identification problem here  To the extent that the increase in   inflation over the last two to three years reflected the pass-through of energy costs and commodity   prices, that is actually good news in a sense because, to the extent that those factors soften and   flatten in the coming year, we should see some reduction in inflation in ’06 and ’07  To the extent   that inflation increases in the last two and a half years reflected increased resource utilization, the   strength in the economy, and the return of pricing power, however, there is a bit of concern that we   may see some additional updrift of inflation in the next few quarters   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 98 of 167       Like most of you, I am not at all alarmist about inflation  I think the worst that is likely to   happen would be 20 or 30 basis points over the next year  But even that amount is a little   disconcerting for me  I think it is very important for us to maintain our credibility on inflation and it   would be somewhat expensive to bring that additional inflation back down  So my bottom line on   inflation is that there is a very modest upside risk  Again, I think it’s not a large risk but one that we   probably should pay attention to   Are there any comments or questions to close our round on the economic outlook?  If not,   we can move to the policy round  In a moment I’m going to turn to Vincent to introduce the policy   options in the statement  Before I do that, I just want to note that we have left unresolved the   discussion about the ownership of the statement—in particular, what we are voting on when we   vote at the end of the meeting  Currently we vote on the action, on the directive, and on the risk   assessment but not on the rationale  The rationale has, however, been largely a consensus paragraph   worked out by the Committee  My sense is that this decision is not entirely separable from a wide   range of other issues we may want to talk about over the next few quarters concerning the content of   the statement, its structure, whether we use forward-looking language, and whether we consider   adopting some kind of numerical guidepost for inflation    And so what I would like to do, if it is okay with the Committee, is to maintain the status   quo for today in terms of our voting in this statement  By the next meeting, in May, I will come   back to the Committee with a proposal for a process by which we can address this whole range of   issues over a period of time, and on the top of the agenda for that process will be the ownership of   the statement  Is that acceptable?  All right  Seeing assent, we will maintain the status quo on the   statement just for today  Vincent, whenever you are ready   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 99 of 167        Thank you  Are there questions for Vincent?      Two-handed intervention  President Moskow   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 103 of 167        President Poole    No, let me clarify  I’m sorry  We’re still in the question   mode    No  Do you have a question?    Governor Olson, do you have a question?   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 104 of 167        We have some breakdown here in our system  [Laughter]    Are there further questions for Vincent?  President Lacker    In the go-round I am interested, of course, in your view on the   policy action, and I am also interested in your view on the statement  So that would also be an   appropriate place if you want to raise issues about the wording  That would be fine  Other   questions for Vincent?  Vice Chairman    Other questions?  President Pianalto    Vice Chairman Geithner    Question, President Fisher?    Other questions for Vince?  Okay  So let’s begin our   policy go-round  I’m interested to hear your views on policy action, the statement, and anything   else you think bears on our decision  Governor Kohn     Thank you  President Poole     Thank you  Governor Olson     Thank you  President Fisher      Had to put that in there  [Laughter]  President Hoenig     Thank you  President Lacker     Thank you  President Stern      Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you  First Vice President Stone     President Minehan    Thank you  President Guynn    Thank you  President Yellen   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 126 of 167        Thank you  It is 11 o’clock  Why don’t we take fifteen   minutes for a coffee break?   [Coffee break]    President Moskow, are you ready?    Thank you  Governor Bies    Oh, I’m sorry  President Poole    Absolutely   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 132 of 167        Thank you  Governor Bies    Governor Kroszner    Governor Warsh    Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  Thank you for this very helpful conversation  It   helps inform today’s decision and also helps inform how we will be thinking about policy for the   next few meetings   As I discussed, I see the economy as still being basically quite strong, and it needs to   moderate to become consistent with its long-run potential  The vehicle by which that is going to   happen is the slowing in the housing market  I think we ought to raise the rate today and not to   signal an immediate end for several reasons  First, we could think of our policy in terms of the   mortgage rate rather than the funds rate  The mortgage rate is currently about the same as it was   when we began tightening in June 2004, and it is still providing support to the housing market  If   we failed to act today or signaled that we are definitely done, we would create a rally in the long-  term bond market and in the mortgage market  We would create, I think, some risk of re-igniting   what is currently a cooling market  I think that would be a mistake  Second, I talked, as many of us   did, about the small but nevertheless probable risk that inflation will rise slightly in the next few   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 139 of 167       quarters and the potential costs of that to our credibility and to our future policy need to respond to   higher inflation     So my recommendation to the Committee is that we raise the federal funds rate target   25 basis points today  We are circulating, and you have received, a draft statement that is very close   to option B, which I’ll discuss in just a moment  What I would like to emphasize is that section 4,   which says that policy firming may be needed is in fact a flexible statement, and I think it’s entirely   possible, depending on the intervening data and the evolution of the economy, that we may choose   to signal a halt or even to not move in May  It depends very much on what we see in the housing   market, what we see in the economy, and what we see in the inflation data  So I believe this does   create significant flexibility   A couple of other comments  First, I realize that there are arguments on both sides about   expanding even modestly the language in the rationale  I think this language is not more explicit or   lengthier than the language we have seen in some statements that this Committee has issued in the   past few years  It has the benefit in this particular case of slightly moderating the hawkish tone of   the statement and of acknowledging that we see, for example, the economy to be returning to a   sustainable pace  So I think it does serve some purpose, and I think it is worth including    I appreciate President Poole’s suggestion, but I do not think that the minutes and the   statement are perfect substitutes  The statement, after all, is much more timely, and it represents   something closer to a consensus or a median view of the Committee as opposed to the minutes,   which try to express the range of views and discussion around the table   One other suggestion about retaining or taking part 5 from statement A  I see the arguments   on both sides  But I think the sense around the table is that the change was not sufficient to justify   the innovation to the January statement, and so I think we ought to stay with the January language   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 140 of 167       If you look at the statement, it is very close to B  We did make a couple of changes   suggested by President Yellen, which I think clarify what we are trying to say—in particular, in the   middle paragraph  “the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have” (Are the subject   and the verb mismatched?)—“the run-up    appears to have only a modest effect,” and   “productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check”  So we are   obviously not ruling out other influences that are important    So that is my proposal—that we move 25 basis points today, that we issue the statement you   have before you, and that we watch very carefully the data during the intermeeting period  The   Bluebook presented a number of options—types of language that would allow us to pause, to pause   with an upward bias, to move and pause, various combinations  So I think we do have quite a bit of   flexibility when we come back to meet in May   We have already had a policy go-round  So I don’t want to do that all again, but if there is   anyone who particularly would like to comment, here’s your chance  Yes, President Moskow    It illustrates the difference between the minutes and the   statement  The statement is a consensus view or at least a median view  The minutes should   express the range of opinion and would include that view but perhaps other views as well  Are there   any other comments?  Are we ready for a vote?   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 141 of 167        Thank you  We need to take an action  There will be a short   break   [Recess]    All right  We would like to return to the meeting and discuss   briefly the format of today’s meeting, and also we need to make a few decisions about what we’re   going to do in May  Debbie is going to introduce the discussion    We’re open for comments on the format or suggestions for   the future  President Guynn    Thank you  President Minehan    President Hoenig    President Moskow   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 145 of 167        President Lacker    President Poole    President Pianalto      Thank you  Governor Bies    President Yellen    Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  President Fisher    Governor Olson     March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 149 of 167        Thank you  Governor Kohn    President Stern    President Minehan    Well, thank you for these comments  Our next meeting is   perforce one day  I would move that we start at 830  So we will begin at 830 the next time    Nevertheless, given today’s meeting, people are going to have to be conscious of time and try to be   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 151 of 167       as concise and direct as possible in your comments  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that we   should probably have the experience of the one-day meeting, and perhaps even as soon as next time   we can think about whether you’d like to make a change in the calendar  Let’s be prepared to do   that   Clearly, one option in terms of flexibility that President Minehan and others asked for is to   have the possibility of a special topic at a two-day meeting when the business doesn’t seem likely to   fill the whole meeting  I think that rather than preparing six months in advance, we could no doubt   have some topics that are prepared on a shorter time frame  They would be less intensive  They   could be joined by the Reserve Banks as well as by the Board  So that’s certainly one option for us   to think about if we want to go to a two-day meeting more often, not necessarily every time  But   this has all been very helpful   Do we have any other business?  So, we will meet at one o’clock for lunch to honor   President Santomero, and the meeting is adjourned  Thank you very much   END OF MEETING   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 152 of 167     "
7919,2006-05-10,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everyone  Let me just remind you that   we’re going to try to fit our slightly modified format into a one-day setting today  We still plan   to have two full rounds of discussion, the first round on the economy and the outlook, and I hope   we can complete that before the coffee break  Then we will have the second round on policy and   the statement  So to allow time for discussion, I hope that people will try to keep their remarks   reasonably concise  At the end of the meeting, we’ll have a brief report from Governor Kohn on   his communications subcommittee, and we’ll talk a bit about procedures for thinking about the   question of a one-day versus a two-day meeting  So first on the agenda—Dino    Thank you  On the rise in inflation breakevens since our last   meeting, do you have a sense about the breakdown between carry effects, expectations, and risk   premiums?    My other question relates to a regulatory relief bill in the Congress,   which is very likely to pass, that would allow us to pay interest on reserves and to have more flexibility   in setting required reserves  Would you like to comment on the potential operational implications of   that?    Do you see any operational issues in just getting to the point where   we can manage that?    No, I understand it’s a good thing for us     May 10, 2006 7 of 120     It appears to be very high    They eliminated a number of controversial items so that this could   go through  Other questions?  President Lacker    Other questions?  President Hoenig    President Fisher    Hearing no other questions, we need a vote to ratify domestic   operations  Do we have a motion?    Any objection?  Thank you  Yes?  Dino    Do I have a motion?    Discussion?  President Lacker   May 10, 2006 10 of 120     Other comments?  I’ll ask for a show of hands  All in favor?    Opposed?  Thank you     We have an issue related to FOIA  A memorandum was distributed proposing to delegate certain   FOIA responsibilities as described in the May 1 note to the Committee from Scott Alvarez and Kit   Wheatley  Scott is here, I assume?  Yes, there he is  Are there any questions for Scott?  These are just   technical changes  Do I have a motion?    So moved  Thank you  Any objection?  All right  Thank you very   much  Okay  Our next item on the agenda is the economic situation    Questions for our colleagues?  President Lacker    President Poole   May 10, 2006 19 of 120     Thank you  President Moskow    President Lacker has a two-handed intervention    President Fisher    Thank you  I think we are ready now to move on to our economic go-  round  Let me remind you of our convention  Raise one hand to be put into the queue to speak, and raise   two hands if you would like to make an immediate intervention or ask a question pertaining to one of your   colleague’s comments  President Yellen    Do you or your staff have a view on the breakdown between the   term premium and future expected rates in terms of the far forward increase in interest rates?    Thank you  President Lacker    President Lacker, one issue I have with these surveys is that, when   they ask about price changes, they don’t distinguish between intermediate goods and final goods  Of   course, the final goods are what we care about  Have you tried to make that distinction in your surveys?    President Moskow    President Fisher    President Fisher, you don’t see any drag from high interest rates or   energy prices on this overall strength?    I’m still trying to understand that comment about the   schizophrenia  [Laughter]  President Poole    President Poole, did your contacts have anything to say about the   issue of whether the strength in retail sales was a seasonal factor or something else?    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  First Vice President Stone    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Guynn    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    I will comment as well on TIPS spreads, but those markets are fairly   concentrated, and therefore, liquidity issues sometimes play a role in these high-frequency movements    Governor Olson    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Governor Bies    Thank you  Governor Warsh    It worries me that we are in the hands of some exuberant 30-year-  olds  [Laughter]    Governor Kroszner    Thank you, and thank you all for your very concise comments    [Laughter]  We will take a fifteen-minute coffee break   [Coffee break]    At this point I would normally try to summarize the remarks around   the table  But since you have all just heard them and since my own views are not terribly different from   many who have spoken, I think in the interest of time I will just go ahead and talk briefly on my own behalf   about what I see the economy doing, and then we will turn to the policy go-round   First of all, with respect to growth, I think we are following the path laid out by the Greenbook   toward greater moderation in the second half  The main difference is that, since our last meeting, the   uncertainty around that prospective path has increased  Obviously, the key to this moderation is the   housing market, and fundamental analysis would suggest that the combination of high prices and rising   interest rates would make affordability a problem and would bring housing starts and housing prices down    So far we are seeing, at worst, an orderly decline in the housing market; but there is still, I think, a lot to be   seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly  As I noted last time, some   May 10, 2006 71 of 120    correction in this market is a healthy thing, and our goal should not be to try to prevent that correction but   rather to ensure that the correction does not overly influence growth in the rest of the economy     I would also note that there are going to be some offsets to the decline in residential investment    We’ve noted increases in nonresidential construction, which is about half the size, as a share of GDP, of   residential construction and, in terms of contribution to GDP, could make up something like a half of the   direct impact of a decline in residential spending  We also have gotten a sense that capital spending is   relatively strong, and world growth is also strong, which may enhance our exports  So there are some   countervailing factors to help cushion the presumed decline in the housing market   But as we talk about the housing market, which is 6 percent of GDP, or nonresidential construction,   which is 27 percent of GDP, we have to pay very close attention to consumption, which is 70 percent of   GDP and which really is the center of the forecast for the rest of the year  The soft landing scenario viewed   in the Greenbook requires that consumption grow the rest of the year at something around 34 percent,   which is roughly what it has been doing in the last year or so on average  I think that is broadly plausible    There are factors on both sides of it  Supporting consumption, obviously, are some increases in   compensation likely coming forward both in terms of hourly wages and in terms of hours worked, job   availability, and to some extent maybe increases in stock prices  On the negative side, many people have   pointed out the effect of rising interest rates and softening in housing prices  Energy is actually a bit of a   mixed bag  Energy prices are obviously a negative for consumption in level terms, but we have had a big   drag on consumption for the past two years from increasing energy prices, and so if energy prices do   stabilize, the drag will actually be less in 2006 than in previous years  So, again, I do think that the   slowdown that has been forecast by the Greenbook is plausible, but like a number of people around the   table, I would note that so far it is largely a prospective slowdown and that the data have only begun to   support that development   May 10, 2006 72 of 120    On the inflation side, I have somewhat more concern, like a number of people  Core inflation has   been remarkably stable, and I do not think it is going to rise very much; but to the extent that there are risks,   they are very largely to the upside  And I also have some concerns about the possible emergence of some   inflation psychology, which is a very negative thing for our policymaking  The factors that support higher   inflation are well known  First, energy and commodity prices  I would point out that, rather than being   transitory, they have now undergone a long, sustained increase, which evidently must at some point get into   the cost structure of firms  Second, the weakening dollar over the past month or so may be sufficient to add   some pressure  Third, the effect of compensation, I understand, is a little ambiguous  There are some   factors working in the other direction, including markups and productivity, but clearly the sense around the   table is that compensation is beginning to move up somewhat, and the risks there I think are also to the   upside  Finally, it is worth noting that, at a technical level, some of the components of the inflation indexes   are moving upward—in particular, owners’ equivalent rent  It economically makes sense that, if house   prices have risen so much, rents will begin to rise  Since that is a very large share of both the CPI and the   PCE core measures, that is going to be an upside risk for us   Now, again, I do not want to overstate the problem  I think that core inflation will remain   contained, to use our language, but I am concerned about those risks  Clearly, the markets have seen a   strengthening of the economy and increased inflation risk  Despite all of our communication and language,   it is summarized by an increase of about 25 basis points in where they think the federal funds rate is going   to end up later this year  We have seen and already discussed the increase in inflation compensation and in   other measures of inflation expectations  Much of our confidence that the pass-through from energy, from   the dollar, and from labor costs to final goods inflation will be low is predicated on the view that inflation   expectations are low and well contained  When that premise begins to break down, then all the other   elements of the analysis also begin to come under pressure   May 10, 2006 73 of 120    Finally, as a number of people have noted, although we do not have an official definition of price   stability, we are at the upper level of what might plausibly be called the region of price stability, and further   increases will be difficult and potentially costly to reverse  So looking forward to the policy discussion, I   think we are going to have to take into account the emerging inflation risk  At the same time, there is an   awful lot of uncertainty about what is going on in the economy  It is going to be a difficult balancing act to   try to maintain as much flexibility as possible so that policy can respond to new data as they arrive  At this   point I would like to turn over the floor to Vincent, who will talk about the policy options    Thank you, Vincent  Are there any questions for Vincent?  If not, I   hope we can have a go-round and have people’s views on the policy  President Lacker    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Hoenig       Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Minehan    It’s the belt-and-suspenders approach  [Laughter]  However, when   we get to the final discussion, I’ll ask for a straw vote on whether to drop row 5    President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Kohn   May 10, 2006 86 of 120     President Stern    President Moskow    First Vice President Stone    Thank you  President Guynn    President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Olson   May 10, 2006 93 of 120     Governor Bies    Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Warsh   May 10, 2006 96 of 120     Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  Let me just talk a bit about the policy option and the   statement  I think we are facing two goals that are difficult to achieve at the same time  The first one is to   respond to some increase in inflation risk and what might be a bit of an inflation scare in the bond markets    In order to respond to that, we would have to signal that we are willing and able to continue to respond to   inflation as it rears its ugly head  If you like, inflation is the nail, and monetary policy is the hammer  We   do not have to strike the nail, but we have to show that we are not putting down the hammer  We have to   keep it in our hand  [Laughter]  In that respect, I think it is important that we not signal that there is a   definite pause  I am also disturbed by the response of inflation compensation to those signals  We need to   keep the option open to respond once or even more than once if the inflation data and the economic outlook   dictate that response  I do think that the use of the further policy firming language in part 4, which repeats   the March statement, will be viewed as hawkish and will probably have some upward effect on yields   Our second objective is to maximize our flexibility, given the degree of uncertainty that we now   face in the economy  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that an optimal policy can well include pauses   for two reasons—perhaps more than two, but here are two  The first is that we gather information over   time; to the extent that we gather useful information and uncertainty is resolved, we can make a better   decision  Between now and June we are going to see two CPI reports, two rounds of housing sales and   starts and permits, two retail sales figures, and two industrial production figures, just to note some of the   data that we will be seeing between now and the next meeting  So I think it is useful for us to indicate that   we will be responding to changes in the outlook and to leave ourselves the flexibility to respond in June   according to how the outlook evolves   I am very sensitive to the issue of overshooting  At least in principle, the correct response is that we   look at the outlook, not at the current data  To the extent that our forecasts incorporate the lagged effects of   May 10, 2006 99 of 120    interest rates, we should, in principle at least, be trying to accommodate that issue  So I recommend a 25   basis point increase today  I recommend alternative B     I have a couple of questions for the group  I gather that most people have acceded to that statement,   but let me just ask a couple of questions about the language  The first is, Could we drop number five?  It   does reemphasize the broad principle that we respond to changes in economic prospects, but it is a bit   redundant given the previous statement  So that is the first question I am going to ask you  The second   question has to do with inflation expectations  I think it would be a big mistake to somehow indicate that   we thought they were not contained  First of all, it is not factually correct, as Vincent’s demonstration   showed  Second, it would convey a concern about the state of expectations that is greater than the one we   actually have  What we could do—and I am a little reluctant, but I am open to the suggestion—would be to   say in that sentence, “Inflation expectations have risen slightly but remain contained” or something like   that      Or “are contained”    Well, I would say “remain” because, remember, it is even after the   change  They were contained before, and now they remain contained, despite the increase    No, it just says they are still contained  President Moskow    Is there anyone who has an opposite view?      President Hoenig    President Pianalto    First Vice President Stone    President Fisher    Thank you for these comments  If it is all right with you, President   Moskow, I would like to hold off on this until the evidence is a little clearer that inflation expectations have   moved up  Other comments?  Governor Bies    President Lacker    President Minehan    The slight difference is that it refers specifically to firming whereas   the last paragraph says that as a broad general principle    If necessary    Governor Kohn    Yes    President Yellen    All right  President Fisher   May 10, 2006 103 of 120     At this point, having heard the discussion, I would like to propose to   the group that we keep line 5 where it is  Line 4 talks specifically about this firming proposal and the   possibility of a pause  Line 5 responds to both of our objectives and re-emphasizes the fact that we do have,   of course, symmetric employment/inflation objectives  I think I have heard around the table a few times in   previous contexts that any change has implications that we may or may not be able to predict very well    Any other comments on this statement?  Yes, President Poole    The test I would apply would be what the odds are as of October    There is the possibility that there might be some shifting in timing between, say, June and August, for   example    There are two parts, though  Part is the effect today  My guess is that   it will be hawkish on net, but there is a lot of uncertainty, and so you may be right  The other part of this is   the indication of responsiveness to data  So if the intermeeting data—and I noted how many different   things we are going to be seeing—are suggestive of greater inflation pressures, I imagine that when we sit   down here in June we will have a much better idea of what is expected and what we are likely to do at that   point  Dino    Are there any other comments?  Yes    I think it would make a difference because it would focus the market   very much on the first part of the sentence, which basically is saying that we are going to move again in   June  What we want to do is retain the flexibility to move or not move, depending on the flow of data   between now and then    Yes  Any other comments?    The Governors need to join me   [Recess]    Thank you, everyone  There are a couple of other quick items  First,   I would like to ask Governor Kohn to give a brief report on his subcommittee on communications    Thank you  We have now had experience with both a two-day and a   one-day meeting  I hope that maybe in June we will be able to make some kind of decision about how to   schedule meetings going forward  I am going to ask Vincent to poll everyone during the intermeeting   period about preferences as to meeting structure, scheduling, and the like  If anyone would like to make a   comment at this point about today’s meeting or this general issue, this would be the time  I hear none  You   will be hearing from Vincent, and we will put this on the agenda for discussion next meeting   The final formal action is just to note that the next meeting will be a two-day meeting on June 28   and 29  Thank you  We are adjourned   END OF MEETING      May 10, 2006 108 of 120     "

Table 1 in the Bluebook shows the three alternative suggestions for the statement  Since   the Bluebook, we have received some suggestions, and we’ve done some wordsmithing—we’ve   actually responded to a few things we heard today  The general tone of the three statements is   the same, but we wanted you to see where it was today, so that you could think about it overnight   and so that it would help you for your discussion tomorrow  That’s going to be coming around   June 28-29, 2006 89 of 177     Let me just briefly summarize what I heard  Certainly, a central theme of the speakers   today was the increase of uncertainty and risk in the environment  It’s getting more and more   difficult to forecast, and there are certainly risks both to the upside and to the downside      The central tendencies with respect to output seem to be that output is slowing to   something close to potential  Some felt growth would be stronger than the Greenbook   suggested; others, like the Greenbook, thought it would be falling somewhat below potential  A   few people saw downside risks from previous tightening  There was some disagreement on the   extent to which financial conditions are supportive of the economy, and some disagreement on   consumption, although there was a view that lower-income consumers were going to do worse   than higher-income consumers  Housing is certainly slowing  Some took the view that it was   slowing more or less as expected, whereas some thought the slowing was somewhat worse than   expected—certainly that’s a source of downside risk  The view of the labor market is that it   remains reasonably healthy, that it’s difficult to find skilled workers, but there are still few signs   of wage pressures in the economy  The business-sector evaluations were much more upbeat,   with ongoing expansion, good sentiment, and capital investment  Finally, there seems to be   considerable unease about recent inflation developments  Everyone considered these recent   developments to be unwelcome  Some felt that the recent increase in inflation might be   temporary  Others saw it as more persistent  But there certainly was a sense that it’s a risk to the   economy    Let me add just a few thoughts about the situation  The situation is, I think, exceptionally   complicated because at least three different things are going on  First of all, there’s a cyclical   transition from a period of above-trend growth to what we would hope would be a period of   trend growth, the normal soft-landing problem  Second, we essentially have a supply shock  It’s   June 28-29, 2006 90 of 177    not exactly a supply shock because it has complicated elements to it, but oil prices and   commodity prices are rising significantly, and that is creating a worsened tradeoff  Third, we are   having a housing cycle that has a certain autonomous component to it because it’s like any other   asset-price correction taking place on its own schedule, so to speak, and it is interacting with the   other two forces  So given these three things occurring at the same time, the situation is   obviously very complicated      Now, the ideal situation would be for us to move to a steady, sustainable pace without   inflation  Right now, the biggest risk to that steady pace seems to be the pickup that we’ve seen   recently in inflation  The main point I want to make about inflation—many points have already   been made—is that it really is quite broad-based I think there are good reasons to downweight,   to some extent, owners’ equivalent rent  It is arguably a cost of living; however, the effects of   monetary policy on this kind of cost of living are somewhat ambiguous  So we could get   ourselves into a bad situation if we focus on it too much  But having said that, if you slice, say,   core PCE in any other way—if you look, for example, at core PCE prices excluding OER, at core   goods, at core PCE services excluding OER, at market-based core PCE less OER, at any of these   ways of slicing inflation—you get a similar pattern in terms of the three-month, six-month, and   twelve-month averages, which suggests a broad-based acceleration and one that I think we   should be concerned about  We should also note that the three-month total PCE inflation rate is   52, which is significant because it influences inflation expectations overall      Now, a concern that we all have—and many people expressed—is that we don’t fully   understand why this sudden acceleration is taking place  Some of the possibilities are, first, the   supply-shock increases of energy prices; second, the tight product markets; and third, changes in   inflation psychology, perhaps related to headline inflation  I guess I would just raise the   June 28-29, 2006 91 of 177    possibility that these three things are interacting  Perhaps with tighter product markets it’s easier   to pass through your energy costs or your commodity costs  That pass-through interacts with   higher inflation psychology, and there’s maybe a vicious cycle there  The thing we should be   concerned about is whether those higher prices then lead to higher wage pressures in an inverse   kind of spiral  So I do have concerns about inflation, although I don’t want to exaggerate  I   think we’re still looking at numbers that are historically not extremely high    The other big issue is the housing cycle  I’m going to give us a bit of perspective  It is a   good thing that housing is cooling  If we could wave a magic wand and reinstate 2005, we   wouldn’t want to do that because the market has to come back to equilibrium  The level of   activity now is about a third bigger than it was in during the boom in the late 1990s  The   housing construction industry is large, bigger than historically normal, and a controlled decline   in housing obviously is helpful to us at this stage in bringing us to a soft landing in the economy    But as people have pointed out, the cooling is an asset-price correction  Like any other   asset-price correction, it’s very hard to forecast, and consequently it is an important risk and one   that should lead us to be cautious in our policy decisions, as we’ll talk about tomorrow    Another potential nonlinearity is in financial markets, as we’ve seen recently  We don’t   have a good understanding of how changes in interest rates are affecting risk reduction and   positions in financial markets right now    Just a bit of commentary on consumption  A lot of our uncertainty—I guess you’d call it   model uncertainty—is the question about how a decline in housing prices will affect consumer   spending  The range of views is wide, some arguing that, because of equity withdrawal and so   on, the effect would be very large  I don’t know the answer to that question, obviously, but I   think there are some positive factors that will support consumption going forward  To name a   June 28-29, 2006 92 of 177    few, the job market remains good, unemployment insurance claims are low, unemployment is   low, and I suspect that wages and incomes will start to rise sometime soon  Consumer   confidence is not that bad  Gasoline prices are likely to come down  In part, they are reflecting   high ethanol prices, which will come down over time  We’ve seen before that consumer   confidence can be very sensitive to gasoline prices  Balance sheets remain reasonably healthy    Even if housing prices flatten out, people have accumulated a lot of equity, and the implication   of that is that they can smooth their consumption through rough times, if necessary, by drawing   on that equity  Finally, Kevin and Randy, I think, gave different sides of the surge in tax   collections, but on the whole it is probably a positive sign  It probably suggests there is more   economic activity than we are capturing    So let me just conclude by reiterating that we find ourselves in an extraordinarily   complicated situation because we have these different themes—the cyclical turning point, the   supply shock, and the housing cycle  The implication is that, whatever we do, we’re going to   have to be very deliberate and careful; but I think we cannot ignore the inflation side of this   equation    Any other comments?  Well, thank you again for your patience in a long afternoon  I’m   glad this is a two-day meeting  [Laughter]  Everyone should have table 1; I don’t expect   significant changes before tomorrow  I’ll see you tonight at the British Embassy, and we will   reconvene tomorrow morning at 900   [Meeting recessed]   June 28-29, 2006 93 of 177    June 29, 2006—Morning Session     Good morning, everyone  Mr Reinhart    Any questions for Vincent?  If not, then we’re ready to start   the go-round on policy  Governor Kohn     Thank you  President Lacker     Thank you  President Poole     Thank you  President Lacker and President Poole have   made some specific suggestions  If additional speakers want to comment, that would be very   helpful  Thank you  President Yellen     Thank you  President Fisher     Is that two-handed?  Vice Chairman Geithner     President Moskow     President Lacker     President Poole     Okay  President Stern    President Guynn     President Guynn, I just want to make a comment that, when   I give my testimony, I will have the Committee’s forecasts for year and a half ahead, which are   conditioned on optimal monetary policy; so I’ll be able to say that this is what we think we can   achieve reasonably over the next year and a half  Any issue of where we may want to be in the   very long run is, at this point, I think moot  I take your point that we have not, as a committee,   decided even to announce a quantitative price stability measure much less choose a specific one,   and perhaps we should be more cautious about that  But in the near term, as Vincent’s   simulation showed, getting to the 15 percent in the simulations takes us five years  We don’t   want to create an impression that we are trying to achieve that kind of objective in a year or a   year and a half, and I will make that point very clear in my testimony  President Pianalto     Thank you  President Minehan     Thank you  First Vice President Stone   June 28-29, 2006 118 of 177      Thank you  President Hoenig     President Hoenig, I think everyone around the table admires   you for your consistent position  [Laughter]     President Minehan     Thank you  President Moskow     Governor Kroszner     Thank you  Governor Bies     Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  President Poole    Vice Chairman Geithner    Okay  Thank you all very much  Jeff    Certainly    President Minehan    Well, let me thank you all very much for your extremely   helpful and useful comments  I, too, think that we should raise 25 basis points at this meeting  I   think it’s justified by the basic economic situation  The greater risk seems to be from inflation   I think also, following some things that President Lacker said, that a credibility–psychology   issue is going on here  Late in April, perhaps because of my testimony, we had a small inflation   scare  The TIPS spread widened  The commodity prices, metals prices, essentially went vertical for   a while  The minutes, my remarks, the remarks of other Presidents and Governors succeeded in   bringing those expectations down significantly, even though we had two upside surprises in the CPI   during that period  So obviously some connection exists between our talk and market expectations    Having said that, I think we need to do what we say we’re going to do   June 28-29, 2006 134 of 177    Now, conditional on what we know today, I should also add that I think we’re getting very   close to where we need to be  We don’t know for sure yet  Obviously we have to look for more   information, but in our public utterances going forward we should be somewhat more balanced   about the risks and also somewhat more uncertain about where we’re going in the future  The risk-  management calculations associated with this move are quite difficult  President Poole has   mentioned the risk that if inflation expectations get embedded at a higher level, it would be much   more expensive to reduce them later than it is to nip them in the bud, so to speak, at this point  That   risk argues for moving earlier rather than waiting to see what happens  That being said, I recognize   that there are also some downside risks, some potential nonlinearities in housing markets and   financial markets  So where I come out is that I think we should move but try to keep our options   open and to move slowly if we do move further   With respect to the statement, I’m the first to agree it’s not a work of art  We have a very   difficult balancing act here  First, we have achieved some credibility gains in the past few weeks    We’d like to hold onto those or at least as much of them as possible  However, we want to keep our   options open for August, and we don’t want to generate in the market a fear that we are completely   focused on inflation with no regard for output, the other part of our mandate  It’s a delicate   balancing act to show that we are aware of the inflation situation but that we are not   single-mindedly focused on the inflation situation  The statement is designed to show that we are   cognizant of the inflation risk  We take note of the elevated readings  We mention that inflation   risks remain  We also note, however, that output is moderating and give some reasons for that, and   we say in section 4 that the moderation in output will reduce some of the pressure  Obviously   there’s disagreement about how flat the Phillips curve is, but all else being equal, that will be a   factor   June 28-29, 2006 135 of 177    Responding to Governor Bies’ suggestion, I think putting that first sentence of section 4 into   the rationale in section 3 is more logical, but the way section 3 is structured, first it says, “Here are   the things that are slowing inflation,” and then it says, “But here’s what we’re worried about”  So if   we put it there, it will downgrade it somehow; if we put it in section 4, it will say that we are aware   of the output risk  There’s also perhaps a subtlety in section 4 that the firming will depend on the   evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth  That’s actually an adaptation of a   suggestion that President Minehan made, and what it does, I hope, is indicate that we’re looking at   both variables as we make our decision   So I’m hopeful that this statement will strike the balance between conveying our vigilance,   conveying our concern, maintaining our credibility gains, and removing the notions from the market   that we are certain we will move in August or that we will pursue inflation single-mindedly at a   rapid rate and independent of whatever happens on the real side of the economy   Again, with respect to some of the suggestions that were made, I think they’re all very   interesting  President Poole made a very interesting case  I don’t think there’s a consensus for   going to the restrictive language right now  However reasonable it may be in principle to use the   first sentence in alternative C, section 4, or to say that readings are unwelcome, I fear it will tip the   balance toward a higher probability in August; perhaps this nuance is too fine, but I am concerned   about the effect on the markets of perceiving the Fed as too aggressive  There is a new Chairman    They don’t know me  As far as they know, I am an inflation nutter, and I want to make sure that   they understand that output is one of our concerns   Those were the main points I wanted to make  Governor Bies suggested striking the last   phrase in alternative B, section 4  I don’t feel strongly about that  Does anyone have a view on   that?  Vice Chairman Geithner   June 28-29, 2006 136 of 177     Let me say that I hope in my monetary policy testimony to   talk a bit about our framework, our focus on the forecast and on the outlook, and the fact that we   will not ever respond to any individual number  I would be quite happy to receive any suggestions   that members might have about how to explain these issues  We’ll be working on that over the next   couple of weeks  President Pianalto, did you have a comment?    Yes  It’s valid to change the word back to “implied”    Very good  President Moskow    It is, but logically you would have to say “ongoing   productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, inflation expectations remain   contained, and the moderation of the growth of aggregate demand would help to moderate”  Then   you say “however,” signaling that these are the things that we are really worried about—resource   utilization and prices of energy  The sentence as it stands signals to me that all these things are   working to constrain inflation, but we are more concerned about resource utilization and commodity   prices because we put them at the end of the sentence, at the end of the paragraph, giving them the   greater emphasis  I think that putting this clause where it is conveys somewhat greater attention to   aggregate demand as a new element in thinking about the inflation outlook relative to our thinking   at the last meeting  I realize that it’s a subtle issue of emphasis, and as I said, I don’t think this   statement is a work of art    Well, I think the risk assessment is going to change  We just   changed the risk assessment from “further policy firming may be needed” to “risks remain”  So I   think that structure is somewhat more fluid than the other parts  Governor Kohn     Good  I would like to put the recommendation on the table for   25 basis points and alternative B as modified by the one word “implied”  You can take care of that   later, Michelle?  Do you have it to distribute?  You’ve distributed it already?     Fine  Could you please call the roll?    Thank you  We have two very short items  We can perhaps   do those, finish the meeting, and then have our coffee  But first, we’ll be right back  [Laughter]   [Recess]    All right  Sorry for that interruption  We have a report now   from the subcommittee on communications  Governor Kohn    That is certainly the intention of the subcommittee  All right    Thank you very much  Ms Danker    Are there questions or comments for Debbie?  President   Poole    Is there a possibility of rescheduling some of the board   meetings?  Are they inflexible?    I don’t want to jump in here, but I suppose that, for the   meeting in October, we could check with people about what days the 2007 meetings should be on    I have complete confidence in Debbie and Vincent to solve   this problem  [Laughter]    Any other questions?  Thank you  The next meeting is on   Tuesday, August 8  We are adjourned, and you can all join us for coffee outside  "

so at least that technological component still seems to be with   us   The question is whether we are, in fact, slowing to potential or to slightly below potential  I   agree with most of what I heard around the table, which is that there is evidence of slowing but,   except for the residential construction sector, it is not yet at all definitive that we are falling below   potential growth rates  For example, the staff estimated that GDP growth in the second quarter was   3 percent The staff also estimated that the slower rate of job creation we saw in the second quarter   is still fairly close to what is needed to keep the unemployment rate constant     We are certainly seeing areas of strength in the economy, as a number of people noted  That   includes the industrial sector—which will grow 07 or 08 percent, something like that, overall in   July—and nonresidential construction, which has been strong enough that so far there has not been   a net decline in construction jobs in the United States  So there certainly are some strong elements   of the economy   August 8, 2006 73 of 158                                  I’d like to talk about the very important housing sector, in terms not of the expected level   but of the variance of our forecast, which I think we must think about given our risk-management   approach  At least three dimensions of the housing sector provide significant uncertainty as we look   forward  The first is the extent to which sales, starts, and permits will decline  The correction in the   housing market so far appears to be fairly substantial  In 2005, we had 172 million starts  For   June, the number of adjusted permits was 145 million  We already have a 15 percent decline in the   level of construction  As Governor Kroszner pointed out, the curve doesn’t look as though it’s   flattening out; it looks as though it’s heading directly south  We have heard anecdotally that   cancellations are up very sharply  Inventories are rising significantly, and I note that, just since the   last meeting, the GDP contribution estimated by the staff for housing construction went from   minus 03 percent to minus 06 percent  So there is, I think, a lot of uncertainty about where that   sector is going to level out   Second, associated with that consideration is a lot of uncertainty about housing prices    Again, as Governor Kroszner noted, we don’t really have much information on what the “true   price” of housing is at this point because of the way this market works  People leave things on the   market for a long time; they take them off the market; they provide incentives; and so on  So we   don’t really see the transaction prices in any kind of quality-adjusted or reliable way for some time   after the decline begins  The prices are significant, of course, both because they affect the   profitability of future construction and because they are, at this point, an important component of   household wealth; we know that these factors are likely to affect spending   Finally, a third element of uncertainty as we look into the forecast is what I would call   parameter risk, which is that the staff assumes that the effect of housing wealth on consumption   spending is, through the standard wealth effect, about four cents on the dollar  I happen to think that   August 8, 2006 74 of 158                                   is a good estimate  I think the econometric calculations are persuasive  Nevertheless, there is the   possibility that the effect is somewhat greater, perhaps operating through liquidity effects  There   may be buffer stock effects  If people see their equity falling, they may become more cautious   about spending in order to avoid eliminating their buffer of reserves  Thus there is the possibility   that housing will have a stronger effect on consumption than we now expect   I don’t know what the expected growth rate is  If I had to take a guess, I would say that   we’re going to be close to or slightly below potential going forward, but I simply want to point out   that our forecast may have a higher variance now than it does under normal circumstances   Let me say just a few words about inflation  I heard a lot of concern about inflation around   the table  I certainly share that concern, and I don’t expect any near-term improvement, if for no   other reason than that these things tend to be highly inertial  I also agree with the general   observation that the pickup is fairly broad based, as I discussed in the meeting last time  One   indicator of that is the share of goods that have price increases or price increases above a certain   level   I tried a somewhat different exercise, and I didn’t do it in any way as an apologist for   inflation—I want to be very clear  But I think it’s useful to look at inflation from a different   approach, which is to ask what share of the inflation acceleration is attributable to different   components  So I asked for a look at the past three months versus the past twelve months to   examine the acceleration between those two periods  In a sort of growth-accounting exercise, how   can we distribute that acceleration among different components?   I have just a few observations from that exercise  First, the shelter component really does   play a big role  For example, in this particular calculation, which is somewhat sensitive to sample   period, of the 71 basis point increase in the core CPI between twelve months and three months,   August 8, 2006 75 of 158                               48 basis points were associated with the shelter increase  So that component is significant, and our   views on where it will go and how that relates to the developments in the housing market need to be   thought about  A second observation is that we are seeing energy pass-through, a good example   being air fares, which have jumped significantly and which by themselves contribute 19 basis points   to the acceleration  So energy pass-through is real  A somewhat more subtle point, which was   made in the Greenbook and which I think is interesting, is that there’s a little different behavior   between inflation in goods and inflation in non-energy, nonshelter services  Inflation in services has   been generally flat  In goods, however, we have seen a bit of acceleration, from a negative number   in ’05 to a slightly positive number in ’06  Examples would be the rise in prices in apparel and,   more recently, in used cars  In just examining clues, I think that acceleration might say something   about international competition, the effects of the declining dollar, and the possibility that import   competition has weakened to some extent and is allowing prices of tradable goods to rise a bit more   quickly   One theme that is consistent regarding the energy pass-through and the perhaps slightly   greater inflation in tradable goods is that an important component of the inflation is product market   tightness as opposed to labor market tightness  That suggests that, as we go forward, we should pay   a lot of attention to final demand and consumption and see how they are affecting the product   markets  My own guess is that unit labor costs and wages will be somewhat lagging; and I think   that, if the product markets slow and the slowing reduces pricing power, as we call it, those effects   will ultimately have effects on the markup that will offset some of the wage effects    So those are just a few observations about the economy  To summarize, I agree with the   sentiment around the table that there is a lot of uncertainty going forward, particularly in the housing   sector, but that the inflation risks at this point are still dominant and that our policy action and   August 8, 2006 76 of 158                                                                                statement should reflect the greater concern with inflation  On the subject of policy, let me now   turn to Brian, who will present the policy options   Thank you  Any questions for Brian?  President Moskow   Any other questions?  Governor Kohn   August 8, 2006 80 of 158                                   Thank you  President Minehan   Thank you  President Yellen   Thank you  President Guynn   August 8, 2006 86 of 158                                                         Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you  President Lacker   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you  President Poole   August 8, 2006 95 of 158                             Certainly   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you President Fisher   Excellent reason  President Moskow   Thank you Governor Bies   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Kroszner   August 8, 2006 104 of 158                      Thank you Vice Chairman Geithner   Thank you very much  First of all, I’d like to thank   everyone for a really helpful and thoughtful discussion  It was very useful  Let me just make a   few comments   August 8, 2006 108 of 158                          First, we do need to be careful to think about what the optimal policy looks like  It   doesn’t take the form that we keep raising rates until we’re happy with the inflation rate    Instead, what we need to look for is the rate that, if maintained, will ultimately give us a good   trajectory in the economy  I would submit that we don’t really know where that is yet   President Lacker made some very interesting arguments about the real rate of interest in   the late ’90s Those are good arguments, but I would reply to him, first, that we’ve seen very   low real rates in the past decade, a global savings glut and all of that, and, second, we have at the   moment an IS shock of very significant and unknown size—the housing market, which is   declining very sharply So I agree that we may well want to go up from where we are  I think   that’s, in fact, a more likely outcome  But we really can’t be sure at this point where we   ultimately want to stop, and we need to be a bit cautious and try to learn about exactly where that   level is going to be For those reasons, I’m not comfortable with alternatives A or C because   they basically say that we’re done, either at 525 or 550, and so the choices then are between   alternative B and alternative D     I’m concerned with alternative D because, besides raising the rate to 550, it signals   further increases After seventeen consecutive moves, we would be tightening into a housing   decline We don’t have that much confidence that we need to be so strong at this point    Signaling a strong concern about inflation but being more cautious in groping for the optimal   level of the interest rate is probably a wiser course  I remind you that the Fed has not been   terribly successful with soft landings We have a chance to get one  All else being equal, I think   it would be good if we could achieve that   So I’d recommend alternative B  I’ll come back to the language in just a moment  I   characterize this as a hawkish pause  I think it has several advantages  The first is to gather   August 8, 2006 109 of 158                information  With respect to some of the points President Poole raised, I think the key   information we want to look at is, first, activity; we want to look at employment, housing, and   consumption, in particular, which will give us some indications about growth going forward    But we also want to look at inflation data and inflation expectations data  Inflation expectations,   specifically, are mentioned in the statement, and an untethering of inflation expectations would   be, on its own, grounds for us to respond  The risk of our falling behind the curve by pausing is   relatively small  Again, I think that we’re not more than a couple of moves away from the   optimal level  Therefore, if we miss a meeting or two and then move again in November or   December, we will still be able to reach this optimal level within a reasonable period of time    Moreover, we have a degree of freedom on the other end, so to speak  If the markets expect us   to begin to cut, we can always maintain the rate at the level for a longer period than expected to   get some further restriction  So on the substance I think there are grounds, after seventeen moves   and with the housing market in an indeterminate situation, to pause and to get more information   I’d like to say a word about the tactics as well  President Minehan was correct that my   introduction of the idea of a pause was not particularly well received  But we have now, at least   reading the commentary, explained the difference between a pause and a stop  It’s useful for us   to get the flexibility that will allow us not necessarily to move at every meeting but to move as   the data require A demonstration of that flexibility has some value in terms of creating some   more optionality for us in the future Also, we have been talking about data dependence  By   creating this flexibility, we’ll be able to increase the relationship between what we do and what   the data say, and I think that’s already working  For example, I would note the wide dispersion   of views among the dealers about where we’re eventually going to stop  That dispersion of   views comes from differences about where they think the economy and inflation are going  It is   August 8, 2006 110 of 158                                     very encouraging to me that they are now not looking to us for forward guidance but rather   looking at the state of the economy and trying to judge where the Fed will have to go to achieve   its objectives So recognizing the concerns that have been raised and taking them very seriously,   I think that our best option, of perhaps not very many great options, is a hawkish pause, which I   associate with alternative B   With respect to the language, I think it is an improvement to take at least the first   sentence of section 3 in alternative C, which includes high resource utilization, and use it in place   of the first sentence of section 3 in alternative B  I have two questions for the group  One, do we   want to reintroduce or go back to our old language of including productivity gains?  If so, that   would require the second sentence of alternative A, section 3  If not, we just use the whole   section 3 of alternative C That’s question one  Two, President Poole has expressed concern   about the housing reference We could simply say “reflecting the lagged effects” and leave out   the housing part I would take suggestions on that I would note that we have used this housing   phrase in the past few meetings, and so it would be a change  President Lacker    Okay Other comments?  President Fisher   Any others?   Certainly   August 8, 2006 111 of 158                               President Poole   Governor Kroszner   President Moskow   Any other views?  President Plosser   President Minehan   All right  I think we need to come to resolution  Oh, sorry   Governor Bies   Okay Thank you  Let me just say that I think this   language is purely descriptive I don’t think it’s conditioning our action on anything having to   do with housing I don’t think the market will tie our move to housing  Let’s just take a straw   vote How many would like to keep the statement as it is with housing included?  One, two,   three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven  Okay I think that’s a majority  So we’ll   leave section 2 as it is  Is there any sentiment for going back to alternative A, section 3, second   sentence, which includes ongoing productivity gains?  Are any of you in favor of that?   [Laughter] All right The statement, then, will be exactly alternative B, except that the third   section of alternative C will be substituted for the third section of alternative B  Would you   please call the roll?   Thank you very much  We have a lunch break now for   about half an hour, and then we’ll reconvene to discuss communications   [Lunch break]   I know some people have flights and so on, so why don’t   we continue eating here If you’re still eating, we can just reconvene  Before we get going, I   just want to recognize Barbara Driggins over here  Barbara is retiring  [Applause] Thank you,   Barbara, for thirty-six years of service, and we hope this display of affection will cause you to   reconsider [Laughter]   Best of luck Our afternoon session is on communications   I’d like to turn it over to Governor Kohn                          Okay We’re just going to have a go-round  Please raise   your hand, and Brian will take your name     President Minehan   Thank you President Hoenig   President Moskow   Thank you  President Stern   President Yellen   Thank you President Lacker   Thank you President Guynn   Thank you  President Poole   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Fisher   Thank you  Governor Bies   Thank you  Governor Warsh   President Plosser   Thank you Vice Chairman Geithner   Thank you  Governor Kroszner   August 8, 2006 144 of 158                                           Thank you   Let me add just a couple of very general comments  I hope   that in our discussions about communication we’ll be aiming to make policy work better  I think   that involves trying to make the markets and the public form expectations that are at least broadly   consistent with our goals and our strategy and trying to anchor long-term inflation expectations to   the extent possible Even if you are skeptical about our ability to do this, you may still agree that we   want to avoid miscommunication and unnecessary volatility to the extent possible   I agree also that in general we don’t want to provide the future funds rate path  I see a lot of   problems with that  One of the reasons not to do it is that, if the market is forced to infer the funds   rate path from economic information, that inference provides information to us  Otherwise, they’re   August 8, 2006 146 of 158                                     simply repeating what we tell them  In an ideal world, how would we get the market to infer our   expected path?  Well, we would provide them with a conditional forecast with error bands and all   kinds of conditioning assumptions, and we would tell them about our objective function, which   would include not only the long-term objectives but also the relative weights on inflation and output   and the shape of the risk aversion coefficients and the like   Now, of course, we can’t do that  Besides the technical difficulties, as has already been   pointed out, we have nineteen very distinct points of view around the table  But I do think there are   ways to communicate this kind of information to the public  As an example, in my monetary policy   testimony I very consciously—whether it was successful or not I leave it to you to judge—talked   about our Committee projections, which gave the public not only some insight into what our general   views were but also information about our preferences because it showed a relatively gradual   decline in inflation  This removed the fear that at least some market participants had that we were   going to try to bring inflation down extremely quickly and extremely far  In that respect, it was very   useful, and I generally agree with President Moskow and others that more-detailed and more-  frequent projections might be a very useful way for us to go in the future   Finally, since we don’t have the budget to hire a semiotician, I do want to express some   frustration with the coded language that we rely on so heavily—I have been exposed to some of the   pitfalls that it can create  I think that we are reaching the limits of what codes can provide, and I’d   like to encourage us to think about ways to use quantitative information, like forecasts, to provide   more information and thereby reduce the weight that’s placed on any single words in statements and   the like  So those are just a few comments   I want to thank everybody for an excellent discussion and for a lot of patience  I appreciate   it very much  Our next meeting is on Wednesday, September 20, and we are adjourned   August 8, 2006 147 of 158  END OF MEETING     "
7994,2006-09-20,BERNANKE," Good morning, everybody   ALL Good morning   We have two milestones to note today  First, we’d like to   welcome new Governor Rick Mishkin  Welcome, Rick  Rick attended FOMC meetings from   ’94 to ’97 when he was on the New York Fed staff, but this is the first time he has gotten to sit at   the big table [Laughter]   On a sadder note, today is President Guynn’s last meeting    He has been Bank president and FOMC member for ten years and has served the Atlanta Fed for   a mere forty-two years  We congratulate you  We will have a lunch in your honor after the   December meeting and will have a lot more to say then     Thank you for outstanding service for an extended period of   time  Let’s begin, then, with Mr Kos   Thank you Are there any questions for Dino?  President   Poole   President Lacker   Vince, you gave me a number for two-year breakevens of   214 percent carry adjusted 	How does that relate to these numbers?   The two-year breakeven rate, carry adjusted?   Are there other questions?  Governor Bies   Do you have a question?  All right We need an action to   ratify the open market operations  Do I hear a motion?   Approved, without objection  Thank you Let us turn now   to the economic situation  	Dave?   Are there questions?  President Fisher   Thank you  President Poole   President Stern   President Moskow   President Lacker   Governor Mishkin   President Minehan   If there are no more questions, we’re ready for the economic   go-around  For the benefit of our new member, the convention is that you raise one hand to be   recognized and be put in the queue; if you have a comment or question, raise two hands for an   intervention  I’ve noticed that there have not been a lot of two-handed interventions, particularly on   one-day meetings, when we don’t have much time  It is perfectly sensible to take account of the   time, and that is fine; but if you do have an important intervention, by all means, don’t hesitate  We   start with President Poole   September 20, 2006 32 of 132                                 Thank you  President Moskow   September 20, 2006 33 of 132                                       President Moskow, going back to the automobiles, you   mentioned the retooling  The Greenbook has reduced production plans for the second half  Is that   what you heard?   September 20, 2006 36 of 132                                    Thank you  President Fisher   You mentioned a third-quarter estimate of about 3 percent?   I am just curious  The third quarter will be over in ten days    Given the data that we have already seen, what would you estimate is the range of standard   deviation around the current running estimate?  If you are looking at the third quarter, which is over   September 20, 2006 40 of 132                              shortly, we have seen at most two-thirds of the data we are going to see  What is the approximate   range of error would you say in terms of estimating the current quarter?   Still pretty large  [Laughter]   Okay Thank you  President Yellen   Thank you  President Minehan   Thank you  President Lacker   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you, President Pianalto, for the new leading indicator   of religious statues  [Laughter] I recently gave a speech in South Carolina, where they always   have an invocation, and the pastor called for God’s blessing on monetary and credit policy    [Laughter] President Guynn   Thank you very much, Jack  President Stern   Well, it’s 1100  Why don’t we take fifteen minutes for   coffee Thank you   [Coffee break]   I think we can reconvene  Vice Chairman Geithner   Thank you Vice Chairman … Governor Kohn  [Laughter]   Thank you Governor Bies   Thank you Governor Warsh    Thank you Governor Kroszner   Thank you Governor Mishkin   Thank you Let me just summarize quickly what I heard   around the table, and then I’d like to make some additional comments of my own on the   economy  The sense is that, on the real side, there’s a two-tier economy  There’s the housing   sector and maybe autos, and there’s everything else  On housing, there’s agreement that a   significant correction is occurring, but the views of the risks vary among participants  In   particular, some feel that this still could be a quite deep correction, and others say that the   fundamentals, such as incomes, interest rates, and so on, will ultimately support housing  With   respect to the rest of the real economy, there were some mixed reports; but on the whole, people   characterized it as a full employment economy  We’re generally more optimistic than the   Greenbook both for later this year and for 2007 In particular, people noted higher incomes and   stock prices and lower oil prices, which should support consumption growth and business   activity At least for now, I heard only a few participants being particularly concerned about the   possible knock-on effects of housing on consumption and investment  The labor market remains   solid, and as we’ve been noting for a number of meetings, attracting more highly skilled workers   remains difficult   On inflation, some noted somewhat better intermeeting news, with the possible exception   of the higher compensation data  But a lot of uncertainty was expressed about where inflation   September 20, 2006 86 of 132                             will go, reflecting in part our incomplete knowledge of the determinants of inflation and also   some mixed anecdotal evidence  However, I hear very clearly a definite unhappiness with the   level of core inflation and with the amount of time that is projected to return it to a level of less   than 2 percent  The principal concern is that our credibility will be damaged if inflation remains   too high for too long So I would summarize the discussion—I hope reasonably accurately—by   saying that inflation remains the predominant risk but there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about   the evolution of the economy in the next few quarters   Let me add a few comments to this—first about inflation and then about the real   economy  I do believe that the intermeeting news on inflation was more good than bad,   particularly relative to the fact that inflation is a lagging indicator and that it would not have been   incredibly surprising if we had gotten 03 readings the past two months  I’ll talk first about some   of the positive news, and then I’ll address some of the risks going forward     First, there is evidence that the momentum of inflation has reversed  When I gave my   speech on June 5, which many of you followed up on, I emphasized the three- and six-month   rates of inflation as indicating that an acceleration, a rising inflation pattern, was occurring  It   now appears that the three-month rate of inflation peaked in May  So, for example, in May, the   core PCE was 306 on a three-month basis; in July, it was 224  The market-based core PCE was   300 in May, and in July it was 211 The core CPI was a high 379 in May, and as of the last   reading in August, it was 295 So in some sense the direction has turned, and the momentum   has been broken, and I think that has been reflected in views in the marketplace     Now, there hasn’t been much discussion of the details of this inflation report, and I think   it’s actually quite significant  In particular, a very important factor in both the level and the   change in inflation is owners’ equivalent rent (OER); we’ve discussed this issue before  OER is   September 20, 2006 87 of 132               41 percent of core CPI and 19 percent of core PCE  Although OER has been decelerating   recently, it’s still at a three-month rate of 44 percent, relative to an annual rate of 266 percent in   2005 So that difference accounts for a great deal of the change between where we are today on   a three-month basis versus where we were in 2005  The good news is that OER and other   measures of rent of shelter have been coming down more quickly than many outside economists   expected but in line with what our staff more or less expected; indeed, the number was 3 percent   for August So if it just stayed there or came down a bit more, we would see better short-term   numbers for inflation going forward   Other positive news on inflation obviously includes energy and commodity prices  For   energy the dominant factors are supply-side factors over which we have no control—hurricanes   or the lack thereof and geopolitical factors  But it’s also interesting that metals and some other   commodities are off their peaks That suggests to me that, at least on the margin, some prospect   of slowing economic activity and rising interest rates around the world may have taken a bit of   the pressure off the commodity prices We also have had some indication since the last meeting   that the economy will be slower than we thought  Clearly, the news on autos and housing was in   a negative direction, and granting the flatness of the Phillips curve, all else being equal, that will   take some pressure off utilization and pricing power  Finally, I would argue that expectations   are, in fact, really quite well contained Around this table, we’re getting used to talking about   core inflation The inflation that people see, of course, is headline inflation, and ultimately that   should be our target as well Over the past year or two, headline inflation has gone well above   what we would consider reasonable levels, and yet TIPS indicators, survey indicators, and   outside forecasters have not markedly changed their long-term inflation forecast  So I take the   September 20, 2006 88 of 132                     credibility issue very seriously, but I don’t think that there is much evidence yet that our   credibility has been seriously impaired   On the negative side, the main piece of news was the higher compensation in the first and   second quarters There is not yet much evidence that labor costs are affecting inflation  We’ve   already discussed the issues with the measurement of compensation per hour  Let me just note   that, if you look at the components of inflation that have moved the most, you get things like   rent, airfares, used cars, and things of that sort  You don’t see much movement in services, for   example, which are more labor intensive  So I don’t think that labor costs have yet infected the   inflation rate; indeed, we know there’s a weak correlation between these labor cost measures and   inflation However, and let me be clear about this, I think that the key risk to our inflation   forecast is that markets will be tighter, labor markets will be tighter, and wages will grow more   quickly, and that will produce more inflation than we would like  So I would summarize the   inflation situation as having had some modest improvement, some encouragement, but I certainly   agree with the general sentiment around the table that the level of core inflation is certainly too   high   On the real side, we paused at the last meeting to observe the lagged effects on real   activity of our previous interest rate moves  The evidence suggests that, indeed, interest-  sensitive sectors did worsen over the intermeeting period  We saw the second significant   markdown in a row by the Greenbook for housing, and we’ve seen autos decline as well  To this   point, I agree that the economy except for housing is reasonably strong and that there are factors   supporting consumption particularly, going forward    So as we look forward, I think there are two issues  The first is how severe the   contraction in housing will be  To be honest, we don’t really know  We’re talking, again, about   September 20, 2006 89 of 132                                                                  an asset price correction, and it’s difficult, in principle, to know how far that will adjust  The   second issue is how much spillover there will be from any housing correction to the rest of the   economy  I don’t have quite as much confidence as some people around the table that there will   be no spillover effect  Any spillover effect would be a lagged effect, and it remains to be seen   how much effect there might be  But I agree that the economy except for housing and autos is   still pretty strong, and we do not yet see any significant spillover from housing   Please look at the figure that was distributed2  I want to talk a bit about the risks in both   directions as we think about policy  Let me just describe the two panels to you and then draw a   conclusion from them  The top panel shows the four-quarter difference in the unemployment   rate—that is, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year minus the unemployment   rate in the fourth quarter of last year, going back to about 1950  The blue bars show recession   periods The dashed line is at zero, and the solid horizontal line is at 03 percentage point  What   you see is that, without exception, every time since 1950 that the unemployment rate has risen as   much as 03 percentage point over a year, it has continued to rise, and we’ve seen a recession    That suggests that having unemployment rise just a few tenths and keeping it there is not quite so   easy as our linear models might suggest  In the bottom panel, you see four-quarter changes in   the growth of real GDP The dotted line shows zero, and the solid line arbitrarily shows   2 percent real growth Again, these are four-quarter differences  With the minor exception of   1956, again in no case was real GDP growth below 2 percent sustained for four quarters without   an NBER recession  I think a very interesting case is 1995-96—the famous soft landing that was   engineered in the mid-1990s  You’ll notice the line just touches the 2 percent zone without   crossing it [Laughter]   2 The figure to which Chairman Bernanke refers is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   September 20, 2006 90 of 132                                                                                So what am I saying here?  I’m only saying that, if we believe that we need to have   output below potential to help arrest inflation pressures, it is a delicate operation, and we may   have a very narrow channel to navigate as we go forward  We should pay very close attention to   how the economy is evolving at this particular moment because I think the uncertainty and the   potential nonlinearity at this juncture are greater than what we normally face  I’ll stop there, and   we can begin our second round Oh, I’m sorry—Vincent  [Laughter]   That is a good practice  [Laughter]   We are ready for the go-round now Would anyone like to   speak? President Poole   September 20, 2006 93 of 132                                  Thank you  President Moskow   Thank you  President Stern   President Fisher   September 20, 2006 97 of 132                                      Thank you  Governor Kohn   President Hoenig   Thank you  President Guynn   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you  President Lacker   Thank you  President Minehan   Thank you  I assure you that the minutes will reflect the tenor   of the meeting  President Yellen   September 20, 2006 107 of 132                                       Thank you  Governor Kroszner   Thank you  Governor Bies   Thank you  Governor Warsh   Governor Mishkin   Thank you Vice Chairman Geithner   September 20, 2006 112 of 132                                       Thank you all  Our pause at the last meeting was a   benefit-cost calculation  The benefit of pausing was to give ourselves more time to assess the state   of the economy and the effects of our previous interest rate actions  The potential cost of pausing   was that we would lose some credibility, that inflation might move adversely, and we would get   behind the curve in terms of that very important goal  The intermeeting developments have shown   a somewhat weaker economy in real terms than we had expected and, I think I can safely say, no   reduction in uncertainty  Although inflation remains above where we would like it to be, I think we   can’t say that the inflation situation has deteriorated during the intermeeting period  Therefore, it’s   reasonable for us to continue to pause to get more information and to evaluate the state of the   economy  We can, of course, maintain our policy stance at this level for a while if we deem it   sufficiently restrictive, or we can move it as new information comes in  At this point we will have a   very high degree of flexibility in future actions   I’d like to make a few other comments about some of the conversation around the table  I’m   bemused by the de facto inflation targeters that we have become here [laughter] with the 15 percent   goal  Let me just make a couple of comments on that  First, flexible inflation targeting does   respond to things other than the target itself  In particular, we saw a surprising increase in inflation   earlier this year, which took us above or further above our implicit target  The optimal response to   that is to return to target, but only slowly and with the amount of time to take to get back to the   target depending positively on the initial deviation  Second, the speed at which you return to the   target ought to depend on the state of the real economy  The extent to which we’re concerned about   September 20, 2006 114 of 132                        potential recessionary effects should make us be a little more cautious and make us move a little   more slowly  I would add that, although a number of us, including myself, have mentioned this 1 to   2 percent zone, it has also been noted around this table that it may not, in fact, be the right zone  If   we do determine that we want to announce a target and it is 15 percent, we should lay out a plan for   getting to that level over a period of time and not immediately  But we might choose as an   alternative possibility, for example, 1½ to 2 percent, in which case we would be somewhat closer to   that target in a shorter time   Let me also say a word about credibility, which is a little subtle, and I am probably going to   mess it up I think there are two definitions of credibility  The first is the one we are all familiar   with, which Paul Volcker gave to the Federal Reserve and for which he is one of my personal   heroes That is the kind of credibility that involves doing what you have to do to get inflation where   it needs to be Let me be completely clear that, if inflation conditions begin to deteriorate and our   credibility comes under serious threat, I certainly will support doing whatever it is we have to do to   maintain that credibility  There is another kind of credibility, however, which I think was brought   to the Federal Reserve by Alan Greenspan, which is credibility and confidence in our ability to   analyze and forecast the economy sufficiently well that we can achieve our objectives in a way that   does not induce undue harm to the economy  I think that the Greenbook forecast, if it comes true,   would in fact be a quite positive accomplishment for this Committee because it would have us   bringing inflation down to a reasonable level in a moderate way and avoiding a recession  That   outcome would actually be very good  In fact, our task is going to be more difficult than that, as   I’ve indicated Part of our task going forward is not just to show that we’re committed to fighting   inflation, which we are, but also that we are very deftly evaluating the state of the economy and   making good judgments about what needs to be done   September 20, 2006 115 of 132                                 Let me turn to the statement  I would like to discuss certain elements of it  I’d like to   propose that we use alternative B, and let me note a few points  First, I’m sure that everyone noted   that in section 2, in the phrase “reflecting a cooling of the housing market,” we are eliminating the   word “gradual” and doing so indicates a somewhat stronger degree of cooling  Second, in response   to President Poole, I think this is not intended to be anything other than a pure description of the   economy and our sense of what is happening in the economy  It actually does have a bit of a   forward-looking aspect as well, Vice Chairman Geithner; and it is factual in that, if you look at the   forecast, the slowdown in construction accounts for almost all the decline from potential  So I don’t   think it’s in any way focusing our policy decision on the housing sector   In section 3, the addition of “reduced impetus from energy prices” is useful, I think  We   have been criticized for, among other things, being too sanguine about the disinflation and arguing   implicitly that a modest amount of slowing in the economy would be sufficient to achieve   disinflation  We do not actually believe that, and one of the reasons we forecasted a decline in   inflation is that we expected to see a reduced impetus from energy prices going forward  We now   have actually seen the fall in energy prices, and so we don’t even have to appeal, for example, to the   futures market  We can simply state that we have seen this decline in energy prices, and I think that   makes our story a little more complete and makes it look more understandable to the public about   why we think that inflation should decline slowly over time   I propose to keep the assessment of risk as it stands  It’s very clear that our bias is toward   resisting inflation  I’m not even sure that B+ would actually be a more hawkish phrase because it   admits the possibility of easing, whereas this statement actually suggests that it’s unlikely that our   next move will be anything other than upward  I am torn about the phrase “on balance”  The   intention of the phrase was to note the slightly better readings but to emphasize that the overriding   September 20, 2006 116 of 132                                                view is that inflation readings are still elevated  However, several people have suggested taking it   out, and I am willing to do so Are there others who have a strong view one way or the other?   I get a sense of nodding around the table, so let’s strike the   words “on balance” from section 3  “In part” was changed back to “partly” just to be the same as   last time  We consulted with the style editor, and she assured us that there was no substantive   difference between those two  [Laughter]  So my recommendation then is no action today, and   alternative B in the statement is amended by eliminating the phrase “on balance”  May I have your   reactions?  All right If there is no further comment, then please call the roll   Thank you very much  Our next meeting is a two-day   meeting, and we will have the long-anticipated discussion of inflation targeting [laughter] on   October 24 and 25  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   September 20, 2006 118 of 132     "
8020,2006-10-24,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon  Let me start by welcoming Pat Barron,   First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, who will be here in Jack Guynn’s   seat for today    Welcome  I have a bit of business to start with before we   go to Dino  Last month the Congress passed, and the President signed, the Financial Services   Regulatory Relief Act, which had a number of measures in it  Included among them were   provisions that allow the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserves and to reduce reserve   requirements at our discretion  The act potentially has a lot of very important implications for   the conduct of monetary policy, for payment systems, for contractual clearing balances, for data   collection, and so on  Because of budget-scoring rules, the provisions of this act will not take   place until October 2011  So I feel that, if we hurry, we can possibly be prepared in time    [Laughter]  So if the group is amenable, I’d like to ask Vincent Reinhart to form a committee of   senior staff around the System to begin talking about these issues  I assume at various intervals   we’ll have reports and some discussions at the FOMC meeting about these issues  Do I hear any   second?      Thank you  Dino Kos    Are there questions?  I see none  Do I have a motion?   GOVERNOR KOHN  So moved    The motion is passed without objection  Thank you very   much  We’ll turn now to the economic situation  Dave Stockton    Thank you very much  Are there questions?  President   Yellen     President Moskow    Thank you  President Fisher    President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Any other questions?  Dave and Karen, thank you, as   always, for a very good report  We’re ready now for the economic go-round  We haven’t made   much use of the two-handed intervention lately, but it’s an option  If you want to make a   comment or ask a question, please raise two hands instead of one  We’ll start with President   Moskow    Okay, Governor Kohn     President Moskow, didn’t you say that you saw output   growing below potential in ’07?  Did I hear correctly?    So with energy prices down and so forth, why do you see   core inflation rising from near-term levels?    President Minehan    President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  First Vice President Barron     That reminds me of the Navy saying “If it stands still, paint   it  If it moves, salute it”  [Laughter]  President Fisher      President Hoenig    President Minehan, did you have something?    President Fisher    President Stern    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  It’s just a little after 400  Why don’t we take a   coffee break and come back at 420?   [Coffee break]    Mr Stockton    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Bies    Thank you  Governor Warsh   October 24-25, 2006 62 of 203     I second the motion  [Laughter]    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Let me summarize what I heard, and then I   would like to make a few comments of my own   There were several themes around the table  Many people noted the bimodal economy    Housing is still quite weak, although a number of people noted that they thought the lower tail   had been trimmed somewhat  Autos are undergoing inventory adjustment, and some people   noted slowing in a few other sectors  However, the general view was that spillovers from   housing to the rest of the economy had not yet occurred  Most people noted that the labor   market is quite healthy, with widespread shortages of labor, particularly of skilled workers  It   was further noted that consumption spending would be supported by the job market, by income   growth, and by the fall in energy prices  Overall, the assessments of growth, as I heard them,   October 24-25, 2006 71 of 203    were that it would be moderate going forward, either around potential or perhaps slightly below   potential, and some saw a bit of upside risk to that projection   With respect to inflation, costs of raw materials and energy are rising more slowly or are   declining, and headline inflation has fallen with energy costs  Some felt that core inflation   would moderate gradually, but others were less confident about that  The behavior of rents and   the behavior of productivity are two important unknowns going forward, and wage growth   probably presents the biggest upside risk to inflation  Most members expressed concerns that the   high level of inflation could raise inflation expectations and undermine Fed credibility  So the   general view, which I think essentially everyone shares, was that the upside risks to inflation   exceed the downside risks to growth at this juncture    I hope that summary was okay; let me just make a few comments of my own  As a   number of people noted, the intermeeting data were actually fairly limited  The employment   report did indicate a fairly strong labor market  There is still, to my mind, some disconnect   between the anecdotes and the data; in particular, the wage data do not yet reflect what I’m   hearing around the table about wage premiums  For example, average hourly earnings actually   grew more slowly in the third quarter than in the second quarter  I think the ECI next week will   be a very important check for our anecdotes  On the positive side, as Kevin and others noted, the   tone was generally stronger in financial markets  The stock market is up  I note the ten-year real   rate was up about 15 basis points since the last meeting, which I take to be a positive indication   of growth    Oil prices continue to decline, which obviously is good for both growth and inflation  I   thought you might be interested in thinking about the quantity effects of the decline in oil prices    We’ve had a decline in oil prices of about $15, which back-of-the-envelope calculations or   October 24-25, 2006 72 of 203    FRB/US analysis can tell us should add about 045 percent to the level of real consumption or   about 035 percent to the level of real GDP  Dave Reifschneider was very helpful in finding   those numbers  That’s a change to the level, so the oil price declines could add 03 to   04 percentage point to growth, say, over the next six quarters  Another way to look at that is to   think about the relationship between oil prices and house prices  A rule of thumb that might be   useful is that a $3 decline in oil prices offsets approximately a 1 percentage point decline in   house prices in terms of overall consumption effects  So oil price declines are essentially the   negative equivalent of a 5 percent decline in house prices  An interesting question that we may   have to address at some point is, what is the policy implication of oil price declines?  I think it’s   clear that oil price declines will lower both total and core inflation, but will also increase growth    Therefore, our policy response to the lower oil prices could depend on our preferences about   growth versus inflation and also our assessments of the risks to both of those variables   On the housing correction, I agree that there is perhaps some reduction in the lower tail    But it’s important to point out that, even if we see some stabilization in starts and permits, a lot   of inventory is still out there, and there’s going to be an inventory correction process that could   be quite significant  The current months’ supply of homes for sale is greater than 6 now,   excluding cancellations; the number over the past eight years has been very stable around 4,   although before 1997 it was higher and more variable, which is a source of uncertainty  To get a   sense of the magnitudes of the potential housing correction, I asked Josh Gallin to do the   following simple simulation  Single-family housing sales were about 10 million at an annual   rate in July, about 105 million in August  So I asked Josh to consider a case in which sales   flatten out at the level of 11 million and continue at that level indefinitely; in addition,   homebuilders respond to three-fourths of the increase in sales by extra building and allow the   October 24-25, 2006 73 of 203    other fourth to go into reducing inventory  When you do that calculation, you find that you   actually work off the inventory  By the end of 2008, the months’ supply is down to 41  Part of   that decrease occurs because the sales level is higher, and so the denominator is bigger as well    Thus that particular scenario is a sensible one in terms of getting the inventories down    However, the effects on GDP, because the correction is still significant, are not trivial, but they   are also not that large  The effect of this scenario on GDP growth from the fourth quarter of this   year to the second quarter of next year is about 02 on growth and about 01 in the third and   fourth quarters  So a very substantial part of the housing correction is still in place because of   the need to work off inventories over the next few quarters   Those are a few comments on the real side  I think that some of the tail risk has been   reduced  I agree with the Greenbook that growth should be slow, at least through the first   quarter of next year, because of housing corrections, but consumption will probably pick up and   lead to a stronger growth path after that   Let me say a few words about inflation  I think I need to push back a little on the view   that there has been no improvement in core inflation or total inflation  In fact, inflation is very   slow to respond to its determinants, and the fact that we actually have seen some improvement in   some sense is a positive surprise, not a negative surprise  The attention that’s paid to the   twelve-month lagging inflation measure is a problem in this context, because we had four   months of 03 percent readings from March to June, and they’re going to stay in that twelve-  month lagging measure until next March  I can predict with great confidence that next March   through next June the twelve-month lagging inflation measure will decline  So I think it’s more   useful, President Lacker, to look, a bit at least, at the higher-frequency measures to see what the   trend of movement is  Although, like President Lacker and others, I’m not happy with the level,   October 24-25, 2006 74 of 203    I think the direction is actually very good  For example, the core CPI three-month went from   379 in May to 275 in September, so it’s a decline of 104 basis points  The core PCE three-  month inflation measure went from 295 in May to 220 in September, using the staff estimate   for the core PCE deflator for September  So it’s certainly moving in the right direction   The other comment I would make about this subject is that we must keep in mind how   much is tied to the owners’ equivalent rent component  I would say, in fact, that once you   exclude that, if you do, just for comparison, that 2006 is roughly equivalent to 2005 in terms of   core PCE inflation  To look at the high frequency numbers, excluding OER, which I’m doing   now for illustrative purposes, core CPI fell from 301 in May to 223 in September, and core PCE   inflation fell from 252 in May to 193 in September at an annual rate  This is saying that a   significant part of the speedup and now the decline in the rate is related to this owners’   equivalent rent phenomenon—not all of it, but a significant part  It’s important to know that   because, as we’ve discussed around the table, the OER may have its own dynamic  It may   respond in different ways to monetary policy than some other components do  It is an imputed   price, which people do not actually observe, and so it may have a different effect on expectations   than, say, gasoline prices or other easily observed prices  The other important aspect of the OER   is that, to the extent that it is a major source of the inflation problem, it makes clear that inflation   probably has not been a wage-push problem so far because owners’ equivalent rent is obviously   the cost of buildings, not the cost of labor  So if you look at inflation over the past few months,   there has been slow improvement, and so far I don’t think that we have seen a great deal of   feedthrough of wage pressures into inflation  I’ve looked through all the various categories of   goods and services whose prices have increased, and I can find no particular relationship to labor   market factors   October 24-25, 2006 75 of 203    Another comment along this line  It’s also true that inflation of even 220 percent, which   was the core PCE three-month inflation rate in September, is too high in the long run  I agree it   should be lower than that  We do have to ask ourselves, given that inflation has been high and   that, as people pointed out, it has been high for a number of years now, how quickly we should   bring it down  Most optimal monetary policy models will suggest that a slow reduction is what   you would try to achieve if you start off far away from the target and if the real economy is   relatively weak  Now, the question arises whether we are going in the right direction  I think so   far we are, but I would certainly agree that we have to ensure that we continue to go in the right   direction  The Greenbook forecast is predicated on a constant federal funds rate from the current   level; actually the rate declines in 2008  But what it leaves out is the notion that we are gathering   information and trying to resolve uncertainty, depending on how things develop  Obviously,   policy can respond in one direction or another and could, if inflation does not continue to   decline, be more aggressive to achieve that  I felt I needed to talk a bit about the fact that we do   have some improvement in inflation, and so the situation cannot really be said to be   deteriorating    Having said all of that, now let me come back and agree with what I’ve heard, which is   that, although we have not yet seen much wage-push inflation, clearly the risk is there    Anecdotally, and to some extent statistically, we have very tight labor markets  It is surprising   how little wage push there has been so far, and if labor markets continue to stay at this level of   tightness, then one would expect that you would get an inflation effect that would be   uncomfortably persistent  That is a real concern, which I share with everyone around the table    If the Phillips curve language doesn’t appeal to you, another way of thinking about it is that, if   the labor market stays this tight, which means that growth is at potential or better, then the real   October 24-25, 2006 76 of 203    interest rate that is consistent with that growth rate needs to be higher than it is now  I agree with   that point as well  So my bottom line is that I do agree that inflation is the greater risk, certainly    I think that the downside risk from output has been slightly reduced  I also think the upside risk   to inflation has been slightly reduced  Thus we’re not in all that different a position than we   were at our last meeting  We can discuss the implications of that tomorrow  I think I’ll stop   there  Yes, President Poole    I would ask the people around the table, in their   conversations in their Districts in particular, to talk to medium-sized homebuilders  We’ve had   the large homebuilders at the Board, and we have considerable contact with them; but what we   don’t have is contact with the medium-sized homebuilders    Okay  Let me ask the Committee’s preference here  The   reception tonight starts at 545, followed by dinner half an hour later  We can adjourn now, or   Vince is prepared to give his opening remarks on the policy session, which would allow us to   finish earlier tomorrow  We’ll do the go-round tomorrow, of course  Jeff?   October 24-25, 2006 77 of 203     Okay  How many people would like to adjourn now?    All right  Do I take it, then, that we would like to hear   Vincent’s presentation?   SEVERAL  Yes    All right  Vincent, whenever you’re ready    Thank you  Are there any questions for Vince?  President   Moskow    Vice Chairman Geithner    Other questions?  President Minehan    That comes tomorrow  [Laughter]    The ten-year TIPS came down quite a bit during the   deflation scare     Are there other questions for Vince?  We’ll reassemble   tomorrow at 900 am     [Meeting recessed]   October 24-25, 2006 85 of 203    October 25, 2006—Morning Session    Good morning  We’ve already heard Vincent’s report on   the statement and policy proposals, so we’ll begin the program this morning with the policy   go-round  After that, we’ll have our discussion on communications  We’ll adjourn at that point    For those of you who can stay for lunch, we have a short presentation on planning for the Federal   Reserve centennial, which I hope most of you can stay to hear about  So without further ado,   let’s begin the second go-round, and Debbie will take your names  President Poole    Thank you  Yes, two-handed intervention    President Fisher    President Poole    Governor Kohn    President Moskow    Vice Chairman Geithner    We’ve used it as a verb and not as an adjective  [Laughter]    President Minehan    President Lacker     All right  President Minehan    President Plosser    Thank you  President Hoenig    Did you mean to say that you wanted to strike the words in the   inflation section?  Was that what you were saying?   October 24-25, 2006 104 of 203     Okay  Thank you    President Pianalto    President Yellen      Thank you  First Vice President Barron    Thank you  President Moskow    President Plosser    That would break many years of tradition  [Laughter]    That’s okay, President Plosser  You’re new  [Laughter]    I see a two-handed intervention from President Poole    Good suggestion    All right  President Stern    I think the communications subcommittee should take that   under advisement  [Laughter]    Governor Bies    President Lacker    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    Vincent    That was truly amazing  [Laughter]  President Fisher    Thank you  Well, thank you all very much for a very useful,   very informative discussion  My bottom line is that we have not had a great deal of information in   the past five weeks on which to base a sharp change either in policy or in this statement  Therefore,   I would propose that we make no change in the federal funds rate target today   Many of the issues that were raised yesterday were in some sense prospective  Will the   housing market decline further or stabilize?  Will labor markets strengthen or weaken?  Will growth   slow or return to potential?  Over the next six or seven weeks, until the next meeting, we’ll be   seeing the employment cost index, the third-quarter GDP, two employment reports, and a raft of   data on housing prices and other key indicators  So I think it would be sensible to think very hard in   December about whether a course adjustment is necessitated both in terms of policy and in terms of   the statement   I would just say that Governor Warsh’s comment about the markets was one that I’ve   thought about myself  If the markets disagree with you, do you try to persuade them or not?  I think   the ideal thing is, again, to convey strongly what our views are—in particular, both our objective   function and our outlook—but in general not to try to directly influence the position of the yield   curve because doing so makes us lose an important source of information about the economy    However, in the intermeeting period we can continue with our verbal tightening in the sense that we   can emphasize our ongoing concern about inflation and the pace of change in inflation, and we can   convey, those of you who believe this, that the risks to lower growth seem to have been at least   somewhat moderated   October 24-25, 2006 121 of 203    With respect to the language, I’ve been trying to keep track here, [laughter] but I think I   have a clear majority in the third section to strike “and of the prices of energy and other   commodities”  I heard no disagreement there  The Kohn amendment seems to have a majority    Governor Warsh raised some of the issues that I thought about in trying to distinguish the third   quarter from the fourth quarter  I guess I’m okay with Governor Kohn’s suggestion  Is there   anyone who would like to re-enter this discussion after hearing the whole thing?  If not, I take the   general thrust to be in favor of making that change    Is there a comment?  Yes, Governor Kroszner    I think “poised” suggests in the future even more than what   we already have  Frankly, this may or may not occur, but I think that second sentence, “seems   likely to expand at a moderate pace,” is actually a fairly hawkish sentiment because it will tell the   markets that we are less concerned about a meltdown in housing than many people in the bond   market appear to be  So I guess I don’t see the advantage of “poised”  I think “moderate,” even   without Vince’s very appropriate intervention, does convey the sense of reasonable, near trend,   certainly greater than 1 percent  So I do think it’s a reasonable suggestion  We will, of course, be   talking in subsequent sessions about how much more we want to go into forecasts and how much   more explicit we want to be about those things in the future, and that will be a point for significant   discussion   On the risk assessment, section 4, a few people expressed interest in B+, but I think the   overwhelming sentiment was that changes in this case would be somewhat risky, and so the status   October 24-25, 2006 122 of 203    quo seems to have the majority  Again, it will be a very interesting intermeeting period  We’ll see   what the data are, and we’ll also see how the markets respond to those data  As President Poole   pointed out, if the data are exceptionally strong, I think the markets will anticipate our action and   begin to move financial conditions in the appropriate direction  So that’s my recommendation    Would anyone like to comment?  If not, Ms Danker, could you call the roll?    Thank you very much  It’s 1030  Why don’t we take a   fifteen-minute coffee break and return for our discussion?   October 24-25, 2006 123 of 203    [Coffee break]    The meeting can come to order  This portion of the meeting is   devoted to a discussion of communications  Governor Kohn, could you lead us off?    Thank you, Governor Kohn  Let me just add a couple of   comments  I’ll talk more substantively at the end of the round, but I just want to say that I’m   looking forward to the discussion  I think we’re going to learn a lot  Our objective should be to   find a package of measures that will improve our communication and our policy effectiveness, but I   hope also that we will find something that will attract a broad support and consensus around the   table because we really need to have the whole Committee behind this kind of thing, if at all   possible   I know the focus today is on explicit specification of a numerical definition of price stability    Certainly in my case, and I’m sure in many of your cases, the interest in that depends a lot on   interactions with other elements of the package—for example, projections  If that’s important to   you, I hope that you’ll refer to it because I do think we’ll have to proceed on some of these other   elements as well   Let me conclude by reiterating a point that Governor Kohn made, which is that we will not   be making any decisions today  I ask you please not to give the impression to the outside world that   we have made decisions because the process is going to be extended and gradual and we want to   make sure both that all the pieces of whatever it is we decide to do are coherent and that we’re all   comfortable with the plan  So with that, I will simply ask people to raise a hand if they’d like to   speak, and we’ll go around the table    Good  So we’ll proceed on that understanding  President   Lacker    Thank you, President Lacker  President Moskow    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Minehan   October 24-25, 2006 150 of 203     Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  First Vice President Barron    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Bies      Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  President Fisher    Speak for yourself  [Laughter]  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  President Lacker had a two-handed   intervention    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner     Thank you  It’s been a very long morning  I appreciate   everyone’s patience in this long but very useful discussion  Let me take just a couple of minutes    I’m not going to try to respond to all the points that were raised  I just want to make just a   couple of observations   There was a lot of discussion about how this would affect policy, and indeed, I think it   would affect policy  But, remember, this debate is about communication  I think it’s very   important that we communicate better  While our policy has been good, we have had   difficulties—I certainly have—in communicating with the public and the markets  If we can find   a more effective, clearer way to do that, I think the benefit would be significant   Let me just say a couple of words—and this goes somewhat against Tim’s comments—  about evolution  Whatever we do, I would agree with several people around the table, should be   incremental and evolutionary for several reasons  First, we have to make sure that we   understand what we’re doing  We have to learn how to implement what it is we’re doing    Second, we have to maintain continuity with the previous regime, not have any sharp changes in   our policy or our perceptions  Third, a transitionary, evolutionary approach will give us a chance   to educate the public, educate the Congress, and get some reaction and feedback that will   perhaps allow us to make corrections as necessary     In addition, I think that our steps need to face two real constraints  The first is that we do   have a dual mandate—that whatever we may say here, we have to persuade the Congress and the   public that we will look at both parts of the mandate and that we will not reduce our interest in   employment and output  The second constraint is our institutional structure, the size of our   October 24-25, 2006 189 of 203    Committee, and those features that the Bank of England, for example, does not have  All those   things have to be factored into our thinking   Let me suggest a way one might think about proceeding that I think meets some of these   concerns  It might be useful, for example, for us at some point to clarify what we mean by the   “comfort zone,” a term that is out there and is causing confusion  I would prefer to do it   collectively, but we can think about ways of doing that  If we could confirm what the comfort   zone is and what it means, I think that would be a step in the right direction  In particular, I   would argue that we should define the comfort zone as the range in which core inflation should   remain most of the time  Over the past ten years, it has remained between 1½ to 2 percent most   of the time  But all we would say about policy is that it should have some bias that will take us,   in the long run, back toward that core range     While not setting fixed horizons on the comfort zone, we need to exploit our projections   and forecasts, which can describe to the public what we think the next two years will look like in   terms of the paths of inflation and output  I would associate myself with several people who   have commented that perhaps the best thing we can do, even if we downplay the comfort zone or   the target, is to provide more information to the public about our forecast, more-regular monetary   policy reports, and considerably more information about our outlook and our approach  Again,   my preferred approach would be to provide some information about the comfort zone  But for   the public the big change would be the additional information we’re providing, which would   address Meyer’s point about what the public is looking for  When I make the speech describing   this regime, I would go so far as to say—and this is a little radical—that the Federal Reserve is   not adopting inflation targeting; what we are doing is simply providing more information  We’re   providing more information about where the Committee thinks it wants inflation to be on   October 24-25, 2006 190 of 203    average over longer periods of time, and we’re providing extensive additional information about   the forecast and our views about the economy  If we do it that way, we will probably avoid   some of the pitfalls that have been mentioned     Again, I want to thank everyone for terrific input and to note that this process will be   ongoing  We are in no hurry  We should go on until we feel that we have a conclusion with   which we are comfortable and that we’re all willing to support   Let’s confirm that the date of the next meeting is Tuesday, December 12  The meeting is   adjourned  Lunch is available next door  Please bring your lunch back, and we’ll have a short   presentation on the centennial while we’re having lunch  Thank you so much   END OF MEETING   October 24-25, 2006 191 of 203     "
8043,2006-12-12,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Pat Barron is sitting in again   today for the Atlanta seat  I just wanted to mention that we’re going to have an informal   luncheon for Jack Guynn following the meeting  Jack wanted to keep it informal, so we’re just   going to do it right here    And some commentary from the Chairman as well    [Laughter]  Speaking of retirements, Dino Kos…    This is Dino’s last FOMC meeting, however  He has   attended fifty-eight meetings, forty-seven of which came since he was appointed the Manager of   the Desk and the System Open Market Account  We owe you a great debt of gratitude for your   professionalism, for your leadership, and for the very insightful market reports you’ve given us   to start off every meeting for about the past six years  So, Dino, thank you very much    [Applause]    This report had better be good  [Laughter]  I guess I should   add that we’ll have to have a notation vote to ratify Dino’s successor sometime before the next   meeting  Dino, the floor is yours    Thank you  Dino, some work here at the Board suggests   that a good portion of the decline in the long-term rates in the intermeeting period was due to a   falling term premium as opposed to expectations of inflation  Is that consistent with what you’ve   seen?     And the reason for a lower term premium?    Are there other questions?  President Fisher     Governor Bies     President Lacker     President Poole     Is there any discussion?  Are there any other questions for   Dino  Can I get a second?     All in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Thank you  Again, Dino,   thank you for your many contributions  We turn now to the staff report on the economic   situation  Dave?    Thank you  Are there questions for our colleagues?    President Moskow     Thank you  President Poole     President Pianalto    President Plosser    President Fisher    Vice Chairman Geithner    Are there other questions?  If not, we’re ready for our   economic go-round  As always, two-handed interventions are available  President Yellen    President Yellen, did I understand you to say that the GDI   being higher than the GDP increases both actual output and potential output and so should be read   as mostly a neutral distinction?    Thank you  President Moskow    Thank you  President Fisher    On that note, President Minehan  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you    President Lacker    President Plosser   December 12, 2006 44 of 134          Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  First Vice President Barron    Thank you  President Stern     Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner     Thank you  Governor Kohn     Thank you  Governor Bies     Thank you  Governor Warsh     Governor Warsh, I’m going to put you on the spot  You   and many others have talked about the liquidity in the market, and I want to understand better   December 12, 2006 70 of 134         what that means  First, liquidity can refer to the availability of buyers and sellers; clearly, that   has increased over the past years as we’ve had hedge funds and other actors increasing their   activity  That simply makes markets more efficient and lowers the costs of trading  I don’t think   that’s a bad thing, if that’s what we’re talking about  The second possibility refers to monetary   aggregates, and we know that hasn’t been a serious concern  Money growth has generally been   pretty slow  A third possibility, which is the one that I subscribe to, is that the big demand for   assets reflects the global saving glut, which means that there’s an awful lot of money out there   looking for returns that is coming from abroad and from high rates of saving relative to   investment in other parts of the world  But if the saving glut is, in fact, a source of liquidity, then   actually, as President Lacker I believe mentioned, the equilibrium rate should be lower, not   higher, to be consistent with the real rate that clears the saving and investment market  So I was   just wondering, what is your view about the meaning of this liquidity issue?     Thank you  With apologies to Governors Kroszner and   Mishkin, I think it’s time to take coffee break  [Laughter]  Let’s take a fifteen-minute break, and   then we’ll come back     [Coffee break]     Let’s reassemble  Governor Kroszner, if you’re ready     Governor Mishkin     Thank you  Let me just summarize and add a few   comments  As Governor Kroszner mentioned, we had an avalanche of data, and the snowman is   still standing in the same place as before  [Laughter]    Most people still see a two-track or bimodal economy  In the first part of the economy—  the goods economy, housing and manufacturing—there seems to be some softening since the last   meeting but not a large change  Housing remains the center of the weakness  There are some   indications that demand for housing may be stabilizing, but a few people noted that there are   probably still some downside risks in that sector  Manufacturing is also becoming a bit softer,   partly but not entirely linked to housing  Automobiles, too, have softened, and a few other areas   as well, as I’ll discuss later  One interesting point was that, where the aggregate data show some   decline in growth in commercial real estate and the Greenbook seconds that conclusion, the   anecdotes do not seem all that consistent with it  The second part of the economy, which is   focused primarily on services, remains quite strong, particularly in sustaining a robust labor   market with good income growth  Together with lower energy prices, those factors are leading   to well-sustained consumption, which is continuing to drive the economy forward  A few people   December 12, 2006 78 of 134         mentioned balance sheet issues for the consumer, but the references to balance sheets were both   negative and positive    Looking forward, again to compliment the staff, I think most people around the table   accepted the general contour of the Greenbook forecast—that is, moderate growth perhaps below   potential for the next few quarters but returning to potential growth later next year, with risks to   the upside as well as to the downside  So far there is little evidence of spillover into   consumption in particular, although obviously we have to keep an eye on that  There are a   number of strong underlying conditions, including supportive financial conditions, strong profits,   and a strong international economy, which are providing a cushion to the economy    On inflation, I have to say there wasn’t much change in view  Most of you still expect a   gradual decline in inflation  Others are concerned that we might get stuck at current levels    Even those who expect a gradual decline remain somewhat concerned about the pace of the   decline  Some of the factors that may return inflation to lower levels are a slowing economy,   well-contained inflation expectations, and the downward revisions to the wage data  Those who   are more concerned about inflation cited the weakening dollar, accommodative financial   conditions, and the expectation that growth will not be below potential for very long  So I think   that some of these concerns and risk assessments do not seem markedly different from those at   our last meeting    Let me add just a few comments  These are all marginal because I think the broad   outlines of the story and the risks are quite reasonable  First, I think I took a bit more weakness   from the data in the first part of the economy than some people around the table  The Greenbook   has single-family housing starts leveling out at current levels  They did fall 16 percent in   October  We’re not entirely sure that they will, in fact, stabilize  Multifamily construction   December 12, 2006 79 of 134         permits have been dropping  They’re off about 30 percent since the first quarter  That had been   a source of stability so far this year  There might be a bit less strength there  Then,   nonresidential construction is an issue  The data, in terms of employment and construction put in   place, suggest some slowing, and I do think that some slowing from the very strong pace of   earlier this year is pretty much inevitable  But the sense of the Committee must be that we will   have to wait a bit longer to judge how much that is going to slow  In manufacturing, obviously   the strongest slowdowns are related to autos and housing  But if you look at employment and the   ISM data, for example, you also see weakness in areas like machinery and electrical machinery,   which suggests some possible weakness in equipment and software spending going forward    This remark does not represent a major difference with the Committee; I just saw a bit more   weakness in the first area than some did    At the same time, like many members of the Committee, I see a very strong labor market   and a very strong services sector plus a very strong nonmanufacturing ISM, which, though it   includes construction, was nevertheless still very strong  One begins to wonder a bit about the   measurement of the services sector—whether or not we are understating growth and productivity   in that sector  That’s a question we’ll need to continue to consider  So like most people around   the table, I think that a soft landing with growth a bit below potential in the short run looks like   the most likely scenario  I expect the unemployment rate to increase gradually but income   growth and other factors to be sufficient to keep consumption above 2 percent, which is   essentially what we need to keep the economy growing  Again, I see the risks going in both   directions     Let me add a couple of extra comments about risks in the housing market  I talked last   time about the dynamics of starts  Even if final demand stabilizes, starts may take a time to fully   December 12, 2006 80 of 134         work out the inventories  A couple of other factors are like that, which I just would like to bring   to your attention  One has to do with the very strong presumption we seem to have now that   demand for housing has stabilized  That may be the case, but I would point out that we have   seen a very sharp decline in mortgage rates   People may have a sort of mean-reverting model of   mortgage rates in their minds  It could be they are looking at this as an opportunity to jump in   and buy while the financial conditions are favorable  So even if rates stay low, we face some   risk of a decline in demand  The counter argument to that, which I should bring up, is that if   people thought that prices were going to fall much more, then they would be very reluctant to   buy  That’s evidence for stabilization of demand  Another point to make about housing is that,   even when starts stabilize, there are going to be ongoing effects on GDP and employment  On   the GDP side, it takes about six months on average to complete residential structures  Therefore,   even when starts stabilize, we’re going to continue to see declines in the contribution of   residential construction to GDP    On the employment side, I asked Bruce Fallick of the staff to run a regression of   residential construction employment on residential single-family starts and to project forward   what the employment results are going to be  According to this regression, if starts stabilize at   the October level, as projected by the Greenbook, the job losses in that sector will actually   continue to rise for the next two or three months and return to the November level of about   15,000 per month only by the middle of next year  There will be lagged employment effects   from the housing sector and presumably from the associated manufacturing sectors, like   appliances and furniture, which also tend to lag  So there will be some employment drag coming   forward, and I think it’s reasonable to think that unemployment rates will start to rise  But,   again, this is about 15 percent of the economy as compared with 85 percent of the economy   December 12, 2006 81 of 134          On inflation, I agree that the latest core PCE number was disappointing  I think perhaps   it overstates the trend a bit, just as the core CPI number understates the trend a bit  I think there   are still indications of a mild deceleration in prices, and most of the factors supporting that are   coming into place, including the slowing of rents, the improved energy situation, some increase   in slack, and expectations, which include a five-by-five-year expectation which has come down   about 20 basis points since we stopped raising rates in August  So I think there are some bases to   expect a gradual decline in inflation  I would note also that outside forecasters are a bit more   optimistic about this than the Greenbook is  For example, the Blue Chip median forecast of core   PCE inflation for next year is 02 percentage point lower than the Greenbook on a comparable   basis    I’ve talked before about owners’ equivalent rent, which is a somewhat special category,   and I’ve indicated that I think its slowing will contribute to slower inflation  In the interest of   being even-handed, let me talk about a category that might go in the other direction, which is   medical costs  Medical costs in the short run depend a great deal on government policy,   Medicare reimbursement decisions, and the like  Therefore, only in the medium term will they   respond to monetary policy  I think that’s a source of risk  The twelve-month change in medical   costs has been declining  It was 43 percent in 2003, 35 percent in 2004, 33 percent in 2005,   and 29 percent so far this year  So that gradual decline in medical costs has been a positive in   terms of inflation  But in the latest month, the number was 06 percent on a one-month basis, or   more than 7 percent on an annualized basis  To the extent that we see some bounceback of   medical costs, that’s going to be another factor of concern in terms of inflation going forward    Again, however, I think that we have some reason to think that inflation will slow, but I don’t   December 12, 2006 82 of 134         disagree with the very wide sentiment I hear around the table that the slowing is far from certain   and that the risks are still to the upside on inflation    Are there any comments on or questions about my summary?  If not, let’s go to Brian,   who will introduce the policy discussion    Are there questions for Brian?  President Lacker      Vice Chairman Geithner     President Lacker has a question     President Minehan     Go ahead     You’re correct  Let me just put that on the table for people   to comment on     December 12, 2006 90 of 134           That’s a perfectly fine point  I also just note that in exhibit   4, alternative B, the word “pace” appears in both phrases  If we decide on that particular   language, I have a suggested rework that gets rid of “pace” and has the same meaning  But your   substantive point about whether or not to include “than anticipated” should be on the floor for   people to consider     Are there other questions?  President Pianalto     Some disconnect between the private forecasters, the   economists, and the bond markets is evident  Even in their assumptions it’s quite explicit  So I   December 12, 2006 91 of 134         don’t think those two things are necessarily inconsistent  Are we ready to begin our policy   round?  President Hoenig     President Hoenig, do you prefer exhibit 4 or exhibit 5?     Thank you  President Fisher     President Minehan     Thank you  President Poole     Thank you  Governor Kohn     Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you  First Vice President Barron   December 12, 2006 99 of 134           Yes     Maybe Michelle can tell us the answer to that  [Laughter]    President Minehan has a clean solution  President Yellen    Thank you  President Moskow    Thank you  President Stern    President Stern, are you advocating exhibit 4 about growth as   opposed to exhibit 5 with the indicators?    Thank you  President Lacker    President Plosser    President Plosser, the communications subcommittee will help   us solve that problem  [Laughter]  Governor Bies    President Minehan    Let me just say what the logic is behind it  The logic is that   we’d like the markets to know that we are awake, [laughter] we are watching the data, we have seen   things coming across the transom, but nevertheless, we have the following views  Perhaps the logic   is not good, but that’s the reason    Okay  Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    In the past the Committee has often referred to “intermeeting   data,” for example    Thank you      I would say we crossed the border  [Laughter]  Well, let me   try to summarize  [Laughter]  First of all, the economy is still on the course that we have been   projecting for some time  A soft landing scenario with some slow but, I hope, decided reduction in   inflation seems to be a reasonable expectation  However, there still are significant uncertainties in   the forecast, and we’re quite aware of that  I note parenthetically that it’s a good thing that the bond   markets aren’t simply parroting our statements  They’re providing their own take, and we should   use that information and not necessarily consider it a failure if their views are distinct from ours  So   since the situation seems to be on trajectory, I would advocate today not changing the federal funds   rate   With respect to the statement, we did try in the first iteration to make some changes to the   assessment of risk  I have some sympathy with President Poole’s view in that, read literally, our   December 12, 2006 112 of 134         assessment of risk admits no possibility that our next move will be down, which I don’t think could   be true under any circumstances  However, we have been using this language for a while  We have   been clear in our minutes that we do see some downside risk to output  The market, I think, has   understood whose statement we are trying to emphasize, our particular concern about inflation, and   our willingness to raise rates if inflation doesn’t moderate significantly  Again, although I’m   sympathetic to President Poole and I’m trying to think about how we are going to move away from   this language into other forms of language, I think, along with Vice Chairman Geithner, that our   changing the risk assessment today would send a very strong signal that our discussion has not   suggested  That’s why I propose to leave the risk assessment unchanged for today but to take on   board the concerns that President Poole has raised about getting it to a perhaps more accurate   description of our risk assessments and expectations   On section 2, the two suggestions that I think have commanded some significant support   are, first, President Minehan’s suggestion of using the second section under alternative C and,   second, the alternative in the Christmas-tree colors using “although recent indicators have been   mixed” in the present perfect tense—“although recent indicators have been mixed, the economy   seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters”  I think those are the   two that people have preferred  I don’t think it makes a great deal of difference, frankly, but I lean   personally a bit toward including the reference to indicators only on the grounds of trying to signal   to the market again that we are watching the data, that we are aware of developments in the   economy, and that we’re not just taking the statement out and putting a new date on it  So that   would be my recommendation—that we use the phrase “although recent indicators have been   mixed, the economy seems likely to expand,” and so on  I’d be happy to take comments    Is there a comment?      Thank you very much  We have one more item—on   communications  I’m going to turn over the floor to Governor Kohn    President Hoenig    President Poole    President Plosser    Let me say just a few things  First of all, the freedom of   individual members to speak is a very important value  We are not trying in any way to suppress   December 12, 2006 118 of 134         that  Second, I agree with Governor Mishkin that the education process is very important  Third, I   would say that past positions are past positions, and no one is asking anyone to repudiate anything    I think the response of President Hoenig is perfectly appropriate—to acknowledge the issue, to   acknowledge the arguments on both sides, and to acknowledge even your own past positions  The   only point is to avoid actively taking strong, specific positions on particular issues that are really up   for debate in the Committee  I think that we as a Committee would agree, for example, that good   communication is very important and that there are arguments on both sides of inflation targeting    But, as Governor Kohn said, we do want to make sure that the atmosphere within the Committee is   conducive to getting agreement  Then I and others will have to explain this to the Congress and   others, and we want to make sure that they haven’t heard different positions that, in fact, do not   reflect what we come out with  So please don’t overstate what we’re discussing here  I mean,   we’re not asking for anything like “mum’s the word,” but simply requesting that you have some   perspective on the vigor with which you advocate specific positions over the next few months    President Minehan    Vice Chairman Geithner    President Fisher    Thank you  Let’s bring this discussion to an end  Everyone   has to use his or her own judgment, but we just wanted to bring to your attention some of these   considerations as you think about your public appearances  The date of the next meeting is January   30 and 31  The meeting is now adjourned   END OF MEETING   December 12, 2006 121 of 134     "
8068,2007-01-30,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everyone  Let me be the first to welcome   Bill Dudley to the table       Today is our annual organizational meeting, so we have a   few items to take care of     Go ahead, Governor Kohn       Thank you  Objections?  [Laughter]     Yes     Are there any objections?  Thank you very much  Ms   Danker, will you read the list of staff officers of the FOMC     Thank you  Are there any questions or comments?    Approved without objection  Next on the agenda is a proposed change to Committee rules  We   received a memo from Scott Alvarez and Debbie Danker, which concerns how a backup would   be appointed in case the Desk Manager was unable to serve  Are there any questions for our   colleagues on that memo?       Are there other questions about the memo?  I need a vote    In favor?  Opposed?  Thank you  Third, we need to select a Federal Reserve Bank to execute   transactions for the System Open Market Account  Governor Kohn, would you like to make a   proposal?  [Laughter]      Comments?  Objections?  Without objection  The fourth   item is that we need to select the Manager of the System Open Market Account  Governor   Kohn     Thank you  Without objection  Thank you     I think we’ve started on the wrong tone here  [Laughter]    Item 5, we need authorization for the Desk operations  We have two items to vote on separately    On the domestic side, we have a memo from Bill Dudley proposing to change the accounting of   repurchase agreements so they will be booked on the SOMA rather than on the books of the   FRBNY  Are there any questions for Bill?  If not, without objection  Thank you  On the   January 30-31, 2007 5 of 255    foreign side, Mr Dudley is proposing no change to the authorization, directive, or procedural   instructions  Any questions?  Without objection  Thank you  Bill, you’re up     Thank you  Are there questions for Bill?  President Poole     President Fisher     Vice Chairman Geithner     President Lacker       Are there other questions?  We need a vote to ratify   domestic operations     Without objection  We turn now to the economic situation    Mr Slifman    Thank you  That was very interesting  I have a couple of   questions about your counterfactuals  In exhibit 6, you look at the simulated rate of   unemployment, assuming that gross domestic income is the true measure of output, and you find   that unemployment fits Okun’s law  But then below you also use GDI to measure productivity    January 30-31, 2007 21 of 255    You’re not doing the same thing in both simulations, right?  If you assume that GDI measures   output and use it to calculate both Okun’s law and productivity, I think the puzzle comes back  I   think you just increased potential output, and you’re back to where you started     Okay  The other question is about exhibit 8, where you   consider a simulation with a decline in productivity and an increase in labor participation and   you get a higher rate of core inflation  In that simulation, the decrease in productivity and the   increase in participation offset each other, on both the aggregate demand side and the aggregate   supply side, and the result is, of course, that the unemployment rate doesn’t change so that   demand-supply balance is unchanged  I assume the reason you get inflation is that nominal   wages are sticky, and therefore, as productivity slows, labor costs go up and firms can push them   through  I guess I would question whether that’s realistic, for two reasons  One is that this   increase in unit labor costs is clearly temporary, and I think we tend to believe that longer   increases are needed to affect pricing  The other reason is that with the demand-supply balance   unchanged, why would firms be able to pass through those costs in this scenario when they   couldn’t raise prices absent that increase in unit labor costs?     You also have to assume that the Fed accommodates with   increased nominal GDP growth as well     Thank you  Are there other questions for our colleagues?    President Fisher     President Stern     Governor Kohn   January 30-31, 2007 24 of 255      Vice Chairman Geithner     President Minehan    President Moskow    President Plosser    Other questions?  President Lacker    Seeing that there are no further questions, I propose that we   start the economic go-round  Remember, we do have the two-handed option if anyone cares to   exercise it  President Yellen    Thank you  President Moskow    I notice that they’re not playing in the Seventh Federal   Reserve District, though  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you  President Minehan, just to clarify, I think that the   forecast of consumption is not based on the idea that the saving rate has to rise  Rather,   consumption is modeled using underlying determinants, like income and wealth, and an endogenous   indication of that is that saving rises    Anyway, you gave the impression that higher saving was itself   something that was going to happen naturally    But the saving rate is not driving the consumption forecast    Rather, the consumption forecast is driving the saving rate    President Fisher    President Fisher, just a quick question  I couldn’t quite gather   whether you were saying that commercial construction is overall slowing  You mentioned that   once, but then you talked about a variety of projects    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Plosser    Mr Vice Chairman    Thank you  It’s 430  Why don’t we take a fifteen-minute   coffee break?   [Coffee break]    Would you come to order, please?  Thank you  We are ready   to recommence with the go-round  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Barron    President Poole   January 30-31, 2007 64 of 255      Thank you       President Lacker     Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner     Thank you  Governor Kohn     Thank you  Governor Bies     Thank you  Governor Warsh     Thank you  Governor Kroszner     Thank you  Governor Mishkin     Thank you  This was an exceptionally interesting, useful   discussion  I thought I would try to summarize what I heard around the table  If you have   comments on that, please give them to me, and then I’ll add a few comments of my own    Members noted considerable economic strength during the intermeeting period  Labor   markets remain taut, with continuing wage pressures in some occupations  Consumption grew   strongly in the fourth quarter, with some momentum into the first quarter, reflecting a strong job   market, lower energy prices, and higher profits  Overall, investment seems likely to grow at a   moderate pace given good fundamentals  Business people seem generally optimistic, and   financial markets are robust    We still have what people have been characterizing as a two-track economy  Housing,   although a drag for now, does show some tentative evidence of stabilization  However, some   warned about drawing too strong a conclusion about housing during the winter months  Some   also noted issues of credit quality  The general view was that housing would cease to subtract   January 30-31, 2007 85 of 255    from growth later this year  Some softness in parts of manufacturing, especially in industries   related to housing and automobiles, still exists  But in part this weakness may be an inventory   correction that may be reasonably far advanced at this point  Despite the weakness in housing   and some parts of manufacturing, there are yet no signs of spillover into employment or   consumption, although some raised the possibility that we may see those later on  Some, but not   all, members agree with the contour of the Greenbook that has economic growth somewhat   slower in the near term, strengthening later this year, with a modest increase in unemployment    The Committee is generally more optimistic about potential growth than the Greenbook, mostly   because the members assume that labor force growth will be greater than the Greenbook   assumes  Overall, downside risks to output appear to have moderated, while an upside risk has   emerged that growth will not moderate as expected    On the inflation side, people noted that recent readings have been favorable, although   there was disagreement about the cause, whether it was energy prices, well-anchored inflation   expectations, less structural inertia, or perhaps just statistical noise  Most still expect gradually   slowing inflation but are cautious and consider upside risk significant, perhaps even greater than   late last year  The primary upside risk to inflation is economic growth above potential in tight   labor markets, which may lead to inflation in the future if not in the near term  Others noted that   inflation expectations may be too high to allow continued progress against inflation  So overall,   the general tone was for a somewhat stronger economy, perhaps a slightly improved outlook on   inflation, but, in any case, a clear view that the upside risks to inflation are predominant  Are   there any comments?     Let me add just a few points  Everything has really been said, but not everyone has said   it, as they say  [Laughter]  Our goal has been, in some sense, to achieve a soft landing, and the   January 30-31, 2007 86 of 255    question is whether we have missed the airport  [Laughter]  We have seen a good bit of strength   in the intermeeting period, and I think the real crux of the issue is what’s going to happen to the   labor market  If the labor market continues where it is or strengthens further, we will see both   stronger growth, because of the income effects and job effects, and continued pressure on   inflation  Again, the central issue will be whether we will see enough cooling in the economy to   have a bit of easing in the labor situation  This is, obviously, difficult to say  I do believe that   the most likely outcome for the first half of this year is for some moderation in growth, perhaps   to modestly below potential   If you look at the various components of spending and production,   you note, for example, that personal consumption expenditures are likely to slow from the very   high levels we have just seen recently  In particular, a lot of the spending recently was for   durable goods, which tend to be more negatively auto-correlated—that is, they tend to drop more   quickly when they are high in the short run   We have seen some moderation in investment, in   both equipment and structures  Net exports were a major contributor to growth at the end of the   year; that should probably reverse, as the Greenbook notes  A special factor there is that the   good weather reduced oil imports, which led people to spend on domestic production rather than   on foreign production  If that situation reverses and we go back to normal net exports, that will   subtract from GDP  Also, the staff noted some likely reversals in government spending  So my   sense is that we’re likely to see something a little less hectic in the first half of this current year    I think it also remains reasonable that growth will return close to potential later this year    There is certainly uncertainty about that  Clearly, we have seen some signs of stabilization in the   housing market  I was going to note the effects of the winter months and the weather  I think   that we should acknowledge that stabilization but not ignore the possibility that we may see   further deterioration there   January 30-31, 2007 87 of 255     Against the view that growth may moderate this quarter, or next quarter perhaps, there is   opposing evidence that consumption and employment are awfully strong  Economists tend to   think of consumption, in particular, as being a very forward-looking variable, and it’s consistent   with views that we see, for example, in consumer sentiment that people do feel reasonably   optimistic about the labor market and about the state of the economy  So I agree that there is   certainly some risk that the economy will be stronger going forward than we have been   projecting  I don’t have an answer other than to say that we obviously have to monitor the   situation very carefully and continue to be willing to reassess our views as the data arrive    Let me say a bit about inflation  Recent readings have been favorable  A couple of   aspects of inflation I do find encouraging  First is that the moderation we’ve seen in inflation the   past few months has happened despite the lack of any substantial moderation in shelter costs    Owners’ equivalent rents are actually a constructed, imputed variable  They are not seen by   anybody  Nevertheless, they are essentially the entire reason that inflation is remaining above   our target zone at this point  I know it’s a bit of a joke that I always refer to the short-term   inflation numbers, but I’ll do it again anyway  [Laughter]  Just to illustrate, over the past three   months, core CPI inflation excluding just owners’ equivalent rent was 02 percent at an annual   rate  Over the past six months, it was 120 percent at an annual rate  Over the past twelve   months, it was 182  We also get numbers for PCE core inflation excluding owners’ equivalent   rents that are all below 2 percent  Obviously that is just carving the data, and there are lots of   problems with doing that  But to the extent we think that rents will continue to moderate, and I   think there is scope for them to do that, that’s one factor that should make us a little more   comfortable  Another factor is that there is a fairly broad-based slowing  I won’t take a lot of   time to go through the evidence, but particularly in the CPI there are some encouraging   January 30-31, 2007 88 of 255    developments on the services side in terms of inflation to go along with the slowing in goods   prices     Now, I am the first to acknowledge that lots of interpretations of the recent developments   are possible  We hope that favorable structural factors are at work  One possibility certainly is   that the wage increases are a catch-up for previous productivity gains and that we’re seeing a   normal restoration of capital-income/labor-income relationships  In that case, this may be in   some sense a transitory adjustment that will restore those relationships and not necessarily   contribute to inflation going forward  Another possibility is that energy price effects are   somewhat larger than we thought  There seems to be some evidence that they are  A third   possibility is that what we saw earlier last year was, as Governor Kohn mentioned, a transitory   upside, some of which has simply passed, and we are going back to the more fundamental rate of   inflation  So there are some structural reasons that inflation might be moderating      My having said that, we should certainly acknowledge the statistical noise that is inherent   in these measures  The monthly standard deviation of core inflation in 2006 was about 8 basis   points  If the true underlying inflation is 02 percent, then you have a very good chance of   getting either 03 or 01  Therefore, we and the financial markets ought to be braced for the   possibility that we will get 03—I hope not worse—in the next few months  I agree with the   view that has been expressed that the trend has not yet been established, and we’ll have to follow   its development  Another very important point that has been raised—President Moskow, I think,   was the first to raise it—is that, given the lags from economic activity to inflation that we see in   standard impulse-response functions and so on, these improvements may be real but nevertheless   temporary and the underlying labor market pressures and so on may lead to inflation problems a   year or eighteen months from now  I agree that it is a concern, and it goes back to my point   January 30-31, 2007 89 of 255    earlier that we need to be very alert to changes in the pattern of aggregate demand going forward    As President Poole mentioned, one element that will help us is the endogeneity of financial   conditions  We haven’t done anything since the last meeting, but long-term real interest rates   rose about 30 basis points  The yield curve is still inverted by about 30 basis points  So I think   even the markets themselves have the ability to raise real rates quite significantly, enough   certainly to make a difference in the mortgage market if the data continue to be strong and if   inflation does not continue to subside  Then we would have a bit more latitude as we try to   determine whether the fourth quarter was a blip or a trend  I think that’s still an open question    So let me just say that I broadly agree with what I heard  The economy does look   stronger  That is an upside risk to which we need to be paying close attention  Inflation looks a   bit better, at least in the short term, but there are some long-term considerations that we need to   keep in mind  Finally, the basic contours of the outlook are not sharply changed, but I agree with   the sentiment around the table that upside risk to inflation remains the predominant concern that   the Committee should have  Are there comments?  Yes, President Poole     We’ll start the meeting with the data  Anything else?    There’s a reception and dinner in Dining Room E  It’s for those who wish to attend  If you have   other plans, please feel free to pursue them, and we’ll see you tomorrow morning at 900   [Meeting recessed]   January 30-31, 2007 90 of 255    January 31, 2007—Morning Session     Good morning, everyone  Let’s start with asking Dave   Stockton to report on this morning’s data     Thank you  Are there any questions?  If not, Vincent    Thank you  Are there questions for Vincent?  Vice   Chairman Geithner     We’re ready to begin our policy go-round  President   Plosser     President Plosser, just so I’m clear, which sections from C?     Thank you  President Minehan     President Minehan, for the risk assessment, in alternative C,   are you proposing also the second sentence?     Thank you  First Vice President Barron     Thank you  President Hoenig     Thank you     Vice Chairman Geithner     The original intention was to capture the last relatively few   monthly readings, so there is a bit of ambiguity there     Thank you  President Fisher     No problem, President Fisher  Thank you  President   Yellen     Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you  President Minehan     President Pianalto     Thank you  President Moskow     Thank you  President Stern     Thank you  President Lacker     Vice Chairman Geithner     Yes President Minehan     You can’t withdraw it; she’s not making it  [Laughter]    President Lacker, please just say a word about how we are linking energy prices and core  In our   public remarks—for example, my speeches on energy—I have talked about the importance of   unlinking those two      Governor Kroszner has a two-hander     President Moskow has an intervention     But I just raise a question, for those who are making the   suggestion, because I’d like to hear your response  In saying that inflation is the predominant   concern, we are acknowledging more explicitly than we have before that we have other concerns    That is, we’re in some sense bringing into the assessment the presumption that there are concerns   other than inflation, but we are perhaps more concerned about housing than we were before    This is simply a semantic issue  In alternative B, we don’t acknowledge other concerns  Neither   January 30-31, 2007 111 of 255    of these things is quite accurate, I agree  I just wanted to point that out and ask for your   response  President Lacker     President Minehan     I couldn’t have framed it that way  [Laughter]     January 30-31, 2007 112 of 255      Intervention, President Fisher    Governor Mishkin    Vincent    Any other interventions?    President Hoenig    Oh, you can speak for yourself  [Laughter]     Okay  I think we’re going to have to assert order here  Any   other interventions?  President Moskow    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  Governor Bies    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Mr Vice Chairman    Thank you  Thank you all for your insights  My   recommendation also is to take no action and to maintain a bias toward further tightening  I have   heard very clearly the Committee’s concerns about inflation risk, and I recognize that we may have   January 30-31, 2007 122 of 255    to take further action in that direction later this year  I would counsel patience for the moment for   several reasons  First, the level of the federal funds rate is probably not too far from where we need   to be  I didn’t hear anyone suggesting that we were 75 or 100 basis points away from where we   need to be  Second, we have clearly conveyed the bias of our policy, and I don’t think there would   be a problem with our taking action  No one is going to accuse us of not having provided sufficient   warning  Third, there’s the confluence of data that we’ve seen since the last meeting, including   some improvement in the inflation data, which gives us, if nothing else, a bit of breathing space to   observe what I believe remain some relatively significant uncertainties about the evolution of the   real economy  The housing market has looked a bit more solid, and the worst outcomes have been   made less likely  But given that we have the breathing space to observe how that evolves, I think   that waiting a bit more would be wise   The other point that I’d like to make—I’ve made it before as have others, but I think it is   quite important—is the endogeneity of financial conditions  The five-year and ten-year bond rates   are 35 to 40 basis points below the fed funds rate  That has several implications  The first is that we   don’t want to completely ignore the information that may be in that  More important from a policy   point of view, we could, depending on the inflow of data, see an increase of 30, 40, or 50 basis   points in long-term rates—mortgage rates, in particular—without any overt action on our part but   simply by maintaining our stance and our language  We are very well positioned in that respect in   terms of the way markets are likely to respond to data that confirm our sense but not the market’s   current sense   With respect to the language, I listened with interest to the discussion  My proposal is to   take alternative B  But I’d like to discuss a bit some of the suggestions that have been made  On   section 2, I share the concern that some have mentioned about using the word “rebounding”  I think   January 30-31, 2007 123 of 255    that it implies that we are seeing the 35 percent continuing into the near term  I don’t think that is   the central tendency of our forecast  Alternative B, section 2 does, I believe, clearly signal that we   have seen a change from December, when we noted that there was “substantial cooling of the   housing market” and that “recent indicators have been mixed”  There is clearly a movement toward   a stronger assessment of the real economy   Skipping to the risk assessment for a moment, I share people’s concerns about the accuracy   of the language  Like many of you, I am reluctant to change that assessment, given that there’s not   a sharp change in our policy view, simply because this has become recognized by the market  I   think it’s reasonably well interpreted  As I suggested with respect to the “inflation remains the   predominant concern” language, it’s not entirely clear how that would be interpreted  In any case,   there’s a risk that there would be a perception of a significant policy shift, which is not intended    We do need to think hard about this language  I note that we’ll be discussing in March a number of   issues  Perhaps we could ask for a bit of discussion about how going forward we assess the risks   and what kind of language we use in describing the policy direction  I think that would be useful,   and if we are going to do it, my recommendation would be to wait another meeting or two until we   either see a significant change in the outlook or agree among us to a more systematic way of stating   risk assessment   On section 3 regarding inflation, I’ve been going back and forth listening to the discussion     We have dropped the word “elevated”  We could, I think, take the first sentence of alternative C,   section 3  “Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months but remain   elevated”  The sense in which that is true is that the fourth-quarter core PCE was 21, which is   above some people’s target  So it’s not grossly inconsistent  At the same time, the word   “modestly” conveys the sense that we are not completely on board with the idea that inflation has   January 30-31, 2007 124 of 255    made a substantial move downward or that the magnitude is enormous  I remain open, if you have   additional comments about my recommendation, to finding a way to incorporate the word   “elevated”  But at the moment, I think it is somewhat more accurate to use the word “modestly” to   convey the sense that the improvement in inflation is still not that large  So having discussed these   issues and having noted that our bias remains clearly to the upside and that we must certainly leave   open the possibility of future tightening later this year, my recommendation is to take no action and   to use alternative B as written  Anyone like to comment?  President Poole    President Poole, I responded to something that you said in the   go-round  I think the language of alternative B, section 4 is not saying that we’re about to move at   the next meeting  It says essentially that the next move is more likely to be up, but it’s very clear   that “extent and timing” could mean that it will be some meetings before we respond  I thought the   tenor of the meeting in the discussion of the economic situation was quite clear that our concerns   about inflation remain paramount, and I’m sure that will be reflected in the minutes    Vice Chairman Geithner      President Hoenig    President Lacker    President Minehan    Thank you  Governor Kohn   January 30-31, 2007 127 of 255     President Moskow    I agree    President Moskow    Thank you  Ready to vote?  Ms Danker    Thank you  This would be a good time to have a fifteen-  minute coffee break   [Coffee break]   January 30-31, 2007 129 of 255     The second portion of our meeting is devoted to   communications  President Plosser submitted a memo about external communication that   suggested there might be some unease in the Committee  In the hope of somewhat reducing that   unease, I thought I would try to state one more time what I was trying to get at when we discussed   this issue before  Perhaps without taking too much time away from the important discussion we   want to have today, if anyone would like to respond to that, I’d be certainly happy to hear   I and a few other people had two concerns about talking in public about our communication   issues  The first was that we would try to avoid interfering with the ongoing discussion and the   development of consensus within the Committee  The second was to try to avoid creating any   unnecessary political problems that might complicate the adoption of whatever we decide we’d like   to do  So my recommendation would be to ask yourselves two questions  The first would be,   “Would the remarks that I will give elicit opposition or significant disagreement from other   members of the Committee?”  If the answer is “yes,” then by giving those remarks, you risk the   possibility that other people might be in some sense compelled to respond, and then we are having   the debate in public  My sense of that is that therefore it would probably not be a great idea to give   a speech specifically on the pros and cons of inflation targeting, for example, even if you tried to   take a somewhat neutral position because it’s inevitably difficult to take a neutral position    However, I want to be clear  I think that it’s perfectly okay for people to talk about broader   themes—the importance of low and stable inflation, the importance of credibility, the importance of   commitment, and the importance of clear communication  I see no problem there because those are   broad, general issues that I think everyone around the table would agree with and that don’t   necessarily speak to the issues that we’re still discussing within the Committee  The other question   I’d suggest you ask is, “Would something that I say today be likely to end up being repeated to the   January 30-31, 2007 130 of 255    Chairman in congressional testimony”  [Laughter]  That is a particular concern of mine  The lesson   I would take from it is that, if you do talk about the importance of low and stable inflation, which is   certainly a good thing to do, you also make the point that we are, of course, committed to our dual   mandate and that one of the principal reasons that we seek price stability is to strengthen the real   economy   So those are my thoughts  I want to reiterate that this is guidance, not regulation  I ask   people just to use their judgment and not to feel constrained about talking about broad issues,   particularly issues that would command wide agreement in the Committee, and you certainly don’t   have to disavow any previous positions  If you are pressed too far on an issue, you can certainly   always say that the Committee is currently discussing these issues and that we’ll be saying more   about this in the future  Again, I certainly had no intention and have no intention of trying to censor   people’s words  I hope that you will continue to talk about the broad issues of price stability and   communication, which are so critical to our function as a central bank  I don’t want to take a great   deal of time from our broader discussion, but if anyone would like to react, certainly this would be   the time  President Lacker    Thank you  If there are no other comments, I’ll turn the   meeting over to Governor Kohn    Thank you  Are there questions for the staff?  President   Fisher    Yes   January 30-31, 2007 139 of 255     Governor Mishkin    President Fisher, I think almost all central banks, even the so-  called “formal inflation targeters,” have in their mandate that they are to support economic activity   insofar as it is consistent with price stability  President Lacker    I’m sorry  Is this for a go-round, or do you have a question?    Then please start      Vice Chairman Geithner    President Minehan   January 30-31, 2007 145 of 255     Thank you  A two-hander from President Moskow    Governor Kohn    President Yellen    Thank you    President Minehan    Thank you  I’m embarrassed about time planning here  These   comments have been extremely interesting, but I’m worried about flights and things of that sort    Everyone should feel free to give their full views  Be mindful, if you can, of time, and if we don’t   have enough time, we’ll have to think about how we might reconvene or otherwise extend the   discussion  Was there a comment?    There’s research at the St Louis Bank that says that the   FOMC forecasts are actually pretty good  Was there another two-hander?  President Poole?    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Intervention, President Moskow     President Fisher    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  Governor Kohn     Thank you  First Vice President Barron     Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you very much  It is a little after 100  Why don’t   we take a break for lunch?  If people could be flexible, we can start somewhere around 130,   maybe a few minutes before, depending on how efficiently lunch is served  If anyone has   concerns about flights or anything like that, could you please let me know during the break?  Mr   Vice Chairman     It should be somewhere between 230 and 300, if we take a   half an hour for lunch now, unless I hear concerns about flights and the like  It’s lunch time    Thank you     [Recess]     Let’s resume  Thank you  Let me start by saying that   we’ve had an enormous amount of discussion  If anyone is inclined to submit a memo to the   Committee or to the subcommittee elaborating on your views or responding to some things that   you’ve heard, please feel free  It will be very helpful to receive any information like that  Let’s   continue with our go-round  President Stern     Thank you  Governor Bies   January 30-31, 2007 187 of 255      Thank you  President Plosser     Thank you  Governor Warsh     Thank you  President Moskow     Thank you  Governor Kroszner     Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner     There is research on that by the St Louis Bank     Yes     Thank you  President Poole     Not to my knowledge     First, let me thank both the staff and all members  People   clearly took this assignment very seriously, and it has been extremely useful  I won’t try to   summarize  [Laughter]  Fortunately, we have a tape recorder  I would like to make a few brief   comments  I believe that we ought to increase our emphasis on the projections  I’ll talk a bit   about some of the parameters of that, but I believe that I owe an answer to President Fisher about   why  I don’t think the process is broken  I don’t think we have a serious problem  But I do   think we could do better  Specifically, to give some examples, I think, first, that our statement is   too influential in the sense that we argued today about a couple of phrases, a couple of words,   knowing that the markets would seize on them and that they would move markets  If we had   more-informative, more-complete descriptions of our views, the statement would become less of   an issue  Second, I don’t want Governor Kohn moving the markets  [Laughter]  I think that   public comments are often overinterpreted  I know in my own case they have been  [Laughter]    I recall the case in which a letter to a senator included the phrase “well-contained inflation   expectations” rather than “contained inflation expectations”  That was a letter drafted by the   staff, and I perhaps didn’t read it carefully enough  It was the subject of commentary in the   markets for some weeks after that  We have a bit of space in which to improve our   communication with the markets and the public  This way to do it would be fundamentally   incremental  I’m not proposing, and I don’t think that anyone is proposing, a radical change    We can build on something that has worked and that we understand how to do, and of course we   would approach it very cautiously  But I do think that this is, as President Yellen called it, low-  hanging fruit in the sense that it’s something we could use to increase our communication and   transparency in a fairly low risk way  Last spring there was a good bit of confusion in the   markets about how quickly we wanted to bring inflation down  The forecasts essentially   January 30-31, 2007 210 of 255    addressed that issue because they implicitly incorporate our policy preferences  So I think we   could improve our communication by increasing information about our outlook and our policy   preferences     Another issue is a bit hard to explain, but I will try  I think that our credibility is   enhanced if we can depersonalize it and make the ownership of our policy more the Committee’s   and the institution’s  It’s the credibility of the Federal Reserve that matters, not Ben Bernanke’s   credibility  I assure you that we are better off with the Federal Reserve’s credibility  Making the   credibility of policy part of a broader process, with more input and clearer Committee analysis,   does to some extent increase the sense in which the institution, rather than the Chairman or any   other individual, is responsible for the outcomes and the policies      Having said all of that, I don’t advocate any radical changes  I think we ought to   consider three or four additional projections depending on the schedule and other factors    Governor Bies mentioned fine-tuning  Perhaps the way I would look at it is that information that   we have about the outlook changes over time, and six months is a long time  Our views do   change within a period of three to four months, and I think it would be informative to let people   know that  I’m open, but I think we should have individual forecasts  The solution to the   problem of consistent assumptions is the one that President Lacker mentioned—to have people   make their unconditional forecast the same way a Blue Chip forecaster would do  That   essentially includes the forecast of what the Committee is going to do, which is not necessarily   the same for everyone but it is based on each person’s view about where they think the economy   and policy are going  That’s one approach  There are probably others, but I want to suggest that   as a possible solution     January 30-31, 2007 211 of 255     Many people have supported the narrative description  I think that’s important  I think   being more timely would be useful  I don’t quite follow the idea of putting the narrative in the   minutes  If we actually have this information, say, a week after the meeting, why would we want   to wait until three weeks?  It is more credible and more useful the sooner it comes out  The same   is true for the minutes  When the minutes were released after the following meeting, it was a   non-event  When they were brought out earlier, they became viewed as a very informative,   useful piece of information  So, like Governor Kroszner, I don’t think we should deform our   decisionmaking process or be overhasty, but if we can make such communication more timely   than the minutes, we should probably try to do that    I agree with the many people who said that we should include some sense of uncertainty    There are ways to do that, for example, including historical numbers on the forecast errors of   previous projections of the Greenbook, of the Blue Chip, or of somebody would give the public   some sense of what the historical record is and perhaps lead them not to overvalue the individual   forecasts  Again, I don’t think this is particularly risky      As I said, I hope we’ll approach this incrementally  Indeed, the history of the Federal   Reserve since 1994, when we first began to announce the federal funds rate target, has been one   of incremental change  This is a little unfair, but, President Fisher, you should go back and read   the discussion in the FOMC before the decision to begin releasing the federal funds rate target    There was a lot of catastrophizing about what was going to happen and why what we’re doing   now is the best possible approach, and so on  So I think this is really no more than a   continuation of twelve or thirteen years of progress in terms of information  The other reason   that this is not particularly risky, if it’s done carefully and slowly, is that we have a great deal of   international experience  Obviously, we’re not Norway, but we’ve seen what works across a   January 30-31, 2007 212 of 255    whole variety of central banks, and financial markets have become more accustomed to this kind   of information being released    There are some important governance issues  Whether we have an approval process or a   consultative process, I think we could get a forecast, together with some description, within a   reasonable period—something on the order of a week or less after the meeting  Let me make just   a suggestion along those lines  If we were to tie projections to two-day meetings and if we were   to have, as we do now, projections submitted before the meeting, along with perhaps a paragraph   of description about the major elements of the forecast and the major risks, I think the staff and I   could present on the second day a draft of what we took both from the first day’s discussion and   from the submissions of the projections  At that point, we could get feedback, or there would be   opportunities for people to change their forecasts or their views based on the discussions at the   meeting  We’d have to allow for diversity and dissent, and I think that’s perfectly fine  We’ve   done that in many contexts, and I think we should continue to do that  I would just conclude by   saying that many people have mentioned the importance of dry runs and a slow and careful   process, and I think it would be very hard to disagree with that  We’ve done that in other cases,   and I think we should do that here    So, to summarize, I think there is some basis for trying to increase our use of the   projections  It would be consistent with our previous incremental movements toward greater   transparency  It would provide more information and reduce the sensitivity of the markets to   other types of communication, such as the statements and public comments  But we have heard   an awful lot of interesting viewpoints today, and I don’t envy the subcommittee, which will have   to go through all of this and come up with a set of proposals  Are there any further comments?    President Minehan   January 30-31, 2007 213 of 255      I think it’s more informative to combine numerical   estimates with a qualitative description     Well, that’s not a reason not to do this  I think that you   could reproduce the information in the minutes; there would be further amplification and   discussion in the minutes  I am just thinking out loud here  The description I have in mind   would be a page or two, nothing substantial  The minutes would be an opportunity to provide   more information and show more of the diversity of views     There’s also a question of how it relates to the statement    That’s absolutely right  Are there other comments?  President Fisher   January 30-31, 2007 214 of 255      Thank you  The next meeting will be a two-day meeting,   March 20 and 21  Oh, David Stockton     Okay—updates of forecasts are to be sent in by Friday    Thank you very much  The meeting is adjourned     END OF MEETING   January 30-31, 2007 215 of 255     "
8096,2007-03-20,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  Let me be the first to welcome   Dennis Lockhart sitting in for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  We’ll start with Bill Dudley    Thank you  Are there questions for Bill either about the   outlook or the housekeeping matter?  President Fisher    President Minehan    President Geithner    Yes    President Lacker    President Moskow   March 20-21, 2007 12 of 196     President Pianalto    I had been puzzled about the quantitative relationship   between the subprime problems and the stock market  I think that the actual money at risk is on   the order of $50 billion from defaults on subprimes, which is very small compared with the   capitalization of the stock market  It looks as though a lot of the problem is coming from bad   underwriting as opposed to some fundamentals in the economy  So I guess I’m a bit puzzled   about whether it’s a signal about fundamentals or how it’s linked to the stock market    Does anyone have any questions about the call procedure?    Are there any other questions?  Then we need a vote to ratify domestic operations    Without objection  Thank you  It’s time for the economic   situation  Dave Stockton    Thank you very much  Are there questions?    President Poole    President Stern     President Fisher    Are there other questions?  If not, we are ready for the   economic go-round  President Yellen    Thank you  President Moskow    Thank you  President Plosser     Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you  President Minehan, could you just say a word   about your outreach on the mortgage problems?    Well, we here in Washington expect to have to answer a   few questions about the subprime situation, and we would be very interested in anyone’s   March 20-21, 2007 48 of 196    experience  If any other Reserve Bank is involved or has any plans, we’d be interested to hear   about them    They have to check the e-mail for anthrax here [Laughter]    On that note, why don’t we take fifteen minutes for coffee   and come back around 440 or a little after  The coffee is in the anteroom   [Coffee break]    If we could reconvene—I see a two-hander from Governor   Kroszner    President Lockhart    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh      Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Thank you very much for the comments  I’m   going to offer, as I always do, a brief summary and invite any comments and corrections, and then   I’d like to add a few comments of my own  Most participants today agree that growth looks as   though it’s going to be slower, but there is some diversity of opinion about how persistent the   slowdown would be  Many people have marked down growth expectations for the remainder of the   year, and there was a general sense that the uncertainty about growth prospects and downside risk   have increased  However, some people saw the current slowdown as only a soft patch that would   be reversed soon  Housing remains weak, and some participants noted the risk that problems in   mortgage and credit markets and increased foreclosure rates might contribute to further weakness    However, others felt that the housing situation has not changed materially since the last meeting    The slowdown in capital investment drew more concern, in part because it has proved difficult to   explain  An inventory correction continues, but automobile inventories have been brought into line    Some factors that will support growth include a booming global economy and stronger government   spending at both the federal and the state and local levels  The labor market continues to be tight,   March 20-21, 2007 71 of 196    with some noting increases in wages  Developments in the labor, housing, and credit markets will   be important in determining the future course of consumption   Several participants pointed to potential financial risks, including possible knock-on effects   of the subprime mortgage problems and the possibility of the drying up of currently abundant   liquidity and financial markets  Corporate earnings are also likely to slow  If these risks   materialize, they could add to downside pressures on output  However, some thought that financial   conditions will remain supportive  Some, but not all, think that inflation will continue to moderate,   albeit very slowly  There is general disappointment with recent inflation readings, and some were   skeptical that any meaningful progress against inflation is being made  In particular, resource   utilization pressures, particularly tight labor markets, pose a longer-term inflation threat  Import   prices and slower productivity growth also add to inflation risk  The views of most participants   were that upside inflation risks still outweigh downside risks to output, that uncertainty has   increased, and that the tails of the distribution have become fatter   Are there comments?  If not, let me just add a few thoughts  It’s very difficult to speak   last—all the good ideas have already been presented  So I’ll say just a few things   I think the growth outlook is slightly worse  The housing market is, of course, central to   near-term developments  The central scenario that housing will stabilize sometime during the   middle of the year remains intact, but there have been a few negative innovations  We’ve noted the   subprime issues and the possibility of foreclosures, reduced confidence, and tightened credit terms,   and I’ve also noted that reports from builders about the spring selling season have not been   particularly upbeat, in general  At the same time, we continue to see rough stability in sales, starts,   and permits  The effects of the decline in subprime lending may have already been mostly seen,   since that has slowed from last fall  Mortgage rates, of course, remain quite low, and the labor   March 20-21, 2007 72 of 196    market is a key determinant of housing demand and of mortgage delinquencies, particularly cross-  sectionally  Across the country, there’s a very close correlation between foreclosure rates and state   unemployment rates  So long as the labor market remains strong, I would think that the general   health of the housing market would be improving  The housing market, I think, will follow the   same scenario, but there are a few negative innovations   There was a lot of discussion about capital investments, and I share the puzzlement about   why that’s happening  Like Governor Mishkin, I am concerned that it might signal something about   productivity  Another possibility in the current environment goes back to my PhD thesis on the   effects of uncertainty on investment, which found that greater uncertainty can make people delay   their commitments  In our last meeting, we discussed the possible upside risk to consumption  I   think that risk is much diminished now  Our retail sales have been quite flat, and the strong growth   of consumption in the first quarter is almost entirely due to the December blip, which will carry   through to the quarterly arithmetic  But consumption is very likely to slow  Gas prices are another   reason that consumption is likely to slow  The labor market, again, remains strong  I agree with the   Greenbook that there is some likelihood of softening going forward  In particular, I think Governor   Kohn mentioned that the slowing productivity growth we’re seeing could be consistent with some   labor hoarding in this late stage of the cycle   Again, I’ve marked down my growth expectations only a bit, but if we were handicapping   recessions, I’m afraid that risk has probably gone up a bit  I would cite at least three reasons  First,   there seems to be a pretty good chance that potential output growth is lower than in the past; and   almost by definition, if growth is lower, then the chance of negative quarters is greater  Second, the   Greenbook has a 60 basis point increase in unemployment occurring stably over the next two years    If that happens, it will be the first time it has ever happened  [Laughter]  Generally speaking,   March 20-21, 2007 73 of 196    increases in unemployment tend either not to occur or to be bigger than 60 basis points  Finally,   we’ve discussed the financial market sensitivities, which are having an effect, so that changes in the   outlook could have pretty substantial feedback effects onto the economy through the stock market,   other financial markets, and credit markets  So I think, as President Fisher does, that the tail in that   direction is unfortunately somewhat fatter   Likewise with inflation, the news was disappointing  We knew that there would be—and   we have seen—month-to-month volatility  It is difficult, as President Pianalto noted, to make a firm   conclusion based on the recent data about whether or not inflation is moderating  I would just note   that rents and owners’ equivalent rent are still pretty important here  They have not yet slowed   much, which may have to do with the nature of the uncertainties about the housing market  That   possibility will be helpful going forward  At an earlier meeting I indicated that medical costs were a   risk; and they have, indeed, proved to be a risk   Speaking about inflation makes me reflect on the difficulties of measuring aggregate supply   in general  As we think about the economy going forward, we face two countervailing possibilities    One, which I and several others have already mentioned, is that potential output growth may well be   lower than many outsiders and maybe even the Greenbook think  Obviously that will make it   difficult to get economic slack and will make this situation much more challenging  At the same   time, the lack of wage acceleration at least raises the possibility that the NAIRU might be somewhat   lower than 5 percent, which would be helpful in the other direction  With respect to inflation, again,   as I said, I’m disappointed by the recent numbers  I don’t get a sense from business people or from   surveys and so on that the general public’s worry about inflation has increased very much, except   insofar as they perceive that inflation is constraining the Fed from acting  So, again, I don’t think   March 20-21, 2007 74 of 196    we’ve seen an adverse breakout by any means, but obviously we’re going to have to remain very   vigilant and make sure that we maintain our credibility on the inflation front   As the last item, I would like Vincent to distribute table 1  We made a couple of changes in   the description of the economy  He can make a few comments, and then everyone will have an   opportunity to look at it overnight, and we can discuss the communication issues tomorrow    Thank you  I hope you’ll join me now in bidding farewell to   Governor Bies  We will reconvene tomorrow at 900 am                                                    2 The table to which Mr Reinhart refers is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   March 20-21, 2007 75 of 196    [Meeting recessed]   March 20-21, 2007 76 of 196    March 21, 2007—Morning Session    Vincent    Thank you  Are there questions for Vincent?  Governor   Kohn   March 20-21, 2007 79 of 196     President Poole     Are there other questions?  If not, we’re ready for our   policy go-round  President Poole    Thank you  President Hoenig    Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you  President Stern    President Yellen     Thank you  President Moskow   March 20-21, 2007 90 of 196     Thank you  President Poole    President Lacker    President Lockhart   March 20-21, 2007 92 of 196     Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Vice Chairman    President Minehan    Let me just ask a question  The intention of this was not to   comment on recent market volatility  The intention was to say that interest rates are low, stock   prices are pretty strong, and liquidity is good, and that is going to support growth  Would changing   it to, say, “aided by supportive financial conditions” or something like that, be of any help?    President Fisher    President Poole    Okay  I get a general sense of agreement around the table,   unless someone wants to speak strongly in favor of financial conditions  President Stern    That was our objective, and we’re trying to find short ways to   say it  Anyone else?  President Hoenig    President Moskow   March 20-21, 2007 100 of 196     The difference is that the first sentence last time was a positive   sentence  The first sentence this time is a negative sentence    “Overall, however”  [Laughter]    All right  Any other two-handed interventions?  Governor   Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    President Hoenig    Governor Kroszner    Governor Kohn has suggested “supported by gains in income   and the anticipated gradual waning in the correction of the housing market”    Vice Chairman   March 20-21, 2007 104 of 196     An additional advantage  [Laughter]    President Lacker    Thank you  Has everyone spoken?  Well  [Laughter]  Let me   try to find a consensus here  First, I agree with the sentiment around the table  I recommend no   action today  We should continue to emphasize inflation risk—I think there’s a strong feeling that it   remains the greater risk  There is acknowledgement that uncertainty and risk have increased on   both sides of the dual mandate, but the balance of risks does not seem to have changed very much    Supporting the idea of keeping the rate where it is is that, as best we can tell, the level of the rate   March 20-21, 2007 105 of 196    currently seems about right to foster our objectives  Also as people have noted, by standing pat, we   have considerable ability to tighten de facto as market expectations move toward our actual revealed   behavior  So I would counsel patience on the rate and maintain the rate at its current level today   Let me take a stab at the statement  I think we all agree on section 1  [Laughter]  On   section 3, let me note the suggestion of, I think it was President Stern  I’m sympathetic  I didn’t   hear much support, however, and again, it’s a change  So I would recommend that we stay with the   current section 3     On section 4, first a small point  I think the mild preference was for “predominant” over   “principal” as consistent with my testimony  To the extent that we’re trying to lean against easing   of expectations, if “predominant” is slightly stronger, it would be beneficial in that respect  So let   me propose that change  I recognize the risk that the second sentence in section 4 has the potential   to mislead the market a bit  My concern is that the second sentence that we have been using is   simply not literally true anymore  The implication is that we are certain that the next move is going   to be an increase, and it’s only a matter of when and how much  We have been trying for some time   to get out of that language and to get to something that is more descriptive  The benefits of the   second sentence are, first, that it does create more flexibility and, second, that it refers only to things   on the right-hand side of the Taylor rule—that is, inflation and output—and doesn’t make a   statement about future policy actions, which most people seem to prefer avoiding whenever   possible  Again, although it will be viewed as a small step toward balance or flexibility, we are   fairly strong in our statement of inflation risk  In particular, we’ve introduced here not just that we   think there are inflation risks but that our specific concern is that inflation will not moderate, which   is a different and somewhat stronger statement than we have had  I acknowledge that there may be   some market rally based on this, but with President Poole, I think that the data will dominate as we   March 20-21, 2007 106 of 196    go forward  Indeed, the endogeneity of interest rates and their stabilizing effects are very important   assets that we have in policy   With respect to the description in section 2, the intention was, given that the first sentence is   relatively negative, to give some modest rationale for our thinking that the economy seems likely to   continue expanding  Let me try one more suggestion  Perhaps we can find a solution  One reason   that a quick summary is difficult is that the story for recovery is, in fact, fairly complicated  It   involves certainly the ending of the housing correction but also assumptions of inventory correction,   of investment coming back at a moderate pace, and of a number of other things  The notion here   was to look at more fundamental factors that would be underlying the assumption of growth, such   as income, which has grown rapidly, and supportive financial conditions  But I hear the concerns    The Greenbook forecast calls for moderate growth in essentially all of the components except for   housing  In particular, it expects consumption to grow more than 2 percent; investment, more than   2 percent; support from government spending and net exports; and so on  So something along the   lines of “supported by growth in nonhousing components of final demand” might be a descriptive   way of saying that we think that, although housing will be a drag, the other components of the   economy will support moderate growth  That’s a suggestion      The last phrase would be “supported by growth in nonhousing   components of final demand”    Yes, Governor Mishkin    President Poole?    Okay  I think that’s where we’re heading  Vince    That is similar to what Governor Kohn suggested  I got the   sense at the time that it wasn’t well received  All right, I think we’re not going to come to a   conclusion  So I think we need to accept President Minehan’s suggestion  Was there other   comment?  Starting with “nevertheless” might be better  “Nevertheless, the economy seems likely   to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters”  Okay?  President Plosser   March 20-21, 2007 108 of 196     Are there others who would like to make that change?   SEVERAL  I support that     OTHERS  No, I—  [Laughter]     Vice Chairman    Let me ask your indulgence on leaving it the way it is this   time and thinking about it more carefully for the next meeting  Are there any other comments?    Should I read it?  [Laughter]    You’ll take a stab?  All right    Thank you  Michelle, could you work with Debbie to get a   printed version of the statement that we’ll circulate after the break so everybody can at least   familiarize themselves with what we’re saying here today?  [Laughter]  All right  Why don’t we   take a coffee break for fifteen minutes?  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we recommence  Governor Kohn    Thank you  I’d like to make a couple of prefatory remarks    Some of the issues here are political in nature, so I’d like you to know that I have consulted a bit   with the Congress  I did not go to negotiate, I went to inform, and therefore I don’t have any   commitments to bring to you  But I was generally pretty encouraged by my discussions  I had   the sense that—and this is a very important caveat—so long as our commitment to the dual   mandate remains strong both in word and in deed, we will get a fair hearing if we decide to go   forward  I also have a very strong impression that the risk of going into directions that we don’t   want in terms of opening up the Federal Reserve Act and so on is quite low and can be managed    So we should think about this today on its merits  If we decide to go forward, we’ll have to   develop a strategy; but I don’t think that there are immediate barriers from the political side to   prevent us from considering this   March 20-21, 2007 111 of 196    That being said, I just want to say also that we have not decided that we are going to   agree on an objective  There are various possibilities  We could agree on an objective  We   could agree to agree but to do it in a staged and gradual way  Or we could simply not agree on   an objective  Even so, I think that the discussion today would be quite helpful for our internal   discussions because I’m not the only one who feels that a certain amount of disagreement exists   around the table that may be associated with views on what inflation should be and how we   should measure it  Again, we have not made any decisions, and I hope today will give us some   more insight about how much consensus we have   Just a word on the projections  As was noted, I think that a minutes-style process could   be a useful way to make sure that everybody has seen the document  But I want just to make   clear that, if we do these projections, twice a year the projections, the commentary, and so forth   will have to appear in the Monetary Policy Report to the President, which is about two weeks   after the meeting  Therefore, we will have to work toward ensuring that we can do this in about   a two-week period, or a little less than the usual period for the minutes  I just want to make that   clear   Finally, I think we’re in pretty good shape on time, but we’re responding to several   requests  We are going to try very, very hard to be finished by 300 pm, so I hope everyone   will keep that in mind as we go through the discussion  The discussion is open for comments on   the questions that the Committee raised  President Poole    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker   March 20-21, 2007 116 of 196     Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you    Yes  President Lacker    Sure    President Hoenig    Thank you very much  President Plosser    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you  President Lockhart   March 20-21, 2007 153 of 196     Thank you very much  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Poole has a comment    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  President Moskow    Yes    Thank you very much  Governor Kroszner      Thank you  Governor Mishkin, you had a two-hander?   March 20-21, 2007 170 of 196     Initially they began with below 2 percent and they clarified   below, but not too far below; then that created at least a sense of a floor    President Lacker    Vice Chairman, you have the floor absolutely  [Laughter]    Certainly  Thank you very much  Let me thank the   Committee for yet another very thoughtful and helpful discussion  I appreciate the time you’ve   spent preparing for this  Thanks also to the staff  I thought the background materials were   excellent  I’m not going to say much  I’m just going to make a couple of comments  If we do   adopt an objective, it needs to be consistent with the dual mandate  That’s obvious and means a   couple of things  One is that the long-run inflation rate would have to take into account, among   other things, the zero bound  I think that is an issue  I would not be comfortable with a range that   involves having the inflation rate, say, below 1 percent a significant amount of the time,   stochastically speaking  So I think that’s a consideration  Second, because we have a dual mandate   and because it’s an implication of optimal monetary policy, the horizon has to be quite flexible  Is   that meaningless?  I don’t think so  In particular, if we begin to use the projections more actively,   March 20-21, 2007 177 of 196    the projections would give a good bit of guidance to the public about the time it takes to get back to   the target range  In particular, we could also, through our communications, discuss how the   adjustment period depends on initial conditions, the state of the economy, and so on   I’m flexible on the choice of index  I heard a lot of interesting discussion today  I am   somewhat attracted to the headline CPI  I do think that people understand it more  It appears in   labor contracts, for example, and in other wage discussions  It obviously appears in the TIPS and   other places  So I think it’s worth considering  One possibility, choosing a headline CPI around   2 percent, would be reasonably consistent with a 1 to 2 percent core PCE in a sense because of the   measurement difference  But that’s an open question  I think it remains to be discussed  We have a   lot to digest here, and we’re going to be thinking very hard about all the comments we heard today    The subcommittee I know will try to come up with some  Don, I hope by tomorrow you’ll have a   few—[Laughter]  Again this has been very useful    I’d like to just make one comment on the projections, which again I think are potentially   very valuable  This is about the assumption of appropriate monetary policy  The way that’s   interpreted now is that each person chooses his or her own path for appropriate monetary policy,   and I think that sometimes leads to somewhat confusing outcomes  If you have someone, for   example, who is pessimistic about where inflation will actually go but who has a low inflation target   and, therefore, has an appropriate monetary policy that’s much more aggressive than everyone else,   he or she will report a good inflation outcome, and the press will report an optimistic Fed as far as   where inflation is going to go  I would just like to put that out for consideration, since we’re going   to do several dry runs  By the way, I don’t anticipate that we will be doing this live for the July   Monetary Policy Report  This will take a while, so don’t worry about that  One alternative, which I   believe I mentioned before, would be for us to make an unconditional forecast, by which I mean   March 20-21, 2007 178 of 196    that we would essentially be saying, “Well, what do we think the Committee is going to do?” and   conditional on that, what we would expect the economy to deliver  That, I think, would probably be   easier for the public to understand than the way we do it now, with each person having his or her   own conditioning policy assumptions  But I leave that for further discussion and for the staff also to   think about     If there are no other comments, again, thank you  We will have lunch in the anteroom, and   the next meeting will be May 9  We are adjourned   END OF MEETING   March 20-21, 2007 179 of 196     "
8118,2007-05-09,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  We start with the Desk   operations, Bill    Okay  Questions?  President Fisher      Are there other questions?  We need a vote to ratify   domestic open operations    Passed without objection  We also need a vote on the swap   lines    We’ve discussed this in the past  The swap lines serve   partly a diplomatic function, and they have some relevance to potential financial crises, if they’re   needed for dollar liquidity either in Canada or in Mexico  However, I will bring these up with   Secretary Paulson at some point just to make sure that the Treasury is aware of what we’re   doing—whether we need to expand them or reduce them  So we’ve had a motion without   objection  Okay, then the swap lines are approved  Let’s turn now to the economic situation    Dave?    Thank you  Are there questions?  President Moskow   May 9, 2007 12 of 130     Okay  President Poole   May 9, 2007 14 of 130     President Moskow, a two-handed intervention    President Stern    We have an intervention from President Minehan    Oh, I’m sorry  Let me go then to President Plosser    President Minehan    Are there other questions?  We had, as you know, a trial run in   which participants submitted some projections  In the interest of illuminating the conversation that   we will have in a moment, I thought I’d ask Vincent just to say a few words about those projections     Thank you, Vincent  I have penciled in some time after the   policy decision for discussion and comments about the process and for the head of the   subcommittee to talk a little about what we will be doing in our communication discussions going   forward  So in the interest of time, I would ask people who have questions for Vincent to try to   restrict them primarily to the projections themselves and to the economic outlook, if that is okay    Does anyone have any questions for Vincent?  If not, we can begin our go-round  President Yellen    Thank you  President Moskow    Thank you  President Fisher     Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Minehan    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you for the arithmetic  [Laughter]    President Lockhart     Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  It is 1030  Why don’t we take a twenty-  minute coffee break and adjourn until about 1050  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Okay  Let’s reconvene  President Minehan has a two-  hander    Thank you  Governor Kohn    They’re always more uncertain than usual  [Laughter]    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner        Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Let me try to summarize the discussion around   the table and take any comments on the summary, and then I would like to add just a few thoughts    May 9, 2007 69 of 130    Broadly speaking, the outlook of most participants has not substantially changed since March    Housing remains weak, and it is the greatest source of downside risk  Whether the demand for   housing has stabilized remains difficult to judge, in part because of subprime issues  It is also   unclear whether builders will seek to return inventories to historical levels, and if so, at what rate    There is yet no indication of significant spillover from housing to other sectors, although that   remains a risk  The downside risks to investment have moderated since the last meeting, although   investment seems unlikely to be a strong driver of growth  The inventory cycle is now well   advanced, and production is strengthening  Consumption growth seems likely to moderate,   reflecting factors such as weakness in house prices and high energy prices  However, the labor   market remains strong, particularly in the market for highly skilled workers  Incomes generated by   the labor market, together with gains in the stock market and generally accommodative financial   conditions, should provide some support for consumption going forward  Financial markets are   priced for perfection, which implies some risks on that score  Foreign economies remain strong and   should be a source of support, although some are undertaking monetary tightening  Overall, the   economy is in a soft patch and will likely grow below trend for a while  Growth should return to   potential later this year or in 2008, depending on the evolution of the housing market  The rate of   potential growth remains hard to pin down  Several participants seem a bit more optimistic than the   Greenbook on potential growth and the NAIRU, although there are risks   Inflation has improved a bit, and most see continued but very slow moderation  However,   there are upside risks to inflation, including compensation, the dollar, energy prices, and a slowing   in productivity  Moreover, a rise in inflation from current levels would be costly, particularly if it   involved unhinging inflation expectations  Vigilance on inflation must, therefore, be maintained    Overall the risks and uncertainties seem a bit less pronounced than at the last meeting, and   May 9, 2007 70 of 130    participants seemed relatively comfortable with the outlook  Although there are some potentially   significant downside risks to output, arising particularly from the housing sector and the possible   spillover to consumption, the group still appears to view a failure of inflation to moderate as   expected to be the predominant risk to longer-term stability  Are there any comments or questions?    Hearing none, I will just add a few points  First, following President Yellen, I think that the   tension between slow growth and a strong labor market remains central to understanding what’s   going on  Okun’s law is supposed to work better than this  [Laughter]  I looked at recent history    Over the past twenty years or so, there has been no exact parallel to what we are seeing now  There   was a jobless recovery in ’91-’93 in which unemployment remained high even though growth was   picking up, and we had a midcycle slowdown in ’95 and ’96, which was relatively short and not   very severe, in which the unemployment rate got temporarily ahead of growth  So there have been   some deviations  Interestingly, after the 2001 recession, despite lots of talk about jobless recoveries,   Okun’s law worked pretty well  So we are in an unusual situation—instead of a jobless recovery,   we have growthless job growth  [Laughter]   Interpreting this correctly is very important  The staff forecast essentially assumes that   Okun’s law will revert to historical tendency  I think that assumption is reasonable, particularly   since the staff is not exceptionally optimistic about potential growth and, therefore, that particular   source of error is moderated  That would suggest that labor hoarding is probably a good part of   what is happening here  If there is one area in which labor hoarding appears to be significant, it   would be construction, as President Yellen mentioned  I asked the staff to do a simple study of this   relationship, to which Dave Stockton referred  Andrew Figura and Adam Looney of the Board’s   staff performed a regression analysis in which they regressed all construction employment against   all investment in structures quarterly with lags going back to 1985  The reason to look at all   May 9, 2007 71 of 130    construction in terms of both employment and production is that there is a lot of substitutability   between those two categories  That regression approach should also account for unmeasured labor,   including undocumented workers and the like  In this analysis they found that employment is   roughly proportional to construction activity, but with substantial lags, which again is somewhat   surprising  Indeed, the model fits well through the fourth quarter of ’06 but then begins to   underpredict significantly in the first quarter of ’07  If this model is correct, then given what is   already in the pipeline in terms of reduced construction activity and then going on with the forecast   in the Greenbook, we should begin to see fairly significant declines in construction employment on   the order of 30,000 per month over the next year, which would be sufficient in itself, with all else   being equal, to add 02 to 03 to the unemployment rate  So if labor hoarding explains the failure of   Okun’s law, then we may soon see some gradual rise in the unemployment rate, which would also   be consistent with the view that the staff has taken that a good bit of the slowdown in productivity is   cyclical   It is actually fairly difficult to calculate the contribution of the construction sector to   productivity because it involves not just construction workers but also upstream production of   various kinds  But one estimate, which comes from discussions with the Council of Economic   Advisers, had the implication of employment hoarding in construction being about ½ percentage   point on productivity growth  We will see how that develops  Even though I believe, as does the   staff, that we will see some softening in the labor market, I should say that the evidence is still quite   tentative  We saw a bit of weakness in the last labor report, but unemployment insurance claims   remain low, and we do not really see a significant indication   The other major issue is the housing market  Again, as a number of people pointed out, this   is an inventory-cycle problem  The two main determinants of an inventory cycle are (1) what the   May 9, 2007 72 of 130    level of final demand is and (2) how quickly you move to bring inventories back to normal  There   does seem to have been some step-down in final demand over the past few months  Assuming that   homebuilders would like to get not all the way to but significantly toward their last ten years’   inventories by the end of 2008 implies fairly weak construction, not only in the second quarter but   going into the third quarter as well  Only in the fourth quarter will we see a relatively minor   subtraction from GDP  That’s also relatively speculative, but residential construction does seem   fairly likely to me to be more of a drag than we previously thought and to continue to be a problem   into the third quarter   There will also be a slowdown in consumption  We have been having rates near 4 percent,   which is certainly not sustainable  We already see indications that consumption may be closer to 2   percent in the second quarter  I think the house-price effects are going to show up  Gasoline prices   will have an effect  The labor market is strong, but it is going to slow a bit  So it looks to me as   though underlying growth is roughly 2 percent and will be so for a couple of quarters to come    Notice in the thinking about the underlying case that there has been quite an asynchronicity between   private domestic final demand and production lately  For example, for the second quarter we expect   to see weaker private domestic final demand but probably a stronger GDP number because of   rebounds in net exports and the like  But we should look past that—those are just quarter-to-quarter   variations—and observe that growth is moderate, an observation that is supported by the sense that   industrial production and manufacturing seem to be picking up  To summarize, I think that the   notion of moderate growth with some uncertainty and with return toward potential later in the year   or early next year is still probably about the right forecast   On inflation, there’s the famous stock market prediction that prices will fluctuate  That   seems to be true also for inflation  I mentioned at the last meeting that the monthly standard   May 9, 2007 73 of 130    deviation in inflation numbers is about 008, and so between 01 and 03 there is not necessarily a   whole lot of information  We have a few pieces of good news  I think vacancy rates are rising for   both apartments and single-family homes  At some point we will begin to see better progress on   owners’ equivalent rent and shelter costs  Also, the quarterly average of medical cost increases was   much more moderate than in the first two months, which suggests that maybe this risk is not as   serious as it may have looked  However, as many people pointed out, there are a number of   negatives, including the dollar, energy, food prices, commodity prices, and most importantly, the   labor market  The compensation data remain quite mixed—in particular, the ECI, which was a very   soft headline number  The 11 percent quarterly wage and salary number, or 36 percent for twelve   months, is now more or less consistent with what we’re seeing in average hourly earnings  If   productivity falls below 2 percent, then we are beginning to get to a range in which unit labor costs   will be putting pressure on inflation  So I am quite comfortable with the view expressed around the   table that, although inflation looks to be stabilizing and perhaps falling slowly, there are significant   risks to inflation and we should take those very seriously   Very much a side point—I did have some interesting discussions with the staff about the   role of the stock market in the forecast  This is not the staff’s fault, but there is a sort of tension in   how the stock market is treated  On the one hand, the stock market is assumed to grow at 6½   percent from the current level  On the other hand, the forecast has profit growth going essentially to   zero by the third quarter but interest rates coming up  Those two things are a little hard to reconcile    The difficult problem is which way you should go to reconcile it  On the one hand, it could be that   the forecast is right, and therefore the stock market will in fact be weaker; that will have   implications for stability, for consumption, and so on  On the other hand, perhaps we should be   taking information from the stock market in making our forecast  So it is a very difficult problem,   May 9, 2007 74 of 130    and I just wanted to point out the tension that we will have to see resolved over the next few   quarters  One partial resolution is that, as has been noted, the stock market and the economy as a   whole can be decoupled to some extent because of overseas profits  This is an interesting example   of how financial globalization is creating stability for domestic consumption—you know,   decoupling domestic consumption from domestic production  Again, we had a very good   discussion with the staff about this issue, and I think it is just something we will need to think about   going forward   In summary, in the last meeting we felt that uncertainty had risen  There has been perhaps a   slight moderation of those concerns at this point—a little less inflation risk, a little less growth risk    Nevertheless, the balance of risks with inflation being the greater still seems to me to be a   reasonable approach  Let me now turn to Vincent to begin the policy go-round     Thank you  Are there questions for Vincent?  If not, we can   begin the policy go-round    Thank you  President Poole’s comments remind me that I did   have a question, Vincent  It is, What do you think is the effect of the term “on balance” in the   inflation paragraph?    Well, let’s just say core inflation, so it wouldn’t be every   inflation measure   May 9, 2007 79 of 130     I agree with that last statement      Certainly      Since we are bringing these suggestions out early, one thing   that you could do in section 2, the second sentence, is simply make an assertion about moderate   growth  One could say, “Overall, however, recent indicators suggest that the economy seems likely   to expand   ,” suggesting that the news recently has been somewhat more positive  That is just a   thought  Let’s go to President Stern    Governor Kohn    Intervention, President Fisher?    Why don’t you go ahead   May 9, 2007 82 of 130     Noted  Thank you    Vice Chairman Geithner    I would like to interject  We do have to think about the time-  series nature of the statement, and I am concerned, given that our last inflation reading was very   good and reduced some of the anxiety that we were feeling in the last meeting, that there will be a   lot of attempts to interpret what we meant by uncertainty  At this point, are we feeling that there is   an increase in uncertainty and that we have lost confidence in this projection?  I think that we have   to think very seriously, not just about the sentence, which is very reasonable on its face, but also   about what extent the change from the last statement will be overinterpreted    Yes    The core inflation sentence?  Which one?    Are there any interventions?  If not, President Minehan    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Kohn    President Poole    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lacker    I think your point about joint causality, joint endogeneity, of   utilization and inflation is a good one  I have tried to make that point in testimony when I talk about   aggregate demand being strong and having effects both on inflation and on resource utilization  We   can think about this  It is a little hard to capture complex models in these statements, but it is   certainly a point well taken  President Yellen     Thank you  President Moskow    Thank you    President Minehan    President Lockhart    Governor Warsh    I think you mean the brake  [Laughter]  Anyway, thank   you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you, and thank you for all the comments  On the   action, I think we’re clear that we want to stay where we are  I just want to make the observation   that for almost a year now we have taken a very steady approach, not only in keeping policy at a   given level but in terms of our rhetoric and in terms of our confidence in moderate growth and a   slow moderation of inflation  During the period, the markets and the general view have gone up   and gone down, and we have maintained a pretty even keel  That increases confidence in the   institution, and unless we have a reason to change our view, we should continue to stay on a   steady path   On the statement, let me start with section 4, which I recommend we not change  The   response last time was a little noisier than I expected, although I did expect some response  We   tried to do a number of things at once  We wanted to retain a balance of risks that emphasized   inflation risks, but we also wanted to get away from forward-directing language  We wanted to   get away from what I think was an inaccurate suggestion that the next move was certainly going   to be up  In some circumstances, for example, we can effectively tighten by simply staying   where we are  We also wanted to convey that, given the uncertainty we were experiencing, some   more flexibility was needed  So it was a very complicated change to make  I’m not sure what   else we could have done  In any case, I think we have the market in sync with our views, and   therefore I would be very reluctant to go through that again to change the assessment of risk  So   I’m going to demonstrate a very conservative perspective today, which probably won’t surprise   you   May 9, 2007 102 of 130    On the rationale, I think I’m okay with the second section as it stands  If you’d note the   parallel to March, the first sentence essentially indicated that we recognized what was going on   in the economy; nevertheless, we expected, based on longer-term considerations and on our   thinking about the broad sweep of developments in the economy, moderate growth going   forward  This does the same thing  We acknowledge what’s going on  We saw slower growth    We see the housing sector  We’re not blind to current economic developments  Nevertheless,   we have good fundamental reasons to think that growth will be moderate  I wouldn’t necessarily   reject my own suggestion to put in something about recent indicators, but putting that in does   create a transitory kind of sense that we’re looking only at the last few numbers  I think it’s good   to project the sense that we have a long view and that we are comfortable with our long view and   are staying with it   I’ve been trying to decide what to do about “on balance”  A couple of thoughts  My   inclination after I listened to the conversation—and I would be happy to take a poll or   whatever—is to strike it on the following grounds  We are moving from a statement that said   “recent readings on core inflation” to one that says simply “core inflation”   The implication   there seems to me to be that we’re not referring now to the last couple of months but really to a   broader measure of core inflation  So, again, in a conservative spirit, to avoid adding more   language, I have a mild preference for dropping the phrase, but I’m open to comment on that   With respect to the ongoing discussion about the implications of our language for an   inflation target, we are going to have to address that  In a moment I will ask Governor Kohn to   talk a bit about communications  We will have a chance in our next meeting to talk about the   statement  I hope that in talking about the statement we can address issues such as how much   detail we should include, how often we should change, and how we should express the balance   May 9, 2007 103 of 130    of risks  Obviously, we won’t be able to nail all of this down, but we will have some opportunity   to try to come to a broader view about what the statement’s role would be in our larger   communication strategy  That’s another reason to be slightly conservative at this point  But   thinking ahead, President Stern’s suggestion about the sentence “Inflation pressures seem likely   to moderate over time, but considerable uncertainty surrounds that judgment” might be a place to   go at some point  We might want to change the derivative, and instead of talking about the level,   we could say that we are still expecting improvement, but that there is a lot of uncertainty about   it  That sort of shifts it from level to direction  That might be a solution, if we come to a point at   which we are at 2 percent or just below 2 percent  But I just raise that as a possibility     So in summary, my recommendation is no action and alternative B as written, striking the   phrase “on balance”  Are there any comments in particular on the phrase “on balance”?    President Lacker?      Yes, my proposal    We’ve given up on English and have now gone to sign   language  [Laughter]      Let’s have a vote   May 9, 2007 104 of 130     Thank you  Let’s just take a moment to update the   communications situation and hear, very briefly, any comments on the dry run  But let me turn it   over to Governor Kohn for some comments    Thank you  Are there questions for Don or any comments?    President Plosser    Governor Mishkin    Vice Chairman    Right    President Minehan    President Moskow    Good point  Remind us when you can update your   projections?     Fine  So you have, I guess, the rest of the day to update   your projections if you like  [Laughter]  Governor Kroszner    I just want to say that this exercise is already a success in   terms of the kinds of questions it’s making us confront  So I appreciate that everyone is taking   this very seriously  We had very good, detailed responses from everyone   Let me just close the meeting with a few quick announcements  First, the next meeting is   two days—June 27 and June 28  You will receive additional information about the nonpolicy   part of the discussion  Second, as usual, on the night of June 27, we’ll have a dinner at the   British Embassy  A number of us have been concerned about the late night, and so I had a   discussion with the ambassador, and we’ve agreed that there will be no program or speaker     The evening will be strictly social, and therefore maybe we’ll get out a little earlier and have   more time to study the Greenbook  [Laughter]  Third, we circulated a set of proposed dates for   next year’s meetings  If you haven’t responded to Vince or Debbie, please do so  There is lunch   available in the Anteroom, and the meeting is adjourned  Thank you   END OF MEETING         May 9, 2007 111 of 130     "
8140,2007-06-27,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everyone  Today begins Cathy   Minehan’s last FOMC meeting  Cathy has been a regular participant since August 1994    We will have an opportunity later in the fall to say goodbye to Cathy more officially, but I   think this will be a good opportunity to thank you for your collegiality and for thirteen years   of tremendous contributions to the FOMC  Thank you very much  [Applause]    Thank you, and now it is time for the report on desk   operations    On the breakeven inflation rates, the five-by-five rose   more, I believe, than either the five or the ten arithmetically because the ten rose more than   the five and it’s in the spread  It seems odd that a change in the near-term growth outlook   would have significant implications for five-to-ten-year inflation expectations  Are there   technical issues there as well as in mortgage hedging, or is it just the way you calculate these   spreads with the differences in liquidity and so on?    Thank you  Are there other questions for Bill?    President Minehan    I’m sorry  Is this two-handed?    Governor Kohn    Vice Chairman, did you have a comment?   June 27-28, 2007 9 of 261     President Fisher    We can monitor the situation here and in New York  I   don’t know, Vincent, if we have any reports or materials that we can share with President   Fisher    There are a couple of themes  One is that the   subprime problems are still being worked through the financial markets  The second is that   June 27-28, 2007 12 of 261    subprime is an example of a broader class of structured products that are difficult to value,   and that creates some uncertainty in the markets in periods of stress  President Lacker    Other questions for Bill?  If not, I need a motion to   ratify domestic operations    Without objection  We will turn now to the economic   situation, and we call on David Wilcox    Thank you  That was an excellent report  We have   time now for some questions for our colleagues  Any questions?  President Lockhart   June 27-28, 2007 24 of 261     President Lacker    President Fisher    President Hoenig    Although the percentages are by number of   mortgages rather than by value, I think    Are there other questions?  President Moskow    President Hoenig, I think I interrupted you  I’m   sorry    President Plosser    The number I recall is 46 as the long-run average   since the ’80s  President Stern    Governor Kroszner     If there are no other questions, Vincent, could I call   on you to talk about the economic projections?     Thank you, Vincent  Thanks for reminding us that   this projection counts in some sense, right?  [Laughter]  Also, I think it is very useful for   us to have the discipline of thinking about how our projections fit together  Are there   questions for Vincent?  If not, then we can begin our economic go-round  Who would   like to go first?

[Laughter]      All in all, there still seems to be general agreement that   the risks to inflation remain to the upside and remain the predominant concern  Is that a   reasonable summary?  Are there any comments?   Let me present just a few essentially random thoughts at this point  First of all, from   my perspective, the biggest puzzle about what’s happening is the behavior of the labor   market, which is continuing  We’ve had slow growth  Unemployment is at least not falling   anymore, but it remains stable at a fairly low level  My scenario for the soft landing plus   some moderation of inflation involves some cooling of the labor market from here  I still   think it will happen, but admittedly, there is only the slightest suggestion so far that it is   happening  In particular, we have not yet seen the decline of construction employment,   which I have continually referred to and continue to expect  There have been a number of   discussions about why we haven’t seen that response yet  Some have noted the possibility   that a lot of the workers are undocumented and, therefore, are not being counted by the usual   June 27-28, 2007 91 of 261    measures  However, they seem to have been counted when the market was expanding  So   it is a little puzzling why suddenly they are not being counted  Thus I still think there will   be some moderate softening in the labor market over the next year  If that does not happen,   then we will be at some risk of higher upside growth than we anticipate and higher inflation   pressures than we anticipate  So for me that is a central thing to look at  I think in talking   about this, it is important to note how uncertain we are about what the natural rate of   unemployment is and that entire concept  Judging from the FOMC’s 2009 projections, most   of us think that the natural rate may be a bit below 5 percent, and I would note that the   unemployment rate was in the mid to low 4s for four years in the late 1990s and has been in   that range now for about two and one-half years  So it is not entirely evident where the   natural rate is, and it does make some difference obviously  Again, I expect to see some   moderation in the labor markets, and I believe that is critical to our scenario     Like everyone else, I think the housing situation continues to involve downside   risks  I would reiterate what President Poole said—that this is an asset market; that   therefore price changes are inherently, at least to some extent, unpredictable; that a lot is   going to depend on confidence, which is going to depend on results, which is going to   depend on confidence; and therefore, that we need to be very careful, just the same as with   inflation, about declaring victory too soon on the housing front  In particular, there is an   interaction between the mortgage market and financial markets  There has been discussion   of that already today, but there is the potential for some trigger to lead to what would   amount to an effective tightening in financial markets, which would affect not only housing   but also potentially, for example, corporate credits  Although that remains just a risk, I think   it’s one we need to keep in mind   June 27-28, 2007 92 of 261    I agree with the general view around the table that, except for housing, the economy   looks to be healthy  Capital spending is not going gangbusters, but it does seem to have   come back to some modest trend  I also agree with what a number of people said about the   strength of the world economy  We shouldn’t get too carried away with the export sector    What we’re hoping for here is that net exports will not be a net drag on growth  [Laughter]    Nevertheless, that is an improvement over the past, and the strong world economy should on   net be helpful to our economy   Like everyone else, I’m encouraged about the incoming inflation data  I agree that   some of these good numbers may be partially transitory  However, when you analyze this,   there has been a decided step-down in the past three or four months in the shelter   component  I would make two observations  One is that, excluding shelter, core PCE   inflation is now at the lowest number since the end of 2003; if the shelter numbers of the   past three months were to persist, then that would automatically arithmetically give us some   additional progress on inflation  Now, that may not happen  Clearly we have month-to-  month variations, as we have mentioned many times; but I think some slack could combine   with some more moderation in rents  On the inflation expectations issue, I thought David   Wilcox’s graphs were very instructive  I do very much believe that inflation expectations   influence actual inflation and that the anchoring of inflation expectations is very important    But I don’t think they’re anchored at 2000; I think that they’re anchored at a general range   somewhere around 2 percent  What David’s graph showed was that the level of   expectations that we observe seems also to be consistent with 18 or 17  So I don’t think   that’s an absolute barrier, though I concede that expectations play an important role  Two, I   would also just comment about the statistical issue  I was among a number of people who   June 27-28, 2007 93 of 261    talked about the statistical significance of the change in inflation that we have seen and   noted that these month-to-month changes are subject to a lot of variable shocks  But let me   just say that I think it’s probably worth noting that, in the classical statistical significance   tests and everything we’re doing here, we’re Bayesian decisionmakers, and we’re trying to   make a decision based on our best estimate of where we are at a given moment  Even if we   concluded that inflation’s decline is not statistically significant in a classical sense, we still   ought to act as if there has been some decline in inflation  As a thought experiment, I would   ask what we would be saying now if we had gone up 06 percentage point from where we   were in May  I think that would have led to a somewhat different tone around the table  So   while acknowledging the statistical variability and the transitory nature, I think that there has   been some improvement and that it is showing through into our thinking about the economy   One last thought—a number of people have mentioned the distinction between core   and total inflation  I agree that our communication on this issue really needs some work  I   was just in Chicago, and several people, including directors and employees, asked me,   “Don’t you guys drive?  Don’t you eat?”  [Laughter]  Clearly, we understand why we do   this, but I think we need to improve our communication on that particular front  That’s a   little segue into what we’ll be talking about tomorrow  So if you will bear with me—I know   it is six o’clock, but I’d like to ask Vincent just to give us a brief introduction to the   monetary policy discussion we’ll be having tomorrow  That will save us some time   tomorrow and give us a chance to think overnight about the subject     Are there any questions for Vincent?  All right  If   there are no questions, then we’ll adjourn  We’ll see you at the dinner, and we will begin at   900 am    [Meeting recessed]   June 27-28, 2007 98 of 261    June 28, 2007—Morning Session    Good morning, everyone  The GDP figures came   out this morning  David, would you like to comment?    Are there any questions?    Okay  We are well advanced in our deliberations   here  We heard from Vincent yesterday on the action in the statement, and so we are   prepared for the go-round  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Stern    I am not so sure about that  [Laughter]  Thank you    President Poole   June 27-28, 2007 105 of 261     Thank you  We have seen some change in policy   expectations, obviously, in the intermeeting period  President Moskow    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Minehan    How about something like “Economic growth   proceeded at a moderate pace”?    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Governor Mishkin and others have   referred to communication issues  I’d just point out that we will be addressing some of   those later this morning  Vice Chairman Geithner    Change the word “inflation” to “those”      Thank you  Well, we appear to be in considerable   agreement about the policy action  [Laughter]  It is a good thing, I guess  Not only are   we in agreement, but also the bond market is in agreement  [Laughter]  I would just note   that, in fact, the bond market is acting as an automatic stabilizer, responding to news, as   we have discussed before  I think we are in a very good place, and our forecasting   process has served us very well  In that respect, I think this might be an appropriate time   to congratulate the staff, including Dave Stockton, Karen Johnson, Vincent Reinhart, and   the research directors at the Reserve Banks who are here, for their tremendous   contributions to this process, which has really been instrumental in helping us find the   right level of policy and in building a lot of credibility in the market  So thank you very   much for your outstanding work   With respect to the statement also, I didn’t hear a lot of dissent  First of all, let me   say that I think Governor Kohn’s amendments in section 3 are very much to the point—  so that would be “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures”  First, the word   “pressures” dilutes to some extent the attention to the monthly numbers  Second, as a   number of people have said, it is a broader concept, and it can be construed as including   some of the headline issues and the oil, commodities, and so on prices that we are   concerned about  So I think it is definitely an improvement, and so I would like to   recommend it   On section 2, just a couple things  One is that I would hesitate to try to indicate   growing strength in the second half, for a couple of reasons  First, at least in terms of the   June 27-28, 2007 121 of 261    Greenbook, that acceleration is relatively modest—certainly not at all a definite uptick    By continuing to use the language of “moderate pace,” I think we signal that we are not   going to take the second quarter as necessarily indicating a new reacceleration of growth    We think that the second quarter represents, at least partly, a transitory increase in the   growth rate  Second, Professor Minehan [laughter] was correct about the quality of   writing in the section  The last statement began with the term “economic growth”  I am   kind of ambivalent about whether or not to do this, but we could say, “Economic growth   appears to have been moderate during the first half of this year, despite the ongoing   adjustment in the housing sector”      A little more variation—is that acceptable?    The proposal is, “Economic growth appears to have   been moderate,” and then it goes on, as it says here, “during the first half of this year,   despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector”  I see nodding, so I think that is   accepted  I’m sorry  No?    Yes, it is—almost  [Laughter]  Well, I mean, that is   no different from what we already have    The content is no different      Is everyone okay with the language?   June 27-28, 2007 122 of 261     I think President Minehan is entitled to her change,   given that she is valedictory in this  [Laughter]  So with that change—“Economic growth   appears to have been moderate during the first half” et cetera—that would be my   recommendation  Are there any further comments?     President Plosser    The entire statement “The Federal Open Market   Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent    Economic growth appears to have been moderate during the first half of this year, despite   the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector  The economy seems likely to continue to   expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters  Readings on core inflation have   improved modestly in recent months  However, a sustained moderation in inflation   pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated  Moreover, the high level of resource   utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures”  The last section is the same    Well, look at the May statement  We have been   doing that for a while now  [Laughter]  Are there any other questions or comments?  If   not, I’d like to call for a vote    Thank you  The coffee is not yet brewed    [Laughter]  So why don’t we go on to the next phase of the meeting  We turn to Vincent   to discuss communication issues    Thank you  Are there any questions?  Vice Chairman    President Minehan    We’re having questions for Vincent now    I think I had President Poole first and then Governor   Mishkin  President Poole    Let me just say that there’s going to be a go-round    Everyone will have an opportunity    Governor Mishkin, do you have a question?    President Minehan  I’m sorry  You had an   intervention    That’s what we have to discuss  That’s on the table    President Moskow    Vice Chairman    Are there other questions for Vincent?    President Pianalto, do you have a question?    I understand that the doughnut truck has arrived    [Laughter]  So give us a twenty-minute break for coffee, and we will continue this   discussion   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we reconvene?  We had some hurried   consultation during the break about how best to proceed with this discussion  Breaking with   our usual practice, we decided that it might be best for me to begin and to provide you with   my sense of a broad schematic of how I see us going forward with our communications, in   particular with the projections, which I view as being central to our plan  I note that people   can justifiably complain that they haven’t had enough preliminary information for this   discussion, which I’m about to give you  But let me also say, first, that there will be, of   course, opportunity to react in the round to follow and, second, that we will continue to poll   you and to consult with you and that we’re not going to be finalizing this for some time yet    So in the interest of trying to give you something to react to, let me just present an overview   of how I see this going     The extended projections that we have been experimenting with can be a central   critical element of a new and expanded communication strategy that will, in fact, address   many of the concerns that were raised today  I’ll be very explicit about that as I go through   this  In particular, what are the elements of these expanded projections?   First, I   recommend that we extend the projection horizon  We have used a third year in our   experiment so far  I think that might be the right solution, but let me just leave open for   discussion the possibility of either using a fourth year or replacing the third year with a third   through fifth year average or something of that sort—sort of a long-term average  Second, I   June 27-28, 2007 137 of 261    recommend that we release this projection quarterly  That would mean approximately   quarterly because the calendar is not conducive to an exact quarterly release schedule  That   would mean that two of the projections would appear in the context of the Monetary Policy   Report  This is not a central concern, but my thought at this point would be that we should   revisit the Monetary Policy Report and try to make it more informative  There is a lot that   we could do to make it better—to include more information, include boxes, and essentially   make it a more-effective publication  That would be, as now, twice a year  Perhaps on the   off quarters we could have a small release of some sort, or we could include the projections   in the minutes  That’s one of the issues that we need to discuss as we go forward   Third, I think that in our projections we ought to project a total inflation measure    As many people have noted, there is confusion—and even some resentment, I would say—  about what appears to be our excessive attention to core inflation  Projecting a total inflation   measure throughout the projection would, first of all, clarify that our definition of price   stability is in terms of total inflation and would give us opportunities to explain in this   document, in speeches, and elsewhere not only why we do look at core inflation, how we   use core inflation, and its role as a forecasting mechanism but also—as President Fisher and   others have mentioned—that it’s not a necessarily sufficient statistic and that we should look   at other things as we try to forecast overall inflation     I would go even further here—just, again, to be concrete  I’ve wavered myself on   thinking about which particular measure  I’ve had discussions with the staff, and I am not   wedded to anything in particular at this point, but currently I am leaning toward suggesting   that we use the PCE deflator as our measure of inflation  It’s a technically better measure    It uses chain weighting and has a lower weight on shelter costs, which have their obvious   June 27-28, 2007 138 of 261    problems  It has disadvantages  There is a significant nonmarket component, for example     An argument can be made for the CPI on the grounds that it is better known although, as has   been pointed out to me, if we begin to really focus on the PCE, it may endogenously   become better known  Another point to make here is—and I don’t want to get too distracted   with this—that since there is a fairly stable wedge between the PCE and the CPI, we might   be able to use the CPI in some of our communication as long as we’re clear that we are not   picking and choosing as far as our objective and our definition of price stability are   concerned   Another component of the projections that we have been doing, which I think is very   valuable, is adding a considerable amount of both qualitative and quantitative information to   our projection  That includes, in particular, our explanation of the qualitative material that   we have been submitting—describing the forecast, the risk to the forecast, the sense of   uncertainty that we have, and so on—and I think that will be very valuable  As I said, we   can combine this with other supporting information  There are various ways to do this    There could be a separate document four times a year  It could be in the minutes  I   suggested one possibility, which is to include it in the Monetary Policy Report twice a year   and keep it in the minutes or as a separate document on the off quarters   Let me talk a bit about what this would accomplish for us, and then I will summarize   that at the end  First of all, the public is very hungry for information about the Federal   Reserve’s outlook and our sense of the risks to the economy  We have, as I have noted   before, the best forecasting group in the world  We have useful information to add to the   debate  By providing that information, I think we can help people make better decisions and   understand policy and the economy better  In particular, the more we are forced to explain   June 27-28, 2007 139 of 261    our predictions and our forecasts, the more credible we’ll be and we’ll be inviting   discussion, reaction, and debate that will, I think, make our projections better  One of the   advantages of transparency is that we begin to interact more with the outside world   Second, I think we should assume optimal monetary policy  I had some other ideas   before, but in the end, I think that’s the right thing to do  An important implication of   assuming optimal monetary policy is that the projections therefore become essentially, as   everyone understands, a plan for how we propose to steer the economy, if you will—  subject, of course, to all the qualifications of uncertainty, forecast problems, and so on  It   gives an explicit road map with reference to both sides of our mandate about how we expect   our policies to move the economy toward our objectives over the next three years  I think   that’s very important for a number of reasons, such as accountability and transparency  But   let me give you an example of where I think it’s particularly useful   One issue we have been discussing is the appropriate period for achieving price   stability, and two suggestions are out there  One is sort of the standard Bank of England   approach, which says that we have a two-year horizon  We have certain concerns about   that  In particular, it doesn’t necessarily take into account, at least not explicitly, the state of   the real economy, the initial conditions, how far we are from price stability, and so on    Another possibility is to say, well, it’s just an aspirational number  It’s a long-term number    We don’t have any particular schedule for getting there  People have raised the obvious   objection  Where’s the discipline?  Where’s the credibility associated with that?  So, as we   understand this, we can explain to the public that the projections go a long way toward   solving this problem because they show how far out we think we have to go to get to what   June 27-28, 2007 140 of 261    we and the public view as being reasonable levels of price stability  So it does in a very   important way solve the problem of the appropriate horizon   Now, I should add a point that will come up, which is that one could object that the   projections are not the same as a Committee forecast  We are not going to come together   and make a single forecast that the entire Committee buys into, except to the extent that we   do have consensus building, which we will have over time in our meetings  That aspect of it   could be viewed as a lack of clarity  However, the aggregation process does reflect unique   features of the Federal Reserve, including its institutional structure, the large size of   Committee, the geographical dispersion of its membership, and our longstanding   willingness to accept and encourage diverse views within the Committee  So we won’t be   forcing some kind of artificial consensus  There will be opportunity for disparity  In   particular, I would recommend that we provide information to the public about the cross-  sectional distribution, as we already do  But my inclination—and people can react—would   be to provide the entire cross-sectional distribution to convey the sense of uncertainty or the   sense of dispersion of views, and that will be informative in the same way that the votes in   the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee are informative  However, as in the case of the   Bank of England and other banks, even though we won’t be having a common forecast,   nevertheless—as I think we have already seen— the preparation of our individual forecasts   does create a certain amount of discipline and has been useful for us in thinking about our   forecast   A very important question is what is conveyed by the third-year projections, and I   think that they are at the heart of the innovation created by this step  Assuming that we’re   not too far from the steady state initially, which I think characterizes our current situation, it   June 27-28, 2007 141 of 261    is evident that the third-year projections—or, alternatively, the third through fifth or   however we decide to do it—reveal a lot of information about our views on sustainable   long-run growth; our views on sustainable unemployment; and, of course, our views of what   price stability is  I simply take note of the fact that the latest projections show the central   tendency of the Committee’s inflation objectives to be 15 to 2 percent on the core PCE   deflator  I actually—and I’m speaking entirely for myself—would be not at all displeased if   that became known as the Federal Reserve’s comfort zone or informal definition of price   stability  First, it’s a compromise among different views  Second, I realize that I’m   complicit in the 1 to 2 percent comfort zone, but I do note that the lowest twelve-month core   PCE, in 2003, was 127  I don’t think we’d be comfortable with inflation rates below 1   percent even though we’re obviously willing to tolerate inflation rates slightly above 2  It’s   not symmetrical, and I think that the comfort zone revealed by our third-year forecast would   be reasonable and would provide useful information   Some would be concerned that we’re also providing information about the   Committee’s views on sustainable growth and sustainable unemployment  I am not that   concerned about it  I think that a transparent Committee should do that  However, for those   who are concerned about possible risks, I’ll point out that Committee projections will have a   lot of dispersion that probably will essentially encompass most reasonable estimates of these   variables  Moreover, there will be forecast errors around those projections, and as we get   information about productivity and other factors, we will be able to update those estimates    I don’t think that they will be a major constraint  I think that they will, in fact, just provide   some information to the public   June 27-28, 2007 142 of 261    I note that some participants have talked about an opportunistic approach to   disinflation, which still seems to have some adherents around the table—that is, people who   may say, “Well, I’m sort of for 2 percent now, but I can see over time, if the opportunity   arises, very gradually moving down to 1½ and so forth”  Obviously, the revealed preference   shown by the third-year projection doesn’t distinguish between those things  One thing that   might happen—and I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing—is that, if opportunistic   disinflation happens and those individuals therefore lower their projections, the Committee’s   projection might drift down a bit  I don’t think it would drift up  I think there would be a   strong resistance to that  But it would be responding appropriately to changing conditions,   and I don’t think it would change very much; so the fact that it would not be literally rigid is   not necessarily a problem to me   Some thought will have to be given to vocabulary, how we describe these things  I   think that I will myself want to talk about the Committee’s projections  It’s not quite right   to call them a target because we will not have agreed universally and chosen a number once   and for all  That being said, I think that the normative implications of the number will not   be missed by the public, and that it will do a lot to clarify people’s views on what the   Committee is trying to do and will also be useful for internal discussions  In particular, in   testimony, speeches, and the like, I would use the projections as my reference point as I talk   about what the Committee is trying to do, where we are heading, and what we think is the   best way to get there   So let me summarize what I think this component of our communication strategy   could do for us, noting that some other things could come in the package—perhaps faster   minutes, changes in the statements, and so on  But let me just talk about what I think is best   June 27-28, 2007 143 of 261    for us  First, it is going to allow us to provide considerably more information to the public   and in a more timely way because it will be quarterly  Second, it will give us an opportunity   to clarify how quickly we intend to move toward our objectives  It will give us a way to   deal with the problem of the horizon  Those of you who were at the St Louis Fed’s   conference on inflation targeting in 2003 might remember a paper by Board staff members   Jon Faust and Dale Henderson in which they talked about inflation targeting as being   focused on the mean of the objective but needing also to focus on the variance  What they   mean by that is the speed with which misses are fixed and that some regimes are not   adequately constructed to deal with that  Again, this would allow us to be very explicit and   very accountable about how we return to our objectives     Third, it would allow us, again, to move to total inflation as our objective and to   clarify how we use core inflation as an input into forecasting total inflation  Fourth, it would   clear up the current confusion about comfort zones and individual views  We’re not going   to take a vote on the particular number, but I think a reasonable way to proceed is to   consider the range of third-year projections as being a kind of consensus view of what most   of us think is an appropriate measure of price stability  Again, I think the normative   implications will be clear  Fifth, it will improve our internal discussion and decisionmaking    We’re already seeing that  In fact, it has highlighted some problems that we have in our   communications and in our coherence  This will help, I think  Sixth, it respects the Fed’s   unique institutional structure, the nature of its Committee, its governance procedures, and its   attention to diversity of views  Moreover, it builds explicitly on a communication device   that we’ve been using for thirty years  In that respect, it will look in some sense as   incremental even though I think it’s very substantive  But I think with its incremental   June 27-28, 2007 144 of 261    nature, the transition risks—be they market risks, political risks, and so on—will be more   moderate than they would otherwise possibly be   So this is an outline  I know that some of you may think that this is a bridge too far    Some of you will think that I’ve only started on the road to Damascus here  [Laughter]  As I   said, there will be an opportunity now to go around as you talk to give any reaction you   might have to this  Also, I have not been very specific about the questions raised in   exhibit 1 that Vince put out  These things bear on the details, but I’m pretty flexible about   them  I think I’d like to see the minutes moved up if possible, consistent with doing all of   what I’ve described  Otherwise I’m pretty flexible about this   Let me just say a few other things about going forward  This, together with the other   elements, is part of an ongoing process  We’re not going to lock this down  I will ask the   subcommittee to continue in existence  Certainly we’re going to have to move forward, if   we all agree that this is the direction that we want to go, to implement the details of the   minutes, the Monetary Policy Report, the collection of this information, and so forth   I would like to talk about the whole package, whatever we come to, in the fall—that   is, in the next three or four months  I will surprise Don by saying this  It would be very nice   if I could have something to point to in October, but it’s certainly possible and I think it’s   very important for us to move deliberately  If that’s not possible to do in a safe and clean   way, then we could wait until January to actually deliver some product  So that is a   question  I think that what will happen is that we will see the reaction we get  We will see   how the public and the markets respond  We may have to take further steps  When we see   how this goes, the markets and the public will tell us what they need to know that we’re not   yet telling them, and then we can move it still further if we need to  But my sense is that,   June 27-28, 2007 145 of 261    with some of the details that we need to work out—and your comments are more than   welcome, as they are with the entire vision—as a central part of a package, this would move   us in a good direction  So I’m going to stop there, and we’ll have a go-round  Did you have   an intervention?    Yes    Let me give Governor Kohn a chance to lead off as the   chairman of the subcommittee, and then we’ll have a full go-round  Don    That’s okay  Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Hoenig    I’m sorry  Vice Chairman   June 27-28, 2007 154 of 261     President Hoenig    Thank you  President Moskow    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    Sure    Governor Warsh    I think I would just note, Vice Chairman Geithner,   that Jim Clouse wrote a version of the minutes that did a pretty good job of integrating   them  It gave the projections with the long-term overview and the underlying forces, et   cetera, and then the rest of the minutes, as is our wont, in sort of a sector-by-sector   discussion of mostly developments in the near term  But you raise a good question  I   think we should keep that in mind    Thank you  President Minehan    Governor Kroszner    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Warsh    President Plosser had an intervention    Thank you  President Lacker    President Minehan   June 27-28, 2007 188 of 261     President Lacker    President Stern    Thank you  President Lockhart     June 27-28, 2007 191 of 261     Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you, Governor  Well, first of all, let me   thank everyone for extremely thoughtful and helpful remarks  We will be looking at   them, the staff will be looking at them, we will proceed with this process, and we will try   to converge to the document that ultimately will be the one that will be the format that we   June 27-28, 2007 200 of 261    will be using  So we will be in touch with you about perhaps further questions, and we   will be doing another trial run for the next meeting     We do want to have a few thoughts from you on the statement  Let me propose   the following  Let’s take a half-hour break for lunch  When we come back—I’ve   conferred with Governor Kohn about this—let me just ask you to answer two questions    One, in light of these proposed changes, are you happy with the statement, or is there a   change that you would make?  Two, are you happy with the approval governance—the   process by which we now construct the statement?  The answer could be yes-yes, no-no,     [laughter]—clearly 300 pm is the drop-dead deadline—but I hope that we can have a   very quick and efficient go-round on those two questions  So let’s take a break for lunch   now and come back in half an hour   [Lunch break]    Let us reconvene  Again, thank you for the very   useful discussion before lunch  Let me just remind you that we need to keep this discussion   within this room  It would be destructive to the whole process if we had it leak out in the   next few months  So we appreciate your doing that   The last item of business is just to do a go-round on the statement  Remember there   are two questions  First, given where we seem to be going on using projections and the   other elements we discussed, do you think that the statement is okay?  What suggestions do   you have for changing it?  Second, do you have any comments on the consultative   governance issues?  Who would like to begin?  President Hoenig    So the practical implication is that it really wouldn’t be   legitimate if we agree with that to dissent on the description of the economy or inflation    If we agree on that—but we will hear what people   have to say  Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    President Moskow    Just to clarify your comment on forward-looking   language, your examples were about policy, like “considerable period” or whatever, but not   necessarily  Does your comment apply to statements like “output is going to grow at a   moderate pace?”    President Lacker    President Yellen    President Minehan    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Governor Kroszner    Governor Mishkin    President Lockhart    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Vice Chairman   June 27-28, 2007 216 of 261     Thank you  Are there any other comments?  Well,   again, we’ll review the transcript and see what steps we need to take  Once again, thank you   for your very useful comments  The next meeting is Tuesday, August 7  If there is no other   business, then we’re adjourned   END OF MEETING   June 27-28, 2007 218 of 261     "
8165,2007-08-07,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  We start off today with some   welcomes and farewells  I would first like to welcome Eric Rosengren, the new President of the   Federal Reserve Bank of Boston    I have known Eric for about twenty years  We used to be   squash partners  I won’t say who won  We know who wins now  [Laughter]  I admire Eric—he   has been a multitasker  He has been very successful as a researcher and as a bank supervisor,   and he is no slouch with respect to monetary policy  So we look forward to your contributions,   Eric    Sadly, today we have to say farewell to President Michael   Moskow of Chicago  Michael has sat at this table since 1994, which we have calculated is a total   of 104 FOMC meetings  Mike has been involved in public policy off and on since 1969 in many   capacities, and he has seen both the good times and the bad times  We will have a luncheon   today after the meeting to honor Mike, but let us memorialize in the transcript that we thank him   for his many contributions and wish him the very best  [Applause]    Today is also Vincent Reinhart’s final FOMC meeting    Vince went to work at the New York Fed in 1983 and came to the Board—   PARTICIPANT  Is he here?    He’s coming  Well, he gets docked for  [Laughter]    Well, let me make a couple of other announcements, and   then we’ll move on  First of all, in the days when Don Winn was the head of the Congressional   Liaison Office, it was customary for him to present during the luncheon after the meeting an   update on congressional matters  Laricke Blanchard, whom I think most of you know, is now   the head of the Congressional Liaison Office  We would like to begin that tradition again  We   have lunch, of course, for President Moskow, but if there are a few minutes after the   adjournment, Laricke will provide us with a short update  He has already circulated a written   summary  So if we don’t get to the update, at least we will have the summary  In the future we   are going to try to have a congressional update at every meeting     Second, on communications, the subcommittee sent a memo to the Committee on   July 25  Broadly speaking, the recommendations were that we should now focus on expanding   the FOMC projections as our next step in increasing transparency, that we submit trial-run   projections in September as we did for August and live projections, so to speak, for the October   meeting, and that we vote in October to approve this step  My sense from June was that there   was a general agreement on this approach  We would like to give you several more   opportunities to comment and to discuss details  We will poll you between now and the   September meeting on remaining issues  In September, there will be an agenda item for final   August 7, 2007 4 of 136    discussion of various issues that might come up  In October, we will have another opportunity to   talk about it  I would like, if possible, to take a vote at the October meeting, which would be   followed by a roll-out about three weeks later, with a press release and with a speech by me, and   then by the information in the minutes that would come out  So that is where we are  Again, we   will have an opportunity to talk about the program on an agenda item in September   The subcommittee also recommended, based on the discussion we had earlier, that we   vote on the entire statement  I would like to make that also an agenda item in September  I have   asked Scott Alvarez, our General Counsel, working with Monetary Affairs, to provide us with a   memo that will address two issues  First, what is the legal status?  What specific action do we   have to take to allow the Committee to vote on the full statement?  Second, it would be   worthwhile to have them take one more look to see whether there are any unintended   consequences  For example, would this inhibit us in any way if there were intermeeting moves   or any special steps being taken?  But the plan would be to have a brief discussion in September   on this memo, to take a vote, and, if we agree, the full statement would be subject to a   Committee vote  Today, let’s stay with the old process, which still allows a vote on the balance-  of-risk assessment   Let me raise an item of business here  Since Vince Reinhart clearly has disappeared, we   need to vote for a replacement  We need to nominate and elect a new secretary and economist to   the FOMC whose position would be valid until the first regularly scheduled meeting of 2008    Would you like to make a nomination?    Other nominations?  [Laughter]  If not, all in favor say   “aye”  Opposed?  Carried unanimously  Congratulations, Brian   August 7, 2007 5 of 136     Okay  I will wait until Vince appears  He may be looking   at financial markets this morning, and so we will wait until he appears to bid him farewell  Let’s   go ahead, then, to the authorization for Desk operations and turn it over to Bill Dudley  Bill?    Thank you for a very good report, Bill  Are there   questions?  President Poole    President Fisher    President Rosengren    President Moskow   August 7, 2007 15 of 136     Are there other questions for Bill?  If not, we need a vote to   ratify domestic market operations    Objections?  Vincent has come in  Welcome  We just want to   acknowledge you    We want to acknowledge your final meeting, Vincent  It has   been six years since Vincent was elected Secretary and Economist to the Committee  You took that   role only three or four weeks before September 11, and your steady hand during that crisis was   August 7, 2007 17 of 136    invaluable  Unfortunately, against all good advice and after only eighty-two FOMC meetings—a   record which to his credit he has achieved without prompting accusations of steroid use—[laughter]   Vincent is insisting upon returning to civilian life  So today is an appropriate occasion upon which   to express our gratitude, Vincent, for your sage advice, your thoughtful guidance, and your   undoubtedly well-deserved admonitions to the Committee over the years  Vincent’s legacy, of   course, will live on in the meeting transcripts from his tenure, as the transcripts become public over   the next few years  For example, in the May 2004 transcript, Vincent is caught using the words   “cattle prods” in reference to a possible experiment involving bond market traders  [Laughter]  In   2005, he suggested that the FOMC as a group was incapable of agreeing on something as   straightforward as the color of an orange  [Laughter]  Notwithstanding that, Vincent, the   Committee does agree on this  You have our heartfelt thanks and our best wishes for the next stage   of your career  Congratulations and many thanks  [Applause]  Is there a rebuttal?  [Laughter]  If   not, we can go to the economic situation, and I will call on David Wilcox    Thank you  We’re now open for questions for the staff    President Fisher    Are there other questions?  President Lacker    Other questions?  We’ll begin our economic go-round then    For President Rosengren’s benefit—as you probably know, if we have a comment or a question for   August 7, 2007 27 of 136    a speaker, we use a two-handed symbol for an intervention  I would like to begin the go-round   today with President Moskow    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you, President Fisher  Just to respond very briefly,   we do have a group here at the Board working with other economists and financial experts   throughout the System that does scenario analysis and does monitor the markets, and we   certainly are quite attuned to these issues    President Pianalto    Thank you  President Stern   August 7, 2007 38 of 136     Thank you  President Hoenig     Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart    I’m sorry  I see a two-handed intervention    The two things are not completely unrelated    If there is a lot of uncertainty, then there will be more   divergence of views as well    No, that is true    President Lockhart    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  It’s now 1040  I’m informed the coffee is ready    Why don’t we break until 11 o’clock?   [Coffee break]    Let’s reconvene  President Poole   August 7, 2007 54 of 136     Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you, and thank everyone  President Lockhart    Thank you for the useful discussion  As usual, I am going   to very briefly summarize what I heard  I will be happy to take any comments on that  Then I   just want to make a few short points  Again, most of the key points have been made   Most participants expect growth to remain moderate over the forecast period  Despite   lower household wealth resulting from weaker house and stock prices, consumption is likely to   continue to grow as labor markets remain strong, real incomes increase, and gasoline prices   moderate  Business investment should also grow moderately, although lower productivity and   higher volatility could be drags on investment  Commercial real estate, in particular, may be   slackening, but it retains good fundamentals  The global economy is strong  Industrial   production is expanding at a reasonable pace  However, downside risks to growth were noted   and perhaps received somewhat greater emphasis than at past meetings  Most notably, housing   appears to have weakened further, with sales of new and existing homes declining and   inventories of unsold homes remaining high  Homebuilders are experiencing financial strains,   and there is downward pressure on home prices  Spillover on consumption spending is not yet   evident but is a possible risk    In this regard, developments in credit markets received considerable attention  On the   positive side, the repricing of risk and the reevaluation of underwriting standards seem   appropriate  Liquidity still exists, credit is still being extended, and markets may work out their   problems on their own  A lower dollar and lower long-term Treasury rates also tend to offset   financial tightening  However, higher risk premiums, tougher underwriting, and greater   uncertainty may constrain housing and investment spending, leading to broader macroeconomic   effects  In more-pessimistic scenarios, dislocations in credit markets may last awhile and have a   more substantial effect on credit availability and costs for businesses as well as for homebuyers    August 7, 2007 82 of 136    The possibility of contagion or severe financial instability also exists  Many participants took   note of the NIPA revisions and their implications for productivity growth, consumer saving, and   unit labor costs  Meeting participants tend to put potential growth at higher rates than the   Greenbook   Views on inflation are similar to those in previous meetings  Recent readings are viewed   as reasonably favorable  However, risks to inflation remain, including the possible reversal of   transitory factors, tight labor markets, the high price of commodities, and higher unit labor costs   resulting from lower productivity growth  In all, the risks to inflation remain to the upside  That   is my summary of what I heard  I’m sure a lot more could be said  Any comments?     If not, let me just make a few additional comments  There have been two very important   developments since the last meeting  The first was the downward revision to the NIPA growth   numbers  It’s not obvious yet, of course, how much of that reflects a permanent decline in   productivity and how much is transitory  But certainly the best guess is that some of it is more   long term in nature  I think the main point I’d like to make is that the implications of this   downward revision for inflation and monetary policy, except perhaps in the very short run, are   not obvious  The question is, What is the effect of the lower productivity growth on aggregate   demand?  We have examples of both types of phenomena  In the late ’90s, the pickup in   productivity growth stimulated a very strong boom working through the stock market,   consumption, and investment, so it led to an overheating economy, whereas in the earlier part of   this decade, productivity growth picked up again but with weak aggregate demand  We had a   jobless recovery associated with that  So it remains to be seen exactly how aggregate demand   will respond to these developments  I do think that perhaps that in the very short run, given   wage behavior and unit labor costs, if I had to choose, I would say that there is a slight bias   August 7, 2007 83 of 136    toward higher inflation and tighter money  In the longer run, you would expect to see lower   long-term rates because of slower growth   The second issue that has been widely discussed around the table is the financial market    It is an interesting question why what looks like $100 billion or so of credit losses in the   subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth  So   it’s an interesting question about what is going on there  I think there are three reasons that the   financial markets have moved in the direction they have  First, there has been a widespread   repricing of risk  That is, obviously, a healthy development, particularly if there is no overshoot,   which is a possibility  But all else being equal, it is restrictive in terms of aggregate demand, and   it makes our policy tighter than it otherwise would be  The second reason for the changes in   markets is that there has been a loss of confidence in the ability of investors to evaluate credit   quality, particularly in structured products  There is an information fog, as I have heard it   described  This is very much associated with the loss of confidence in the credit-rating agencies    I think one of the implications of this is that some of the innovations we have seen in financial   markets are going to get rolled back  We are going to see more lending taken out of originate-to-  distribute vehicles and put back onto portfolio balance sheets  So the question is how much   effect this adjustment process will have on the availability of credit  The third reason that I think   the markets have reacted as much as they have is concern about the macroeconomic implications   of what is happening  In particular, there is a fear that subprime losses, repricing, and the   tightening of underwriting standards will have adverse effects on the housing market and will   feed through to consumption, and we will get into a vicious cycle  That certainly is reflected in   the expectations of policy   August 7, 2007 84 of 136    I am not going to go through all the things that are going on now in the markets  You   have had very good reviews of that  Obviously, the markets right now are not functioning   normally  Some conduits of credit are simply closed or frozen  A number of companies are   having difficulties with short-term finance, and so, per President Fisher’s comment, we are   watching those things very carefully  We are prepared to use the tools that we have to address a   short-term financial crisis, should one occur  In the longer term, of course, our policy should be   directed not toward protecting financial investors but, rather, toward our macroeconomic   objectives  That is very important  Then the question is what the long-run implications of the   financial market adjustment will be for the economy  I think the odds are that the market will   stabilize  Most credits are pretty strong except for parts of the mortgage market  But even so   there will be notably tighter credit, tighter standards, probably some loss of confidence in   markets, and higher risk premiums that will on net be restrictive  This restrictive effect could   come in various magnitudes  It could be moderate, or it could be more severe, and we are just   going to have to monitor how it adjusts over time  Again, there is a bit of a risk—and tail risk   has been mentioned not only in a financial sense but also in the macro sense—that, if credit is   severely restricted so that we get feedback from lower house prices, for example, into the   financial markets, that situation would be difficult to deal with   Those are the two major issues that people have talked about  Just very briefly on the   overall assessment—on the output side, economic growth looks a little softer to me, mostly   because of housing  There are also some slightly worrying developments in terms of automobile   demand, which suggest some weakening in consumer spending  But there are some strong   elements as well  Also the labor market has marginally softened  The unemployment rate is   about 25 basis points above its recent low; so there has been some movement, and I still expect   August 7, 2007 85 of 136    to see some reduction in construction employment  So I think there is a bit more softness and   there are a few more downside risks to output than at our last meeting  Like others, I think the   recent inflation data are moderately encouraging  I continue to see risks  If you’re not satiated   with risks, I’ll add one more, which is that if the housing market really weakens and people go   back to renting, we could get the same phenomenon that we saw last year, by which rents are   driven up and we get an effect working through shelter costs  So I agree with those who still   view the risk to inflation as being tilted to the upside  If there are no comments or questions, let   me turn now to Brian to discuss the policy action     Thank you  Are there questions of Brian?  If not, let’s   begin our go-round  President Fisher   August 7, 2007 88 of 136     Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Moskow    President Pianalto    Thank you  President Yellen   August 7, 2007 94 of 136     Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart     Thank you  President Rosengren    Okay  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  President Lacker    All right  Let me get us back to the statement  [Laughter]    Vice Chairman Geithner    Governor Mishkin   August 7, 2007 108 of 136     President Moskow    Well, right  You really have to rewrite the sentence  Let me   try to evaluate this with your guidance  [Laughter]  So I agree with Brian that this is one of the   toughest ones to write and to assess the response  If you read the commentary, expectations are all   over the map, and so it is very difficult to know how this will be taken  I don’t pretend to know    Let me start with something easy  I think that President Plosser is absolutely right  There is no   August 7, 2007 109 of 136    reason to change paragraph 3 without a reason  So unless anyone has concerns, I’d like to change   paragraph 3 back to the June language  Okay  That’s the first thing     Regarding the tougher question—and President Yellen, President Poole, and others have   raised an interesting possibility—again, without much confidence I am going to resist it for the   following reasons  The first reason is mostly that it is complicated, [laughter] and it moves things   around in ways that will make it even harder for the market to understand what we’re trying to do    Another reason is that the statement “although the downside risks to growth have increased   somewhat,” if we follow your advice and put it after the new sentence in paragraph 2, will   essentially say that the financial markets are the reason that the downside risks have increased,   whereas there are other factors—the housing market, automobile sales, and things of that sort—that   could be viewed as increasing the downside risks  So I guess that’s my recommendation  On   “predominant,” I think the word has been neutralized to a significant extent by its use  You may   recall that we used the phrase “predominant policy concern,” and we changed the second sentence,   and the market based on that decided that we had gone all the way to balance  My concern is that, if   we get rid of “predominant” and if we mention the downside risks to growth anywhere, that will be   viewed as having gone mostly to balance, and I don’t think that’s where we are right now as a   Committee   I have one thought, which may have come too late in the day here  This is going back to   paragraph 2, “financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks”  President Geithner raised the   idea of changing that to something about risk  One small concern I have, and it would have been   good had we put this in earlier, is that the phrase refers to something going on in the markets per se   and not an effect of the markets on the economy, which heightens some of the put risk a little  An   alternative would be to replace that first phrase with something like “investors have demanded   August 7, 2007 110 of 136    greater compensation for risk”  That would be a market development that evidently affects yields   and borrowing costs  I see some nodding  I see some frowning  So I’m not sure    No  “Investors have demanded greater compensation for risk,   credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses”  All right  No   excitement    No  [Laughter]    Oh, I see what you’re saying  Well, actually the way I   phrased it was intentionally not to say that risks have increased but rather to say that the price of risk   has increased    But that’s what I want it to say      Okay  I don’t see any snowball  [Laughter]    President Fisher    Governor Kroszner  I’m sorry  You were next    Well, just to say “have increased” and then have the next   phrase say “credit conditions have become tighter” also makes no value judgment on whether   they’re appropriate    Governor Kohn, do you have a comment?    I think that is a good idea  Credit conditions are becoming   tighter  We saw that in the bank surveys before any of this happened    I understand, but I think that some acknowledgement of the   effects of financial market developments in the recent weeks on the economy is needed just to make   sure that people understand that we’re awake    “Have increased, credit conditions have become tighter”  And   the housing    Well, think of it as being market-traded assets, and “credit   conditions” sounds like mortgages, retail type of credit provision  President Hoenig    Okay  Let me just get a sense around the table, if I could  I   think President Hoenig makes the point that volatility in financial markets could be viewed as   having an effect on the economy through uncertainty and those sorts of factors  One option is   “financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks”  The second option is “risk premiums in   financial markets have increased”  Who wants “volatility”?  [Laughter]  I see five  Who wants to   make the change?      Oh, great  [Laughter]  All right      Okay    Okay  I apologize profusely for bringing this up  Why don’t   we just leave it?  [Laughter]  So after all the discussion, my proposal is to follow President Plosser   and to replace paragraph 3 with the June version  Please call the roll    The next meeting is September 18  Let me remind you that   we will be discussing briefly on September 18 and in October the communication issues  Let me   ask you, please, to be reticent about discussing this; please be nontransparent about transparency   [laughter] in our discussions so that we don’t front-run ourselves too much  I would appreciate that    I’m going to adjourn formally, but if you can tolerate a few extra minutes at the table, we would like   to give Laricke a chance just to give us a very quick update on congressional matters, and then we   will move upstairs for lunch for President Moskow  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   August 7, 2007 116 of 136     "
8189,2007-08-10,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  As you know, financial markets   have been fragile  They appeared to continue to be quite fragile overnight  There are difficulties   with commercial paper funding and other short-term funding and a lot of concerns about   counterparty risk  This morning the Desk, responding to a situation with the federal funds rate   trading well above the target, did a large early operation and announced that to the markets  They   are prepared to come back throughout the day to continue providing reserves as needed to keep the   federal funds rate at our target  We are also proposing at 915 to release a statement essentially   saying that  I will now read you the statement   “The Federal Reserve is providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of   financial markets    The Federal Reserve will provide reserves as necessary through open market   operations to promote trading in the federal funds market at rates close to the Federal   Open Market Committee’s target rate of 5¼ percent  In current circumstances,   depository institutions may experience unusual funding needs because of dislocations in   money and credit markets  As always, the discount window is available as a source of   funding”   So we’re just saying that we are here, we are going to try to maintain the fed funds rate at   5¼ percent, we will provide adequate reserves, and we’re going to try to work against any   remaining stigma associated with borrowing at the discount window   What I’d like to do is have Bill Dudley and Brian Madigan brief you about the state of the   markets and give you a chance to ask questions  No action is being contemplated at this meeting    August 10, 2007 2 of 12    This is informational, but we wanted to keep you apprised of the situation and of our proposal to   issue this statement  Bill, are you available?    Brian, would you like to add anything?    Are there any questions for Brian or Bill?  President Lacker    Other questions  President Hoenig    Governor Mishkin    President Poole    I think it’s our intention to be aggressive and to go below   5¼ percent if at all needed  However, we have not changed the target, and we don’t want to convey   the sense that we’ve changed the target, but we will be aggressive  President Fisher    President Geithner, did you want to intervene?      President Fisher, our goal is to provide liquidity not to support   asset prices per se in any way  My understanding of the market’s problem is that price discovery   has been inhibited by the illiquidity of the subprime-related assets that are not trading, and nobody   knows what they’re worth, and so there’s a general freeze-up  The market is not operating in a   normal way  The idea of providing liquidity is essentially to give the market some ability to do the   appropriate repricing it needs to do and to begin to operate more normally  So it’s a question of   market functioning, not a question of bailing anybody out  That’s really where we are right now   August 10, 2007 8 of 12     President Lacker    President Plosser    Bill, can you take that?    President Lockhart has a question  Dennis, why don’t you   come sit up here so everyone can see you?    Are there any other questions?  Okay  Thank you for your   questions and comments  This is what we’re going to do now  There are additional things that we   might consider in the future if problems continue or worsen—for example, a swap line to provide   more dollar liquidity to Europe; a reduction in the discount rate; and then if we decide that the   macroeconomic conditions warrant it, a change in the federal funds rate  Those things would   require FOMC approval  So obviously, should we get to the point at which we want to take   additional steps, we will be in touch with you, and if you have any further comments or questions,   please let us know  Is there anything else?  President Plosser    Certainly     “The Federal Reserve is providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of   financial markets     The Federal Reserve will provide reserves as necessary through open market   operations to promote trading in the federal funds market at rates close to the Federal   Open Market Committee’s target rate of 5¼ percent  In current circumstances,   depository institutions may experience unusual funding needs because of dislocations in   August 10, 2007 11 of 12    money and credit markets  As always, the discount window is available as a source of   funding”    So there is just one procedural point  Again, this is not something that we’re   contemplating, but one possible thing we could do would be to lower the discount rate, reduce the   100 basis point spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate  It’s not obvious that it is   the right thing to do  There are probably some technical and logistical issues concerned with it  It’s   not obvious that it would be helpful  But I just want to put it on a list of things that we might   consider and to remind you that the procedure for doing it would involve requests from your boards   and then approval by the Board of Governors  So should we come to that point and we begin to   discuss that particular option, we would need the Presidents to get the assent of their boards so that   we could go ahead and take that action  Are there any other comments or questions?  All right    Well, we will keep you well apprised, and I’m sure you will be following the markets on your own    So thank you very much and good morning   END OF MEETING   August 10, 2007 12 of 12     "
8200,2007-08-16,BERNANKE,"  Let’s begin  Let me add my thanks for your coming together   on such short notice  We very much appreciate it  I know people are on vacation and so on  Since   we last met in these circumstances, financial markets have come under even more stress  As you   know, some effects of this are desirable  We’re seeing reductions in risk  We’re seeing   deleveraging, and we’re seeing revaluation of assets  But I think we’re also seeing a certain amount   of panic; a certain amount of markets seizing up, with good credits not being able to be financed;   and a good deal of concern that there is a potential for some downward spiral in the markets that   could threaten or harm the economy  So we would like in this meeting to discuss possible responses   to that situation  To give us some background, I’d like to call on Bill Dudley for an update on the   markets, and then we’ll take questions and comments for Bill  Bill, are you there?    Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker    President Hoenig, I believe   August 16, 2007 4 of 37     President Fisher    Are there other questions?  If there are no other questions,   then we can ask what our options to address the situation are  Broadly speaking, we can do   something in monetary policy, something in our lender-of-last-resort function, or some   combination  In monetary policy, the economy appears to have been strong in the second quarter    It seems to be running at a moderate pace in the third quarter  So the direct evidence of a slowdown   is not yet here  However, I do think that one can argue that the balance of risks has shifted toward   softness  We see significant wealth effects and confidence effects, and as Bill was mentioning, the   mortgage market is under significant stress  I do think there will be some spillover into other kinds   of consumer credit as we go forward  So I wouldn’t say that a rate cut is completely off the table,   but my own feeling is that we should try to resist a rate cut until it is really very clear from   economic data and other information that it is needed  I’d really prefer to avoid giving any   impression of a bailout or a put, if we can  Therefore, what I’m going to suggest today is to offer a   statement updating our views of the economy that will give some signal about where we think   things are going but to stop short today of changing rates  I’ll come back later to a proposed   statement and hear views on whether we should issue a statement or whether we, in fact, should   consider a cut   The other option, the other general area, is lender-of-last-resort activity  The benefit of this   is that it’s directly related to the functioning of markets  It’s a traditional central bank approach to   dealing with disorderly markets  Last week, we agreed to inject additional liquidity to try to   improve the functioning of short-term money markets, and I think we were largely successful in   doing that  But at this point the problems are much greater than they were, and the question arises   whether we could do other things to increase confidence and liquidity  The tool that we have that   may be beneficial—and I emphasize “may”—is the discount window  The proposal would be to   August 16, 2007 7 of 37    use the discount window more aggressively  I’d like to ask Governor Kohn to talk a bit about what   we might do and to give a statement that could be issued along with the action  Don    Do you want to read the statement now?    I’d like to take questions and comments at this point  If   you’re not speaking, it would help if you turned off your microphone so that we don’t get the   feedback  President Moskow    Okay  Governor Mishkin    Please    President Lockhart    Well, our discount window obviously doesn’t apply to foreign   banks  Usually we make announcements like this before the market opens in the morning, probably   the optimal time to do that   August 16, 2007 12 of 37     President Lacker    Vice Chairman Geithner, can you respond?    Yes, go ahead    Okay  Thank you  Go ahead, Vice Chairman Geithner    Okay  President Rosengren    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser      I haven’t read the proposed FOMC statement  I was leaving   that for after this discussion  Perhaps I could read it now  You should have a copy  Here’s the   proposed statement    All right  That’s true  I’m sorry  So I’ll read it  I hope you   can get it from there   “Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and   increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth  In these   circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at   a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside risks to   growth have increased appreciably  The Committee is monitoring the situation and is   prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from   the disruptions in financial markets”   It still gives us our base case—“Recent data suggest that the economy has continued to   expand at a moderate pace”—and we say that we’re monitoring the situation and are prepared to act   as needed to mitigate the effects  Basically what we are doing here is acknowledging increased   risks  It’s a little ambiguous as to what the balance of risks is  Clearly, it raises the probability of   action—no question  I certainly don’t think, particularly if financial markets are somewhat calmer,   that it commits us to action, but it does increase the probability  It is possible that, given what the   markets are discounting for future actions, they’ll be disappointed with this statement, and we might   August 16, 2007 17 of 37    even get a de facto tightening  But I think we just need to state an accurate expression of our views   at this time    President Yellen    President Fisher    We take MBS in agencies even in open market operations    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Lacker    No    Thank you  I’d just comment on a couple of things you said   about sterilization  What we’re doing is effectively allowing the set of redeemable, tradable assets   to expand  Only if the markets are working in a way that there’s free arbitrage among assets is that   August 16, 2007 25 of 37    irrelevant  But I do agree with you actually that it’s not at all certain that this will have an effect  It   depends to some extent on how binding liquidity constraints are  I would argue that we do have   theories of liquidity constraints and that central banks have for centuries tried to address those  This   may not be effective  One reason, frankly, that I want to do this now is that I feel that we want to   make a clear distinction between actions taken to try to restore orderly markets and actions taken to   try to stabilize the economy  In doing this, we are exhausting in some sense the tools that we have   to address disorderly markets  Obviously the next step will have to be based on our economic   assessment  But I appreciate your comments  President Rosengren    Governor Kroszner    Okay  Governor Warsh    President Fisher    I just want to say that “no questions asked” applies to the   banks not to the assets  Go ahead, President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Hoenig    Governor Kroszner    Governor Mishkin    Because of the number of people who suggested the 75 basis   points, let me please ask Bill Dudley and Brian Madigan to comment on whether they think there   would be severe operational implications at 5½  Bill    Brian    Rick Mishkin    My proposal would be that we stay with 50 basis points, see   what happens, and leave open the option of revisiting the question as we see developments  Would   that be okay?   SEVERAL  Fine    President Moskow    Vice Chairman Geithner    Anyone else?  Okay  On the 75, I hear everybody  I know   there’s a difference of opinion  We are doing a very unconventional thing, as President Lacker   pointed out  I would not like to see it distorted by operational problems, so I would prefer to stay   with the 50 basis points for now  I do think that we could consider changes later   With respect to the statement, I just want to make one point  The thrust of “the existing   collateral margins will be maintained” is that there will not be any cut in the margins, that we will   maintain the margins at least at existing levels  Of course, if individual Reserve Bank Presidents   wish to tighten margins, that’s certainly within their power to do so  I hear President Lacker’s   principal objection  I otherwise believe I hear a consensus to undertake the changes to the primary   credit program  If no one objects, we will then ask you  We have two requests already in hand, one   from San Francisco and one from New York  The Board will vote after this meeting  We will ask   the rest of you to submit your requests after the announcement tomorrow morning, and we will get   to them and respond to them quickly  So I thank you very much for that   Let me read the statement one more time  I have a couple of thoughts  First, is there a sense   that adding the “going forward” is helpful?  I believe there was some sense that it was helpful  On   President Fisher’s comment about “having increased appreciably,” I think we need an adverb there   because we just said in the last FOMC statement that they have increased  So we need to ratchet it   up some  We could say “significantly” or some other word, but unless there are other comments, I   August 16, 2007 34 of 37    would recommend staying with “appreciably”  Also I believe that “prepared to act as needed”   encompasses the idea of either not moving or moving once or moving twice  I believe that “as” is a   more encompassing preposition, and I would recommend that we leave it as is  If there are no other   comments, I think it would be best for us to take a vote of FOMC members on the monetary policy   statement for the record  President Fisher    “Significantly”?    Go ahead    President Lockhart   August 16, 2007 35 of 37     No, sorry  That’s not strong enough    Materially?    I think the best alternative is “significantly,” if that’s   preferred  No?  “Appreciably” simply means that it’s detectable, large enough to detect    Okay  I think we’ve reached the limit of our ability to craft it    Do you have a two-hander here, Vice Chairman Geithner?      I would suggest that we vote but that the vote be recorded in   the minutes and not reported in the statement that we issue tomorrow morning, if that’s okay  Matt,   do you have the list of FOMC voters?    Why don’t you go ahead and read the list?     Appreciably    Okay  Thank you  If there’s no other comment, the meeting   is adjourned  Of course, we stand ready to reconvene      At the same time, yes  Let me ask the Board members to   remain on line because we have to vote on the discount rate request, but the meeting is adjourned    Thank you   END OF MEETING   August 16, 2007 37 of 37     "
8219,2007-09-18,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  I’d like to welcome Charlie Evans   to the table  Charlie is no stranger  He has been attending these meetings since February 1995,   certainly ahead of me  So congratulations and welcome    I’d also like to thank Cathy Minehan in absentia [laughter] for   being willing to postpone her celebratory lunch until the next meeting, but we will do that in   October  The first item of business is to select associate economists  With Brian Madigan   becoming the secretary and Mr Evans taking on a new role, we need to appoint two associate   economists  Jim Clouse from the Board and Dan Sullivan from Chicago have been nominated  Do   I have a motion?   SPEAKER  Moved    Moved  Discussion?  Thank you  All right  Let’s turn now to   the Desk operations  Bill    Are there any questions for Bill?  President Plosser    President Fisher    President Stern    Vice Chairman Geithner    One complexity in this whole period is that there is a   surprisingly large demand for dollars in Europe, which of course is early in the day  So the fed   funds rate was opening very, very high, very tight, and then there were judgments about how to   September 18, 2007 14 of 188    bring it down during the peak trading period of the US markets  That led to guesses about how   many reserves to inject before the end of the day  So the dysfunction in the normal interbank   market process—precautionary demand for dollars in Europe—led to some very unusual stresses   early in the day, which complicated Bill’s job considerably    Oh, we all love Bill  [Laughter]    President Lacker    Are there other questions for Bill?  If not, I need a vote to   ratify domestic open market operations    Without objection  Thank you  May we turn now to the staff   presentation on the economic situation?  Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson will start with the   economic overview, and then Brian will make a few comments on the projections that we   submitted  Dave     Thank you  Mr Stockton has been reading Upton Sinclair,   I think  [Laughter]  Questions for our colleagues?  President Evans      President Plosser   September 18, 2007 27 of 188     President Poole    I see a two-handed intervention     President Fisher    Other questions?  If not, we are ready for our economic go-  round  For President Evans’s benefit, we do have two-handed interventions as a possibility  It’s   like the discount window—rarely used but there if you need it      There’s no stigma  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  The news about the Italian strike is concerning   me considerably  [Laughter]    President Fisher, you raised a legitimate issue, which I think I   should address now  We will this afternoon be discussing this auction credit facility with a possible   September 18, 2007 43 of 188    swap that would allow the Europeans to provide term dollar funding as well  This work has been   going on for a few weeks  It has been very intensive  The staff has done a great job, but as you   know and as Bill explained, the financial market conditions have improved somewhat in the past   few days, and so we view it—I view it and I think the Board views it now—as a relatively close call   as to whether such a facility is needed at this juncture  What I would propose to do is discuss it as   planned on the agenda  We would like to have a thorough discussion and, if the Committee   approves the contingent permission, to use it should market conditions appear, in our judgment, to   warrant it  But just because, as you point out, there is some interaction with the monetary policy   decision, I’d just like to say that, at this point, it is not by any means a certainty that we will go   ahead and apply that particular agency    Sure  President Plosser    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  Let’s put President Poole between us and the   coffee break  President Poole  [Laughter]  Sorry    Before  Go ahead    Thank you  Sorry to have put you on the spot there  It is   1110  Why don’t we take a break until 1130?  Thank you    [Coffee break]    President Stern    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you, and thank you all  Let me just briefly   summarize and make a few additional comments  Financial market conditions were a key theme   of our discussion today  Recent developments in financial markets have been reflected in   reduced willingness to take risk and in tighter credit conditions  Bank balance sheets are a   potential constraint on credit extension  Participants were unsure about how long these   conditions would persist, but the repricing of risk seems likely to be persistent  The tighter credit   conditions will very likely weaken an already very weak housing market, as nonprime borrowers   are rationed out and jumbo mortgage borrowers pay higher premiums  Mortgage rate resets and   foreclosures pose further risks  Industries related to housing are naturally showing weakness    However, creditworthy borrowers are able to obtain credit  Second-quarter and third-quarter   GDP figures may be solid, but even so there have been some signs of slowing in the economy,   even before the financial market developments, notably in the labor markets and in housing    Auto output is also on the weak side  Labor markets do remain tight, and in general Main Street   has been far less affected thus far than Wall Street  Consumer spending continues to grow along   with incomes, and net exports remain strong  Financing should continue to be available for   capital investment  There were some regional differences in soundings on business confidence   and expectations, but in any case, uncertainty has increased  Some of the key questions include   whether the further weakness of housing will spread to consumer spending; whether credit   September 18, 2007 91 of 188    tightness will affect sectors other than housing, including the household sector and commercial   real estate; and whether the labor market will continue to slow  There is a general view that   downside risks to output have increased with some very bad scenarios at least conceivable    However, others noted the resilience of the US economy and the fact that previous financial   crises had not necessarily reduced growth  Inflation has moderated somewhat, and more   participants view the risk to inflation as closer to balance  Inflation expectations remain stable,   and cyclical slowing is likely to reduce the pressure on resources  However, tight labor markets,   strong foreign demand, high oil prices, and other pressures still do exist   Are there any questions or comments?  Let me just make, as I said, a few extra comments   here  More so than usual, we have to look forward rather than backward  We have to try to   assess how these recent developments change the outlook, and that is very difficult  To me, the   critical elements to look at are housing and labor markets  I think the interaction of those two   sectors will determine the dynamics of the economy  There has been some discussion about the   fact that in 1998 there was very little effect of the financial markets on the real economy  There   was no obvious channel of effect in that episode  In this case, there is, I think, a pretty clear   channel of effect through mortgage lending, and we have already seen changes in availability of   mortgages and changes in cancellations, sales expectations, and the like  I would note that there   are also—as you can see in the consumer confidence numbers, for example—expectations on the   buyer side  If buyers think that the housing market is going to be very weak, they will be less   likely to want to get into it  Finally, credit availability to homebuilders may also be an issue  So   I think there is pretty much a consensus that the housing sector will take another leg down based   on financial market conditions  I mention parenthetically that I have some concerns also about a   September 18, 2007 92 of 188    few other areas, notably commercial real estate, and perhaps others like consumer credit and   autos as well; but, again, I think the focus should be on housing   On the labor side, I think we can parse the job report numbers in some detail  For   example, on the one hand, the August report was not quite as weak as the markets thought it was    On the other hand, it revised down some previous numbers  So overall there seems to be a sense   that labor markets were slowing a bit before the financial crisis  Even so, we have been   expecting weakening in labor markets for some time, and I think now that the odds of that are   really quite high  I do expect to see continued expansion in construction layoffs  There are   losses of jobs, obviously, in mortgage finance and other related areas  So I don’t know how   quickly the labor market will weaken, but I do believe that it will weaken over the next couple of   quarters   Now, those are two predictions  Then the question is, What is the interaction between   those two things?  I think there is potential for a negative feedback cycle, which is of some   concern  If labor markets weaken, particularly if they weaken severely in certain local areas, it   will hurt house prices through two mechanisms  First, house prices capitalize employment and   other economic opportunities in an area, so house prices will fall as economic activity slows    Second, the demand for housing or the ability to make house payments directly depends on labor   income  Working in the other direction, as house prices fall, the normal wealth effects, but also   possible precautionary saving effects or other liquidity effects, could begin to affect consumer   confidence and consumer spending, and we get the makings of a potential recessionary dynamic   that may be difficult to head off  That is the scenario that concerns me  I don’t know if it’s the   modal scenario, but I think it’s one we need to watch very carefully   September 18, 2007 93 of 188    Beyond that scenario, there are further tail risks  As a number of people have mentioned,   most recently Governor Mishkin, these financial effects—financial accelerator effects, if you   will—can be quite nonlinear  The Greenbook has a 2 percent decline in house prices in each of   the next two years  It’s very possible that the decline could be greater than that  Even if it’s not   greater than that, it will not be uniformly distributed around the country  In some parts of the   country, house price declines will be much more significant  The nonlinearity I’m talking about   has to do with the distribution of equity among families  If you have a 10 percent decline in   house prices and two families, each of which has 50 percent equity in their home, then each   family is going to experience basically the normal wealth effect  But if one family has 100   percent equity and the other has 5 to 10 percent equity, the effects on behavior will not be linear    There will be a bigger effect on the family that finds itself in financial stress, and the possibility   exists that weakening in these markets could feed back into some of the financial problems we   are seeing  So I am concerned about getting ahead of what could be an adverse dynamic   between the job market and the housing market   On inflation, I think the slowing that we are likely to see will probably remove some of   the upside risk that we have been concerned about  I don’t know how these housing   developments will affect owners’ equivalent rent  We saw some perverse effects last time  They   are still possible  A very small piece of information is that the PPI numbers yesterday actually   had some favorable news in them in terms of both intermediate goods and medical costs  So the   near term still looks to be fairly good  But I don’t dismiss inflation risks by any means, and we   know that policy changes can work through expectations as well as through resource pressure,   and so I consider that to be a serious concern  Nevertheless, I do at this point think the principal   risks are to the downside, and the interaction between different components of the economy   September 18, 2007 94 of 188    presents the biggest challenge in that respect  I will stop there  Brian, if you are ready to   introduce the policy alternatives now    Thank you  Are there any questions?  If not, we’ll have our   policy go-round  Many people have already tipped their hands  We do have a 215 constraint, so I   hope that people will keep that in mind  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser      Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  As you know, I’m an advocate of two-day   meetings  This is exactly why  Michelle informs me that our true drop-dead time is 145  So we do   need, please, to be efficient  Next is President Lockhart    President Pianalto    Thank you very much  President Lacker    Thank you  President Evans   September 18, 2007 108 of 188     President Evans joins the table with twelve years of   experience already  [Laughter]    Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Poole     Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner      Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Thank you very much, everyone  The one person   at the table who I know is going to be right is President Hoenig, who says that whatever we do is   going to be criticized  I can write the Wall Street Journal editorial for tomorrow  [Laughter]  I just   want to say that I think that moral hazard is a terribly misunderstood idea and that as the central   bank we have a responsibility to help markets function normally and to promote economic stability   broadly speaking  We are not in the business of bailing out individuals or businesses  As long as   we make that distinction, I think we’re fine, but it may be history that agrees to that rather than the   newspapers   So I do advocate 50 basis points  The modal assessment of the Greenbook suggests that at   least 50 basis points are needed to restore a pre-financial-crisis neutrality  There have been some   differences about how severe this is likely to be, but something on that order of magnitude seems   about right  There seem to be significant tail risks, and I think some insurance is worthwhile  Quite   September 18, 2007 118 of 188    frankly, I thought about the alternative C option—25 basis points and a downward bias  One of the   concerns I have would be that turmoil during the intermeeting period would sort of force us to come   in and do the next 25, and I would rather say that we did what we had to do—we are moving at the   meeting—and let the markets absorb that  I also want to agree with Rick and others who have noted   that we should be prepared to take this back, and I state that for the record   On the statement, I prefer alternative B  I have struggled with President Pianalto’s   interesting suggestion about deleting the last clause in paragraph 2  I guess in the end I would prefer   to leave it as it is  What this is doing is two things  First, we’re trying very much to clarify in this   paragraph that what we care about are the effects on the broader economy  That is, financial market   disruptions have occurred, but we are trying to ameliorate the effects on the broader economy    Second, we need in some sense to play a little defense in that this is a sharp change from the   statement of August 7  What has changed since August 7?  Well, clearly, the most obvious thing   that has changed is the financial market situation, which in turn has fed through to housing and other   parts of the economy   With respect to the assessment of risks, I think what the market wants to hear is that we get   it, that we’re here, that we are ready to move as needed, and that we pay attention to both parts of   our mandate  I do think that it’s a little premature to make that a balance of risks, and the inherent   flexibility here is useful  President Lacker’s comment that this is actually a downside balance of   risks is an interesting one  It might be taken that way to the extent that markets think that the   economy will deteriorate much further and the Fed will have to respond  But our perspective is that   we will respond as needed, and we should be careful to emphasize that in public—in the minutes   and elsewhere  So that’s my recommendation—50 basis points and alternative B  Are there further   comments?  If not, could you please call the roll?   September 18, 2007 119 of 188     Thank you very much  We can recess now for half an hour   for lunch  The Board of Governors will vote, but the rest can recess for lunch  [Laughter]  During   lunch, our Congressional Liaison person, Laricke Blanchard, will give us an informal update on   congressional matters  We will try to reconvene around 200   [Meeting recessed for lunch]    Why don’t we reconvene our meeting?  Item 5 on the   agenda is communication  We have a couple of things to do  Scott Alvarez and his colleagues   have prepared a memo, which you received, on the issue of voting on the full statement  Could   September 18, 2007 120 of 188    you give us a brief overview, Scott, and then I’d like, if possible, just to get a sense of the table    I hope we don’t have to get into a lengthy discussion    Are there any questions for Scott?  Well, it appears that one   thing we can do is just do it  Precedents have been pretty effective in this Committee  For   example, our circulation of table 1 has become a regular modus operandi  That does leave   flexibility  On the other hand, if others would like to go further, that’s fine with me  Is it the   sense of the Committee that simply beginning to adopt this action would be adequate?   SEVERAL  Yes    My sense of the table is, then, that we will just begin the   practice at the next meeting of voting on the entire statement  That, of course, raises the   possibility for dissent based on the statement  We have to use good judgment on that particular   decision  If there is dissent on the statement, Scott, it would be explained in the minutes?    That’s the same practice we use for a dissent on the action    Yes    Well, if our communication schedule continues along   current lines—and we can discuss that next—it would in fact be in these minutes that we made   this decision, right?    So would it be okay if we just put this in the October   minutes, reflecting the first time we took that action?    All right  In that case, it would be part of the overall   description  Okay  That’s a good suggestion  Thank you  Anyone else?    That’s true    Well, we also have another element coming up right now—  an update by Governor Kohn on the communication strategy    All else being equal, we’ll try to get it into the October   minutes  But if it turns out to be a problem, we’ll address it  Any other comments?  Don, do you   want to update us on the projections?    Governor Mishkin       Other comments?  Vice Chairman?    I think the staff shouldn’t hesitate to talk about different   points of view  It is not at all necessary to come up with or try to manufacture a consensus   narrative        President Rosengren    We have a section on the risks, though, right?      Other comments?  Okay  Thank you  Our last item is   approaches to stabilizing money markets  Let me make, if I might, just a few introductory   comments about where this came from and what we’re asking of you today  As we have been   thinking about various money market issues, two things have come up  One is that there have   actually been a surprisingly large number of problems in dollar markets in Europe—that is,   banks that need dollar-based funding   Debbie reminds me that this is a joint Board-FOMC meeting and that I need a motion    Without objection  Thank you  The first issue is the need   for dollar funding and dollar term funding by European banks, which has caused problems in   Europe but also has bled over to some extent to dollar markets in the United States  We have   been in conversations at various times with Europe about a swap arrangement that would provide   September 18, 2007 127 of 188    dollars to Europe to address this issue, but the issue has not yet, obviously, been brought to you   as a Committee  The second issue that we have been looking at is how to address the stigma of   the discount window  Are there ways to provide liquidity that would help normalize money   markets, particularly term money markets, and would allow banks to make use of the enormous   amount of collateral they have at the discount window, but would avoid the stigma and create a   more efficient system?  The solution that the staff came up with on that was to have an auction   facility that would essentially set an endogenous price and, because it was an auction, it might   look more like a good business proposition rather than like a move of desperation and, therefore,   would not have the same stigma  So there are these two separate issues—the auction facility as a   way of addressing the stigma of the discount window and the swap as a way of getting dollars   into the European dollar markets  Some conversations that I had, in particular with President   Trichet of the European Central Bank, came up with the possibility of combining these two   things, essentially having auctions simultaneously in the United States and in Europe, and then   using the swap markets to provide the dollars to the extent that the ECB would like to have them    The Swiss National Bank expressed interest in joining this as well  In a moment you will be   hearing from the staff a few details about these proposals   Now, let me just say a couple of things  First, one thing on governance is that the rules   here are that the auction credit facility requires an amendment of regulation, which is a province   of the Board, so in that respect it’s a Board decision  However, obviously, the Bank presidents   are very much involved in this because it would involve discount window management, and   therefore, I think it’s fair for us to have the discussion of this from the perspective of the entire   Committee  Second, the swaps would be, of course, a decision of the FOMC, and they obviously   would need a vote    September 18, 2007 128 of 188    We began working on this some weeks ago when the markets were in a particularly   stressful condition, and our hope was to try to normalize those markets  As I said earlier today,   the markets seem to be getting better, and this may not be the exact moment that we want to be   doing this  However, it might be a good idea to have this process or, alternatively, the two   separate processes—we could do either one without the other—available should market   conditions demand it  So what I would like to propose is that we have a presentation; some   comments, discussion, and questions from you; and we’ll get a sense of the Committee in terms   of where you are on this  What I will commit to is that we won’t take any votes today, but   before using either option or a combination of both options, we will have a videoconference and   ask for your formal approval of the swaps and at least your consent to the ACF  So we are not   planning to implement this immediately, but we would like to have the possibility of having it as   an option, should money markets seem to require it  So with that, let me turn to the staff    Yes, please    They will be very general—something like there was a   discussion of means to address money market issues     Exactly  President Lacker    Go ahead    Why don’t you go ahead and make your presentation, and   then we’ll take questions    Are there questions for the staff?  President Fisher    Governor Kroszner     President Rosengren, question?    Governor Mishkin had a question   September 18, 2007 139 of 188     Okay  President Fisher    Other questions?  President Hoenig    Any other questions before we take general comments?    Governor Kroszner    Governor Kohn   September 18, 2007 142 of 188     Okay  Why don’t we start our go-round?  President Lacker    Let me echo what you first said and congratulate the staff on   an enormous amount of work and a terrific presentation  I do want to just say a word, President   Lacker  Most of your arguments are premised on the idea that markets are basically in some kind of   equilibrium and we’re just messing with the equilibrium  There’s a longstanding tradition, both in   central banking and in theoretical analysis, that you can have periods when there is insufficient cash   in the market and prices are, therefore, driven away from fundamentals by the lack of cash  What   central banks do is provide cash against collateral  I refer you, for example, to Franklin Allen and   Douglas Gale’s new book, Understanding Financial Crises, in which they present a model with   exactly that property    The moral hazard issue is the following  There is a good reason to allow some deviation of   cash-based valuations from fundamentals because it creates incentives for providing sufficient   liquidity and rewards those who have sufficient liquidity  But beyond a certain range, the models as   well as central banking experience suggest that, when you have a fire sale type of situation, then the   central bank can be useful by providing cash against that collateral  Essentially this process would   take $140 billion of undervalued, hard-to-sell, or illiquid assets onto the central bank’s balance sheet   and provide term liquid funding in its place, which I find totally consistent with Bagehot and the   traditions of central bank lending  Now, the question arises whether the market is in sufficient   September 18, 2007 147 of 188    distress  If it’s not, then we’re in the first regime where some deviation of values from   fundamentals is legitimate  If the market is in extreme distress, I think—I repeat what I said   before—there can be situations in which markets are simply not functioning well and there could be   a lot of reasons for that in which case the central bank could help the market function better  I agree   that some of these issues about bid size and so on do confuse the issue  We need to make a strong   distinction between helping these markets to function better—we can address, for example, some of   the counterparty risk because we have all this collateral in our discount windows—and helping or   bailing out any individual institution  I agree with you that we certainly want to avoid that   perception if at all possible  President Rosengren    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  President Hoenig    Okay  President Poole    This is news to me, by the way, because the logic of this was   that the normal spread between the overnight index swap and term funds is about 10 basis points   September 18, 2007 151 of 188     But the OIS captures that—the one-month OIS    I would suggest that we not get too involved in this  I think   we ought to be as transparent as possible   September 18, 2007 152 of 188     Thank you  President Fisher   September 18, 2007 153 of 188     Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    President Stern    Governor Kohn   September 18, 2007 159 of 188     Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    So thank you very much  I appreciated this discussion a great   deal  I did not hear a great deal of opposition to the principle that the Federal Reserve at times   should help markets function when they are in a state of panic or otherwise in serious dysfunction    So in that respect, I think that this is the kind of tool that under some circumstances might prove   quite useful  You did raise a large number of practical issues, political issues, optical issues, and so   September 18, 2007 167 of 188    on  You all said that you wanted to think about it, and I’m going to take you up on that  Please   think about it  Please consult with your staffs, and then let me to please ask our staffs in New York   and Washington to see if some of these issues can be addressed, and let us continue to think about   under what circumstances this might be useful  You know, just because you have a hammer doesn’t   mean that every problem is a nail, right?  [Laughter]  So we do need to think further about the   circumstances under which this kind of intervention would improve market functioning and reduce   financial stress in an appropriate way  Fortunately, it does not appear that we need to act today  But   as Vice Chairman Geithner points out, markets are fragile and the possibility that we might come   back to you in three days or a week or two weeks or whatever should not be discounted  So thank   you very much for your comments     The next meeting is October 30 and 31, a two-day meeting, and we will also have Cathy   Minehan’s farewell lunch at that meeting  Thank you again  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING      September 18, 2007 168 of 188     "
8242,2007-10-30,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  This meeting is Karen   Johnson’s last  She attended her first meeting in 1991 and has been a regular participant for the   past ten years, so she has ninety-one total FOMC meetings to her credit  Karen has been briefing   the FOMC on international financial and economic matters since she became head of the   International Finance Division in 1997, and she has done a great job of covering about 95   percent of the world’s population and about two-thirds or more of the world’s economic activity    Also, as the head of IF, she has logged an awful lot of miles to World Bank–IMF meetings, the   BIS, and elsewhere  She has given me a lot of good advice on jetlag, I can assure you  She is   going to finance her retirement with frequent-flyer miles  [Laughter]  So, Karen, I am sure every   member of the Committee would like to join me in thanking you for your dedication and your   excellent advice and counsel  Best of luck  [Applause]    I have the less pleasant duty of reminding everybody about   the Wall Street Journal article on our communications policy that appeared some time ago  I   don’t think anybody actually leaked the story, because the way Greg Ip works is that he goes   around and talks to each person and gets a little of the story and then builds it up in that way    Nevertheless, I think it is obviously bad for our institution when our internal deliberations   become public, and so let me just ask everyone, please, to be especially careful about   maintaining confidentiality  Thank you   October 30-31, 2007 4 of 162    For our first item today, in light of Karen’s retirement, we would like to propose Nathan   Sheets to be an economist for the FOMC until the first meeting of 2008  Do I have a motion?   SEVERAL  So moved    Without objection  Thank you  Next, we turn to Bill   Dudley    Thank you very much  Are there questions for Bill?  No   questions?  Okay  Then, may I have a motion to ratify?    Without objection  Thank you  A very thorough briefing    I don’t know if we will have the same luck over on this side  [Laughter]  Let me turn to Dave   Stockton to begin the economic situation report    Thank you  Are there questions for our colleagues?  Vice   Chairman Geithner?    President Plosser    Of course, we have multiple estimates  [Laughter]    President Poole    Other questions?  If not, we’re ready for our economic go-  round  President Hoenig     Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Yes, sir, Vice Chairman    Yes    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Pianalto   October 30-31, 2007 40 of 162     Thank you  President Lacker    But not Texas    The Chair is calling for order    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  We have been extraordinarily efficient today    Why don’t we take a coffee break and come back at 430?   [Coffee break]    Let’s reconvene  Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  Governor Kohn     Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Thank you everyone  Let me try to summarize   this discussion  It is a little harder than usual  Broadly, the macroeconomic news came in   slightly better than expected during the intermeeting period  Housing has been very weak, as   expected; but consumption, investment, and net exports were relatively strong in recent months    In the aggregate data, there is yet no clear sign of a spillover from housing  Most participants   expect several weak quarters followed by recovery later next year   The risks remain to the downside but may be less than at our last meeting  One issue,   given all these factors, is determining the equilibrium short-term interest rate  Financial market   conditions have improved somewhat since our last meeting, with investors discriminating among   October 30-31, 2007 69 of 162    borrowers and with the process of price discovery proceeding  There was general agreement that   conditions are not back to normal and that it would be some time before that happened  Some   suggested that a risk of relapse remains, should credit quality worsen or further bad news be   disclosed  Lending conditions have tightened, particularly for mortgages, and securitization   remains impaired  There is not yet much evidence that this tightening is affecting business   borrowing, however, although financial conditions may have somewhat increased uncertainty   among business leaders     Views on how consumption would evolve were mixed  Consumer sentiment is on the   weak side, house prices are down, and oil prices are up, which suggests some weakening ahead    However, the labor market remains reasonably solid, which should support consumer spending    Anecdotal information about consumer spending was unusually mixed  Some saw evidence of   growing weakness in consumption  This evidence included weak reports from shippers and   credit card companies  Others saw the consumer side as slowing a bit but generally healthy    Investment, including investment in commercial real estate, may also be slowing somewhat; but   again, the evidence is mixed  Manufacturing growth appears to be moderating  Other sectors—  including energy, agriculture, high-tech, and tourism—are doing well  Core inflation has   moderated, and there was generally more comfort that this improvement would persist  There   was less concern expressed about tightness in labor markets and wage pressures  Energy prices   and food prices could lead total inflation to rise, perhaps even into next year, and there is the risk   of pass-through to the core  Similar concerns apply to the dollar and to export prices  Some, but   not all, TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations have risen, and survey-based measures   have been stable  Most participants saw inflation risks to the upside, but at least some saw them   as less pressing than earlier this year  That is my summary  Comments?     October 30-31, 2007 70 of 162    Well, again, as usual, it is hard to be the last person to speak, but let me make just a few   comments  First, as always, the Greenbook was very thoughtful  The authors have done a good   job of balancing the risks, and I find their forecast very plausible as a modal forecast  Housing   does seem to be very weak, of course, and manufacturing looks to be slowing further  But   except for those sectors, there is a good bit of momentum still in the economy  Having said that,   I think there is an unusual amount of uncertainty around the modal forecast, maybe less than in   September but still a great deal   Let me talk briefly about three areas  financial markets, housing, and inflation  A lot of   people have already spoken about financial markets  Market functioning certainly has improved    Our action in September helped on that  For example, commercial paper markets are working   almost normally for good borrowers, the spreads are down, and volumes are stable  One concern   that we had for quite a while was that banks would be facing binding balance sheet constraints   because of all the contingent liabilities that they had—off-balance-sheet vehicles, leveraged   loans, and so on  That problem seems to be somewhat less than it was  Some of the leveraged   loans are being sold off, some of the worst off-balance-sheet vehicles are being wound down  So   there is generally improvement in the financial market, certainly  In the past couple of weeks   there has been some deterioration in sentiment, and I see that as coming from essentially two   factors  First, there were a number of reports of unusually large and unanticipated losses, which   reduced the confidence of investors that we had detected and unearthed all the bad news  This   problem will eventually be resolved, but clearly we still have some way to go to clarify where   people stand  The other issue, which I think is more pertinent to our discussion, is about   economic fundamentals  There was a very bad response, for example, to Caterpillar’s profit   October 30-31, 2007 71 of 162    report, and so the market is appropriately responding to economic fundamentals as they feed   through into credit concerns   From our perspective, one of the key issues will be the availability of credit to consumers   and firms going forward  My sense—based on my talking to supervisors, looking at the senior   loan officer survey, and talking to some people in the markets—is that banks are becoming quite   conservative, and that is what Kevin said  It is not necessarily a balance sheet constraint but   more a concern about renewed weakness in markets  It is also a concern about the condition of   borrowers, about credit risk, and the demands of investors for very tight underwriting  Now, of   course, tight underwriting is not a bad thing; it is a good thing  But from our perspective, we   need to think about its potential implications for growth and, if you like, for r*  The biggest   effect of the tighter underwriting, of course, has been on mortgage loans, although we have seen   a bit of improvement in the secondary market for prime jumbos, which is encouraging if that   continues  This is the area in which vicious-circle effects, which Vice Chairman Geithner and   others have talked about, is most concerning  House prices, according to the Greenbook, are   projected to fall 4½ percent over the next two years  Clearly, there is some downside risk to that    If house prices were to fall much more, that would feed into credit evaluations, into balance   sheets, back into credit extension, and so on  So I think there is a risk there, as Governor   Kroszner and Governor Mishkin also discussed  The corporate sector is not much of a problem    Good firms are issuing debt without much problem  I don’t really have much read on small   business, but I have not heard much complaining in that area either  With respect to consumers,   my guess is that we are going to see some effects on consumers  Certainly, home equity loans   and installment loans have tightened up  We can see that in the senior loan officer survey  We   don’t see that yet for credit cards, but since a lot of credit cards are used by people with subprime   October 30-31, 2007 72 of 162    credit histories, I suspect that we will see some tightening there  So I do expect to see some   effect on consumers from credit conditions   As has already been mentioned, an area we also need to note is commercial real estate    Financing conditions have already tightened there quite considerably, and spreads are much   wider  The senior loan officer survey shows the tightening of terms and conditions that matches   previous recessions, and CMBS issuance has dropped very significantly  You can debate   whether or not this tightening is justified by fundamentals  On the one hand, vacancy rates   remain low, and rents are high  On the other hand, it is still also true that price-to-rent ratios are   quite high  If you calculate an equity risk premium for commercial real estate analogously to the   way you calculate one for stocks, you would find that it is at an unusually low level, which   would tend to suggest that prices may fall  So it is uncertain, I would say  Certainly one area in   which we might see further retrenchment in commercial real estate is the public sector  Tax   receipts are slowing, and that might affect building decisions  So I do think this is another area   in which we will be seeing some effects from credit tightening  I should be clear—the   Greenbook already incorporates a considerable slowdown in commercial real estate, but that   means it will no longer offset the residential slowdown   I just want to make one comment about housing, which I think we all agree is a central   source of uncertainty, both for the credit reasons I have discussed and in terms of prices, wealth,   and other issues  Let me just make one point that I found striking anyway, which is that—at   least from the Greenbook—the forecast of a strengthening economy by next spring and the   second half of next year is very closely tied to the assumption that housing will turn around next   spring  In particular, if you look at all the final demand components for the economy, other than   housing, in 2007 those components contributed 35 percentage points to GDP  According to the   October 30-31, 2007 73 of 162    Greenbook forecast, in 2008 all those components together will contribute 20 percentage points   to GDP  So the fact that GDP doesn’t slow any more than 06 comes from the assumption that   the negative contribution of housing next year will be much less than it was in this year  It is   certainly possible—again, I think the Greenbook authors have done a good job of balancing the   risks  But as we have noted, we have missed this turn before, and it could happen again  So let   me just note that as an important issue  If we do miss on that turn, the other forecast errors for   consumption and so on obviously would be correlated with that miss   Finally, let me talk for a moment about inflation  I want to share the concerns that some   people have noted  If you wanted to be defensive about inflation, you could point out that the   movement in oil prices and the dollar and so on is in part due to our actions  But it is also due to   a lot of other things—for example, the dollar in broad real terms is about where it was in the late   ’90s  In that respect, it is perhaps about where it should be in terms of trying to make progress   on the current account deficit  Similarly, with oil, a lot of other factors besides monetary policy   are involved  That said, I share with Governor Warsh the concern that the visibility of these   indicators day after day in financial markets and on television screens has a risk of affecting   inflation psychology  I do worry about that  I think we should pay attention to that  So I do   think that is a concern, and we obviously need to take it into consideration in our policies, in our   statements, and in our public remarks   I have one more comment on housing before ending  In thinking about the turnaround   for housing next year, Governor Kroszner talked about resets and those sorts of issues  We   spend a lot of time here at the Board thinking about different plans for refinancing subprime   borrowers or other borrowers into sustainable mortgages  We have looked at the FHA and other   types of approaches  A very interesting paper by an economist named Joseph Mason at Drexel   October 30-31, 2007 74 of 162    discusses, at a very detailed institutional level, the issues related to refinancing, in terms both of   the servicers’ incentives and of the regulatory perspective  Mason points out that there are some   serious regulatory problems with the massive refinancing effort, including consumer protection   issues, because refinancing can be a source of scams  There are also issues of safety and   soundness because refinancing can be a way to disguise losses, for example  If you read that   paper, I think you will be persuaded—at least I am becoming increasingly persuaded—that a   significant amount of refinancing will not be happening and that we will see substantial financial   problems and foreclosures that will peak somewhere in the middle of next year  So I think that is   an additional risk that we ought to take into account as we think about the evolution of housing   Those are just a few comments on the general outlook  Let me just note, we will adjourn   in a moment  There will be a reception and a dinner, for those of you who wish to stay  There   will be no program or business, so if you have other plans, feel free to pursue them  A number   of pieces of data, including GDP, will arrive overnight, and we will begin tomorrow morning   with a discussion of the new data  Perhaps that will help us in our discussion of policy  Thank   you  The meeting is adjourned   [Meeting recessed]   October 30-31, 2007 75 of 162    October 31, 2007—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody  Let’s start with Dave Stockton,   who will bring us up to date on the overnight data releases    Any questions for Dave?  President Fisher     Other questions for Dave?  President Rosengren?    Brian?    Thank you  Other questions?  If not, Brian?   October 30-31, 2007 81 of 162     Brian, do I have it correctly that the blue shows the change   between the Bluebook and the current version?    So the only changes from the Bluebook in A-3 and C-3 are   that there’s a more expansive description of the inflation risks, and in A-4 there is simply the   phrase “after this action”  Those are the only changes from the Bluebook  Are there any   questions for Brian?  President Evans     Governor Mishkin     President Fisher    Are there any other questions?  President Rosengren    President Poole    It’s a separate agenda item    Yes  Are there any other questions for Brian?  If not,   President Lacker     Thank you  President Hoenig    I’m sorry  You prefer C-4 to B-4, is that what you said?    So that is basically the September assessment    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you      Yes, Vice Chairman    President Yellen    Thank you  President Rosengren    President Lacker    Just for clarification—and, Brian, you can correct me—we are   not going to publish the histogram showing the risks  We will describe verbally, generally   speaking, the Committee’s views  President Evans    Thank you  Governor Mishkin   October 30-31, 2007 109 of 162     Thank you  It’s a little past 1030  Coffee is available  Why   don’t we recess until 1100?  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Let’s recommence with President Fisher    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Stern      Governor Mishkin    Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Thank you all  Well, it has been said many times,   but this is very, very close, and I’ve thought about it quite a bit, obviously  I have a lot of sympathy   for President Plosser’s very clear analysis  There have been good data since the last meeting  We   have talked about the importance of spillovers  We have not so far seen evident spillovers from   housing into other sectors  We did take a preemptive action in the last meeting  Inflation is a   concern  I think not immediately, but some of the factors like input costs are there, and market   October 30-31, 2007 125 of 162    expectations alone are obviously not a reason to move  All of those things are valid, and I have   thought about all of them    So why do I favor a cut?  Most of the arguments have been made  The downside risks are   quite significant, if the housing situation, including prices, really deteriorates  I think part of the   difference between what the market sees about housing and what we see is that we are a little more   sanguine about price behavior than the market is, and a decline in prices has effects both on   consumers and on the credit system  So I think that risk is fairly important and may swamp some of   the other issues  There is some new information that is relevant  The senior loan officer survey and   other information suggest that credit conditions are tightening and that this will have an effect, I   believe, in some significant markets, certainly including housing  Other information, like consumer   sentiment and consumers’ views of the labor market, suggests some slowing and some weakening    The decline in sentiment in the markets in the past two weeks is very interesting  On one level I feel   as though we failed to communicate somehow; however, I don’t know exactly where the mistake   was  The markets seem to be responding to information about earnings reports and projections of   future activity and so on, both in the financial sector and in the real sector, and as a number of   people have said, I don’t think we can entirely ignore that information  So I think there are some   good reasons on the real side to take out a bit more insurance, as has been said  I agree with the   Vice Chairman that the credit markets probably could stand the surprise, but they have become   somewhat more uncertain, and I think their basic problem is macro uncertainty  It has to do with   concerns about tail risk, and that is something that we can, I think, address a bit   The point has been made a number of times, first by President Yellen, that the current rate   could be construed as being slightly restrictive and that creates an argument for a somewhat lower   October 30-31, 2007 126 of 162    rate  An additional argument is that the core inflation rate has come down some since last year, and   so the real federal funds rate on that basis has gone up   Finally, an argument that I would bring to you is about tactics, and the Vice Chairman also   alluded to this  Most of the paths that we submitted include a path for policy that is perhaps slightly   lower than the current one, and the question is how we do this  If we take alternative B, which I   think is the most obvious alternative, on the one hand we don’t take an action and on the other hand   we express alarm about the economy and say we’ll probably be cutting in the future  That makes   calibrating how the longer-term expectations will respond to that very difficult  I think it would, on   balance, tighten expectations a bit because we didn’t act, but it does create some uncertainty  The   advantage of alternative A, even as we take a cut, is that we will, I hope, curb expectations for   sustained additional cuts through several mechanisms  First, in the economic growth paragraph, we   have switched language from actions “intended to help forestall”—very indirect—to “should help   forestall,” suggesting that we are now more confident in our ability to prevent bad outcomes in the   economy  Second, we have—and this will certainly be noticed—taken note of energy and   commodity prices, among other factors, and we have highlighted our concerns about inflation    Third, the rough balance of risks certainly indicates that we are not eager to cut again quickly unless   the data clearly support it  So a lot of this is tactical, about how to take control of expectations—  you know, how to manage the market’s views of our policies  And I just felt a bit more comfortable   with taking the action but then using that to recalibrate our balance of risks  For what it is worth, 75   basis points of easing has been pretty much the standard Fed medicine for financial crises ever since   1970 or so; in that respect we are in good company  That’s my recommendation—25 basis points   with alternative A  Any questions or comments?    What exactly was the Mishkin amendment?    I worry about that  For example, by saying that the action   “should help forestall” instead of “is intended to forestall” I think we address that    The other comment that came up, I think President Hoenig   and President Stern mentioned it, is not exactly softening but emphasizing the uncertainty that   surrounds our judgment  So another possibility, and I have always regretted making suggestions on   the statement, is that we could take the first sentence from the September paragraph 4, cut out the   phrase “since the Committee’s last regular meeting,” and say, “Developments in financial markets   have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook  However, the Committee judges   that   ,” and we could put that at the beginning of the assessment of risks  Is that as appealing?  I   don’t know  I guess my prejudice is, unless there is strong sentiment, to stay with what we have   because that is what people have talked about    Okay  I withdraw that  Any other comments?  All right  If   not, Ms Danker will call the roll  Let’s just note for the record that for the first time we will be   voting on the entire statement   October 30-31, 2007 128 of 162     Thank you very much  I need to have the Board for a   moment   [Meeting recessed]    Let me just address quickly the last item on the agenda, which   is communications  On October 19, you received a memo from the subcommittee that describes the   latest round of changes to the projections  I won’t repeat what they are, but if there are questions,   we can take them  I don’t believe we received any comments on this round  I’ll talk in a moment   about getting this ready for prime time  But what I’d like to talk about now is, as I discussed in   September, asking the Committee for a consensus to release these projections  They would be   October 30-31, 2007 129 of 162    released with the minutes of the current meeting on November 20, which is one day less than three   weeks because Wednesday is the day before Thanksgiving  So we would release it on Tuesday    The necessary explanation of the projections—what they mean and how to interpret them—would   be in a speech that I propose to give on November 14  That speech would be preceded by a press   release from the FOMC describing the plan in general terms  You received copies of the press   release  Michelle, do we have other copies?  Does anyone need it?    All right  If anyone needs a copy, Michelle is happy to give   you one  I would talk in general terms about this approach, why we’re doing it, what the   implications are, and so on  I’d be happy to share my draft remarks with anyone who would like to   look at them  Let me be clear—I do not plan to reveal any of the data from the projections  They   would be released to the public for the first time in the minutes, and so it would obviously be very   important for everyone not to release that information  President Plosser    My speech is November 14, and the release of the minutes   will be on November 20  That would give people some time to digest the ideas  Yes?    The press release would be on the morning of November 14   before my speech  On previous occasions when the FOMC has announced communication   changes, they have followed the meeting by some weeks  It’s not unusual for that to happen   There are questions about timing, whether we should think about doing it later  We had   some discussions about this  My own view is that this was the most convenient time  January   October 30-31, 2007 130 of 162    would run into the monetary policy hearings, for example  If there are serious problems in the   markets or anything like that, I am prepared to add material about the markets or to substitute   another speech—to do whatever is necessary to address that issue  But I do think that, besides the   natural rhythm and the fact that we are about as far as we are going to get in fine-tuning this, the fact   that this has appeared in the press suggests that we should just go ahead and get it out soon, if   possible  In a moment I’m going to ask you for your comments, and then I’ll ask you for your   consensus—first, on releasing the material and, second, on the speech and the rollout of the press   release   Let me just say that, as Brian indicated, we do have until tomorrow close of business to   revise our projections  This counts  This is the real thing  Please take a look at your projections in   light of this morning’s data and in light of the discussion today  In the future we will not be doing   this every meeting, only four times a year  So in that respect it won’t be such a burden as I know it   has been  So I urge you please to do that  Let me now open the floor for any comments or   questions about projections, the rollout plan, or anything  President Poole    Well, let me say first on the mode and the median, you make a   good point on the first issue about risks  The question to ask yourself is, Given your most likely   forecast, on which side are the largest and most costly deviations most likely to occur  In which   direction are the risks skewed?  That is the way to think about it   October 30-31, 2007 132 of 162     No, I don’t think so  I think you ought to put in some costs—    Okay  I think that the answer would be pretty similar in either   case  So we can discuss this at another time  On your second question, I think I’m kind of a special   case because people will overweight what I say if I give a number  So I would not give a number,   and what I would say is that what matters are the views of the broad Committee, and I don’t want to   distinguish myself from the broad Committee  It is a Committee decision process  If individuals   want to give their numbers, I suppose that’s okay  But I would urge you to consider the externality   a bit, which is that there will be some desire to figure out who is where on the distribution in order   to assess who is holding which type of policy preference and so on  Certainly many of us have   often given our views of what price stability is and so on  I don’t think I want to prohibit that, but   my recommendation would be to be a little fuzzy, a bit careful about being too precise and too sharp   about that number   October 30-31, 2007 133 of 162     That’s fine    President Fisher    President Lacker      Anybody else?  President Lockhart    Yes, and there have been no problems  The response has been   positive    Yes, Vice Chairman  I’m sorry   October 30-31, 2007 134 of 162     May I ask the staff, do you have institutional memory on   this question?      Is the skew that determines the risks simply the probability   of outcomes, or is it the probability weighted by the cost of certain outcomes?    The utility cost is relevant in the statement, and you can’t   take a balance of risks unless you compare them in terms of cost  There is no other metric by   which you can compare them  So in that case, it has to be cost-weighted  But I think it is more   or less equivalent—the univariate answers you are giving about mode versus median    I think we won’t go too far wrong by interpreting it as a   probability distribution in the shape of the probability distribution for outcomes    Okay  President Lacker   October 30-31, 2007 136 of 162     I think our standard procedure is that it is a modal    Yes    I’m sorry, President Plosser, we have kept you waiting    Let me also commend Governor Kohn, President Stern, and   President Yellen for their excellent work  We really appreciate it  Governor Mishkin    Governor Kroszner    Yes, let’s do that because it will be more consistent with the   statement  So let me ask everyone to rethink their risks conditional on our policy move today    Vice Chairman   October 30-31, 2007 138 of 162     It represents the diversity of views on the Committee about   that, with the additional caveat that not everyone may necessarily believe that we will approach   their ideal level of price stability even in three years, conceivably  So it is a mixture of elements,   and that’s what I will talk about  Again, if you would like to look at the speech—    Yes   October 30-31, 2007 139 of 162     If you wouldn’t mind, yes    We can do whatever we want as long as we all agree to do   the same thing  [Laughter]    President Lockhart     October 30-31, 2007 140 of 162     No, I don’t think so  It is based on the information in the   meeting, including the data we received this morning    We’re releasing it with the minutes  It’s not part of the   minutes     I hope, President Hoenig, that you won’t be in this situation   too often  [Laughter]    Any other questions or comments?  May I have the sense of   the Committee to proceed with the release?  Thank you very much  I appreciate it, and I   appreciate everyone’s hard work and cooperation  I think this is a very important step, and I am   very pleased with the outcome  Let me just describe now the sequence of events  I will now   give you the date of the next meeting, and I will adjourn the meeting  Laricke Blanchard is here   October 30-31, 2007 141 of 162    to talk briefly about congressional issues for us, and the lunch for Cathy Minehan begins at   1230  Okay?  So our next meeting will be Tuesday, December 11  The meeting is adjourned      END OF MEETING      October 30-31, 2007 142 of 162     "
8266,2007-12-06,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, everyone, for meeting on short notice  I hope   the weather is fine where you are  This is a joint FOMC–Board meeting, so let me ask a Board   member to move to close the meeting     Okay  Without objection  Our topic today is possible   measures to try to improve or address the liquidity situation in certain funding markets, and I am   going to turn the program over to Brian Madigan    Thank you, Bill  If you have questions for Bill, please raise   your hand  Okay  I don’t see any questions  So, Brian, why don’t we go on to the next stage    Thank you very much  Are there questions for the staff?    Okay  If there are no questions, I would like to make a couple of comments, just giving you my   impression of this work, and then I would like to ask for a go-round and have people comment   on the proposals  There are really two proposals  There is a TAF, term auction facility, and then   there is a swap  Obviously, they are complementary as well   Brian was correct when he said that this is not primarily a liquidity issue we have; it is a   credit and valuation issue  But we have all been following the markets, of course, and I do   believe that liquidity is playing a role in the pressures that we are currently seeing  In particular,   the normal providers of liquidity—such as banks, as Bill Dudley pointed out, but also money   market mutual funds (we see what is happening to the Florida state fund), other relatively   unsophisticated funds, or funds that are driven by retail investors—have withdrawn significantly   from these markets  The result is that getting funding, particularly term funding, has become   quite difficult   This has, I think, important costs  The fact that it is very hard to get funding more than   overnight creates a lot of uncertainty and risk around the funding process  We are seeing   elevated rates like LIBOR, which in turn is a reference rate that affects other contracts  Perhaps   most important, if funding rates remain elevated, the risk of fire sales increases with knock-on   effects in the rest of the system  Of course, as always, in proposing liquidity measures there are   the usual moral hazard issues and so on  In my view, at this point, the imperative of trying to   December 6, 2007 11 of 51    help markets function more normally and, therefore, support normal economic functioning is the   stronger   As the staff described, we looked at a number of options for addressing this problem    One set of options relates to somehow expanding or extending the discount window—lowering   the primary credit rate, for example  The fundamental issue there is that it is very hard to know   how far to lower the rate  If you don’t lower it far enough, you don’t get any borrowers  If you   lower it too much, you may get too many in the sense that a large amount of unplanned or   unexpected borrowing creates significant problems for the Desk’s management of the federal   funds rate  So to hope to achieve a significant scale, we need some method that will help us plan   and give us some warning, some advance knowledge, of how much credit is likely to be   extended  One possibility, incidentally, would be to use the discount window but to require   advance notice or put other restrictions on the amount borrowed  We thought about that, but in   the end, once the discount window is hedged about by all kinds of restrictions, it is not obvious   that it is better than just going ahead and auctioning credit     So I do think, after much discussion with staff and colleagues, that the term auction   facility is probably our best hope to try to improve, at least on the margin, the liquidity situation    By construction, it will lead to a predictable amount of lending  We know what the limit will be   as we set up an auction, and we can take the view that, if in fact we are undersubscribed, that we   will plan to use regular term repo operations to make up the difference  And so, again, we will   have good knowledge of how much to account for  The question of the stigma is basically   unknowable, but the fact that the reservation price will be low suggests that some banks may be   able to justify coming to this auction facility as an economic measure and perhaps will reduce the   stigma, although I certainly can’t guarantee that  We would announce this as a temporary   December 6, 2007 12 of 51    measure  However, I would point out that other central banks do have facilities that are similar   to this one  It may be, depending how well this works, that we may wish to make it a more   normal part of our tool kit  If we were to do that, we would go out for comment and get the   public’s reaction, but this does have the advantage that we can either keep it or take it back; or if   it is particularly successful and demand is high, we can also scale it up because, again, if we can   forecast the borrowing, we can account for that in our monetary policy implementation   Let me say a couple of words about the international aspect of this  With all of the work   that we did—and I should say that the Reserve Banks were extremely helpful in the feedback and   in doing some practice runs and analysis—I think we made the proposal a lot better from the last   time we talked about it  But we have been talking about it strictly in terms of a domestic   operation  You may recall that the last time we discussed this possibility we were considering a   joint operation with the ECB and perhaps also with the Swiss National Bank  There is a problem   with dollar funding in Europe  There is a shortage of dollars there early in the day, which often   leads the funds rate to open high  It creates problems for our monetary policy implementation    It creates problems in other markets, like the foreign exchange swap market  We have believed   for some time that it would be helpful if the ECB would enter a swap agreement with us to use   the dollars to address some of those needs  They were unwilling to do that except in the context   of some kind of broader operation, and they were willing, therefore, to do this joint operation   that we described at the earlier meeting  For both technical and optical reasons, we are not   proposing to include any other central banks in this auction  This would be a US-only   operation  However, as we went around and we informed other central banks about what we   were planning, the ECB, which met today, came back to us and said that, even though they   wouldn’t be part of the auction, they would be interested in a swap arrangement that would give   December 6, 2007 13 of 51    them dollars as part of this overall effort to try to improve liquidity in dollar term funding   markets   I think this is a positive step  Again, it would not create any significant operational   problems for us  I think it would have greater impact in the marketplace, and so I would support   that as well  We may also hear from the Swiss National Bank  We may have the Bank of   England announce separately some sterling operations, which would be unrelated; but by   announcing at the same time, we would be essentially conveying to the market that the major   central banks are in communication and that we are working together to try to address some of   these problems  This may not work  I don’t want to oversell it  We may not get a full bid  The   amount may be too small to affect the markets  But I do think it is worth trying  I think it will   send a good signal, and particularly I think the international cooperation aspect of this would be   well received  But I don’t know for sure  If we do it, we are just going to have to give it a try   and see what happens     Have you been taking names, Ms Danker?  Let’s start with President Hoenig     That is a good point and a good issue  The opposite   concern is that, if we announce it as being permanent and it is not successful or there is no bid, it   would obviously give us a problem as well  We have tried to split the difference and say that this   may be permanent depending on need, on market conditions, and on response  If we do that, it   would give us the opportunity to get feedback  I would note also that, if we do this, we will be   doing it under essentially an emergency provision that allows us to change Regulation A without   public comment  So that, generally speaking, would point to a temporary facility  But, again,   we would be clear that we would be willing to make this permanent if the conditions suggest it   and if the demand is there    Thank you  President Poole    Could I ask staff, should we go around first and then ask   questions?  Would that be better?  Would that be okay, President Poole, if we just do our go-  round and then come back?    Okay  We will keep a record of questions and answer them   all  Let’s see, who is next?  President Stern    Well, ask the question, and we will just try to answer them   collectively   December 6, 2007 16 of 51     Only if we use the TAF    That’s right    President Lockhart    You know, I’m thinking that maybe we should try to   respond to President Poole  Would that be okay?    Spence or someone, would you like to address the first   question, which is, Won’t we have to take out the same amount through some other means?    Okay  President Fisher    Thank you  Just a comment on the OIS—it is kind of the   natural benchmark against which usually one-month money is measured  I assume that bidders   bidding for billions of dollars might be able to figure out what it means  But, in particular, the   one-month T-bill rate has been very erratic because of ebbs and flows of demand for T-bills, and   its liquidity demand has fluctuated  There might be other options—and I think we are open to   doing that or modifying on the fly—but I think the T-bill rate at this time would be not such a   great choice  I agree with you—let me just say that we have to recognize the political realities of   small banks  If we need to expand the accessibility, I think that is something we should seriously   consider  We haven’t considered restricting beyond the primary credit window, but in terms of   the CAMELS ratings, it is something to think about     Can I get some help on that?    Thank you  President Rosengren    Anybody want to try?    Governor Kohn    President Poole, did you want to speak again?    One way to think about it is that you have money market   mutual funds that were willing to provide funding for, say, mortgage-backed securities  They are   now unwilling to provide funding for those types of assets at essentially any price or at least for   any reasonable price  The Fed would, therefore, be funding the mortgage-backed securities and   providing the bank with Treasury securities in exchange, which could be funded from the money   market mutual fund because that’s the only thing they’re willing to lend against  Again, the   presumption is that some assets are more liquid and easily fundable than others  We are   changing our balance sheet to hold heavily collateralized but nevertheless more-illiquid assets   and replacing them in the banks’ balance sheets with Treasury securities    Well, this may not be big enough if that’s the question, and   we may be able to scale it up somewhat  That’s one of the advantages of this—that we can scale   it up potentially quite a bit  But it’s meant to offset to some extent the withdrawal of supply   from normal liquidity providers  It may not be big enough  It’s possible  Let me go to President   Stern    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Would someone from New York like to   comment on the question of educating the banks in the time frame?    President Fisher, two-handed    Are there any other presidents who would like to speak?    President Lacker   December 6, 2007 27 of 51     Okay  Thank you  President Plosser  President Plosser, do   you have your mike on?      As we described it, we would actually have two auctions   before year-end  As far as the market reaction, you’re correct—it is hard to anticipate  But there   December 6, 2007 30 of 51    has been a lot of media and other speculation that we’re going to do something  In fact, this   specific idea has been mentioned in a number of cases  So it’s not quite clear whether doing   something or not doing something is the riskier in terms of what markets are expecting, and I   don’t really have anything else to add to that  I believe the intention would be to fill the gap with   term RPs if there’s not demand for this  But there is, of course, a difference in terms of, again,   the balance sheet of whether—you can think of it this way—we’re using central bank money to   fund Treasury securities or using central bank money to fund less-liquid assets  The presumption   here is that funding less-liquid assets on the margin—and again, all the points that have been   made are well taken—is more helpful  But we would, in any case, use term RPs to fill any gap   that was remaining  President Plosser, did you want to continue?    It is about both  The other issue is with the spread between   the discount rate and the funds rate—again, I agree with you  That is simpler, more   straightforward, and easier to understand  The problem is that we don’t know what spread   balances the two risks—one risk being no takers or no interest because the stigma is too great   and the other risk being so many takers that we are unable to offset the effects of the borrowing   in our management of the funds rate  So there was a lot of discussion, but operationally it seems   that there’s an advantage to knowing in advance how much the limit of lending might be  I   guess I’d like to say that, beyond all these valid and interesting points, there seems to be an   interest from our international partners in working with us with the swap, with activities in other   countries, and this TAF seems to be the thing that makes them eager to participate  They were   December 6, 2007 31 of 51    not interested, explicitly, in participating if we were involving only a discount rate cut or any   other action  So it has at least that benefit  President Evans    Thank you  President Yellen    Just for the record, we would announce this on Wednesday   morning, after the FOMC meeting  So the market would already know whatever action we have   taken on Tuesday  Thank you  Vice Chairman, did you want to comment?    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  President Poole, did you have another   comment?    Okay  Thank you very much  Well, again, thank you for   meeting at this irregular time, and thank you for the interesting and useful comments  The   governance here is that the TAF is established by Regulation A, which is a decision by the   Board  So I think we might want to review what the language of the regulation is, and if the   Board is amenable, we will put that to a notation vote tomorrow  The swap, though, is an FOMC   decision  I promised President Trichet that I would get back to him with information about this    If everyone is okay with it, I would like to go ahead and have an FOMC vote on the swap with   the European Central Bank  If a small one comes from the Swiss National Bank, we could deal   with that next Tuesday  Debbie, can you read the swap language?    Okay  Thank you very much  We will see you on Tuesday   in Washington  Thank you  The meeting is adjourned      END OF MEETING      December 6, 2007 46 of 51     "
8290,2007-12-11,BERNANKE,"  Good early morning  [Laughter]  I would like to start by   thanking the Committee for the very useful discussion we had last week, although I must say that   videoconference is not the most intimate format  People raised a number of important   reservations about the TAF, including the fact that capital, perhaps more than liquidity, is the   issue now; issues about the size of it; and concern about stigma  I think that those points are well   taken and that we need to be modest in our expectations about at least the initial effect of this   facility  However, as I indicated last week, I think that it will perhaps provide a platform for us   to create a more flexible tool that will allow us to use our discount window facilities in a more   effective way as we go forward  In the near term, it has also provided a good vehicle for us to   cooperate with other central banks, and I would like to update you on that now   First, the Board did approve the TAF on Friday by notation vote, as we expected    Second, we have been in communication with the whole G-10 about these matters and have   widespread support from our colleagues for this action  In particular, I believe that you have a   draft press release that will be very similar to what will be released tomorrow morning  What   time is it?  It’s at 830 am now?    Tomorrow morning at 900  It will be a joint release of five   central banks  The press release will have a common first paragraph, as you see in front of you,   and then each central bank will describe its own actions in more detail, followed by web links to   the other central banks  In particular, the European Central Bank will take the $20 billion in   swaps that we approved last week and will do two essentially noncompetitive auctions  That is,   December 11, 2007 3 of 138    they will allocate $20 billion in two tranches to European banks needing dollars at the price that   clears the US TAF, so they may have to ration or otherwise allocate  That is their problem    The Swiss National Bank will also do a $4 billion one-time auction  Let’s see, they are going to   do an actual auction    Okay  At our stop-out rate?    Okay  So they have the same auction plan that we have,   essentially  In addition, we are being joined by the British, who are doing two auctions of   £10 billion each before year-end  These are sterling auctions, not dollar auctions, but they are in   fact of the same actual size as ours—an indication of the appreciation of the pound  Finally, the   Canadians were already planning to do some auctions before the end of the year, and they will   simply join us in announcing those at the same time  In addition, the Japanese and the Swedes,   although not planning anything in the near term, will issue statements supporting our actions and   affirming their willingness to support liquidity as necessary  So I am hopeful  Again, I think our   expectations should be modest  This is not a one-shot deal  We will continue to try to address   these problems, but I am hopeful that the international aspect of this will also be at least   somewhat reassuring to markets  There will be, I think, a bit of disappointment today that we   don’t cut the discount rate spread; but by tomorrow morning, I hope that will be resolved one   way or another   A few people have asked about informing their boards  I have no objection to your   informing your board if you wish in advance of the announcement—so long, of course, as it is   December 11, 2007 4 of 138    with the usual confidentiality rules  What I might suggest to you to consider is that perhaps a   compromise between doing nothing and informing your whole board might be to give a call to   your chairman sometime today and just give a heads-up, if you choose  I am just indicating that   we have no objection, to your doing that   There is one piece of business remaining associated with this, which is that we have to   approve the $4 billion swap request from the Swiss National Bank  What I would propose to do   is allow Bill to begin his report on Desk operations  Subsequent to that, we can take questions,   either on the financial conditions that Bill describes, on any of these aspects, and then I would   like, along with the ratification of operations, to ask you at that time also for a vote on the swap    So if there is no question or comment at this point, I will turn to Bill    Thank you  Are there questions for Bill on financial   conditions or for Bill or me on the TAF proposal?  President Poole   December 11, 2007 8 of 138     Governor Kohn    I think it is probably worth observing that the spreads   probably also are correlated with nonprice terms  So it may not be an exactly neutral change    President Fisher    President Lockhart    President Plosser    Other questions for Bill?  If not, we need to vote to ratify   domestic operations    Without objection  Okay  We also need a vote on the   Swiss request for a currency swap     Any commentary?  President Poole?    Why don’t you make your comment, and then we will take   a roll call vote    Thank you  We will, of course, announce a swap in the   context of our plan to address money market issues  With respect to the issue of their reserves, I   think there are two reasons for having the swap  One is that for technical reasons it is easier for   them to segregate their foreign exchange reserves from the money they would use in this auction    They felt it was bureaucratically easier for them to do it this way  Second, this obviously gives   us—which is very important for our monetary control—sort of a clear marker in terms of what   the size of this operation will be, and so on  But your points are well taken  Any other   comments?  If not, Debbie, could you please read the resolution?    All right  Thank you  Let us turn now to the economic   situation and Dave Stockton    Thank you very much  Are there questions?  President   Fisher     President Evans    President Poole    President Stern    President Plosser    Vice Chairman Geithner    Other questions?  President Evans    All right  President Hoenig    Okay  Let’s begin our go-round  President Yellen    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Poole    Is the sale of a used truck to Russia an export or a capital   inflow?  [Laughter]  Think about that one    No, I understand  Let’s see  President Lacker   December 11, 2007 39 of 138     Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Hoenig     Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  It’s 1030  It would be a good time to take a   coffee break  Why don’t we return at 1050   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we recommence  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you, Governor  Well, again, thank you for a very   helpful discussion  Let me just try to briefly summarize and then offer a few additional comments    Many participants obviously gave considerable attention to the resurgence of stresses in financial   markets, including the increased losses by financial institutions, widening spreads, and poorly   functioning markets  Some expressed concern that these developments were likely to result in   tighter credit—not just in mortgages, where conditions are already tight, but in other areas as well—  perhaps resulting in spillovers to the broader economy  A weakening economy could cause   financial conditions to worsen further, leading to a negative feedback loop, and indeed, there are   signs of some broader credit deterioration  Impending mortgage rate resets and foreclosures pose   further risks  Some took these developments as increasing downside risk to growth, perhaps   significantly  However, other participants noted some mitigating factors, including the fact that   banks came into the situation with a lot of capital  Some institutions have raised capital  There’s   the possibility that other credit providers could take over from money center banks  Corporate   balance sheets are strong  The credit problems have a regional focus in some cases, and there is a   lack of effect so far on many on Main Street  Some also noted that the price discovery process was   inevitable and needed   With respect to the macroeconomic data, overall the incoming data were slightly weaker   than expected, particularly in housing and consumption, although, again, the anecdotes were   somewhat mixed  Fundamentals for consumption are weaker but not collapsing, with the labor   market and perhaps wealth still providing some support and mixed information on retail sales    Differences across regions and products were noted  With the possible exception of commercial   December 11, 2007 86 of 138    real estate in some cases, investment is not yet much affected by credit conditions  Improvements   in inventory management were cited as a positive  Unemployment remains low, and wage   pressures exist in some areas, but they were less cited, I think it’s fair to say, than in past meetings    Export demand related to the weaker dollar and strong foreign growth provides some help to the   manufacturing sector, although it was noted that other countries might not be immune to a   slowdown in US growth  Overall, most participants saw slower growth, but there is greater   agreement that the outlook is in any case more uncertain   On inflation, some took a relatively benign view noting the restraint from a slowing   economy and less tightness in labor markets  Others noted some recent increases in core inflation   and continuing pressures from energy, food, and the dollar  Many stressed that stable inflation   expectations cannot be taken as a given  Any comments or questions?   Let me just add a bit to the discussion because, as usual, it has already been very thorough    Again, if one looks at the incoming macro data, I think a fair judgment is that it was a little weaker   than we expected  The economy has been a little slower than we expected  Housing data,   consumption, and I would argue investment and production numbers were all somewhat lower than   we thought was going to be the case at the end of October  I would also argue that, in particular, the   consumer, who of course is crucial to the expansion, is facing somewhat weaker conditions—  including higher oil prices, less wealth from lower stock and house prices, and perhaps tighter   credit—than was the case a month and a half ago  I think it is noteworthy that the unexplained   portion of consumer sentiment has declined considerably  There seem to be attitudes or, if you like,   forecasts among consumers that are even weaker than would be suggested by some of the   conditions they are currently seeing, and I think that is a concern   December 11, 2007 87 of 138    Now, there have certainly been positive developments in the data  The labor market has   held up pretty well  The unemployment rate actually dropped a bit last week  Stocks have come   back a bit from their so-called correction, although I should say that this is conditional on a lot of   expected easing by the Federal Reserve  ISM surveys show manufacturing as flat, but   manufacturing is still growing, and there was a bit of good news yesterday in housing, with some   slight indications of improved pending sales  I think it’s interesting that the Michigan survey notes   that prospective homebuyers are actually a bit upbeat because they see interest rates as low and   prices as more favorable  So, again, the data suggest some weakness, but the story is not entirely   unmixed     So how would we interpret this?  I think you could take a more sanguine view that we are   seeing the continuation of a zigzag pattern that we’ve seen for quite a while  We had very weak   growth in the first quarter of this year, for example; but even with the zero growth projected for the   fourth quarter, we will see 22 percent growth in the first half of ’07 and 25 percent growth in the   second half of ’07  So it could be that we’re just seeing a zigzag pattern, and some of that is   certainly true  It’s also still true that a lot of the weakness we’re seeing is in the housing sector  For   example, for all of ’07, growth excluding housing is about 3½ percent—so again, not suggestive of   great weakness  Now, all of that being noted, I don’t think I’d go quite as far as Governor Mishkin;   I try to maintain an even keel here in my mood  [Laughter]     But I think I’m in the camp of those who see a fundamental   softening going on here  One indicator is the pattern of final demand  This zigzag pattern has been   mostly in a situation with basically about 2 percent growth in final demand but with quarter-to-  December 11, 2007 88 of 138    quarter variation in exports and inventories  We see in this case the opposite  Growth in private   domestic final demand is projected by the Greenbook to fall to minus 02 percent in the fourth   quarter and another minus 03 percent in the first quarter of next year  It does seem to have been a   step-down in economic growth outside of housing   The other issue is the financial markets, which so many people have commented on  I just   note that there are several elements to this  First are the losses and the downgrades that have hit   capital  These have been only partially offset by new capital issuances  In particular, we’ve seen   about $75 billion in write-downs or losses in the financial sector, of which $45 billion has occurred   since our last meeting, at a time when we thought things were clearing up  Criticized loans by our   supervisors for the top fifty bank holding companies rose from 26 to 28 percent over the last quarter    So we’re seeing continued losses, and I expect to see that to go forward  The second element of this   is the pressure on balance sheets  Banks are taking off-balance-sheet assets onto the balance sheet    An example that Governor Kroszner mentioned is the leveraged-loan market, which was open for a   while and now seems to be closed, and securitization markets remain closed   Moreover, and I think this is particularly worrisome going forward, supervisors—and you   all, of course, talk to your supervisors—are increasingly concerned about credit quality as it looks   likely to evolve  Commercial real estate is one area in which we’ve seen essentially no defaults yet,   but these things tend to lag, and there’s a lot of expectation both among bankers and among   supervisors of that sector weakening  One indicator of banks’ views is that they have been raising   their loan-loss provisions at a rapid rate, $17 billion in the third quarter  It was at a twenty-year   high, and we are certainly hearing from, for example, the Federal Advisory Council that they expect   credit quality to continue to deteriorate  The result of this is that, although I do not expect   insolvency or near insolvency among major financial institutions, they are certainly going to   December 11, 2007 89 of 138    become much more cautious, and I think that will affect their lending behavior and their willingness   to extend new credit  As has been pointed out, some of the natural substitutes like the so-called   shadow banking system are not really there at this point, and I would also be less sanguine than   some about regional and community banks, which face their own problems  lack of securitization   outlets and a lot of exposure to commercial real estate   So I do think that we’re going to see some tightening of credit and that it could get worse    Experience suggests that, while financial conditions are always different and the financial structure   has changed significantly, credit crunches can have a big effect on the economy  The case that’s   been cited the most is the 1991-92 crunch, when the capital losses were pretty limited regionally   but, nevertheless, there was a national impact  Another smaller, perhaps less relevant, example is   the Carter credit controls in March 1980, which were very small in their aspiration yet somehow   managed to create a short recession  So I believe that the financial conditions are going to be a   significant drag  It is going to go on for a while  Given the low growth expectations, it could lead   us into a negative growth area  I see realistically only one way in which we could avoid a drag from   the financial system, which would be if, in fact, we get lucky and the housing market begins to   stabilize and there’s a sense that we’ve reached bottom there and house prices are stabilizing  I   think that would do a tremendous amount of good for the financial system  It might lead to   sufficient improvement as to avoid some of these consequences   You know, I do think that we have to take note of the fact that the two-year government   yield is down about 75 basis points in real terms since our last meeting and that five-year bond   yields are down about 60 basis points in real terms  That’s certainly a market view on what’s   happening to growth expectations, and it’s not terribly inconsistent with some of the figures that   come out of the Greenbook calculations  So obviously there are mixed views, but I think it is very   December 11, 2007 90 of 138    hard to argue that both the modal growth forecast and the rest of that output forecast have not   shifted adversely   With respect to inflation—again, people made these points as well—it is unfortunate that we   do have some instability, some risks there  We saw some stabilization of the dollar over the past six   weeks  That is obviously not exogenous  It depends on our behavior and our communication  I   think oil prices depend also to some extent on our policy, directly or indirectly  We will be seeing   some ugly near-term inflation numbers with oil price increases, which we hope will move out of the   data shortly, but we’re not sure  So obviously we have to watch that  I think there are a few things   that are slightly helpful on that front  One is that, relative to the previous intermeeting period,   there’s more conviction now that other countries may be easing monetary policy  In fact, we’ve   seen cuts in Canada and the United Kingdom  I think that takes a bit of the risk away from the   dollar   I do not know how big the impact of the national intelligence estimate about Iran will be, but   it certainly reduces a bit the geopolitical risk that has been around oil over the past couple of years    But, of course, I agree with Governor Mishkin and many others that, whatever we might be tempted   to do in terms of trying to get ahead of the financial conditions and what I fully believe will be   ultimately a Main Street problem as well as a Wall Street problem, we need to be highly   cognizant—this is not a ritual but an honest statement—of those implications for inflation   expectations and the dollar as well  So let me stop there, just adding that I think the situation is very   difficult and we need to recognize the uncertainty that we’re facing  I believe that in response we   will have to make sure that we are sufficiently flexible, open minded, willing to accept new   evidence and new information, and willing to respond actively and quickly when we do get that new   December 11, 2007 91 of 138    information  Let me stop there, and let me now ask for volunteers—oh, sorry—before we do that,   Brian will introduce the policy go-round    Thank you very much  Questions for Brian?  President Evans    Any other questions?  All right  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Hoenig    President Hoenig, did you have a view on the statement?    President Poole    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Stern   December 11, 2007 104 of 138     Rules versus discretion  [Laughter]  Thank you  President   Plosser     Thank you  President Lockhart     Thank you  President Fisher   December 11, 2007 108 of 138     Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Thank you, everyone  Oh, sorry  Vice   Chairman  [Laughter]    Thank you  Well, again, thank you, thank you all  I do   think we need to move today  Once we take into account the drag from financial conditions,   December 11, 2007 119 of 138    arguably the current rate is neutral or even somewhat restrictive  For example, the Taylor rules   in the Bluebook have the neutral rate between 4 and 4¼ percent  Moreover, there has been quite   a market change  Whether you look at markets or look at simulations, the FRB/US equilibrium   real funds rate, for example, is down 70 basis points since the last meeting, which of course is   just a summary of the revision of the forecast  On the other hand, you get similar numbers when   you look at actual market indicators  So I think there is a sense in which our policies become de   facto more restrictive and need to be addressed  On top of that, there is some case for insurance,   although the discussion around the table illustrates that that is a complex idea when you, in fact,   have a dual mandate and there are risks in both directions   If the choice were between 0 and 50 basis points, I would be very tempted to do 50 basis   points  I think it would move us more toward accommodation, and it would be very pleasant to   get the same kind of market response we got after September in terms of improved functioning   and credit extension  That said, I think there are some risks to going with 50 basis points  I   acknowledge what others have said, which is that it is not just about the rate but also about what   the message is  In particular the markets already expect us to ease quite a bit more  We are not   pushing strongly back against it with 25 basis points  If we do 50, we may be saying to the   market that we are willing to do even more than you currently expect  I think that poses some   risks to inflation expectations and poses some risks to the dollar, which is a little fragile right   now  You can imagine it even having reverse effects with respect to the economy—for example,   if it caused oil prices to jump or if it caused nominal interest rates to rise, thereby raising nominal   mortgage rates  The other concern I have is that, for better or worse, given our communications   and market expectations, at this point a 50 basis point cut would be viewed as something of a   lurch and might signal, as others have suggested, more concern or private information about the   December 11, 2007 120 of 138    economy that we in fact don’t necessarily have  You can tell that I am quite conflicted about it,   and I think there is a good chance that we may have to move further at subsequent meetings  In   that respect, it is very important that both in our statement and in our intermeeting   communications that we signal our flexibility, our nimbleness  We are not locked in, we are   responsive to conditions on both sides of the mandate, and we are alert to new developments   With all of that in mind—and although I don’t think the TAF is really a significant   substitute for monetary policy, on the margin I think it is helpful—I recommend 25 basis points   and alternative B  I did not hear much support for a downside risks sentence, and I agree that   adding it would probably not very substantially affect the signal that we are sending today  So   that is my proposal  Any comments?  If not, could you please call the roll?    Okay  Thank you  We need to recess briefly here for the   discount rate   December 11, 2007 121 of 138    [Meeting recessed]    Okay  Why don’t we reconvene  Again, thank you all  Let   me just reiterate what I was saying about the statement  I hope as we go through the   intermeeting period that we will try to maintain our flexibility  As we discuss the outlook in   public, we should of course give our honest and full views on the outlook and the risks  But we   should try to maintain, with respect to policy action, flexibility in the ability to respond to new   conditions  That way I hope when we come to January we will be able to respond as the data   and the markets best indicate   We are no longer doing communications in our two-day meetings, so there is a question   of what to do in that time  [Laughter]  We would like to suggest several things to the   Committee  First, as part of the international processes and the efforts of the President’s   Working Group to study the lessons that we have gained so far from financial turmoil, there are   numerous work streams going on about different aspects of the turmoil, including a lot of work   being done by people in the System  So we would like to propose—and I hope that we would   consider it complementary to our policy discussion—a presentation in January by the staff on   various policy lessons learned from the experience we have had with the financial turmoil    Again, this is material that will be feeding into international discussions about how policy,   financial regulation, and so on might respond to these situations in the future  The subsequent   two-day meeting is in April  The staff is working hard on the issue of interest on reserves  They   would like to present to us what they have done and get feedback from us on some parameters of   the process  It is in fact quite relevant to our current situation because it bears on issues of   monetary control  If we have interest on reserves, we would, for example, be better able to   manage the overnight funds rate  So if there is no objection, we would like to put that on the   December 11, 2007 122 of 138    schedule for April  Subsequent to that, we would like to go back to our practice of having   presentations on topics of interest  We would like to put special emphasis on research taking   place at Reserve Banks, and we will be sending out a memo soliciting ideas from the Committee   and from the Reserve Banks in the hope that individual Banks, in collaboration with others,   might take the lead in making presentations of relevant research  So that is the current plan for   two-day meetings  Are there any comments?   Okay  Finally, the next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, January 29 and 30  We will   adjourn in a moment for lunch, and over lunch Laricke Blanchard will give us a brief   presentation of congressional matters      I think it will be very interesting  President Yellen    Can I get some help?  Scott    He is not speaking to you?  [Laughter]    All right  President Fisher    We were asked whether it was okay to inform the boards    Given that the boards are often privy to confidential information, I didn’t see any reason to   prohibit that  I think in some cases it might be a useful compromise, instead, just to inform your   chairman  But we are not requesting that you inform your board  It is up to you  If you think it   would be useful, by all means  Of course, this will all be available first thing in the morning  So   if you prefer to call immediately after and discuss it—any way that is good for you is fine with   us    President Plosser    The discount window will still exist  They will still be   making loans at 50 basis points above the fed funds rate  This is a new facility, approved by the   Board  What your board has to approve is the willingness to make loans from your discount   window at the rate determined by the auction    All right  The meeting is adjourned   December 11, 2007 125 of 138    END OF MEETING      December 11, 2007 126 of 138     "
8312,2008-01-09,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  Thank you for coming, and I   am sorry about the awkward time  I am also sorry I wasn’t able to talk to many of you in   advance of the meeting  I just got back from Basel yesterday, and so I have been out of the   country  Let me tell you why I called this meeting  I have become increasingly concerned that   our policy rate is too high to fully address the downside risks to growth  We have cut 100 basis   points since September, and I think that may possibly have roughly offset the credit factors and   the housing factors, but I don’t think that we can claim that we have done anything in the way of   taking out insurance against what I think are some potentially significant downside risks    Meanwhile, since our last meeting in December, the data have been on the whole negative  The   fourth quarter looks all right, but since then we have seen a number of indicators that the   economy is sliding  So I thought it would be worthwhile for us to have an intermeeting meeting,   so to speak, just to get an update on the situation and to have some discussion of our policy   strategy   As you know, we circulated a draft policy statement for the contingency that the   Committee might want to act on rates today  After getting some feedback, and with some   thought, unless the sentiment of the Committee to move today is especially strong, I am not   going to propose a policy action at this meeting  What I would really like to do, instead, is get a   sense of where the Committee is and a sense of your willingness to be somewhat more proactive   in terms of addressing the downside risks that we are seeing in the growth situation  Part of the   reason it is scheduled today is that tomorrow I have a sort of well-publicized speech on the   outlook and next week I have a testimony  I would like to be able to give some signal of where   January 9, 2008 3 of 60    the Committee is going forward toward the end of January  I think that would be very beneficial    The markets in part are suffering from just simple uncertainty about whether the Fed is willing to   be proactive in addressing the downside risks, and I think if I am able to give some signal about   our inclinations that would be quite helpful  So, in short, the purpose of the meeting today is not   to take any action, but rather it is my attempt to consult with you, so that when I speak in public   tomorrow and next week I will be representing the broad consensus of the Committee   With that, I would like to begin with some short briefings by Bill Dudley in New York on   markets and by Dave Stockton in Washington on the forecast—I think you received materials   today—and then give time for Q&A  Following that, I would like, because I called the meeting,   to give you my own views on why we need to be somewhat more proactive in risk management    Following that, we will open the floor, take comments, and sort of see where we are at the end of   the day  I hope that works for everybody  Okay  If there are no comments, let me call on Bill   Dudley to discuss the market situation    Thank you, Bill  Why don’t we take a few questions for   Bill  Does anyone have questions for Bill?  President Fisher    Other questions for Bill?    Other questions for Bill?  All right  If there are no other   questions for Bill, let’s turn to Dave Stockton for an update on the forecast    Thank you, Dave  Are there questions for Dave?  President   Lacker    Other questions for Dave?  President Fisher    Are there other questions for Dave?  If not, if I could kick   off the general discussion, I will talk a bit about how I see the economy  I have two main points   to make  First, I think the downside risks to the economy are quite significant and larger than   they were  Speaking as a former member of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, I   think there are a lot of indications that we may soon be in a recession  I think a garden variety   recession is an acceptable risk, but I am also concerned that such a downturn might morph into   something more serious, and I will talk about that in a moment  My second point is that I think   that 100 basis points of easing may or may not be a rough offset, in terms of expectations, to the   decline in demand that we have seen, but I don’t think that we have done really very much at all   in terms of taking out insurance against what I perceive to be the greater risk at this point   So let me address those questions just a bit  President Lacker already anticipated me in   mentioning the regime-switching models of recession  Those suggest a nonlinear process  There   are two states of the world—a growth state and a recession state—and the behavior of the   economy is different in those two states  Those models fit pretty well, although, of course, like   many econometric models they are mostly retrospective  But some of the indicators suggesting a   switch are things like falling equity prices, slower manufacturing growth, rising credit spreads,   and—an often very effective indicator—the fact that the federal funds rate is so far above two-  year interest rates at this point  Those would all be indications that the regime is about to switch,   if it hasn’t already   January 9, 2008 14 of 60    President Lacker also mentioned the idea of a stall speed  I presented some figures on   that in a meeting in 2006  There have been situations of a 03 percentage point increase in the   unemployment rate in a month that have been reversed, but there has never been in our case a 06   increase over a period of time that didn’t translate into a recession and a much greater increase in   unemployment  Similarly, there has never been a sustained GDP growth rate below 2 percent—  and we have a 1 percent forecast for 2008—that has not turned into a recession  Indicative of the   kind of behavior that we have seen in the past, let me just refer to the last two recessions    Unemployment was 52 percent in June 1990, having been there for about two years  It jumped   to 55 percent in July, by the next June it was 69, and the following June it was 78  In   December 2000, unemployment was 39, it was 43 at the cyclical peak in March 2001, and   ultimately it hit 63 in June 2003  So there is some tendency, once a stall speed is reached, for   the economy to slow quite considerably  Again, like David, I don’t know if we’re there yet    Obviously, ex ante it’s extremely hard to tell, but I do think the risks are at least 50 percent at   this point that we will see an NBER recession this year  Now, as I said, the concern I have is not   just a slowdown but the possibility that it might become a much nastier episode  The main   mechanism I have in mind—there are several possibilities, but I think the financial markets are   the main risk     Let me talk a bit about banks, which are at the center of this set of issues  I’m going to   talk a bit about the 21 large, complex banking organizations (LCBOs)  I have had some data   worked up for me by the supervisory staff  Since August these 21 LCBOs have announced $75   billion in extraordinary markdowns associated with various credit issues  They have, on the   other hand, either raised or plan to raise $50 billion in capital  Therefore, one might say, “Well,   that looks pretty good”  I think, though, on net that there is really actually quite a fragility here    January 9, 2008 15 of 60    Several factors are going to put pressure on bank capital going forward  First, they have been   taking assets on the balance sheet, as you know—about $250 billion so far of semi-voluntary   additions coming from off-balance-sheet conduits and others  It is hard to say how much   contingent additional exposure they have  There are a lot of different estimates  For these 21   banks, the Board supervisory staff identified between $250 billion and $300 billion more of   potential exposures to bring back on the balance sheet  The BIS, at the meeting I attended over   the weekend, looking at the 20 largest international banks, estimated $600 billion  We don’t   know how much it is going to be, but the banks themselves are somewhat unsure about potential   exposures   Loan-loss reserves are quite low for this stage in the cycle, about 14 percent, compared   with, say, 25 percent during the headwinds period of the early 1990s, and that is partly a result   of the SEC regulations, which have forced banks to keep their reserves low  There is a lot of   concern in banks about additional credit losses and downgrades, concern about financial   guarantors, and, of course, macro concerns  Finally—and I think this is one of the most   worrisome things to me—we are beginning to see some credit issues outside of housing and   mortgages  Credit card delinquencies have jumped in a few banks’ home equity lines  There are   concerns in commercial real estate, particularly in some regions like Florida and California  And   with fair value accounting, as pricing goes down, even if you don’t yet see a cashflow effect, you   get immediate effects on capitalization   The implications of this, even if the economy continues along, say, the Greenbook’s   estimates, are that lending is going to be quite tight  Banks are reluctant to take loans onto their   balance sheets because of the capital constraints  They are, in fact, raising their internal capital   targets because of their concerns about credit losses and about additional off-balance-sheet   January 9, 2008 16 of 60    responsibilities  We have seen contraction not only in the primary mortgage market but also in   home equity lines of credit, and I suspect we will see tighter conditions for credit cards, CRE   lending, and non-investment-grade corporates  A question is high-grade corporates  There has   even been some deterioration in, say, A-rated corporations   I have had a lot of opportunities to talk to bankers  We had a meeting over the weekend   in Basel between the central bankers and about 50 private-sector representatives  The thrust that   I got was that things are going to be pretty tight  “We are going to meet our regular customers’   needs, but all of this is conditioned on no recession”  As one banker put it in our meeting,   “There is no Plan B”  So a concern that is evident is that, if economic conditions worsen   notably, the effects on bank capital, on credit risk, and so on will create a more severe credit   situation, which could turn a garden variety downturn into something more persistent   The other issue, of course, is housing  Credit markets and housing are interacting very   closely  I think that residential construction is going to stop subtracting so much from GDP   growth because there is a non-negativity constraint  Eventually, the declines in residential   construction will have to stop, but we are pretty far from the non-negativity constraint on prices,   and I think that is where the issue is  I have reviewed the staff’s analysis of house prices  They   make perfectly reasonable guesses about what house prices will do  But it is inherently very   difficult, and there is a very wide range of possible outcomes  If the housing market continues to   be weak and if credit continues to be tight, then the possibility of a much more significant   decline in house prices, particularly in some regions, is certainly there; and that, in turn, would   have significant effects on credit markets and on the economy   So I have tried to be quick; I don’t want to take too much time; but I see a lot of   indications that a recession may well happen  Given the additional considerations of credit   January 9, 2008 17 of 60    markets and housing markets, I am concerned that we might get something worse than, say,   2001     The other question I raised was, Have we done enough?  We have done 100 basis points    Of course, it is hard to know  A few indicators  The Greenbook-consistent medium-term r*,   which is an indicator of the real funds rate that leads to full employment in three years, was 33   percent in August 2007  It is currently about 18 percent, so that is a decline of 150 basis points    That is just one rough indicator of the decline in aggregate demand  I have not redone the Taylor   rules, but for December the estimated forecast- and outcome-based Taylor rules showed a rate of   about 40 to 41  Again, that would not include any risk-management considerations  That is   just sort of an average over periods of both inflation risk and growth risk  I guess I would also   mention the 2001 pattern, the most recent episode  The FOMC—many of you were there, I was   not—dropped the rate 250 basis points in a little over four months in early 2001  Obviously, that   was a much more aggressive episode   What about inflation?  The fact is that we are in a tough bind here, and we don’t have any   easy, simple solution  We are going to have to balance risks against each other  We are going to   have to do it in a forward-looking way, and we are going to have to try to make some judgments    I’ll make a couple of comments  First, even assuming no recession, as the staff does, the staff   has core and total inflation back into a reasonable approximation of price stability by 2009  As   they note, wage growth has slowed; that doesn’t seem to be incorporating any inflation pressures    The other thing I would say is that, if we do have a recession, inflation during recession periods   does tend to fall fairly quickly  In the 1990 episode I mentioned before, between June 1990 and   June 1993, core PCE inflation fell from 44 to 27 percent  Of course, in the 2001 episode,   despite 550 basis points of easing, we went from 22 percent in the fall of 2001 to unwelcome   January 9, 2008 18 of 60    disinflation in 2003  So should there be a recession, the inflation problem would probably take   care of itself   Now, there is an argument—and Governor Mishkin’s speech on Friday makes the case   pretty well—that, when you have these kinds of risks, the best way to balance the growth and   inflation risks is to be aggressive in the short run but to take back the accommodation in a timely   way when the economy begins to stabilize  I realize this is not easy to communicate, but I think   if we attempt to do so we can make some progress on that front   So, to summarize, we have a very difficult situation, but I do think the downside risks   have increased and are quite significant  I don’t think that our policy thus far has gotten ahead of   the curve, so to speak, in terms of taking out insurance  Although, again, I’m not recommending   any action today, I think we need to be cognizant of this issue as we go into the January and   subsequent meetings  So let me stop there and open the floor for your reactions and comments    I’d like to know if you are comfortable not acting today—waiting until the January meeting  On   the other hand, I am also interested in knowing if you share my assessments or if you don’t  Let   me be clear  I am not asking now for a commitment to any particular action in January  I am not   asking for carte blanche  I am simply trying to see if we are all on the same page, or more or less   on the same page, so that we can collectively communicate more effectively and I hope take the   right actions when the time comes  So let me stop there, and Debbie will call on members    President Lacker      Let me just respond quickly  Obviously, I am not   advocating any change in our objectives  I just think that at this point we have not quite   balanced the risks to our objectives appropriately, and you could think of it as a level adjustment,   if you’d like, and not a change in path  I would just note the risk of having what could be a   strictly inefficient outcome, in which the growth situation gets so far out ahead of us that   inflation falls too much, as happened in 2003  I believe that we can make essentially a level   adjustment and try to get a little ahead of the risks here  So long as the market expects the   economy to slow—and I note that they are already expecting quite a bit of easing and inflation   expectations aren’t moving—I think we can do that in a safe and reasonable way  I am not in   any way advocating changing our objectives  I am suggesting that we are not quite calibrated   properly to achieve our objectives  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Stern    If one of the lessons is that we need to take the   accommodation back, I agree with you on that one  President Fisher    Thank you  I will certainly do that  President Evans    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you very much  President Hoenig    President Poole    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman     Thank you  Well, in this less than two hours, we have   covered intermeeting moves, policy strategy, assessment of the economy, and inflation   dynamics  I think it has been pretty productive  Seriously, I very much appreciate it  I promise   to try not to do this too often, but getting this intermeeting update has been very useful for me  I   very much appreciate it  I think we are a little better prepared for the next meeting when it   comes, although obviously, as President Poole pointed out, we will be seeing a lot of data and   certainly there is no pre-commitment to any specific action  But I do think there is at least a   reasonable amount of support for the idea that some insurance is worthwhile, and we should keep   that in mind as we go forward  Are there any other comments?  President Hoenig     It will be described, I assume, in the minutes, which will be   three weeks after the next meeting, so it will be six weeks before this is reported  It will be   reported, I assume, as a consultation and discussion of the economy  I would advise you not to   discuss this with your directors  If it gets into the market, it could cause confusion and   uncertainty  So if possible, I would not discuss it    Thank you  President Lacker, do you have a point or a   comment?    Thank you  Any other comments?  If not, have a good   dinner  Thank you very much, and we will see you in Washington at the end of January, if not   sooner  Thank you   END OF MEETING   January 9, 2008 48 of 60     "
8332,2008-01-21,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  Thank you for taking time on   your holiday  The purpose of this meeting is to update the Committee on financial developments   over the weekend and to consider whether we want to take a policy action today  I would like to   start with a brief update on the markets from Bill Dudley and take any questions for him, and   then I will introduce the issue, make a recommendation, and ask for your comments following   that  Bill, would you like to give us a short review?      Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker?    Other questions for Bill?  President Hoenig    Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue   here  I was reluctant to call this meeting, both because of the holiday and because the   Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled   meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9  However, I think there are times when   events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting  I know it is only a week   away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets  As Bill described, over the   holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe  As he   mentioned, even though the US markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today,   close to 5 percent  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC   meeting 16½ percent  Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock   investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the   economy and increasing problems in credit markets   On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets   reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession    Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will   January 21, 2008 6 of 32    have global consequences  Consequently, we saw, for example, an 8 percent drop today in the   German stock market  The dollar rose today, reflecting I think increasing belief that other   central banks will have to follow us in cutting rates, and oil prices are down to about $87,   reflecting expectations of slowing global demand  So it is not necessarily a US-only story   On the financial side, as Bill noted, a lot of things are going on  The latest is the likely   downgrade of one or more of the monoline insurers, which would cause banks and other   financial institutions to have to mark down billions more of their holdings  I think there is a   general sense—I certainly feel in talking to market participants—that it is not just subprime   anymore and that there are real concerns about other kinds of consumer credit—credit cards,   autos, and home equity loans—and that there is fear of housing prices falling enough that   contagion will infect prime mortgage loans  There is building in the market a real dynamic of   withdrawal from risk, withdrawal from normal credit extension, which I think is very worrisome   Would a rate action today, before the start of trading tomorrow, be of help?  I don’t   know  In some sense it was a lucky break that today was a holiday because in the middle of the   day we got a very good read on what the markets are doing tomorrow, and so we can get ahead   of things as opposed to being forced, after a couple of disastrous days, to respond  Again, I don’t   know if this would help, but I think that indicating that the Fed is on top of the situation and that   we are proposing to address economic and credit risks aggressively would help  In any case, it   would at least make clear that the Fed was in touch with the situation   I think we have to take a meaningful action—something that will have an important   effect  Therefore, I am proposing a cut of 75 basis points  I recognize that this is a very large   change  I would not do that if I thought that the size of the cut was inconsistent with our   medium-term macroeconomic objectives  Let me discuss that a few minutes   January 21, 2008 7 of 32    As I said to some of you, on Friday I had a briefing from Dave Stockton and his team   about their Greenbook forecast for next week’s meeting  They have not made an explicit   recession call, but they do forecast very weak growth going forward  More important, in order to   get that positive economic growth, they revised down their assumed path of the federal funds rate   by 100 basis points—50 basis points next week and 50 basis points in March  That gives a   cumulative decline in the staff’s fed funds assumption of 200 basis points since August, which is   consistent both with the markets and with a 225 basis point decline in medium-term r*, which is   an indicator of the neutral rate, as well as the optimal policy rate that they calculate  Importantly,   of course, we have lowered the funds rate only 100 basis points so far, so I think at first   approximation we are about 100 basis points behind the curve—something in that general area—  in terms of the neutral rate, and that itself doesn’t even take into account what I believe at this   point is a legitimate need for risk management     With respect to risk management, these credit risks obviously have the potential to feed   back into our financial system and to affect the economy going forward  I hope to be able to talk   next week more about a simulation the staff is working on, which shows that a severe recession   would create extraordinary credit losses for our financial institutions, with implications   obviously for credit extension and for financial stability  It is just one indicator, but a paper by   Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff has been circulated in the past couple of days, which compares   some indicators of our economy with other major financial crises and finds that we rank at the   moment among the five largest financial crises in any industrial country since World War II    Given what their indicators show, they conclude that, if we have only a mild recession in the   United States, it would be a very fortunate outcome  Now, I am not saying that this is   necessarily evidence, but I am saying that there are risks and that a careful approach should   January 21, 2008 8 of 32    allow for some easing with respect to risks  Governor Mishkin is not here  He is aware of this   meeting, but he is on the slopes—I think in Idaho somewhere  He has made I think a case for   being more aggressive initially, trying to address the problem, and then removing   accommodation as the situation calms down  I think there is a case for doing that, given the fact   that we have done 100 basis points and that we seem to have not really made a dent   Now, of course, there is also the issue of inflation  Many of you have valid concerns   about inflation  Let me just make a few comments on that  First, in the Greenbook, despite a   100 basis point drop in the rate assumption and the scenario that I take as being in some sense   optimistic in that it avoids an outright recession, the preliminary Greenbook forecast for 2009   has total PCE inflation at 17 percent and core PCE inflation at 19 percent  This does not take   into account any disinflationary effects that would arise if we did have an NBER recession or   worse  Again, I note that we have, for example, effects working through oil prices, which the   Greenbook doesn’t take into account directly  So I think, obviously, that we have to continue to   watch inflation and inflation expectations carefully  It is very important to do so  But at this   point we are facing, potentially, a broad-based crisis  We can no longer temporize  We have to   address this crisis  We have to try to get it under control  If we can’t do that, then we are just   going to lose control of the whole situation   So that is my case  I think we really have no choice but to try to get ahead of this  A   statement has been circulated  Those of you who wish to comment on the proposal—of course,   you can  You may wish to comment on the statement as well  But let me just stop there and see   what comments the Committee has  President Plosser?    Certainly  Let me do that  I had one word in the second   paragraph—the word “broader”—which I will come to      “The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal   funds rate 75 basis points to 3½ percent   The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and   increasing downside risks to growth  While strains in short-term funding markets have eased   somewhat, broader—add that word—financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate   and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households  Moreover, incoming   information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor   markets   The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will continue to   monitor inflation developments carefully     Appreciable downside risks to growth remain  The Committee will continue to assess the   effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely   manner as needed to address those risks”   President Evans    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  Who is next?  Would anyone else like to   speak?  Vice Chairman    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lacker      Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Fisher   January 21, 2008 16 of 32     Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Poole, did you want to intervene?    We don’t know what they are considering, but just to   anticipate my response to some of these comments, I think the situation in the United States, the   fundamental situation, is much more severe at this juncture than in Europe or the United   Kingdom  The basis for this move is not to calm markets per se but rather to get the funds rate   closer to where it ought to be on fundamental grounds  But to answer your question, I don’t   know what the ECB and the Bank of England are contemplating  You had a second question    Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner     Thank you  President Hoenig, does a language change on   inflation help you at all?    All right  Thank you  Let me make a few comments    Thank everyone for your input and your concerns, which I appreciate  This is a very, very   difficult situation, and no one can know exactly how this is going to work out  But let me try to   respond to a few points that were made  First of all, as I indicated earlier, I would not be   January 21, 2008 27 of 32    proposing this if I didn’t think that we were seriously behind the curve in terms of economic   growth and the financial situation  I said that on January 9, and since then the markets and the   data have only gotten significantly worse  I do believe that we are at least 100 basis points   behind the curve in terms of neutrality, and so I am quite comfortable with this order of   magnitude of move  Frankly, I think the evidence is very much in favor of it     With respect to what the real rate is, I would combine my response to you with a   comment to President Fisher, which is that real rates depend on expected inflation, not past   inflation  Inflation is a lagging indicator  We cannot wait until inflation is down before we   begin to act  We have to look at the future  We have seen oil prices down $10 already  We just   have to make a judgment  With the economy slowing and with oil prices likely to moderate, the   best guess is that inflation will be well controlled going forward  If that is not the case, we can   begin to address it  But I do believe that, from a forecast viewpoint, we don’t have a negative   real interest rate, and we don’t necessarily have inflation above 4 percent   I would like to address the issue of the lesson of 2001  I don’t think that the problem   with 2001 was the rate at which the interest rate was cut  The interest rate was cut more than   500 basis points, including three intermeeting moves of 50 basis points each in 2001    Nevertheless, at the end of that episode, inflation was too low, which is evidence I think that in   some sense the response was even inefficiently slow  Not that they could have necessarily done   better, but clearly it was not the cut itself that led to inflation problems  Governor Kohn’s points   notwithstanding, and it was very difficult to know ex ante what was right, if there is a concern   there it has to do with how quickly the rate was raised starting in 2004 going forward, when the   economy was already on a growth path  I think we have learned from that  I think we will be   very sensitive to that     January 21, 2008 28 of 32    Let me just add that I do intend to be talking more about the outlook and about policy  I   am sure that I will do my best to communicate where I think we are and how we are going to   manage policy going forward  I have talked specifically about the need to be aggressive in the   short run, particularly when financial stability is at stake  So again, my fundamental point is that   we are behind the curve  We need to do something to get up there     Why does that help markets?  Well, I think there are issues of psychology and dynamics   and damage that could be done if we let the markets twist and turn for another nine days  But the   fundamentals are also involved  The markets essentially—in their incredible efficiency—are   bringing into the present concerns about very bad outcomes that might happen in the future    With fair value accounting, mark to market, and all of those things, the risk that house prices   might fall 20 or 30 percent, even the small risk, is affecting today’s credit ratings and credit   markdowns  We can help the markets in a fundamental sense by assuring them that we are   aware of these risks and that, though we are not going to necessarily stop a slowdown, we will do   our best to minimize the tail risks of a really bad outcome that are right now driving today’s   market reactions  That would help the monoline insurers in the sense that, if the markets become   convinced that those risks are much smaller, then the obligations of the monolines insurers will   be less, and the willingness to advance capital might be greater   Again, if I thought that we were where we should be and this was just a question of   placating the markets, I would not be here talking to you  But I think that we need to move, and   if we move now, we will get a bonus in terms of at least some hope of reducing the fear and the   uncertainty that is currently in the markets  So I do think it matters whether we move today or   move nine days from now  I recognize the risks, but in the two years that I have been here in this   position, we have not moved intermeeting  We waited a long time to move in September after   January 21, 2008 29 of 32    our intermeeting statement  I don’t think that we are trigger happy  I don’t think we are   perceived as trigger happy  I think that we need to be catching up to where the right interest rate   is, and that is the essence of the issue  I guess that is all I have to say     As I said, Governor Mishkin is not here  For what it is worth, he authorized me to say   that he supports the action and the statement  We are currently at a very critical juncture  We   are being watched very carefully  We have to demonstrate our willingness to address these very,   very serious risks  I think we ought to go ahead and take this step, and I hope that you can   support this action  Are there any other comments?  President Hoenig    Did you want to accept Governor Kroszner’s suggestion?   January 21, 2008 30 of 32     Okay  Governor Kroszner’s suggestion was to say, “The   Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue   to monitor inflation developments carefully”  Does that work for everybody?  All right  If there   are no further comments, I would like to call the roll, please    Okay  Thank you very much  Again, I am sorry to   interrupt your holiday, and we will see you next week in Washington  Thank you  The meeting   is adjourned   END OF MEETING       January 21, 2008 32 of 32     "

President Plosser  Oh, I am sorry—a two-hander    President Plosser    I wonder if I could entice anybody for a cup of coffee    [Laughter]  Why don’t we take a fifteen-minute break, and then we’ll commence with the go-  round  Thank you   [Coffee break]    If it is okay with everybody, we can start the economic go-  round at this point  President Poole, you are up   January 29–30, 2008 49 of 249     Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Lacker    Vice Chairman   January 29–30, 2008 55 of 249     President Lacker    Thank you  President Plosser   January 29–30, 2008 59 of 249     Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Hoenig   January 29–30, 2008 67 of 249     Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner   January 29–30, 2008 89 of 249     Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you, and thank you all for succinct and very insightful   comments  [Laughter]  I’m going to try as usual to summarize what I’ve heard; but even more so   than usual, no warranty is expressed or implied  Again, trying to bring together some of the   comments, we noted that incoming data since the last meeting have been broadly weaker than   expected, and anecdotes generally suggest slower growth, in some cases significantly slower   growth  Housing demand, construction, and prices have continued to weaken, and inventories of   unsold homes are little changed  Housing weakness has implications for employment, consumer   spending, and credit conditions     With respect to households, consumption growth has slowed, reflecting falling house and   equity prices and other factors, including generally greater pessimism about the labor market and   economic prospects  The labor market has softened by a range of measures, with unemployment   jumping in December  However, workers in some occupations remain in short supply  Together   with financial indicators, weaker labor and consumption data suggest that the economy is at a risk of   recession; in any case, it is likely to grow slowly for the first half of the year  The second half of the   year may be better, the result of easier monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and possible improvement   in housing and credit markets  However, there are significant downside risks to growth, including   the possibility of an adverse feedback loop between the economy and credit markets   Reports by firms are mixed  Investment may have slowed, reflecting uncertainty and slower   growth in demand  Commercial real estate activity may be constrained by tighter credit conditions    Manufacturing is slow to mixed, though IT, energy, and some other sectors continue to be strong    Financial markets remain stressed  Credit conditions more generally appear to be worsening, and   the problems may be spreading beyond housing  Additional risks are posed by the problems of the   monoline insurers  Credit losses have induced tighter lending standards, and a key question is how   January 29–30, 2008 96 of 249    severe those may become and how persistent they may be  One offset is the ability of banks to raise   capital   Core inflation and headline inflation have remained stubbornly high and are a concern  One   risk is the ability of some firms to pass through higher input costs  Inflation compensation has risen   at long horizons, reflecting some combination of higher inflation expectations and inflation risk   premiums  Going forward, a slowing economy, anchored inflation expectations, and possibly   stabilizing food and energy prices should lead to more moderate core and total inflation  However,   some see upside risks, especially the possibility that higher headline inflation might affect inflation   expectations  So that’s my attempt to summarize  There’s a great deal more detail and a great deal   more color in the conversations around the table   Let me try to add a few points  Again, much of what I’ll say has been said  I do think that   there has been a significant deterioration in the outlook for economic growth and an increase in the   downside risks to growth  It was sufficiently severe as to prompt me to call the January 9   videoconference that we had, and I think that since then we have had further deterioration  A   number of things have happened and are going on  Very important, perhaps most important, is the   continued further deterioration in the prospects for the housing market  Housing, of course, feeds   directly into the real economy through employment, income, and wealth, and I think there are some   indications that spillover from the housing sector to the rest of the economy is increasing  However,   the critical aspect of the housing outlook is the relationship to the financial system, which I’ll come   back to     Consumer spending has slowed  I think there’s little doubt about that at this point  There   are a lot of factors now that are acting as headwinds in the consumer sector  Let me just point out   the basic fact that most households in the United States have very little in the way of liquid financial   January 29–30, 2008 97 of 249    assets  Therefore, when they, on the one hand, are denied access to home equity if they see tighter   credit conditions on cards, autos, and so on, and if at the same time they see greater uncertainty in   the economy and the labor market, then their natural tendency would be to be much more   conservative in their spending  I do note that fiscal action may be of some help, particularly for   people in that kind of situation  Like President Yellen, I think the indicators of a weakening labor   market are broader than just the payroll report  There are a number of other things as well  We may   get a better report this week  The UI claims are a little encouraging, but I do think that the   weakening economy is going to drag down the labor market to some extent  Certainly the financial   markets have deteriorated, reflecting greater concern about recession  We see it in the equity   markets but also in short-term interest rates and a variety of credit measures as well  Finally, just   going through this list of items, we continue to see problems—credit issues, banks concerned about   additional losses not just in mortgages but perhaps in other areas as well—with the potential   implication of a further tightening of credit conditions   Those are some of the developments that we’ve seen since the last meeting  On our   January 9 call, I talked about the regime-switch model and those ways of thinking about the   business cycle  Others have talked about that today  I think many of those models would suggest   that the probability of recession at this point is quite high, at least 50 percent or more  I don’t think   any of us would be happy to see a garden variety NBER recession; but if we had that, there would   probably be a few benefits, including correction of some imbalances that we’re seeing in the   economy and perhaps some reduction at the edge in the inflation picture  But, like others, I am most   concerned about what has been called the adverse feedback loop—the interaction between a   slowing economy and the credit markets  A phrase you might have heard, which is getting great   currency among bankers, is “jingle mail”  Jingle mail is what happens when otherwise prime   January 29–30, 2008 98 of 249    borrowers decide that the value of their house is worth so much less than the principal of their   mortgage that they just mail their keys to the bank  (I wonder if that 140 percent is the right loan-to-  value number  Maybe it’s less than that)  Even if prime mortgages hold up—and I think in some   regions of the country there will be significant problems with prime mortgages—there is a lot of   other potential trouble  We’re just beginning to enter the period of maximum subprime ARM   resets  Second lien piggybacks and home equity loans are all questionable at this point  We haven’t   begun to address the option ARM issue, which is about the same size as the subprime ARM   category, and of course, we have the issues with the monolines and private mortgage insurers    Outside of mortgages, expectations for credit performance are worsening in a range of areas,   including commercial real estate and corporate credit  So I think that even under the relatively   benign scenario that the Greenbook foresees, we’re going to see a lot of pressure in the credit   markets and perhaps a long period of balance sheet repair, tight credit, and a drag on the economy    Again, our experience with financial drag or headwinds has been that it can be quite powerful and   deceptively so, and I think that’s a significant concern   Now, the central issue here, though, ultimately comes back to the housing market  Certainly   by this point there must be some pent-up demand for housing  We’ve had obviously very low sales   for a period  House prices are soft  Mortgage rates are low  Affordability is better  What’s   keeping people from buying houses is the fact that other people aren’t buying houses  If there were   some sense that a bottom was forming in the market or in house prices, we probably could actually   see a pretty quick snap-back, an increase in housing demand, and that in turn would feed back into   the credit markets, I think, in a very beneficial way  So there’s the possibility that, if the housing   market can get restarted, we could get a relatively benign outcome    However, there appears to be a law of nature that the   turnaround in the housing market is always six months from the present date  We simply don’t have   any evidence whatsoever that the housing market is bottoming out  We have guesses and estimates   about how far prices will fall and how far demand and construction will fall  The key issue is   prices, and we are far from seeing the worst case scenario that you could imagine in prices  So long   as we don’t see any stabilization in the housing market or stabilization in house prices, then I don’t   think we can say that the downside risks to the economy or to the credit system have been   contained  Until that point, I think we need to be very, very alert to those risks   Everyone has talked about inflation, as should be the case  I am also concerned  The pickup   in core inflation is disappointing  There are some mitigating factors, such as the role of nonmarket   prices, which tend not to be serially correlated  We haven’t discussed owners’ equivalent rent in   this meeting for the first time in a while, but we know that it can behave in rather odd ways during   periods of housing slowdowns  The hope is that energy and food prices will moderate; in fact, if oil   prices do rise by less than the two-thirds increase of last year, it would obviously be helpful    Nominal wages don’t seem to be reflecting high inflation expectations at this point  So I think there   are some reasons for optimism; but as many people pointed out, there are upward pressures,   including the point that President Fisher made that the lagged effects of the previous increases in   energy, food, and other commodity prices have probably not been fully realized in core inflation    Furthermore, as we’ll talk about more tomorrow, to the extent that we decide at this meeting to take   out some insurance against downside risks, then implicit in that insurance premium might be a   greater risk of inflation six months or a year from now  So we have to take that into account as we   think about policy and about our communications, as President Plosser and others have pointed out    In particular, as Governor Mishkin and others have noted, we need to think about a policy strategy   January 29–30, 2008 100 of 249    that will involve not only providing adequate insurance against what I consider to be serious   downside risks but also a policy strategy that involves removing the accommodation in a timely   way when those risks have moderated sufficiently   So my reading of the situation is that it’s exceptionally fluid and that the financial risks, in   particular—as we saw, for example, after the October meeting—can be very hard to predict  There   are a lot of interactions between the financial markets and the real economy that are potentially   destabilizing, and so we are going to have to be proactive in trying to stabilize the situation,   recognizing that we have a confluence of circumstances that is extraordinarily difficult and that no   policy approach will deliver the optimal outcome in the short term  We’re just going to have to try   to choose a path that will give us the best that we can get, given the circumstances that we’re facing   All right  Any further comments or questions?  We will reconvene tomorrow at nine   o’clock  There is a reception and dinner, optional, available in the Martin Building  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]   January 29–30, 2008 101 of 249    January 30, 2008—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody  Let’s begin our meeting by   calling on Dave Stockton to report on the GDP data    Thank you  Are there any questions for Dave?  If not,   Brian, would you like to talk now?    Thank you  Are there questions for Brian?  Governor   Mishkin    President Evans    President Lacker    I have just a technical question on inflation expectations    You presented to us at some point a variation of the model in which the policy action itself was   fed into the model for inflation expectations  Is that part of the model at this point?    So the answer is that the funds rate is affecting inflation   expectations in these simulations    Vice Chairman    I think that it is hard to generalize  You say there are so   few recessions, so the specific communication that is undertaken—for example, in the last   episode there was actually communication that leaned against the rapid reversal—you know,   January 29–30, 2008 113 of 249    “considerable period” and so on  So rather than trying to generalize from two examples, I think   it would much more have to do with how we present the outlook and communicate our   intentions  Other questions for Brian?  Governor Mishkin    President Poole, you had an interjection?    President Evans    President Lacker    I don’t think so  I would just point out that with the   1990-91 episode, inflation after the recession—after the whole episode was over—was   significantly lower than in the period before it  So if there are headwinds that are bringing the   economy below potential and are causing high unemployment, for example, there has to be a   mechanism  Expectations have to be tied to something, and there has to be some way in which   January 29–30, 2008 117 of 249    excessively low interest rates are stimulating inflation, through either commodity prices or wage   pressures or some other mechanism  If those pressures aren’t there because of headwinds or   some other factor, then unusually low interest rates will not by themselves create inflation  Vice   Chairman, did you have anything else you wanted to add?    Could we start our policy round?  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Rosengren    President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Poole    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Why don’t we take a coffee break and come back   at 11 o’clock?  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we recommence  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin     Thank you  President Poole    Vice Chairman    Thank you, and thank you all  Let me make a few comments    The recent period has been more ragged in terms of policy and communications than I would have   liked  In particular, during the past few months I think a perception has developed that we are   tentative and indecisive and are not communicating clearly enough to the markets and to the public    Now, whether that’s fair or not, that perception is there and has to be addressed  I think we have   begun to address it with our recent communications and the strong policy action that we took last   week  For my part, I plan to speak more often and more clearly in public about the economy and   January 29–30, 2008 153 of 249    our policy strategy, and to do that I will need your continued thoughtful input and support  All that   has happened notwithstanding, I think we now have the opportunity to get policy to about the right   place  As we have all noted, the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed sharply around   the turn of the year  I am very hopeful that the labor market report this Friday will be positive    However, as I mentioned yesterday, there is as yet no evidence whatsoever that the housing market   is stabilizing, as the new home sales data show  So long as house prices keep falling, we cannot rule   out some extremely serious downside risks to our economy and to our financial system  We need to   be proactive and forceful, not tentative and indecisive, in addressing this risk     I recommend a 50 basis point cut at this meeting, to 3 percent  This is the value that the   Greenbook forecast requires to achieve modest growth later this year and price stability by next   year  A decline of 225 basis points since last August fits well with both constructed indicators, like   the staff’s medium-term r*, as well as market indicators such as short-term nominal interest rates  A   3 percent funds rate is lower than most Taylor rule prescriptions, but the Taylor rule makes no   allowance for current unsettled conditions in financial markets, including spreads and bank capital   constraints, which make a given value of the funds rate less accommodative today than it would be   in normal circumstances  In contrast, the Greenbook analysis attempts to take those financial   conditions into account  Even at the 3 percent level, assuming that the Greenbook analysis is in the   right ballpark, we would be making little or no allowance for risk-management considerations, as   several people have pointed out  For that reason, it’s instructive to note that the Greenbook has a   flat path that doesn’t reverse, and the reason is precisely that they’re in a certainty-equivalent   framework without any insurance having been taken out  If you accept risk-management principles,   then we should be considering the possibility of cutting below 3 percent and then reversing when   January 29–30, 2008 154 of 249    that insurance is no longer needed  However, 125 basis points of ease in two weeks is certainly a   good amount, and I don’t think that going further at this time is advisable   Regarding the statement, I recommend alternative B  It is very similar to our statement of   last week in the description of the economy  There are two main differences, both in paragraph 4    First, and very important, we acknowledge our two recent policy actions, including today, and note   that they should lead to moderate economic growth and to mitigation of risks  The latter part is   strictly true because a cut will certainly mitigate risks, but it may be read to say that we think we’ve   taken out a little insurance, which is, as I said, somewhat debatable  That’s something we can   discuss in the future  Second, the downside risks are no longer described as “appreciable”  I think   both of these steps will serve to moderate expectations of further rate reductions by indicating that   we think that our actions thus far go a substantial distance in addressing the downside risks     I strongly counsel, however, against taking out the sentence referring to downside risks    First of all, it’s not plausible that downside risks that were appreciable just last week are no longer   an issue today; and indeed, in the projections that we’ve submitted, the Committee overwhelmingly   saw a downside risk to economic growth  We have to be honest about that  Second, although I   realize what the intent of that change would be, which would be to say that we’re not promising   further cuts, it could actually be read in quite the opposite way, which is that we are saying we’re   not making further cuts even if the conditions warrant, and that would put us back in the situation   we were in at the end of October, when the market was confused about whether or not we were   willing to respond to circumstances  We have to maintain a posture of flexibility and   responsiveness in this fluid situation, and drawing a line in the sand is not the way to do that  I’m   also reluctant to make the other changes that have been suggested  I understand the purposes behind   them, but I’m very conservative about changing wording that has just been used a week ago in a   January 29–30, 2008 155 of 249    statement and less than three weeks ago in my speeches  It’s just so risky to give the impression   that we are changing course when we have just simply now identified the downside risk and have   taken aggressive action in that direction   Now, I understand that several of you will be quite unhappy with the nature of that   statement, and let me try to reassure you in the following way  Rather than trying to convey all the   subtleties of our policy strategy in the statement—and here I agree with President Poole, who has   pointed to the limitations of the statement—I propose to supplement the message of the statement,   as I said, by commenting more on the economy and the policy in public speeches and in   testimonies  Between now and the next FOMC meeting I have a testimony the week after next, I   have the Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies, and I have a speech, and in each of those I will talk about   the economy and the policy strategy that we are taking  In particular, subject to your counsel and   individual, perhaps even collective, consultation, in my public speaking I will try to make three   main points   First, I will try to reinforce the message of the statement, which is that the Federal Reserve   recognizes the downside risks to economic activity and we are on the case  We have already moved   aggressively and proactively, and we are prepared to respond in a timely manner as needed to   mitigate the risks of very bad outcomes  Conveying the message that the Fed will be active and   willing to mitigate tail risk is critical for achieving financial stabilization, which in turn is necessary   for achieving economic stabilization  We have to show that we’re in touch  But—and let me now   address these points in particular to President Plosser and others who have raised concerns—the   second point I will make is that the Fed is not on autopilot for further rate cuts  Monetary policy   takes time to work, and our recent actions will do little for the economy over the next few months    Thus, some weak economic news is to be expected in the near term and is not a prima facie case for   January 29–30, 2008 156 of 249    additional easing  Instead, we will be data-dependent in the specific sense that we will respond to   the incoming information that affects the medium-term outlook and to our assessment of the risks    The third point I will make in my public comments is that, to the extent that we are being proactive   in addressing downside risks to the economy, we must also be proactive in removing   accommodation once the economy is on a sustainable recovery path, and we must be clear about the   circumstances that will prompt that reversal  Again, in saying this I reiterate that it’s not clear that   we have yet taken out a great deal of insurance; nevertheless, I think that point needs to be made    The need for making a policy reversal at an appropriate point, which may not be the next six months   but when the conditions warrant, is important; moreover, I think it’s actually credible  If you look at   the dealer surveys or the fed funds futures, they show a hockey stick  They do show a response and   then change, coming back later this year or next year   So that’s what I’d like to do  I’d like to be conservative with the statement  Given some of   the problems we’ve had, I don’t want to do any right turns or U-turns or add any confusion  I want   to continue on message in terms of where we have been in the past few weeks  But recognizing the   subtleties of our policy approach, the concerns that we have about inflation and about financial   conditions and economic growth, I will be making a concerted effort to try to explain in public the   subtleties of our strategy and of our economic outlook  I hope we can present a united front to the   public behind the strategy to the extent possible  Again, I appreciate your support and   understanding of the very difficult pressures and conflicting forces that we face  So that’s my   recommendation  I would be happy to take any further comments  If none, Debbie, can you call the   roll?    Thank you very much  We’ll take just a very quick recess for   the Governors to meet, and then we’ll come back for our presentation   [Meeting recessed]    Okay  Let’s reconvene  We have a special presentation on   policy issues raised by financial crisis  Let me turn to Pat Parkinson to introduce the presentation    Are there questions for Pat?  President Lacker    President Poole   January 29–30, 2008 162 of 249     President Hoenig    Do you have a question, President Yellen?    President Rosengren    Vice Chairman    Are there other questions for Pat?  Okay  We can continue the   presentation    Questions?  President Lacker   January 29–30, 2008 170 of 249     President Fisher    Governor Mishkin    President Hoenig    President Poole    Governor Kohn    Did you have any questions?    Governor Kroszner    I have President Evans for a two-hander and then President   Lockhart and President Lacker  I also see that President Plosser has a two-hander, and I think at that   point we should probably go onto the last presentation    Okay  All right  So President Evans, President Lockhart, and   President Lacker    President Lockhart   January 29–30, 2008 181 of 249     President Lacker    Okay  Thank you  Why don’t we continue with the final   portion?   January 29–30, 2008 183 of 249     Thank you  Questions?  President Rosengren   January 29–30, 2008 188 of 249     President Hoenig    Vice Chairman    Let me also thank the staff for an excellent presentation  This   is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work that’s being done on all these different topics, and   in turn we’re collaborating with our colleagues here in the United States and abroad, and I guess   we’ll keep working and hope to find some valuable lessons out of this experience   I’ve been asked to remind people that you have until tomorrow close of business if you wish   to revise your projections  Brian Madigan raised a few questions about consistency  If you want to   think about that, of course, feel free to do so  Our next meeting is March 18  I look forward to   seeing you then, and there’s a lunch available for those of you who can stay  Thank you very much    The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   January 29–30, 2008 194 of 249     "
8383,2008-03-10,BERNANKE,"  Good evening, everybody  I am sorry, once again, to have   to call you together on short notice  We live in a very special time  We have seen, as you know,   significant deterioration in term funding markets and more broadly in the financial markets in the   last few days  Some of this is credit deterioration, certainly, given increased expectations of   recession; but there also seem to be some self-feeding liquidity dynamics at work as well  So the   question before us is whether there are actions we can take, other than monetary policy, to break   or mitigate this adverse dynamic   There are two actions on the table, which I think we should just try to consider together,   if possible  The first is the proposed term securities lending facility—I know you received the   documentation on this without much notice, but we will get some explanation in the meeting    The second item—we have received formal requests from the European Central Bank (ECB) and   from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to expand and extend the currency swap lines that we have   with them  As you recall, in December we had a coordinated action, which involved the ECB   and the SNB doing dollar funding auctions that piggybacked on our term auction facility  They   stopped doing that after the turn of the year, but they would like to return to doing that now for   some time  They think that dollar funding conditions warrant it  They are requesting that we   raise their swap lines  The ECB’s line is currently $20 billion  It would like to raise its line to   $30 billion, so it can do two $15 billion auctions a month  The Swiss National Bank would like   to have its $4 billion line raised to $6 billion, so it can do one $6 billion auction each month    That would be a coordinated effort  We would have a joint statement, along with the United   Kingdom and Canada, and also supporting statements from Sweden and Japan  So it would be a   March 10, 2008 3 of 39    type of coordination similar to the one we saw in December  Again, the request is to increase the   swap lines and to extend them, and we propose to extend them through September 30  That   requires a vote of the FOMC, and so, again, we have two items for your discussion   I would like to proceed as follows  I am going to turn first to Bill Dudley and his   colleagues in New York to give us a brief update on market conditions and then to outline for us   the proposed term securities lending facility and how it would work and what we hope it would   do in the markets  I don’t think extensive exposition of the swaps is necessary, but any questions   are welcome  After New York’s presentation, we have Bill, Brian Madigan, Scott Alvarez, and   other staff here, if you have any questions  Following that, we would have a go-round and get   comments and positions, and then we proceed to votes  So without further ado, let me turn to   Bill in New York to start with a market update and then to talk a bit about the proposed facility    Bill      Thank you very much  We have all the staff here  Are   there any questions about any aspect of the presentation or about the swaps?  President Hoenig    Scott, do you want to answer the first part about   section 13(3)?    We would not be setting a price floor for the asset, but we   would be trying to reduce the liquidity premium  If there were further deterioration in price   associated with the credit risk, that would still show through    President Fisher has a question    This is the question phase now  We will have a chance for   everyone who would like to speak to do so    I would like to note that I did talk to Chairman Cox today   about this and got his strong support    Other questions?    President Lockhart    Any other questions?  President Plosser    President Plosser, I would make just a couple of comments,   and Bill can follow  On the slippery slope, it requires an FOMC vote to add assets  So if we   come to that point, you will have your opportunity to vote “no” or to object  Again, we don’t   propose to do that—but, you know, time consistency  I’m sorry, what was the other thing?  Oh,   you asked about the duration  The section 13(3) legal basis for this operation requires an   affirmation that market conditions are significantly impaired  If we couldn’t honestly make that   affirmation, our legal basis would disappear  So I think we would have to remove it once   conditions had normalized  Bill, do you have anything to add to that?    Gee, thanks  [Laughter]  Charlie, did you have other   questions?  No?  President Rosengren    President Pianalto, do you have a question?    President Evans    Okay  President Fisher, do you have another question?   March 10, 2008 15 of 39     I agree, President Fisher  We have deficiencies in our   regulatory system  Even this change would take us short of what the ECB routinely already has   because they don’t have this division of commercial and investment banks, and they have   essentially a much broader ability to take collateral  There is a problem, and it is a long-term   issue  But the Treasury, for example, is looking at some of these regulatory structure issues   going forward  Are there other questions?  President Evans    But not in a legal sense    I think President Evans is asking if we would have liability   in some legal sense, and I don’t think we would  We have the right to decline any counterparty    President Hoenig    I think we have moved into the commentary period    [Laughter]  President Yellen, did you have a question?      All right  Let’s start with President Lacker, then  President   Lacker    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Rosengren    Other comments?  President Plosser    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  On exit strategies, we do get a lot of feedback   from the auction itself, of course, in terms of demand and price, and we can monitor the market   conditions  Obviously, we’ll keep you well apprised of developments in the markets and in the   auction  I’m a little worried about having a firm cutoff date ex ante  If we want the dealers to make   markets, we need them to feel that there will not be an arbitrary cutoff when the situation is still in a   turbulent state  But that’s just a thought  President Evans    Thank you  President Lockhart    Other comments?  If you’re prepared to take a vote—oh, I’m   sorry  You know, it’s very late here in the East Coast  Governor Warsh      Thank you  Governor Kroszner   March 10, 2008 30 of 39     Any other comments?  Vice Chairman Geithner    Thank you  So, there are different ways to look at this  We’re   crossing certain lines  We’re doing things we haven’t done before  On the other hand, this financial   crisis is now in its eighth month, and the economic outlook has worsened quite significantly  We   are coming to the limits of our monetary policy capability  The Congress has passed a fiscal   March 10, 2008 33 of 39    program  I do not know how much political capacity there is to do additional things, although I   assure you that we will be thinking hard about it and I hope you will be, too     So I view this really as incremental, and I think we need to be flexible and creative in the   face of what are really extraordinary challenges  This is a combination of circumstances—a deep   and abiding financial crisis, a serious slowdown, and inflation pressures  This combination is really   a very challenging and an almost unprecedented combination  I think we need to be flexible,   creative, and thoughtful in going forward  I think this is a very creative idea  It’s well put together    We will have to do our very best to report regularly to the FOMC for your governance and your   oversight of this process  It’s not without risks, but I do feel that this is the next step  Whether we   will have to take additional steps, we’ll come back to you if we think we do or if you think we do    But right now I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that this is probably the best option that we   have, and it comes at a critical time in terms of where the markets are  If there are no other   comments, I’d like to ask Scott to tell us what is required of us to move forward    President Lacker    Any other questions?  Debbie, could you call the roll?    Thank you  We turn now to the swap authorization    Finally, the Swiss    Thank you  There will be an announcement at 830 am   Eastern time tomorrow simultaneously with four other central banks and supporting statements   from Japan and Sweden, just like in December  Brian, why don’t you quickly read the   announcement?    Okay  Thank you all  Again, thank you for the short-notice   meeting  I apologize for that  We’ll see you next week in Washington  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   March 10, 2008 39 of 39     "
8401,2008-03-18,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Let me extend a welcome to First   Vice President Sapenaro, who is sitting in for St Louis this morning  A quick comment on special   topics  I’m sure we’re all disappointed that we won’t have further conversations on the   communications strategy, [laughter] but that being the case, we have the opportunity to have special   topics again  In April we will be discussing interest on reserves, as we mentioned before  We asked   for suggestions for October, and a number of Banks proposed to look at inflation modeling, which   seems obviously a good and policy-relevant topic  So that is what we propose to do in October    We look forward to Reserve Banks taking the lead on presentation and research in this area, and   there will be meetings among the research directors and the System Research Advisory Committee   to figure out how to go forward, but obviously we have about seven months to get to that  We look   forward to having special topics  So the first item, Mr Dudley, if you’re ready    Are there any questions for Bill?  Vice Chairman    We thank you  President Lacker    President Lacker    You make a good point, President Lacker  President Fisher    President Rosengren    Governor Warsh     I think it is incumbent upon me to point out that the Board   staff was also very involved, and I mention Brian Madigan, Pat Parkinson, Scott Alvarez,   March 18, 2008 13 of 127    Deborah Bailey, and others as well  So it was very much a joint effort  Other questions for Bill?    If not, we’ll turn to Dave Stockton  Oh, I am sorry, we need a vote to ratify the open market   operations    Without objection  Thank you  Now to Dave Stockton    Thank you  Questions?  President Fisher     President Evans    Other questions?  If not, we will begin our economic go-  round  President Hoenig     Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  First Vice President Sapenaro    Thank you  President Plosser    AEIOU    Okay  Thank you  It’s 1035  Why don’t we take twenty   minutes for coffee  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we reconvene  Let’s start with President   Fisher    Certainly    Okay  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner     Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Well, let him finish  Are you done?    President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you very much  Thank you for all of your comments    Let me just briefly summarize and add a few points  To summarize the discussion, incoming data   have been weak, and some view the economy as having entered recession  Housing demand and   construction have continued to decline sharply, and house-price declines have been somewhat   greater than expected  Housing weakness has implications for employment, for consumer spending,   and for credit conditions  It also leads to 21 miles of empty boxcars  [Laughter]   Financial conditions have worsened considerably, reflecting weakness in housing prices,   and credit markets in particular are highly stressed and illiquid  Wider spreads have offset some or   all of the decline in safe rates for many credit products, and credit conditions are tighter for most   borrowers  Financial conditions are likely to be a significant drag on economic growth  Some   noted the risk that continued financial turmoil could lead to a more serious and prolonged recession,   implying possibly large downside risk to growth  With respect to households, consumption growth   has flattened out, and there was generally greater pessimism about the labor market and economic   prospects  Consumer credit quality may be worsening  Payroll employment growth has turned   negative  There was little expectation expressed of strong help from the fiscal stimulus package    Firms are generally more pessimistic and cautious but also remain concerned about cost pressures    Inventories look to be in balance  Exports continue to be an important source of final demand and   will continue to contribute significantly to growth, although it’s possible that growth abroad may   slow   Readings on core inflation have been mixed  Increases in energy and commodity prices are   important sources of increased headline inflation, and some producers have adopted a cost-plus   March 18, 2008 76 of 127    mentality  Agricultural prices, in particular, are up a good bit  Inflation breakevens are up   somewhat, especially at the five-by-five horizon  The dollar has depreciated, potentially adding to   longer-term inflation pressures and adding some risks  However, nominal wage increases are   moderate, as are unit labor costs, and US and global economic weakness could moderate gains in   commodity prices and create domestic economic slack  Several members warned about the risk of   losing inflation credibility  Any comments, thoughts?   Let me make just a few comments  Again, I’m very sympathetic to what almost everyone   has said around the table, in particular the fact that we’re facing a three-front war, if you will, which   makes this extraordinarily difficult and delicate  I thought in January that we were in recession    That was my view at that time, and I certainly believe it now  The Greenbook has done a good job   of trying to factor in the data and the other types of evidence  I think I’m actually slightly darker on   growth than the Greenbook is  The reason is that I don’t see where the recovery is coming from in   the beginning of next year  In particular, we won’t have a recovery until financial markets stabilize,   and the financial markets won’t stabilize until house prices stabilize, and there is simply no   particular reason to choose a time for that to happen  So I do think that the downside risks are quite   significant and that this so-called adverse feedback loop is currently in full play  At some point, of   course, either things will stabilize or there will be some kind of massive governmental intervention,   but I just don’t have much confidence about the timing of that   I would like to say a word  I would just agree with Governor Mishkin about the efficacy of   our policy  I think that it has had an effect and it has been beneficial  We obviously affect short-  term rates, including commercial paper rates and the like, which have implications for financing and   for borrowing  We affect the dollar, which has mixed effects, but on the growth side has some   positive effects  It’s true, as President Fisher pointed out, that medium-term and long-term rates   March 18, 2008 77 of 127    have not fallen because lower Treasury rates have been offset by higher spreads, but again, the   question is the counterfactual  Where would we be if we had not lowered rates?  I think that lower   rates have both lowered safe rates and offset to some extent the rising concerns about solvency,   which have caused the credit spreads to widen  I think this argument can go either way  You can   say that our policy is less effective and, therefore, we should do more of it  So there are two ways   of looking at that  In addition, there may be some benefits for capital formation of low financing   rates and a steep yield curve in keeping bank share prices from entirely collapsing   On inflation, I agree with much of what’s been said, and I’m very concerned about it  Let   me make one simple point, though, which I don’t think has been adequately discussed  Ninety-five   percent of the inflation that we’re seeing is either the direct or the indirect effect of globally traded   commodity prices—food, energy, and other commodities  What is happening is that there is a   change in the relative price of, say, oil and the wage of an Ohio manufacturing worker  There’s a   relative price change going on  That has to happen one way or the other  It can happen either by   overall increases in the nominal price of oil, which are reflected in overall increases in headline CPI   inflation, or by lower or negative growth in nominal wages  Now, if we have temporary movements   in these relative prices, I think all the theory tells us that the best way to let that relative price change   happen is to let the shock feed through; let the prices of energy, commodities, and so on rise; accept   a temporary increase in headline inflation; and focus on making sure that the increase in headline   inflation doesn’t feed through into domestic core inflation, say, through wages or domestic prices    A good response to that is, well, we’ve had a lot of “temporary” shocks here and they have gone on   for a long time  That’s certainly true  But again, it was very difficult to anticipate how these prices   have moved     March 18, 2008 78 of 127    Looking forward, the futures markets have been wrong and wrong, but they are the best we   have  In my view, if we think about the likely slowdown in the US economy and the global   economy, there are going to be some forces that will prevent commodity prices from continuing to   rise the way they have been rising, which ought to take the pressure off the inflation process  That   being said, I fully recognize that there has been a bit of movement in some of the indicators  I think   I like the use of the index measure  It uses lots of different indicators  I don’t think we should   overemphasize inflation compensation  For example, the one-year inflation compensation three and   four years out has moved up less than the five-by-five, and I think for good reasons  The five-by-  five could reflect, again, general uncertainty  It could also reflect more volatility in the relative price   changes of oil, for example  If we think there’s more volatility in that, if it’s up or down, that would   create more uncertainty about headline inflation and would feed through into that spread   Frankly, in thinking about inflation, I am concerned about inflation expectations and the   general psychology  I’m hopeful at least that it will moderate as commodity prices moderate   although, of course, no one can know for sure  I agree with Governor Warsh that, from a financial   perspective on the inflation side, the greater dangers are in the currency area  Exchange rates are   very poorly tied down by fundamentals, except over very long periods of time—I think Ken Rogoff   had a paper in which he said that over maybe 600 years or so the PPP finally works  [Laughter]  So   a lot of psychology is there  I think that it is an important issue  We need to think about what the   Treasury will say and those sorts of things  That is a concern, and I consider that in some sense a   greater risk at this point   So there are risks on both sides  I think that the downside risks, including the financial risks,   at this point are greater—not to belittle inflation risks, which I think are quite significant  We are   obviously going to have to make tradeoffs about how to deal with these  Using both our policy   March 18, 2008 79 of 127    tools and our communication is very important  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that we need   and I need—and I have a very important role here—to maintain clarity in communication about our   attention to inflation, that we are not ignoring that side of the mandate   Finally, let me just say, as I said last night at the dinner with the presidents, that I think we   are getting to the point where the Federal Reserve’s tools, both its liquidity tools and its interest rate   tools, are not by themselves sufficient to resolve our troubles  More help, more activity, from the   Congress and the Administration to address housing issues, for example, would be desirable  We   are certainly working on those issues here at the Board, and I will be talking to people in   Washington about what might be done to try to address more fundamentally these issues of the   housing market and the financial markets  So those are my comments  Why don’t we turn now to   Brian for an introduction to the policy round    Thank you  Bill    Okay  Thank you  Questions?  Vice Chairman    No    I would think of them as complementary—they are not strong   substitutes, obviously—in the sense that, as is often pointed out, the liquidity measures can affect   credit and solvency concerns    Brian    Governor Mishkin    President Fisher    Okay  President Evans   March 18, 2008 86 of 127     Any other questions for Brian?  With your indulgence, it has   been a very volatile period with a lot of changes in views  We’re also a little short of time  I think it   might be more focused if I gave a proposal and had people react to it  President Plosser made the   correct point that we need to think about the level of the funds rate  Where should it be?  I think it   needs to be lower, frankly  In our last meeting, at 3 percent, many of us viewed that as about neutral   without much insurance  Since then we’ve seen, I believe, a much stronger indication of recession,   an increase in downside risks  When I spoke about the downside risks in the Congress and in   speeches, I cited three categories of risks  housing, finance, and labor markets  All of those have   transpired in that direction  So I do think we have to respond effectively against that  For that   reason I would recommend the 75 basis point reduction  I recognize the concerns people have, and   I have them myself, about both inflation and the dollar  So I would make two comments regarding   that  First, we will be even now disappointing the market somewhat  A more aggressive ease is   built in  Second, as Brian already indicated, in a number of places in alternative A, which I am   proposing, we have ratcheted up the language about inflation, notably in paragraph 3, where we talk   March 18, 2008 87 of 127    about it being elevated and inflation expectations, and in the last sentence, where we reinstitute price   stability and clarify what our dual mandate is   Minor comments  I’m open to anything, but I point out that in paragraph 3 we added the list   of explanations for why inflation may moderate  We didn’t have that last time  If people are   uncomfortable with that, we can take that out  The other thing we added in paragraph 4 was the   comment about market liquidity measures  I think that’s useful  It shows that we’re doing other   things  It creates a sense that there’s more going on besides monetary policy  But again, if people   have strong objections, I have no strong feelings about that  In addition, my recommendation would   include maintaining the discount rate difference of ¼ percentage point that we established on   Sunday  So that’s where I would be  Why don’t we now have a rapid go-round?  President Hoenig    Certainly  President Rosengren    President Lacker    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Evans   March 18, 2008 93 of 127     Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Fisher    Always a pleasure  [Laughter]  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  First Vice President Sapenaro    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner   March 18, 2008 102 of 127     Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman   March 18, 2008 106 of 127     What chart is that?    President Fisher, I think I agree on the last sentence  I   would like to keep it something that we have used frequently before and that emphasizes, in fact,   the symmetry of the dual mandate  Are there other thoughts on either the indicators of inflation   expectations or the list of reasons that anyone would prefer to change from where we are?      All right  President Evans    Brian, do you have a thought on “risen” versus “risen   somewhat” versus taking it out?    Anyone else?  Bill    Right    All right  President Hoenig?    Okay  Having thought about this, I think that “some   indicators” does tone it down a bit  Perhaps we could just leave it where it is?  Who knows what   reaction this will get  Again, there is some sense here of trying to ratchet up at least our verbal   attention to inflation  Let me say to everyone that I went through each of these alternatives and   tried to find one that didn’t make me intensely uncomfortable—and I am still going through   them  These are very, very difficult decisions  We are all people working in good faith, and we   are all doing the best we can  I appreciate the candor and the honest comments, and we will   continue to work together and to address these very, very difficult issues that we have  If you are   ready, then perhaps we could take a vote    Thank you  We are going to recess for the discount rate    Unless there are objections, we are going to maintain the ¼ percentage point difference   [Recess]   March 18, 2008 112 of 127     Okay  The next meeting is April 29 and 30, Tuesday and   Wednesday, a two-day meeting  We will talk about interest on reserves  And we will meet you   shortly upstairs for a lunch in honor of Bill Poole  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING         March 18, 2008 113 of 127     "
8423,2008-04-29,BERNANKE,"  Let’s formally begin the meeting  Let me start by   welcoming our new colleague, Jim Bullard from St Louis, over there in the heartland section of   the table  [Laughter]  We welcome you, and we look forward to your contribution and to   working with you   I want just to note that there has been some interest in doing more work collectively—  Board members and Presidents—on various issues relating to bank supervision and regulation    We have some work streams planned, Governor Kohn will talk about this a bit tomorrow during   our lunch, and we will discuss some of those things  Let me now turn to Bill Dudley to discuss   Desk operations  Bill, if you would, also talk about some of the proposals for expanding   liquidity support  Thank you    Thank you  Let’s have questions for Bill on financial   markets, and then we will come back to a full discussion of the proposed actions  Questions for   Bill?  No questions?  That is unusual  Yes, President Lacker    Other questions?  If not, let me just say a word or two about   the proposed liquidity measures  First, as Bill noted, the interbank and short-term funding   markets remain under some stress  In particular, as you know from the picture, the spreads in the   dollar interbank market have gone above the UK and ECB markets  Although it is certainly   April 29–30, 2008 9 of 266    difficult to identify precisely the size and the significance of the effect of our liquidity facilities,   not just the banks and the market participants have been in favor of them  We have received   very good reviews from international agencies such as the IMF, the OECD, and others, and I do   think that it is worth continuing these efforts to try to strengthen liquidity availability   Therefore, with respect to interbank markets, first, as mentioned, I propose to use my   delegated authority to increase the size of the term auction facility  Second, I would like to ask   the FOMC to approve increases in our swap lines and an extension of the duration of the swap   lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank  As now, they would be   auctioning money at the same time that we do in our TAF  The swaps with Canada and Mexico   are routine  We have done these for a number of years  As I promised you at an earlier meeting,   I checked with the Treasury, and they are all in favor of maintaining these facilities  I think it   would be rather odd to end them at this particular juncture, so I ask for renewal of those swap   lines as well   On the TSLF, the auctions that we have had have been undersubscribed, which may be   good news  On the other hand, it may have something to do with narrowness of the collateral   that is accepted  The TSLF is intended to help the functioning of the Treasury market because it   puts more Treasuries into circulation  We do have some evidence that Treasuries are trading at   lower spreads and with less volatility since we began these activities  In addition, there is some   support for the collateral that is taken and general liquidity support for the market, although,   again, it is really both sides of this equation that we are looking at  The current collateral that is   accepted at the TSLF is basically RMBS and CMBS  The proposal is to increase the range of   collateral to include AAA asset-backed securities, which include credit cards, auto loans, and   student loans—basically mostly consumer-oriented credit  I think it makes a lot of sense in the   April 29–30, 2008 10 of 266    context of what we have been doing  It would make the range of collateral more similar to that   in our other facilities  It also would reduce the credit allocation aspects by broadening the range   of collateral that we accept  On the other hand, as Bill mentioned, unless the situation becomes   radically different, we probably don’t want to extend beyond this because of difficulties in   assessing the credit quality of other assets   I put this item on the meeting agenda for your discussion because there are some political   and public relations complications, and I wanted just to be up front and let you know what they   are and get your response and your views  As you know, the student loan market has been   dysfunctional, and we have received requests—perhaps you have as well—to do “something”   about this problem  We received letters, probably about a month ago, from some House   members, including Congressman Kanjorski, who asked us to extend our lending authority   beyond the current institutions to others  I assume Sallie Mae, for example, would have been a   possibility  We wrote back a very clear letter saying that we could not do that; that our 13(3)   authority was reserved for unusual and exigent circumstances, which we interpreted as being   systemically relevant circumstances; that the bar was very high for the use of that authority; and   that, although we certainly want to strengthen the liquidity in the general markets, we didn’t see   this as being a possibility   We received a second set of letters a couple of weeks ago, really one letter signed by a   number of senators, mostly from the Senate Banking Committee, asking specifically that we   expand the collateral in the TSLF to include student loans  Now we have the problem that this   would do that, along with other much more significant, in terms of size, consumer loans  We   wrote back to Senator Dodd and his colleagues last week and told them that, although we of   course are always looking to improve the liquidity of markets and, in particular, we think student   April 29–30, 2008 11 of 266    loans are a very worthy type of credit, we didn’t see the argument  First, student loans are   already accepted as collateral in our other three facilities—the TAF, the window, and the PDCF    Second, we argued that the real problem with the student loan situation is on the legislative side    In particular, recent legislative changes have reduced the spreads that private-sector lenders can   get from student loans  Given the increase in funding costs, they have become unprofitable, and   so many lenders have withdrawn from that market  So we didn’t give any encouragement in that   letter   That being said, if we take this action—which was suggested by the staff and which is, I   believe, fully justified on its own merits—it would be part of a broader package, and I think we   would get two different reactions  On the one hand, we would get, I would call it for short, a   Wall Street Journal editorial that the Federal Reserve is once again the craven cur and the   spineless—boy, I am getting good at this—[laughter] lackey of the Congress by accommodating   this request  I take that seriously  I’m sure we all take seriously even the perception that we are   catering to this request  On the other side, I suppose that there would be what I could call the   USA Today editorial, which is, “Why won’t the Fed, which is bailing out Wall Street left and   right, include asset-backed paper in their facilities, even though it is consistent with all of their   other practices and they take it in all of their other facilities?” and so on  So I think there are PR   and political risks on both sides of this  I am not going to try to downplay those, but I do think   that on the substance this is a good move, and I will just put this on the table for your questions   or comments  If a significant number of members of the Committee are uncomfortable with   proceeding—and what we would do if we proceed is to put this all together in a package to be   announced with the Europeans and the Swiss on Friday morning—then I would certainly be   willing to table this last item  So let me open the floor for any comments  President Lacker   April 29–30, 2008 12 of 266     President Hoenig    Vice Chairman    President Rosengren    President Lacker, a two-handed comment?    I may have misspoken, but I think I had in mind both sides   of the equation  The Treasuries have certainly responded  It’s harder to judge on the asset side,   but I guess that the premise is the same—that all of these markets are suffering from withdrawal   of the normal liquidity provision of money market mutual funds and other, less sophisticated   investors  Banks and others are finding it hard to finance those assets, and that’s the liquidity   backstop that we provide  So I think on both sides    Yes    Well, we have seen the breakdown of a particular structure   of lending that was based on the credit ratings  The credit ratings have proven to be false    Therefore, there is an informational deficit—an asymmetric information problem, would be my   interpretation—which has, in turn, triggered a massive change in preferences  But I don’t think   we are going to settle this at the table here  President Evans    The TSLF and the PDCF are emergency measures, and   barring congressional action, we cannot maintain them  Presumably, they will be phased out as   markets improve  If we are doing these things, I don’t see the argument for one set of collateral   versus another  President Fisher     Yes    President Fisher, the timing is dictated by the preference of   the Europeans not to be tied into our monetary policy decision and the fact that Thursday is a   European holiday  The problem you were alluding to earlier had to do with the very strong   market expectation that we were going to act on liquidity measures  We disappointed both on   that and on the rate  That was why we got the strong reaction, and there’s no such expectation to   my knowledge here  At the same time, our press release, which we have already looked at in   draft, and market expectations are very focused on the LIBOR issue and the interbank issue    Given that we have done so many steps in this direction, I don’t think that this would be   misinterpreted as anything particularly overdramatic    The problem is that European banks are structurally   deficient in dollars and they have a time zone shift  It is a dollar market    Governor Kohn     Okay  President Bullard    To repeat what Bill said, I think it is hard to measure the   quantitative impact, but my guess is that there is some  But the point is well taken  What I   would like to do is go through the first votes, and then we will take a straw vote on the TSLF,   and then decide what to do  Okay?  First, we have to ratify domestic open market operations      No objection?  Okay  Now the swap agreements with   Canada and Mexico    Is there anyone who wants a roll call on this?  Okay  If not,   then no objection  Extend and expand the swap agreement with the ECB    Is there anyone who wants a roll call on this?  Okay  Then,   without objection  Expand and extend the swap agreement with the Swiss National Bank    Without objection  Okay  Now, on the TSLF, the proposal   is to include this as part of the package  There will be no change to the facility except for the   increase in the collateral range, to include AAA asset-backed securities  Are there any further   comments on this?  I am going to ask for a straw vote, just to get a sense  Abstentions are fine    If there are no further comments, how many people are in favor of this?  I see 10, I think    April 29–30, 2008 22 of 266     I’m sorry?    I would like to get a sense of all participants, if that is okay    Thirteen participants are in favor  All right  All participants against?  Okay  Let’s go ahead and   take a vote on this, then  Is there anyone who wants a roll call vote?  If not, then no objection    No objection  Thank you  Let’s turn now to the economic   situation  Dave Stockton    Thank you very much  Are there questions for our   colleagues?

[Laughter]   April 29–30, 2008 86 of 266     Thank you, and thank you all for very helpful comments    As usual, let me briefly summarize what I heard today and then make a few comments of my   own  Again, in summary, data since the March meeting have been soft, and economic activity is   weak  But the recent news has not generally been worse than expected  There was disagreement   over whether we are technically in a recession  Most saw improved economic growth in the   second half of 2008 with further improvement in 2009, although some saw more-protracted   weakness  The housing sector remains weak, though there were reports of improvement  Starts   and the demand for new houses continue to decline  Prices are falling  Inventories of unsold   homes remain very high  Housing demand is affected by restrictive conditions in mortgage   April 29–30, 2008 87 of 266    markets, fears that house prices have much further to fall, and weakening economic conditions    Retail sales, sentiment, and consumer spending have generally been soft, reflecting a long list of   headwinds, including tightening credit, weaker house prices, and higher energy prices  Payrolls   are falling, although there are some pockets of strength  Unemployment is likely to keep rising    It may remain somewhat high into 2010  We will soon see whether the fiscal stimulus package   affects either the consumer or business investment plans  Possibly, liquidity-constrained   consumers may respond more strongly than normally  Business sentiment is also relatively   weak, reflecting in part credit conditions but also the uncertain prospects for the economy and   continued cost pressures  Investment has softened somewhat, including declines in commercial   real estate investment  Strength in foreign markets is helping support US production and   profits, especially manufacturing, although foreign economies may slow in the coming quarters    The energy and agricultural sectors are strong   Financial conditions have improved in the past month, with financing conditions better,   credit risk spreads coming in a bit, and both equities and real interest rates up since the last   meeting  Decent earnings, a sense on the part of some that the bulk of the write-downs in the   banking sector have been taken, the ability of financial institutions to raise capital, and possibly   Fed actions, including liquidity provision and the actions regarding Bear Stearns, have   contributed to the improvement  On the other hand, many markets remain fragile, including the   key interbank market and other short-term funding markets  Some expressed the view that more-  significant write-downs and financial stress lie ahead, as house prices continue to fall and the   slowing economy weakens credit quality, and that the full impact of tighter credit has not yet   been felt in the nonfinancial economy  Others, however, were less concerned about the real   April 29–30, 2008 88 of 266    effects of the financial conditions  Financial conditions and the housing market probably   remained the most important downside risks to growth, although energy prices were also cited     Readings on core inflation were moderate in the intermeeting period, although some of   the reasons for improvement may be transitory  Oil prices have continued to move up,   contributing to higher headline inflation  Other commodity prices have also begun to rise again    Many firms noted these strong cost pressures and indicated some ability to pass those costs along   to consumers  Inflation breakevens showed improvement at some horizons since the March   meeting, possibly reflecting lower risk premiums, though survey inflation expectations were   higher  The dollar appreciated during the intermeeting period, but longer-term depreciation and   rising import prices remain another source of pressure on inflation  Nominal wage gains remain   moderate, however, and markups are high  Uncertainty about the course of oil and other   commodity prices adds to overall inflation uncertainty and perhaps to inflation risks that are now   somewhat more to the upside  Many participants expressed concerns about these upside risks,   about inflation expectations, and about the maintenance of the Fed’s inflation-fighting   credibility  Any comments?     Let me just add a few thoughts to what has already been said  On the real side, I think   that I am probably somewhat more pessimistic than the median view that I heard around the   table  First of all, I am reasonably confident that we are in a recession  We don’t see these   dynamic patterns of employment, sentiment, and so on without a recession being eventually   called by the NBER  That fact, I believe, raises the risks of more-rapid declines in employment   and consumer spending in the months ahead because there seem to be somewhat more-adverse   dynamics in a recession scenario  Second, I remain concerned about housing, which is not   showing really any significant signs of stabilization  Mortgage markets are still dysfunctional,   April 29–30, 2008 89 of 266    and the only source of mortgage credit essentially is the GSEs, which are doing their best to raise   fees and profit from the situation  Sales of new homes remain weak  Inventories of unsold   homes are down in absolute terms, but they still are very high relative to sales  We heard this   morning of yet even faster price declines for housing  As I’ve said several times at this table,   until there is some sense of a bottoming in the housing market and in housing prices, I think that   we are not going to see really broad stabilization, either in the economy or in financial markets    Now, there are some positives—exports, for example—which have kept manufacturing and other   industries from declining as much as usual during a recession  Interestingly, this could be a   mirror image of the 2001 recession  In 2001, the business sector was weak, and consumption   and housing were strong  We could have the mirror image this time   In financial markets, there certainly have been improvements, and that is certainly   encouraging  I agree with people about that  But we have heard a few people in the market say   that credit losses and write-downs are in the ninth inning  As a baseball fan, I think we are   probably closer to the third inning  Let me explain why I think that  The IMF recently projected   aggregate credit losses on US-based assets of about $945 billion worldwide, with about a   quarter of those coming in the US banks and thrifts  The Board staff has a somewhat lower   number, around $700 billion to $800 billion, but they have a higher fraction in US banks and   thrifts  So the basic numbers are pretty similar in that respect  The staff projection for credit   losses for US commercial banks and thrifts, excluding investment banks, is about $215 billion   for this year and next year and $300 billion if the recession is more severe  In addition, the staff   projects about $60 billion in write-downs of CDOs and other types of traded assets  Now, most   of those $60 billion write-downs have been taken  They are mostly held by the top banks, and   they have mostly been already written off  However, of the $215 billion to $300 billion in   April 29–30, 2008 90 of 266    projected credit losses, so far US banks and thrifts have acknowledged only about $60 billion    So if you put together those numbers, you find that we are about one-third of the way through   total losses   Now, there are, in fact, obviously some countervailing factors  Banks and thrifts have   already raised about $115 billion in capital since the middle of last year, which essentially covers   the losses announced so far  But that said, there is still a lot of deleveraging to go  There is   going to be a long process of selling assets, reducing extensions of credit, and building capital   ratios  This may not yet be fully felt in the real economy, but it will eventually be there  So I do   think that we are going to see continued pressure from financial markets and credit markets, even   if we don’t have any serious relapses into financial stress  So, again, I am somewhat more   skeptical about a near-term improvement in economic growth, although I do acknowledge that   the fiscal package and other factors that the Greenbook mentions will be helpful   The question has been raised about whether monetary policy is helpful and what the   stance of monetary policy is  I agree with the comment that the real federal funds rate is not   necessarily the best measure of the stance of monetary policy right now  Let me take an example   that was given in the New York Fed’s daily financial report a couple of days ago, which was   about the all-in cost of asset-backed securities backed by auto loans  According to this report, in   February of ’07, the three-year swap rate was about 5 percent, and the spread on AAA tranches   of auto-backed ABS was about 10 basis points  The all-in cost was 507 percent for this   particular asset  In February of ’08, the three-year swap rate was 315 percent, almost 2   percentage points lower, but the spread on AAA tranches was 195 basis points  Therefore, the   overall all-in cost of auto loan ABS was 536 percent  So the net effect is—well, is monetary   policy doing anything?  Absolutely  We have reduced the safe rate  We have brought down the   April 29–30, 2008 91 of 266    cost of funds  But the spreads have obviously offset that  So what we have really done is   essentially offset the effects of the credit crisis  Obviously, if we had not responded to the   situation, those costs would be much higher, and the extent of restriction would be a lot greater    For these reasons, I really do believe that we need to take a much more sophisticated look at   what the appropriate interest rate is  The Taylor rules, in particular, are just not appropriate for   the current situation because the equilibrium real interest rate of 2 percent that is built into them   is not necessarily appropriate   Let me turn to inflation, which a lot of people talked about today  First, let me just say   that I certainly have significant concerns on the nominal side  In particular, I have a lot of   anxiety about the dollar  Foreign exchange rates in general are not well tied down, and they are   very subject to sentiment and swings in views  Therefore, although I think that the depreciation   of the dollar so far is a mixed bag—obviously, it has effects on different parts of the economy—I   do think that there is a risk of a sharper fall with possibly adverse implications, in the short run,   for US assets and, in the long run, perhaps implications for our position as a reserve currency   and so on  So I think that is an issue to be concerned about  For that reason and for other   reasons as well, I am very sympathetic to the view I hear around the table that we are now very,   very close to where we ought to be, that it is time to take a rest, to see the effects of our work,   and to pay equal attention to the nominal side of our mandate  I agree with all of that  So I am   hopeful that in our policy discussion tomorrow we will be fairly close around the table   That being said, I do want to take a little exception to some of the discussion about   inflation  There is an obvious and very elementary distinction between relative price changes   and overall inflation  Let me ask you to do the following thought experiment  Imagine you are   speaking to your board  Last year, as a first approximation, headline inflation was 4 percent,   April 29–30, 2008 92 of 266    labor compensation grew at 4 percent, and oil prices rose 60 percent  Let’s imagine that we had   been so farsighted and so effective that we managed to keep headline inflation last year at   2 percent  The implications would have been, assuming that relative price changes were the   same, that wages would have grown at 2 percent and that oil prices would have risen at   57 percent  In the conversation with your board, your board would say, “This inflation is killing   us  These costs are killing us  We have to pass them through”  They would, and they would be   right  When there are big changes in relative prices, that is a real phenomenon, and it has to be   accommodated somehow by nominal price shifts  So to the extent that the changes in food and   oil prices reflect real supply-and-demand conditions, obviously they are very distressing and bad   for the economy and create a lot of pain, but they are not in themselves necessarily under the   control of monetary policy  If we give the impression that gasoline prices are the Fed’s   responsibility, we are looking for trouble because we cannot control gasoline prices  That said,   of course we need to address the overall inflation rate  We need to address inflation   expectations  All of that is very important  But, again, we need to make a distinction between   relative price changes and overall inflation   Now, a more sophisticated response to that is, “Well, maybe monetary policy is   contributing to these relative price changes as well”; and I think that is a very serious issue    Certainly the dollar has some effects on oil prices  But keep in mind that a lot of the depreciation   of the dollar is a decline in real exchange rates, which is essential in any case for balancing our   external accounts  So, yes, the depreciation of the dollar, through our policies, has contributed   somewhat to commodity prices  But compared with the overall shifts in relative prices that we   have seen, I think it is not that large  There are other hypotheses suggesting that we have been   stimulating speculation in a bubble, suggesting that low real interest rates contribute to   April 29–30, 2008 93 of 266    commodity price booms  I don’t want to take more time, but the evidence for those things is   very limited  In particular, the fact that we have not seen any buildups in hoarding or inventories   is a very strong argument against the idea that inflation expectations, hoarding, or speculation is   a major factor in energy price increases  So, yes, the nominal side is very important  We need to   address that  I agree with that  But we should try to help our audiences understand the very   important distinction between real and nominal changes   I think I will stop there  If I can ask for your patience, we could do the briefing on the   alternatives today and give ourselves more time tomorrow  Around the table, does that seem   okay?  I’ll call on Bill English    We’ll have a special session on MZM  [Laughter]    Thank you  Are there questions for Bill?      President Fisher    Bill Dudley    President Evans     Dave, did you want to respond?    Governor Mishkin first, and then President Bullard    Governor Mishkin    Other questions for Bill?  All right  Well, we have   overnight to reflect  We will also have the GDP data in the morning  I’m sure that they will be   informative  We will reconvene tomorrow at 900 am  There is a dinner and reception, for   those of you who would like to attend, and we’ll see you there   [Meeting recessed]   April 29–30, 2008 104 of 266    April 30, 2008—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody  Why don’t we start with the   report from Dave Stockton on the data    Any questions for Dave?  All right  If not, yesterday we   had an introductory presentation by Bill English on the alternatives  You will be pleased to   know that there have been no further changes in the proposed statements  So why don’t we take   comments now from the participants  President Plosser    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Fisher      Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Vice Chairman      And a wheezing canary  [Laughter]     April 29–30, 2008 133 of 266     Thank you all  The discussion was very good as usual, and let   me just assure you that I listened very, very carefully  So I’m certainly hearing what you’re saying,   and I understand the concerns that people have expressed  I play Jekyll and Hyde quite a bit and   argue with myself in the shower and other places  [Laughter]  Let me first say that I think we ought   to at least modestly congratulate ourselves that we have made some progress  Our policy actions,   including both rate cuts and the liquidity measures, have seemed to have had some benefit  I think   the fear has moderated  The markets have improved somewhat  As I said yesterday, I am cautious   about this  There’s a good chance that we will see further problems and further relapses, but we   have made progress in reducing some of the uncertainties in the current environment     April 29–30, 2008 136 of 266    I also think that there’s a lot of agreement around the table—and I certainly agree—that we   have reached the point where further aggressive rate-cutting is not going to be productive and that   we should now be signaling a willingness to sit, watch, and listen for a time, for two reasons  First,   risks are now more balanced  That is, there is more attention to inflation risks and dollar risks, and   although our output risks remain quite significant, the balance is closer than it has been for some   time  Second, given that we have done a lot in a short time and moved aggressively and that we’re   seeing fiscal actions coming in and perhaps other policy effects as well—lagged effects of our own   actions— it seems to be a reasonable time for us to pause, to watch carefully, and to presume that   we’re not going to move unless conditions strongly warrant it  So I think that, at least in that broad   respect, there’s a lot of agreement around the table   The two alternatives that have been discussed by most people are B, which is to move   25 basis points today but to send a fairly strong signal of a preference to pause after this meeting,   and C, which is not to move but to keep some elements of the downside risk alive in our risk   assessment  Like a number of people, I think both are plausible  Both have appeal  Alternative C,   in particular, has the appeal of pushing back against some critics on the inflation side who have   criticized us for not being sufficiently attentive to the dollar, to commodity prices, and so on  As I   said yesterday, I think that inflation is an important problem  It’s a tremendous complication, given   what is happening now in the other parts of the economy  In no way do I disagree with the points   made by many participants that inflation is a critical issue for us and that we have to pay very close   attention to it  As I said yesterday, I do think that some of the criticism that we are getting is just   simply misinformed  I don’t think there’s any plausible interest rate policy that we can follow that   would eliminate the bulk of the changes in commodity prices that we’re seeing  I think they are due   mostly to global supply-and-demand conditions  A small piece of evidence for that is that yesterday   April 29–30, 2008 137 of 266    the ECB was mentioned favorably as having the appropriate inflation attitudes compared with our   attitudes  I would just note that headline inflation in the euro zone is about the same as it is here,   despite their stronger currency, because they are being driven by the same global commodity prices   that we are   I would also say that, although the inflation situation is a very important concern, I don’t see   any particular deterioration in the near term  Since the last meeting, oil prices have gone up, which   is very high profile, but gold, for example, has dropped about 12 or 13 percent  Other precious   metals are down  Some other commodities are down  The dollar is stronger  TIPS breakevens   have moved in the right direction  Wages, as we saw this morning, are stable, and I would urge you   to compare wage behavior over the past five years with wage behavior during the 1970s  Wage   growth then was not only high but also very unstable and responsive to short-term movements in   headline inflation  So I think the canary is still getting decent breath here  [Laughter]  I want us to   be careful not to overpromise  We cannot do anything about the relative price of gasoline, and I   don’t think that we’re on the edge of an abyss of the 1970s type  I do think it’s an important issue,   and I do think that there is benefit to pushing against the perceptions  In this business, perceptions   have an element of reality to them, and we understand that  That’s an important part of central   banking, and I fully appreciate that point  So again, I see a lot of merit in the alternative C   approach    As I think you can conjecture, I’m going to recommend alternative B—25 basis points but   with a stronger indication of a pause  Let me discuss why in the end I come down on that side    First is the substance, the fundamentals  I don’t think that 25 basis points is irrelevant  For   example, one-month LIBOR is up about 35 basis points since our last meeting  These short-run   financing costs do matter, particularly in a situation of financial fragility  So it is not just an issue,   April 29–30, 2008 138 of 266    as President Evans mentioned, of long-term interest rate expectations  Overnight and short-term   financing costs do matter for the financial markets, and a lower rate will help the markets to heal   It   will affect other rates  To take an obvious example, it affects the adjustable rate that mortgages   move to in the economy  So I think there’s a case to be made on the substance  I will not add much   to the discussion about how we define “accommodative”  But one way to do it, I guess, is to look at   the Greenbook’s very thorough analysis, which rather than using rules of thumb attempts to look at   a broad forecast conditional on what the staff can ascertain about the financial drags that we’re   seeing  Their analysis suggests that something around where we are or a little lower is consistent   with slow economic growth but also price stability within a relatively short time  That is one way of   trying to calibrate  Obviously, there are other ways as well   The second point I’d make, besides just the substance, is the consistency with our own   projections  Virtually everybody around the table still thinks that the downside risks to growth are   significant, and we’ve mentioned the same factors—financial conditions, housing, and a few other   things  Those remain very serious downside risks  I don’t think anybody thinks they are under   control at this point  Yes, we also see an increased number of people with upside risks to inflation    But again, in terms of the numbers we’ll publish, I think the downside risks are still held by more   people than the inflation assessment  That, by the way, suggests why we can’t really do what   President Plosser suggests—hold and move to the alternative B, paragraph 4, language  Not to   move and to say that the risks are balanced would, I think, be clearly inconsistent with the risk   assessments that are in the projections   The other issues have to do with communications  We are at an important transition point in   our communication strategy  One of the risks that we took when we made the very rapid cuts in   interest rates earlier this year was the problem of coming to this exact point, when we would have to   April 29–30, 2008 139 of 266    communicate to the markets that we were done, that we were going to flatten out, and that we were   going to a mode of waiting  It was always difficult to figure out how that was going to work in a   smooth way  Whether through luck or design, market expectations have set up perfectly  I mean,   basically they’re now assuming a flat path going forward, with some increase later; and that appears   to be consistent, as Vice Chairman Geithner noted, in the last few days with significant dollar   appreciation, declines in commodity prices, and declines in inflation expectations—all the things   that we want to see  It appears that we’re in a position that had seemed really problematic some   time ago, so we are now able to make the transition in a way that will be relatively clear and, I hope,   not too disruptive   Now, I want to come back to the issue of disappointing markets  I agree with President   Fisher and many others that disappointing markets can be a good thing  It is certainly not always a   bad thing, by any means  I think the issue is a little more subtle than that  The issue here is the   clarity of what we’re trying to say and the way our message is going to be read  Let me make two   points about that  If we were to do alternative C, I think there would be essentially two issues  One   is that, although we would not be moving, which would be a surprise, we would also not be   declaring a pause because of downside risk, which would be another surprise  We’d have a surprise   both in the action and in the statement  The risk there is that we confuse the markets about what our   intentions are and what would cause us to respond  For example, the Greenbook’s projections of   Friday’s employment numbers are somewhat more pessimistic than those being held in the market    If we took action C today and Friday’s numbers were consistent with the Greenbook forecast and   with our own projections but worse, significantly worse, than the market expectation, would   statement C then lead to the building in of additional ease?  I think there would be a lot of confusion   April 29–30, 2008 140 of 266    there—a lot of uncertainty about what exactly we are saying about when we’d be willing to   respond   The other communication issue that I have with alternative C—and this, again, is something   President Fisher said yesterday—is that if we don’t move and we put C out there, the stock market   could go up because it might be read as saying that the Fed has increased confidence, is seeing   things looking better, and is feeling stronger about the economy  I’m not sure that really is the   assessment we have, and if we then have bad data on the labor markets and the financial markets   weaken somewhat, will we be seen as having made a wrong call, as being blindsided by   circumstances?  This is more discussion than it’s worth, but what I’m trying to convey is that it’s   not just a question of disappointing or not disappointing markets  It’s a question of whether or not   we’re sending a clear message  I think alternative B, while it’s consistent with our risk assessments,   is also a pretty strong statement  Let me, just for what it is worth, assure you now that data that   come in within the general, broad ranges of what we’re expecting, even though they will be weak,   should not cause us to ease further, given this statement  I believe that this statement will provide us   with plenty of cover  No matter what the markets expect, we have said that we have come to a point   at which we need to take a pause, we need to see what’s happening, and we are going to be watchful   and waiting   With respect to the language, I just want to point out how much the language in   alternative B has moved from March  It really is a very significant change  First of all, we are   acknowledging explicitly how much we have already done—the substantial easing of monetary   policy to date plus the measures to foster market liquidity—and expressing a general confidence   implicit in that first sentence that we have done a lot; that it is likely to help; and therefore, that we   should wait and see what happens  Second, we removed any reference to downside risk to growth,   April 29–30, 2008 141 of 266    which has been in there for a long time  That’s a very strong statement  That says a lot about our   inclinations going further  Third, we’ve added the phrase “continue to monitor,” which to me   suggests very much a watchful waiting rather than an active approach to developments in the   economy  Finally, we have made it clear that we are going to be data dependent and, in particular,   though we have done a lot, we are expecting continued weakness, and we’ll act as needed  But we   have taken out the “timely manner,” so the presumption that we’ll be responding in a very rapid and   aggressive way, I think, has been moderated     I think of alternative B as being a compromise in the sense that it takes a step that is   consistent with the fundamentals in terms of the underlying tightness of the financial system and the   risks that most of us see to economic growth as well as inflation  At the same time, I think it is a   rather strong step in expressing a shift in our strategy—that we are moving from the phase of rapid   declines and aggressiveness to a phase of waiting and observing how this economy is going to   evolve  Again, with full respect to everyone’s comments, I understand  Unlike Governor Mishkin,   I wasn’t sitting on the fence; I thought that was a little uncomfortable  But I understand the   concerns and the arguments  The communication issues did concern me, and largely on that basis, I   would advocate B today  Are there any comments?  If not, could you please take a roll call?    Thank you  I will ask the Governors to join me in the office   for the discount rate decision  Everyone else, why don’t you take a 20-minute coffee break   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we recommence  The meeting that we are   about to begin is a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board, so I need a motion to close the   meeting      Without objection  The discussion is about interest on   reserves  Let me turn to Brian    Well, let me first congratulate and compliment the staff for a   really thorough piece of work, both the presenters and all the other people whom Brian mentioned    It is excellent work, particularly under very trying circumstances  I mentioned that in February a   workshop was held here at the Board on monetary policy implementation, which brought together   April 29–30, 2008 157 of 266    people from major central banks around the world  So there has been a very, very serious attempt to   evaluate others’ experience  Thank you very much for all of that  Why don’t we take some   questions first, if there are any  Then anyone who would like to make comments can do so  Any   questions?  President Hoenig, do you have a question, sir?    Governor Mishkin    President Yellen    President Lacker    Thank you  Just a procedural question  You kind of segued   into the positions  Does anyone have a short question of fact?  Governor Kohn    Vice Chairman    Let me interject  If there’s a sense of the Committee that this   is something we should escalate, let’s move it up the ladder and do that  But anyone who wants to   comment on that during the go-around, please feel free  There was a second part about the United   Kingdom, I believe   April 29–30, 2008 168 of 266     Other short questions?  President Fisher    President Stern    There is an effect on swaps, like foreign exchange swaps,   right?    President Evans had a two-hander    Governor Warsh    Governor Kroszner, do you have a question?    President Plosser, did you have a question?    Okay  Did you have a question?    Okay  Let’s take positions and comments, keeping in mind   that lunch is being held hostage  [Laughter]  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Evans    President Stern    President Yellen    Thank you  President Bullard    On the public finance question, of course, the Congress has   acted and they score it to cost  So in some sense that is moot from our perspective  President   Pianalto    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Fisher    We don’t want it  [Laughter]  Governor Kohn    Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner   April 29–30, 2008 186 of 266     Governor Mishkin    Vice Chairman  Oh, sorry  President Lacker    Vice Chairman    Thank you  On those broader questions, Vice Chairman,   we are going to talk at lunch about some initiatives by which we will address some of the   broader regulatory and bank supervision issues  That process will be parallel to this  What I   would say about this issue is that, as you go forward, you should keep in mind the possibility we   might want to go to the Congress for some kind of interim power  Obviously, there are things   that we can do that are not the full panoply of things you described today  They would be   interim steps, and I think that the most important thing is to make sure that whatever we ask for   would not be inconsistent with or contradictory to some of the longer-term plans  We obviously   don’t anticipate implementing option 5 next year, but we could take some interim steps that   potentially might be useful in the current circumstances   Very briefly, I agree with President Fisher and President Lacker  This is a once-in-a-  generation chance to modernize our system  It is a relic that we use a quantity-based   April 29–30, 2008 190 of 266    management of the federal funds rate  So I think option 1 should be a fallback if we can’t make   something else work, but we should try very hard to see if we can find a system that will let us   manage the funds rate tightly, even as our balance sheet expands and contracts, and so on  I have   the same concerns about option 3, that it might not tie down the fed funds rate very much    Options 2 and 5 are interesting  I agree with President Lacker that option 4 is worth exploring  I   broached this with the staff before the meeting  Option 4 seems a lot like Friedman’s optimum   quantity of money  You just throw out money until the transaction cost on margin is zero    That’s basically what it is  I don’t, frankly, fully understand what the implications would be for   the federal funds market—whether the federal funds market is just a shoe-leather cost or whether   it actually has some useful functions, including price discovery, credit risk management, and   counterparty discipline  There may be some functions of that market that are important, and   even if it still existed, if its liquidity were greatly reduced so that it wasn’t functioning in a   normal way, it could be a question  To my mind, that is the main question we have to understand   as we think about option 4  Once again, terrific work, and this is really exciting, interesting stuff    So thank you all very much  Are there any other comments on interest on reserves?     Okay  If not, let’s see  First, again, the projections are due Thursday at 500 pm  If   anyone has changes, please make the effort to do that  We will be circulating information on the   2009 FOMC schedule to try to come to closure on that  The next meeting is Tuesday and   Wednesday, June 24 and 25  In a moment, we will adjourn and get lunch, but please come back   to the table so that we can have some discussion about some of our longer-term issues on   supervision and regulation  Thank you very much  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   April 29–30, 2008 191 of 266     "
8451,2008-06-24,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  Why don’t we begin, as usual,   with the Desk report and Bill Dudley  Bill    Thank you, Bill  The quarter-end premium seems less this   time, but am I correct that the dollar premium is higher than the euro and pound premiums?    Is there anything to be inferred from that?    Other questions for Bill?  President Lacker    President Fisher    Other questions?  President Plosser    President Stern    Other questions?  If not, would someone move the   ratification    Without objection  Thank you  Okay  Let’s turn now to   the economic situation  Nathan, I’ll start with you     Thank you, Brian  Are there questions for our colleagues?    President Fisher    President Evans    President Fisher    Other questions?  President Bullard    President Lacker    Thank you  Any other questions?  Okay  We are about   ready for our go-round  Let me remind you about the proposal to add a long-term line to our   June 24–25, 2008 31 of 253    projections  The rationale for doing so is that the current system doesn’t necessarily let the   public know what our views on the steady state of the economy are  To show my own hand, I   think it would be helpful to add maybe one line that said in five to seven years out what we think   the economy would do  But I think it is important for those of us who want to express an   opinion to do so  If there is interest, as Brian mentioned, we can do a trial run in October, and   we won’t have to make a final decision about whether to go forward until October or December   or perhaps later depending on how things go  But if you have a view on that, please add that to   your commentary  So let’s begin with the economic go-round, and we’ll start with President   Hoenig    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lockhart    June 24–25, 2008 44 of 253     Thank you  President Rosengren      Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lacker     Thank you  Why don’t we take a break until 445 and have   some coffee  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we reconvene  President Bullard, whenever you   are ready    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  Vice Chairman   June 24–25, 2008 69 of 253     Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you, and thank you all  First, on the long-term   projections, I think there’s consensus that we should just go ahead and have a trial run  The staff   should review the transcript and make gold out of straw there  We should consult with the   subcommittee, and we should think about maybe even a couple of alternatives  Maybe we could try   a couple of alternative ways of doing it in October  So let’s go ahead and do something along those   lines and keep thinking about how best to do it   Let me first, as I usually do, try to summarize the discussion around the table, and I’ll add   some comments of my own  Beginning with the summary, the incoming data were stronger than   expected, notably for consumer spending but for some other components as well  As a result,   economic growth in the second quarter, though not robust, was likely positive, continuing the   pattern of weak but positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2007  However, to the extent that   strength in consumption was transitory or due primarily to fiscal stimulus, some of the growth in the   June 24–25, 2008 91 of 253    second quarter may have been borrowed from the second half  Participants generally saw growth   continuing at a slow pace the rest of the year and improving in 2009  There was, however, some   divergence of views, with some expecting a longer period of slow growth   Recent numbers on retail sales suggest that the consumer is holding up better than expected    Consumer finances may be better than feared, and the fiscal stimulus may already be having an   effect  However, as many have noted, there are substantial drags on consumption going forward,   including falling wealth and income, credit constraints, and the recent rise in energy prices    Sentiment has also fallen noticeably further  Weaker consumption may, thus, restrain growth later   this year, particularly after the effect of the stimulus wanes  Labor markets continue to soften but at   a relatively moderate pace  The peak in unemployment is projected to be between 5½ percent and 6   percent  That’s what I generally heard around the table  Prospects for housing continue weak, with   falling prices, high inventories, and weak demand  Some saw a possible bottom forming but noted   that the recovery of this sector is still some way off  As has been the case for a while, businesses are   quite cautious, noting economic uncertainties and surging input costs, with one or two mentions of   tighter credit, although that was not a dominant theme today  Real exports continue to grow and are   partially offsetting weaker domestic demand, especially in the case of manufacturing    Financial conditions have been mixed since the last meeting, although the improvements   from March have largely been maintained and the risk of systemic crisis may have receded to some   degree  Funding markets are generally doing better  The concerns about credit losses have led the   stock prices of banks, including regional banks and investment banks, to fall sharply  Capital   raising continues, though at less favorable terms and with perhaps declining availability  As the   economy continues weak and housing contracts further, more credit losses for banks may well be in   store, adding to financial market stress and reducing the availability of new credit  Progress in the   June 24–25, 2008 92 of 253    financial markets is likely to be slow as the deleveraging process will take a while  Stock prices in   general are also lower  Financial conditions in the housing market remain important downside risks   to growth, with the spurt in oil prices adding to those risks  Uncertainties about the growth   prospects are great  However, tail risks may have moderated somewhat   Readings on core inflation have remained relatively moderate  However, the sharp rise in   oil prices and some other commodity prices, in part reflecting flooding in the Midwest, is likely to   lead to very high levels of headline inflation over the next few months  Gas and food prices have   become perhaps the most important economic issue for consumers, and firms are feeling ever-  increasing cost pressures  Moreover, inflation pressures are global  There are increasing reports of   firms being able to pass through these costs, which could lead to an increase in core inflation  On   the other hand, slack may restrain core inflation increases  Measures of longer-term inflation   expectations have been up a bit on net since April, depending to some extent on the measure   chosen  Nominal wage growth is still slowing  Participants debated how much comfort to take   from slow wage growth, some arguing that, by the time wages reflected higher inflation   expectations, it would be too late  Most saw inflation risks as now to the upside, with the primary   concern being the possibility that inflation expectations could rise further as headline inflation rises   and more costs are passed through  That’s my very, very quick summary  If anyone has any   comments, I’d be happy to hear them   If not, let me just say a couple of words on my own views here  This may come as a   surprise to some of you, but I am not a fine-tuner  I think that the objective of the Federal Reserve   ought to be to avoid a very bad outcome, and so my concerns are primarily with tail risks on both   sides of our mandate  I think that the evidence of the last month or so provides a bit of reassurance,   on both the real side and the financial side, that the tail risks on the growth side of the mandate have   June 24–25, 2008 93 of 253    moderated somewhat  That being said, I think they remain and are still significant  In particular, as   I mentioned in the summary, I am at this point still suspicious of the strength that we saw in the   second quarter  If we look at the fundamentals for consumption—including wealth, income,   employment, and energy prices—and look at the plunge in sentiment, which is at remarkably low   levels, I think there’s a very good chance that consumers will weaken going forward and bring the   rest of the economy along with them  In addition, of course, housing remains extremely uncertain    We are at best some distance from stabilization in that market  Even when residential construction   begins to stabilize, we’ll still see continuing declines in house prices, which will affect consumer   spending and, importantly, will affect financial markets as well as the value of mortgages   With respect to financial markets, I agree certainly that the crisis atmosphere that we saw in   March has receded markedly, but I do not yet rule out the possibility of a systemic event  We saw   in the intermeeting period that we have considerable concerns about Lehman Brothers, for example    We watched with some concern the consummation of the Bank of America–Countrywide merger    We worried about a bank in the Midwest  Other regional banks are under various kinds of stress    We’re seeing problems with the financial guarantors, with the mortgage insurers  So I think that   those kinds of risk are still there, and we need to be very careful in observing them  Moreover, even   if systemic risks have faded, we still have the eye-of-the-storm phenomenon—we may now be   between the period of the write-downs of the subprime loans and the period in which the credit loss   associated with the slowdown in the economy begins to hit in a big way and we see severe problems   at banks, particularly contractions in credit extension   So I’m not yet persuaded that the tail risks are gone  I think it would be very valuable to   have some more data, some more observations, to see how the financial markets and the economy   are proceeding  But I want to say that I do agree that the developments in financial markets and the   June 24–25, 2008 94 of 253    surprisingly strong data in the second quarter should lead us to feel somewhat better  I think we   should take a little credit for our various efforts to support both the financial system and the   economy   Now, what about tail risks on the other side—on inflation?  The increase in oil prices that   we’ve seen in the past six weeks is obviously very, very bad news  I think that the combination of   the commodity price increases and what we’re going to see as very ugly headline inflation numbers   is beginning to generate a tail risk on that side of the mandate as well, and I am becoming concerned   about that  Indeed, I think that it’s now appropriate that we begin, as some of us already have, to   move rhetorically toward acknowledging that risk and agreeing that it may be at the point where it   even exceeds the risk that we see on the growth side, although I think we’re very uncertain about   that   Now, the concern I have is the following, which is that there has been a lot of talk about   policy action  I don’t think that a 25 basis point or even a 50 basis point move, if it’s not viewed as   being the start of a continued increase, is going to do very much on the inflation side, frankly  We   had a good test of that over the intermeeting period  Partly because of our rhetoric and for other   reasons, the dollar strengthened  The two-year rate rose 50 or 60 basis points, and oil prices went   up $25  I do not think that with a small change in our stance we can do anything about commodity   prices, and frankly, it’s commodity prices that you’re hearing about from your Board members and   from people you talk to  It’s the real change in the relative price of those commodities that is   painful and the real change in the terms of trade coming through the dollar which is painful, and I   don’t think we can do very much about those in the short term  Our objective, of course, as   everyone has noted, is to prevent that from becoming a sustained and persistent source of inflation   June 24–25, 2008 95 of 253    So the problem then is that a small amount of movement will not solve the problem  A   small to moderate movement, however, might create some serious financial strains given the   fragility of the system  I think what we need to do is to decide when we reach that tipping point    There will be a tipping point at which we’re sufficiently confident that the system is stabilizing and   that we can begin to turn in a serious way to the inflation concern  A partial one step, unless it   signals a longer-term tightening program, could give us the worst of both worlds  We will just have   to make the judgment about when we have reached the point of having to switch from our previous   approach of supporting the economy and financial system to an approach that is aimed more at   containing inflation  It’s going to be a very difficult and delicate situation, but I want to express   again my agreement with those of you who are worried about inflation and my belief that the time   might be relatively soon  But it’s going to be a very, very delicate decision and one that we have to   make with great concern and consideration   A little anticlimactically, I would like to say just a couple of words about the 1970s because   they keep coming up and I do think that these comparisons are a bit misleading  First, in the current   episode, commodity prices—particularly oil prices—are basically most or almost all the inflation   that we’re seeing  That was not the case in the ’70s  In particular, inflation rose considerably before   the first oil price shock in 1973  PCE inflation was 5 percent in 1970, which prompted the wage–   price controls, of course, which is an episode we’re all familiar with; and in 1972, before the oil   shock, average hourly earnings were growing between 7 and 8 percent  There was already a serious   inflation problem before the oil price shocks came  Hence, credibility was already damaged at the   time of the oil price shocks  That is not the case here     Second, the movement in wages and core inflation following the oil price shocks in the   1970s was very striking  From the time of the oil price shock right before the second quarter of   June 24–25, 2008 96 of 253    1973 until the first quarter of 1975, total inflation rose a little over 5 percentage points, reflecting the   quadrupling of oil prices  During the same period, core inflation rose more than 6 percentage   points  In other words, core inflation responded almost one for one to total inflation  Moreover,   average hourly earnings rose more than 2 percentage points, and productivity and cost   compensation rose 3½ percentage points in that year and a half  So there was a very strong   sensitivity of expectations and pass-through to these commodity price shocks  Obviously, we’ve   been seeing oil price increases since 2003, and they have not yet shown anything like that effect on   core inflation or on wages     The final observation I’d make about the 1970s is that we shouldn’t forget that, even in that   very bad situation with very poorly anchored inflation expectations, the slowing of the economy did   do something to reduce inflation  In particular, core inflation fell 3½ percentage points during 1975   following the 1973–75 recession  So while we cannot do much about oil prices, I do think that there   is some hope that weakness in the economy is going to provide some restraint on core inflation,   which of course will generate a more stable total inflation rate if and when commodity prices   stabilize  So I’ve been very all over the map here  I apologize  I tried to organize my thoughts in   the meeting     My bottom line is that I think the tail risks on the growth and financial side have moderated    I do think, however, that they remain significant  We cannot ignore them  I’m also becoming   concerned about the inflation side, and I think our rhetoric, our statement, and our body language at   this point need to reflect that concern  We need to begin to prepare ourselves to respond through   policy to the inflation risk; but we need to pick our moment, and we cannot be halfhearted  When   the time comes, we need to make that decision and move that way because a halfhearted approach is   going to give us the worst of both worlds  It’s going to give us financial stress without any benefits   June 24–25, 2008 97 of 253    on inflation  So we have a very difficult problem here, and we are going to have to work together   cooperatively to achieve what we want to achieve   The last thing I’d like to say is on communications  Just talking about communications   following this meeting, I’d like to advise everyone, including myself, to lean, not to lurch  That is,   we are moving toward more concern about inflation, but we still have concerns about economic   growth and financial markets  We should show that shift in emphasis as we talk to the public, but   we should not give the impression that inflation is the entire story or that we have somehow decided   that growth and financial problems are behind us, because they are not  So if we can convey that in   a sufficiently subtle way, I think we will prepare the markets for the ultimate movements that we’re   going to have to make   Again, I very much appreciate your insights and your attention today  We have a dinner at   730, and for that reason I think we should probably bring this to a close  We’ll start tomorrow   morning with Brian’s presentation of the policy options  The statement is essentially the same as   the Bluebook’s  There won’t be any surprises there  So we’ll begin with that first thing in the   morning  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]   June 24–25, 2008 98 of 253    June 25, 2008—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody   PARTICIPANTS  Good morning    We have two major items this morning  We’ll first complete   the discussion of policy action and the statement; and in the second part of the meeting, we’ll   discuss supervision of investment banks and some related policy issues  Over lunch, if time   permits, we’d like to hear Laricke Blanchard talk about congressional developments, and we’ll have   a chance to ask questions there as well  So without further ado, let me turn to Brian to introduce the   policy discussion    Thank you  Are there questions for Brian?  President Lacker    Governor Mishkin    Any other questions?   June 24–25, 2008 103 of 253     Vice Chairman    If there are no further questions, why don’t we begin our go-  round?  President Evans    Thank you    Governor Kohn    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Governor Kohn    President Pianalto  Oh sorry, President Plosser    Thank you  I guess just to say it more simply, all the rates that   have determined behavior—for example, mortgage rates, auto rates, or corporate bond rates—are   higher than a year ago  Now, unless there has been a major change in long-term inflation   expectations, which the TIPS data don’t suggest, there don’t seem to be indications, as far as interest   rates that are relevant to people’s spending decisions, that there has been a significant reduction    Someone else had a comment  Governor Kroszner    President Lacker will back President Plosser up though    The magnitude is somewhat greater, though    President Pianalto, we apologize    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Stern    You have your Strunk and White style manual with you, I   can see  [Laughter]  Thank you, President Stern  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Warsh   June 24–25, 2008 125 of 253     Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you very much  In April, we signaled that,   following our aggressive rate actions and our other efforts to support financial markets, it was   going to be a time to pause and to assess the effects of our actions  That was not that long ago,   and I think it is appropriate to continue our watchful waiting for just a bit longer   I talked yesterday about the balance of tail risks as opposed to the balance of risks  I   think that, although the tail risks on the growth and financial side have moderated somewhat,   they are still quite substantial  I agree with the Vice Chairman on that point  They arise from   two separate but related sources  The first is that, notwithstanding the stronger-than-expected   performance in the second quarter, I think there is an excellent chance that we will still see a   recessionary dynamic with the associated strong movements in employment and production    Second—again as the Vice Chairman mentioned—I do not agree that systemic risk has gone   away  I think it is in abeyance  There is perhaps, if anything, excessive confidence in the ability   of the Fed to prevent a crisis situation from metastasizing  Even if we don’t have a failure of a   major firm, we still have the possibility of a significant adverse feedback loop as credit   conditions worsen and banks come under additional pressure  So if I could try to think about   this—I don’t want to say “mathematically”—a lot of our discussion has implicitly suggested that   June 24–25, 2008 133 of 253    there has been a linear model, which is that we are just trying to balance on the scales this risk   against that risk  Again, if you are worried about preventing bad outcomes, you have to worry   more about nonlinear or discontinuous changes  I think that, at this point, we still have   significant risk of a nonlinear, discontinuous change in the financial markets or in the real   economy   Tail risks have risen for inflation  There is no question about it  I take what has been   said around the table extremely seriously, and I am quite anxious about it, I have to concede  If I   were making a comparison of tail risks to tail risks, I still think that the inflation tail risks have   not yet reached the level of the concerns I have about the financial crisis  In particular, some   important indicators—such as wages, inflation expectations, and core inflation—have not yet   signaled a major shift  That being said, I do think we need to acknowledge the relative change in   those risks, and we need to begin to prepare the market for the normalization that is going to   have to come   Both President Fisher and President Stern talked about the rhetorical aspects of our policy   and the effects on policy expectations, and I think we are all in agreement that words mean   nothing unless they are eventually backed up by actions  On the other hand, actions may be   better if they are preceded by words, if you will  We do need to begin to prepare the markets and   to communicate clearly so that people will know what’s coming and that the system will be   better able to deal with that   If I thought for sure that we were going to begin renormalizing very soon, I would   propose doing it today  Why wait?  But I think enough uncertainty and enough risks are on both   sides that there is some benefit from waiting just a bit longer to see, first, how the financial   markets evolve and, second, whether we continue this stronger-than-expected growth pattern or   June 24–25, 2008 134 of 253    whether we begin to see a more recessionary-type of pattern  In particular, between now and the   next meeting, we have two employment reports, a lot of other relevant information, and a lot of   insight from the financial markets  At the same time, on the inflation side, we will see how   commodity prices evolve, whether we have any kind of relief from what we saw in the last   intermeeting period, how the dollar behaves, and how inflation expectations behave  All those   things will give us a better sense of where we are and how we should proceed   So I think we should try to be nimble  We should try to respond to the information as it   comes in  We should be focused particularly on tail risks  I think we should begin to move, or   should maintain, market expectations toward tightening  President Fisher, I think I have to note   for the record that I don’t think we should let political considerations affect our decisions in any   way, and I am not concerned about that  I think we are all prepared to do what is necessary  I   don’t know what we are going to do in the next meeting or the meeting after that  But my   expectation now is that, as others have mentioned, we will begin normalizing interest rates   relatively soon, and we should, if possible, begin to prepare the markets for that   For today, as I have indicated, I recommend no change in the federal funds rate target and   alternative B for the statement  I think alternative B captures the facts pretty well on the whole    I won’t go into it, but I think the inflation paragraph is a little more hawkish  It drops the   discussion of a leveling-out of commodity prices  It doesn’t refer to core inflation, which we   have taken before as sort of a reassuring element  I’m disappointed that President Fisher is going   to vote against his own language in alternative B, paragraph 4, which we have adopted and   which I think is a very good expression of the risks     I think President Stern’s suggestion is interesting  I am a   little worried that it might go just a bit too far in suggesting that we have discounted the   downside risks  I am struggling with the “considerable” in alternative B, paragraph 2  I have   sort of heard two for and two against  I don’t know if others have a view  It is a bit risky to   change, given how quickly things can move  But if others would like to express a view, I think   yet a third thing that we could do would be to say, “Financial markets, though somewhat   improved recently, remain under considerable stress”  That might be a way to address it  Does   anyone have any thoughts on that word?  Any concerns?  President Lacker?    Vice Chairman    I think the Vice Chairman raises an interaction that I hadn’t   thought of, which is that our facilities are existing under the premise of unusual and exigent   circumstances, and we don’t really want to undercut that  President Fisher   June 24–25, 2008 136 of 253     Yes  President Plosser    Of course, all of these subtleties will    I would like to propose no change in alternative B as given   in exhibit 1  Any further comment?  If not, could you please take the roll?    Thank you  Why don’t we take a fifteen-minute coffee   break, and we will come back and discuss investment banks   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we commence, then  This is a joint FOMC and   Board meeting, and so I need a motion to close the Board meeting    Without objection  Okay  Our topic for this morning is   investment banks, their supervision, and related policy issues  Let me turn it over to Art Angulo   of the New York Fed, who will introduce the topic  Art    Art, could you define “leverage” in this picture   June 24–25, 2008 139 of 253     Questions for our colleagues?  President Lacker    Governor Kohn    President Lacker, you had something?    President Plosser, did you have a comment?    Go ahead  Finish your sentence    President Hoenig, did you have an intervention?    We’re going to have a chance, of course, for everybody to   give their views  President Fisher, did you have a question?    Did you complete your questions?    President Rosengren    Governor Warsh, did you have a question?    Why don’t we then have an opportunity for general comments   on these issues  Let me just give a bit of context  When we instituted the PDCF and the TSLF in   March, about the time of the Bear Stearns event, we stipulated that they would be available for up to   six months  That date, mid-September, is coming closer  It’s my view, and I think others share it,   that markets remain fragile, and in the case of Lehman, for example, the existence of the backup   June 24–25, 2008 160 of 253    was an important support in maintaining the stability of that institution  Therefore, given the state   of the markets and given that I think we still face some systemic risks, I am quite inclined at this   point to ask the Board to extend the PDCF and the FOMC to extend the TSLF over year-end, which   is a difficult period—subject, of course, to the continued finding of unusual and exigent   circumstances  If we do that, I would ask the Board to consider that in a Board meeting, and   depending on the comments today, if there’s sufficient support, I would ask the FOMC to do that in   a notation vote later this month   Now, if we make the announcements that we’re going to at least provisionally extend these   facilities, I think it’s important that we do so in the context of explaining that we have an exit   strategy  In particular, we are working to strengthen supervisory oversight, market resilience, and   the overall regulatory structure so that there is understanding and confidence that we’re moving   forward in a way that will over time make this unnecessary not only in the short term but in the long   term as well    There are several parts to the plan here  One, as Scott already described, is the   memorandum of understanding with the SEC, which will provide the basis for cooperation and   collaboration in the medium term for our oversight of the investment banks  Two, working with the   SEC, we’d like to push forward along the lines that Art was describing, go beyond where we are   now, and begin to establish a set of supervisory expectations regarding what we expect to see for the   investment banks and to make sure that we have greater confidence in what we’re doing and what   they’re doing  A third element that I think is important as we go forward is to try to improve the   financial infrastructure in a number of dimensions  A lot of this work is already taking place at the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York, working with other regulators and with the private sector  It   includes things like improving the clearing and settlement process for various kinds of derivatives   June 24–25, 2008 161 of 253    and improving risk management of derivative positions and counterparty positions, for example  It   would be important for us going forward to make sure that major institutions can identify their   exposure to a given counterparty through derivatives and other instruments and be able to close out   that counterparty in an efficient and effective way  In addition, work is going on here at the Board   and in conjunction with New York on the tri-party repo market, trying to think of ways that we can   strengthen that—perhaps, for example, by narrowing the range of collateral that is normally   accepted and through other steps   So the way I would envision this proceeding would be—again, with your assent and subject   to your comments—that we will announce within the next few days the MOU agreement with the   SEC, which I would reemphasize is not tied to the PDCF  That is, we would anticipate that this   relationship would continue even should we close those facilities, on the grounds that the moral   hazard issue is still there, until such time that there is further resolution by the Congress  Second,   I’ll be giving a speech at the FDIC on July 8, followed by testimony on regulatory reform on   July 10, when Secretary Paulson and I and others will be laying out some broad principles,   including some of the issues of infrastructure, and will be discussing some of the longer-term   legislative issues—for example, the issue of how we should perhaps normalize or regularize the   resolution of a failing systemically important firm and, in so doing, maybe define more strictly what   the parameters are for Fed lending and what our responsibility is in this kind of situation   So to summarize, the MOU is this week  There will be testimony coming up  Presumably   after the monetary policy testimony later this month, we would like, conditional on your approval,   to announce the extension of these facilities conditional on continuing unusual and exigent   circumstances  We would like to package that with a series of announcements concerning   investment bank expectations, infrastructure, and as part of this environment as we talk about this in   June 24–25, 2008 162 of 253    testimony and so on, some of our thoughts about how we might go forward in terms of statutory   change in the future  What I’m trying to convey is that, although I think we need to extend these   facilities, we should do it in a context of increasing clarity about how we are working to make them   less and less necessary in the future  So with that as context, let me just open the floor for any   comments that people might have  I have first President Lacker    Thank you  I agree with you that we need to define limits, but   I think we have stronger tools than just our declarations of piety  I would just note that there are   models  One good model is the FDICIA model, for example, which lays out a whole set of criteria   under which intervention can be taken and, if intervention is taken, has a set of rules  There are   ways through the legal structure to solve some of these problems without our necessarily having to   make time-inconsistent promises    We’ll discuss those  Yes, President Plosser    President Rosengren   June 24–25, 2008 167 of 253     Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you    A suggestion?    That’s right  Because of testimonies and so on, we are   going to have to at least enunciate some broad principles, and that is why this discussion is very   useful  Obviously, details will be worked out over a longer period  President Bullard    President Fisher    I was planning to do that    President Stern    Thank you  President Yellen    President Plosser     Thank you  President Pianalto   June 24–25, 2008 178 of 253     Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you    Thank you  Governor Mishkin    Thank you  Vice Chairman   June 24–25, 2008 190 of 253     Thank you  President Plosser      Vice Chairman   June 24–25, 2008 192 of 253     President Lacker   June 24–25, 2008 193 of 253     Remember that we are doing moral suasion as well  I   mean, we are not really allowing investment banks to use this as a profit center  So I’m not quite   sure what the marginal effect would be on incentives    It also might increase the stigma  It is a very complicated   calculation    Governor Warsh    Bill Dudley, did you have a comment?    Okay  If there are no other pressing comments, thank you   very much for this discussion  I heard general support for the short-term strategy, which means,   I hope, that if we do come to ask you for an extension of the TSLF we can do it by notation vote   without a videoconference meeting, unless things change   There clearly is a lot of dissatisfaction among all of us about the ad hoc nature of the way   we had to deal with the crisis in March  We would all like much more clarity about our   authorities, the limit of those authorities, and the match between our responsibilities and our   authorities; and, as we go forward, we will try to get clarification on that  At the same time, we   also want to take steps to try to increase the resilience of the system and reduce the risk that we   will be in the same situation again in the future    I will try to vet my speech  I don’t want to overpromise  It has to be done over the   Fourth of July weekend, so I expect everyone to be available 24/7 for commentary  [Laughter]    But I will generally be talking about things that we are doing  I will talk only in general terms   about some of the principles that we have discussed today about the need for clarification about   how to resolve a troubled institution, how to set those limits, and so on  But I will try to circulate   that, to the extent that it is feasible   Let’s see, our next meeting is Tuesday, August 5  You are invited to get lunch and come   back to the table to hear Laricke Blanchard’s update on congressional matters  If you have any   revisions to your economic projections, you have until 500 pm tomorrow to send those in  And   I want to thank—I haven’t done this—Art, Scott, Pat, and all of their colleagues, who have been   working very hard on these issues, for their presentation and their hard work  The meeting is   adjourned   END OF MEETING   June 24–25, 2008 196 of 253     "
8477,2008-07-24,BERNANKE,"  Without objection  This is a joint Board–FOMC meeting   because the issues on liquidity provision that we are going to be discussing today require both   Board and FOMC actions   At the last FOMC meeting, the one in June, we discussed briefly some of the facilities—  the TAF, the PDCF, and the TSLF—and I think there was an agreement that we would be   announcing an extension of those beyond year-end  At that time, I suggested that we might take   a notation vote on those issues  However, the staff has proposed a couple of additional wrinkles,   which would make sense to announce at the same time that we announce an extension  Because   we want to get your views on these, I thank you for taking the time to join this meeting   Two additional suggestions have been made  The first is to add an auction of options to   the TSLF to allow dealers to bid for the option to have access to the TSLF over critical short   periods such as over year-end  We will get more explanation of that  The second proposal is to   extend the maturity of the Term Auction Facility from the current 28 days to 84 days  As you   know, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank have been conducting auctions   pursuant to our TAF auctions  We have contacted them and told them that we are considering   the extension in time  If we do that, they have both indicated that they would want to follow and   do three-month auctions with us  To make that work out, we are going to propose a small   increase in the ECB swap line—well, not small, but from $50 billion to $60 billion  I guess $10   billion is large money anywhere  The purpose is that they can divide that by six and have a more   even number for auctions   July 24, 2008 3 of 50    The reasons I thought that we should discuss this now instead of waiting for the meeting   in a couple of weeks are, first, that there is considerable interest in what we are going to do with   these various facilities and already some reporting about them, and I think it is better for us to get   this out sooner rather than later  If we decide today to take these steps—in particular, if we   decide to lengthen the TAF—for purposes of coordinating with ECB, they would have to get   approval from their governors as well  The bottom line is that our announcement would be next   Wednesday morning, so we would not be quite ready to announce for a few more days  In   addition, because I do want everyone to have a chance to give their views and we have only a   one-day meeting coming up, I thought it would be better to get this done before the FOMC   meeting  Again, the issue at hand is whether to make these two additional modifications to our   liquidity program   I am going to turn to New York and ask Bill Dudley to brief us on these proposals  He   will be assisted by Debby Perelmuter and Sandy Krieger  After that, there will be time for Q&A   with them; with Brian, who is here; with Scott Alvarez; or with anyone on the staff  Following   that, we will have an opportunity for discussion  The votes are actually kind of complicated   because the responsibilities for these programs are divided in various ways between the Board   and the FOMC  But we will get to that, I guess, at the appropriate time  So let me now turn over   the meeting to Bill Dudley  Bill    Thank you very much  Are there any questions for Bill or   other staff members?  President Evans    President Lacker     Okay  Other questions?  President Hoenig    Tom, let me say just a word about that  The “unusual and   exigent” is a determination that the Board makes  I personally feel comfortable with that   determination at this time, given a lot of indicators of stresses in the markets  In addition, I think   that, in the absence of our facilities, the risks of systemic problems would be much higher  I   think it is useful for us to give a time frame, to provide some sense of assurance to market   participants that, if conditions remain stressed, there will be these backups  I would note, for   example, with respect to your point about underutilization, that the PDCF is now at zero and has   been at zero; but I do think that its presence has actually provided some assurance  Finally, I   would also mention that—as you will see, if you have not already seen in our official resolution   on this—if at any point going forward the Board determines that unusual and exigent   circumstances do not prevail—and Scott is nodding—we would not be committed to going six   months  At that point we would no longer have a basis for maintaining these programs  So we   do have to make that determination, and at this point I would say it is a reasonable determination    Other questions?  President Plosser    Bill, if our goal is not to take away something that the   banks already have, wouldn’t it make sense to make the 28 days or more the loan that needs to be   overcollateralized?  Would that be the right way to think about it?    All right  President Plosser    President Evans, did you have a two-handed intervention on   this?    Let me turn to President Pianalto, who has been very   patient, and then, Bill, you can respond to both, as you wish  President Pianalto    Thank you  Other questions?  Well, if there are not any   other questions, let me first say that I do want to thank the staff  These innovations did come   from the staff members who are on the front lines  President Evans, we really have talked about   these, and I know the staff has thought these through  I think that these are constructive ideas    The option idea essentially will allow for a better targeted use of our balance sheet to some short   periods that have been particularly stressful, and I think it will give us overall more flexibility to   use our balance sheet in the most effective way  So it seems like an innovative way to deal with   a particular problem, which is this end-of-quarter issue   On the 84-day TAF, I know for sure that banks have been asking for a longer term  I   have heard it directly myself and have heard a lot about this from the Desk  It is frequently   pointed out by the banks that the ECB and the Bank of England have been making effective use   of longer-term loans, and in their view that has made the liquidity pressures less severe in those   jurisdictions  So I do think it is certainly worth considering the three-month TAF loan    Obviously, as Reserve Bank presidents, you have to administer these; and the first question that   comes to your mind is, of course, the greater credit risk  In that respect, I think that taking the   July 24, 2008 20 of 50    existing haircuts plus 33 percent should provide some comfort  Of course, you retain the right   always to demand collateral to your satisfaction or to convert the loan to a primary or secondary   or overnight loan or to call the loan  So you have always the same protections that you currently   have  I suppose it would be, in some sense, a de facto tightening of standards, if you were   looking at institutions that would be eligible on a three-month basis  At the same time, to go   back to my earlier comment, we don’t have to make a final decision today, but it might be worth   considering not putting the overcollateralization requirement on any loan less than, say, 14 or 28   days on the grounds, as President Plosser pointed out, that we don’t want to be seen as taking   away something or increasing the cost of funding at a time when we still want to provide these   liquidity benefits  So I guess that one option I would raise for consideration is that, if we do the   three-month maturity, we use the overcollateralization for loans greater than 28 days  This   means that, as a loan maturity comes down—as it comes close to payoff—some collateral could   be withdrawn if desired   I do think these are reasonable extensions  They seem to me to be quite consistent with   our earlier practice  I take President Hoenig’s point that we are not in this business indefinitely    We need to be thinking about cutting back  But at the moment, conditions do not seem   considerably better, and I don’t think that at this moment we really should be reducing our   support to the market  Are there others who would like to comment on any aspect of these   proposals—about collateral or about any of the other issues?  President Plosser    Okay  Thank you  Anyone else?  President Yellen    President Yellen, San Francisco did a really good job in a   difficult situation  We were following that very carefully  Just a footnote, did the FDIC not give   you some assurances as well—protections for lending—because they asked you explicitly to   assist them in winding down the bank?    My main point, though, is that if you had allowed this   bank—and you probably had some suspicions about it—to participate in the three-month TAF,   you would have had all the same protections  the ability to convert to overnight, to primary   credit, or to secondary credit; to call the loan; or to ask for more collateral  Am I mistaken?    Sandy?  Anyone?  Why would you have been unable to do the same?    Okay  Governor Kroszner had a two-hander on this one    Governor Kroszner    President Lacker, you had a two-hander?     President Lacker—I’m sorry, Janet  Go ahead    I just wanted to assure President Lacker that we did, in fact,   communicate our concerns to the OTS about this episode  President Stern    Anyone else?  President Evans    I would just note that the TAF is not contingent on any   unusual and exigent circumstances because that is just the regular discount window  President   Rosengren    Okay  Thank you  Mr Rosenblum    President Bullard     President Lockhart    President Lacker    There is a kind of embarrassing situation that this is, in fact, a   Board decision  What I would like to do is ask President Geithner and President Plosser to make a   couple of final comments, and then I would like to turn to Board members  Governor Kroszner, I   am going to give you warning  In that you are the head of Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs, I   would like to know what your view is  In particular, can you offer any kinds of steps, assurances, or   July 24, 2008 34 of 50    anything that might persuade our colleagues particularly on the credit issues with respect to the   three-month TAF?  If not, we would like to know that  But let me first turn to President Geithner    President Geithner    President Plosser, did you want to add something?      Okay  Governor Kohn   July 24, 2008 37 of 50     Thank you  Governor Kroszner   July 24, 2008 38 of 50     Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Is there anyone who hasn’t spoken who would   like to speak?  Governor Mishkin    Thanks  I may not be the only one who thinks that maybe we   should come to some kind of conclusion here  So let me suggest a way to go forward  First of all,   as Governor Warsh mentioned, I think we were in agreement at the last meeting that we would   extend the TSLF and the PDCF beyond September  The TSLF extension requires approval both by   the Board and by the FOMC  So let me make a list here  The first thing I’d like to do—and I hope   this is okay with everyone—would be to have Scott read those two resolutions  I would then like to   ask the Board to extend the PDCF  Again, I believe we have discussed these and are okay with   them     With respect to the extension of the TAF terms, my sense is that this would be a productive   thing to do from the perspective of markets  I agree with President Geithner that the markets are   still quite stressed and that this would be helpful  It has the additional sort of multiplier effect that,   if we extend to three months, the ECB will auction $60 billion to three months as well, to give some   additional impetus in Europe  That said, I do not feel comfortable doing this unless we have at least   a reasonable sense that the presidents are okay with it  So after we finish the first three votes, I’ll   take a straw vote of the presidents and ask you to answer the following question  Given the efforts,   to which President Geithner and Governor Kroszner alluded, to address the credit issues that we   already face in our 28-day program, do you feel comfortable in doing the 84 days?  If you do not,   then my suggestion would be just not to go forward with it   Finally, the TSLF options program is an FOMC vote  I would propose that we take a vote   on it and see how it comes out  Okay?  Any comments, questions, or concerns?  If not, Scott, could   you start us off with the TSLF extension and take us through what we have to do?   July 24, 2008 43 of 50     Sure    This is an FOMC vote  Debbie, if you would take the roll,   please    You got President Lockhart  Okay, good  Thank you  Now   the Board has also to make a determination  Scott    All right  Unless there is an objection, since we had a   unanimous vote on the first one, I am going to assume, if no objection, that we will pass that   resolution  Okay  Let’s turn to the Board’s determination on the PDCF    All right  Why don’t you call the roll on this one, Debbie    Okay  Thank you  Now, I’d like to poll the presidents on the   following question  Assuming that we do take the measures that were described by Governor   Kroszner and President Geithner to work with President Hoenig on improving our collateral and   surveillance procedures, are you more comfortable with the extension in terms of the ability to   manage credit risk?  I might add, if you are a negative, would your view be changed if we broke this   into a 28-day and an 84-day so that you would have the option of directing a bank to the 28-day if   that were your decision?  Let me ask people just to get a quick response  President Rosengren    Certainly    That is correct    President Rosengren, did you say you support the proposal?    Thank you  President Geithner   July 24, 2008 46 of 50     Okay  President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    President Lockhart    President Bullard has left  President Evans   July 24, 2008 47 of 50     President Stern    President Hoenig    President Yellen    Bill, are you having any issues with the feasibility of splitting   it?    So let’s do this  Let’s have Bill and his team look at the   feasibility of a split auction  Let’s have any discussions we might have about how we might   improve our monitoring of the credit risks and of the institutions  We will then have the staff   communicate with everyone in the FOMC  Then depending on the reaction, we’ll have notation   votes  Will that be a reasonable way to go?   All right  We will not take any further votes on this issue, but we will have the staff contact   you and discuss with you both the issue of 28 versus 84 and the issue, going forward, of how to   improve our surveillance  There will have to be notation votes if we decide to go forward  The   extension of the TAF would be a Board vote, but we also would need the FOMC to approve an   increase in the swap line so that the ECB could follow us  All right  So we’re leaving those   notation votes, and you will all be contacted by the staff  I appreciate your feedback on that  The   last item on the agenda is the options program for the TSLF  Scott Alvarez advises me that we can   July 24, 2008 49 of 50    take a straw vote  I’m okay with a regular vote  Let’s go ahead and take a vote  This is a vote by   the FOMC  Could you read the resolution, Scott?    Thank you  We had a very long meeting but a very   productive discussion  I thank you for that  We will be in touch with you about both of the issues   relating to the TAF  Thank you very much  Without other issues, the meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING      July 24, 2008 50 of 50     "
8498,2008-08-05,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Today is the last meeting for   our colleague, Governor Mishkin  Rick has attended 16 FOMC meetings as a Committee   member and 23 additional meetings, I assume mostly as the research director for New York  We   are certainly going to miss your singular interventions—[laughter] as well as your insights and   your collegiality  There will be a lunch today in honor of Rick, and we will have a chance then   to express our appreciation for your time here and for your contributions   There are comings and goings  Today is also the first meeting for Governor Duke, whom   I was pleased to swear in about 15 minutes ago in my office  [Laughter]  It took an   unconscionably long time for this qualified person to be confirmed by the US Senate  We are   very glad that she had the patience to stick it out and that she is finally here  She brings a great   deal to the table, including a lot of experience in banking, which obviously is something of great   interest to us these days  So, welcome  We look forward to a long and productive association   Turning to Desk operations, before Bill begins, a couple of issues were raised in our last   videoconference  One had to do with the concern about whether we have a sufficient balance   sheet to address liquidity needs going forward  Bill, I believe you are going to talk a bit about   that—give an interim report on where we are on balance sheet issues and what we might do in   case those constraints start to bind  The second concern that was raised had to do with what we   mean by “unusual and exigent” and how we determine whether those conditions are still   prevailing  I have asked Brian and the staff to put together a memo giving us some thoughts on   that issue, and that will come to you before the next meeting and give us a chance to think about   it and, as time permits, discuss it at the next meeting  Without further ado, Bill   August 5, 2008 3 of 145     Thank you very much, Bill  Any questions for Bill?    President Evans    President Plosser    President Bullard    President Lacker    Thank you  I guess I would comment that there is an   asymmetry here, which is the possibility of systemic risk  There are situations in which   failures—major collapses of certain markets—can have discontinuous and large effects on the   economy  We have seen that in many contexts across a large number of countries  These   stresses do reflect the working out of equilibriums given fundamental losses, which we can’t do   August 5, 2008 14 of 145    very much or anything about  But they do create machinery that is less flexible and less able to   respond to new shocks, and that raises systemic risk  That is the risk that we want to try to   minimize, even as we allow the markets to work their way through and to price the changes we   have seen     Certainly  Any other questions for Bill?  If not, let me turn   to David Wilcox for the economic situation    Thank you  Questions for our colleagues?  President Fisher    Thank you  President Plosser    President Lockhart    Steve, you might want to define “core import price inflation”    It’s not analogous to the other core    Vice Chairman    Isn’t it true, though, that changes in potential growth also have   demand effects as well—to some extent offsetting?    President Evans     Vice Chairman, did you have an intervention?    President Rosengren—sorry  President Lacker, an   intervention?    President Lockhart      President Plosser    President Rosengren, you have been patient    I have President Fisher, and then if it’s okay with everybody,   we should probably start our go-round  President Fisher    Thank you, President Fisher  The go-round  President   Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Fisher    President Fisher, I’m going to ask you a very innocent   question  You’ve given many chilling anecdotes over the last few meetings about increases in   prices, but the official statistics just don’t show anything like that outside of oil, gas, gasoline, and   the direct commodity price increases  Do you believe that the CPI is not an accurate measure?    Governor Mishkin    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Why don’t we take a coffee break until 1120   [Coffee break]   August 5, 2008 63 of 145     Okay  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin, your swan song    [Laughter]    Thank you  Governor Duke   August 5, 2008 92 of 145     Thank you  Michelle, what time is our hard cutoff here?    You want it before 215, though  All right  Well, I spent a   lot of time through the meeting and during the break working up a crystalline summary of the   discussion  [Laughter]  But I am a bit concerned about getting to lunch and avoiding the 215   hard deadline; so if you would excuse me, this time I will just go directly to a few comments of   my own, and then we can go to the policy round   We saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign   slogan for the Republicans, “The Economy  It Could Be Worse”  [Laughter]  The question,   though, is whether this higher-than-expected growth rate in the second quarter implies that we   are actually looking forward to a better-than-expected remainder of the year or whether this was   in some sense a last hurrah of borrowing from the future  I feel that I am very strongly in the   latter camp, unfortunately  I do think that, for reasons people have talked about, the remainder of   the year and into next year are likely to be quite weak  I don’t know how weak, but if you look   at each component of spending or component of production, you see mostly very negative   indicators   We have talked about consumption  We know about all the fundamental issues that are   affecting consumers, and we have seen recently, I think both anecdotally and in terms of the   data, some softness, particularly in the auto area  In the labor market, several people have noted   August 5, 2008 97 of 145    that the loss of payroll jobs has not been as rapid as, for example, in 2001  The unemployment   rate, though, has risen as quickly as in previous episodes, and any look at the unemployment rate   would suggest that this is something close to a normal recession dynamic     Housing, of course, remains very uncertain  We don’t really know when the bottom will   be, although I would add, a point that I think Bill Dudley made, that there seems to be a growing   confidence that when we have reached the bottom in housing, whenever that may be, we will see   a very quick improvement, both in the financial markets and then, presumably, in the economy   as well  In other areas, such as nonresidential construction, architectural billings and other   factors suggest slowing there  We see slowing in the other industrial countries, although some   strength is still in the emerging markets  So just looking at the traditional indicators of growth   and production, I think the best guess is for a slow second half, a slow beginning of 2009, and an   unemployment rate that continues to rise from here   I do believe that the financial stress and its implications for credit availability are   important in this whole dynamic  I guess President Lacker and I keep talking past each other,   but I don’t think that the federal funds rate is an adequate description of the stance of monetary   policy  To give another example, in the past we have used money growth as an indicator of   monetary policy  If we used that indicator, it would look quite different  I think the appropriate   indicators are the rates and terms that are being faced by the people making decisions to spend in   the economy  You can go through the entire list, and in every case, as Governor Kohn   suggested, the actual rates being faced in the data by borrowers are as high as or higher than they   were last summer  Mortgages, which are a particularly sensitive area, are of course critical here    Despite the decline in the federal funds rate, the spread between mortgage-backed securities and   duration-matched Treasuries is now about 260 basis points compared with 120 basis points last   August 5, 2008 98 of 145    summer  In addition, for the spread between jumbo loans and conforming loans, which in the   past has normally been between 25 and 50 basis points, the offer rate is about 120 basis points    So there seems little doubt—and we can check with Governor Duke about this—that, despite the   lower rate on overnight bank lending, the rates that matter for economic activity are largely   higher than they were a year ago  Therefore, I don’t think it is evident at all that we are in a   financial situation that is conducive to rapid, excessive growth and inflationary increases a priori   Now, going forward, of course, a lot of what happens in the economy is going to depend   on bank balance sheets  I won’t spend much time  In April, I talked about the staff’s estimates   of losses going forward  That has been updated  Nellie Liang is working with people in New   York  The numbers are not too encouraging under the baseline scenario, forgetting about the   more severe scenarios  The staff now projects about $228 billion in losses for US banks and   thrifts in ’08 and ’09  That excludes investment banks  That excludes write-downs  If that   occurs, it would be about a 2 percent loss rate over the next two years, which would be above the   peak of 1991 and 1992  Of course, if the economy does worse, it would be even higher    Relative to that $228 billion in losses, there are so far loan-loss provisions of about $68 billion    So it looks as though we still have a long way to go in terms of bank losses and write-downs   In addition, some of the biggest banks will take very significant hits  This is very   preliminary, and I don’t want to make too much of it, but the preliminary analysis shows that for   five of the very biggest banks, under a baseline scenario and looking at the composition of their   asset holdings, their current tier 1 capital ratios will be reduced between 30 percent and   50 percent over the next two years  So there is a real concern about the availability of credit and   about the cost of credit  I could go on and talk about a variety of other areas, including the   Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which suggests that credit will be a concern going forward   August 5, 2008 99 of 145    President Lacker and I have, I hope, respect—I respect him, and I hope he respects me    But we disagree also about President Bullard on systemic risk  I take his criticism to be that it   works in practice, but can it work in theory?  Systemic risk is an old phenomenon  There are   literally dozens and dozens of historical episodes that are suggestive of that phenomenon  There   is also an enormous theoretical literature  Maybe it is not entirely satisfactory, but certainly   many people have thought about that issue  I, myself, have obviously worked in this area    Clearly, it is not something that we can tightly explain in all aspects, but I do think it is a   concern  We need to remain concerned about it  Although it is true, as President Bullard points   out, that there is an accommodation and a basis for anticipating crises as we go forward, it is also   the case, as I think Governor Mishkin noted, that after a year we are also facing a situation of   greater fragility, of much lower capital, and fewer shock absorbers  Those things will make any   crisis that much more severe, should it occur  So overall I think there is still significant   downside risk to growth  I think the baseline of slow growth is right  I am hopeful that we will   see growth restored early next year, but I think it is very uncertain at this point   On inflation, I do have concerns, as everyone else does  I think that the commodity price   movements we have seen are good news  They have been quite significant  Besides oil prices   down about 10 percent and natural gas prices down about 32 percent, since the last meeting corn   is off 27 percent; soybeans, 17 percent; and wheat, 16 percent  Those are not small changes    Now, obviously, the level of prices is still very high  It has risen considerably over the past year    We will continue to see that high level of prices being passed through into the core, as Governor   Kohn noted, but I would argue that if—and this is a very big “if”—commodity prices do begin to   stabilize within the general range of what we see now, I think that the inflation concerns will   moderate over time because they will have lost essentially their driving force  We don’t really   August 5, 2008 100 of 145    have the conditions to turn the commodity price increases into persistent inflation, absent   continued pressure on that front and absent changes in inflation expectations, of which there is   only limited evidence at this point  So I want to be very clear  I think that containing inflation is   enormously important, and I think it is our first responsibility  We need to watch this very   carefully  I think there will be continued pressures even if commodity prices don’t rise, but I do   think there is also a chance that we will see a moderation of this problem going forward   What else?  I guess there has been a lot of discussion about the appropriate withdrawal of   stimulus  Again, I don’t think I accept the idea that we are currently in an extremely stimulative   situation  However, if financial markets were to normalize, for example, that would lead to a   more stimulative situation  I would like to say just a word about that  That is to say that the   speed at which we remove the accommodation—and I think it is clear we do have to do that   relatively soon—should depend to some extent on how inflation evolves  Under the more benign   scenario that I have just described—if inflation does decline significantly because of commodity   prices—I think that we obviously have more time  I would just note for comparison past   episodes  In 1994, for example, the pause lasted 17 months, and the first increase in rates came   two years after payrolls began growing again  In 2001, again, it was more than a year after   unemployment rates started coming down, and payrolls began growing before the rates started   going up     Now, I think there is a view, which is a reasonable one, that maybe in at least the second   of those two episodes we waited too long to begin to normalize  That is entirely possible  But,   again, it would be extraordinary if we were to begin raising rates without an immediate inflation   problem with the economy still in a declining or extremely weakened situation  If inflation does   in fact become the problem that many around the table think it is, particularly if commodity   August 5, 2008 101 of 145    prices begin to go up again or if the dollar begins to weaken, then I will be the first here to   support responding to that  I do think it is incredibly important to keep inflation expectations   well anchored, particularly to the extent that movements of commodity prices and the dollar   seem to be derived from monetary policy as opposed to things like geopolitical risk  Then, I   think we can’t treat them as truly exogenous  We would have to respond to those things  So I   welcome the ongoing discussion we should have about the pace of withdrawal of   accommodation  I do think it depends very much on how things evolve, and I do think that our   strategy should be to watch carefully and to make the right decisions as we see the data come in    Let me stop there and turn to the last round and ask Brian, please, to introduce the policy   discussion    Thank you  Any questions for Brian?  President Fisher    All right  Any other questions?  Let me start, then, with   President Yellen      Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  I would just note on the “unusual and exigent”   issue that there are two schools of thought  The other school is the one you said, which is that   having done this, we would have the freedom to raise rates; so I think it sort of cuts both   directions  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  Governor Kohn   August 5, 2008 111 of 145     Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Stern    President Lacker    That wasn’t my intention, President Lacker   August 5, 2008 114 of 145     You raise a good point—that we ought to look empirically at   the relationship between borrowing rates and the federal funds rate in this episode and other   episodes, which we really haven’t done  So we need to do that  Thank you    President Rosengren    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Mishkin   August 5, 2008 120 of 145     Thank you, Governor Mishkin  Governor Duke    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  I want to thank everyone for your comments   today  I know we don’t have agreement around the table, but as somebody once said, if everybody   agrees, then everybody except one is redundant  [Laughter]  I listened very carefully to what has   been said  I understand your concerns  I think hard about them—I do every day  As we go   forward, we will obviously continue to have these fruitful discussions     I do think that we need to continue to clarify this exit strategy issue  One point I would   make, and Governor Warsh alluded to it, is that we need to think of this as a state-dependent rather   than a time-dependent strategy  We need to be clear not so much as to whether we are or are not   going to raise rates but under what circumstances and why and what our objectives are  On that   basis, I reiterate that my greater attention recently to financial and real conditions has to do with my   view of the risks rather than my objective function   I recommend no action today and alternative B  There were a number of suggestions for   changes  I think I will avoid them just to avoid further controversy  My reasons for suggesting   August 5, 2008 126 of 145    alternative B were well stated by President Pianalto  It’s hard to judge  I don’t know what the   markets will make of this, but my intention is for it to be slightly hawkish—to indicate a slight   upward tilt in policy—which has several functions  First, if we don’t move, it emphasizes our   ongoing concern with inflation and perhaps provides some prophylactic protection with respect to   expectations and so on  On the other hand, if conditions do warrant action, and it could be quick   action, at least we will have provided the markets with some warning and some indication of our   concern about this issue  So that’s my recommendation  Any comments?  Would you call the roll?    Thank you very much  The next meeting is September 16,   and we will adjourn now to the Terrace Level of the Martin Building to pay honor to Governor   Mishkin  Thank you very much   END OF MEETING   August 5, 2008 127 of 145     "
8523,2008-09-16,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Sorry for the late beginning    The markets are continuing to experience very significant stresses this morning, and there are   increasing concerns about the insurance company AIG  That is the reason that Vice Chairman   Geithner is not attending, and Chris Cumming will sit in his place   I want to turn in a minute to Bill Dudley for his usual report, and he will be able to give   you more information about the situation  There is another action item I would like to add, given   what is happening, which is that there are very significant problems with dollar funding in other   jurisdictions—in Europe and elsewhere  After Bill makes his presentation and we have our   discussion, I would like to put on the table a request for authorization for swap lines  I prefer not   to put a limit on it, so I know I’ve got my own bazooka here  [Laughter]  There is a Foreign   Currency Subcommittee that consists of myself, the Vice Chairman of the FOMC, and the Vice   Chairman of the Board  Again, after Bill’s discussion, I would like to discuss the possibility of   giving us a temporary authority to use swap lines as needed   Before I turn to Bill, let me say one other thing  Obviously, we started late  We have a   lot to talk about  I would like—just for today, if you would indulge me—to condense our   discussion to one round  In your discussion, please include your tentative views on the policy   decision  Obviously, that is not ideal because you will not have heard everyone else’s views, but   we will have an opportunity afterward for people to amend, revise, and give additional thoughts    But in the interest of time, I think it would be more efficient at this time just to do it that way    Without further ado, let me turn to Bill and ask for a report    Questions for Bill?  President Rosengren    President Plosser    President Lacker   September 16, 2008 7 of 108     Other questions?  Bill, would you be able to talk a bit about   the need for swaps?    You had a two-hander, Governor Kohn?    Bill, if we were going to take action today, what would you   recommend in terms of counterparties?  Should we say an unlimited amount?  Should we specify   an amount?  Can we leave the time open?  What are your recommendations on all those   dimensions?    President Lacker   September 16, 2008 11 of 108     Whether it’s sensible or not, the ECB has made a pretty   strong distinction with us between their foreign exchange reserves and their dollars that they use   in these operations  They really want to keep those segregated  They want, to some extent, to   represent this as being a collaborative effort with the United States as opposed to something they   are taking on their own behalf  From their perspective—actually President Poole raised the same   issue earlier on, and we had this discussion—they seem to put a lot of value on having a distinct   swap line, which symbolizes the cooperation and coordination of the two central banks as   opposed simply to using their own reserves  President Fisher    Well, I don’t think there are any significant downside risks    There are operational issues that Bill Dudley and his team have to worry about  If we extend   funds to the Europeans, which they then relay to their banks, it affects our reserve positions and   affects the management of the federal funds rate and requires sterilization  That’s an operational   issue  I suppose, if there were really very large draws, it would begin to affect some of these   balance sheet constraint concerns that we have  I think that is not an entirely separate issue, but   it is certainly one that we are looking at in terms of trying to get interest on reserves and those   other kinds of measures   Again, my expectation is that having the facility would in part provide some confidence   over and above how much we actually extend  So I guess the operational issues and the further   draw on the balance sheet would be the downside, but to me, it seems to be a relatively   September 16, 2008 13 of 108    straightforward step—one we’ve done in the past and one that has the additional benefit of   indicating global cooperation on these issues      Other comments?  All right  Then I’d like to propose that   the FOMC delegate to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee an unspecified authority, in terms of   amount, to offer swaps to foreign central banks as needed to address liquidity pressures in those   other jurisdictions  Those decisions will be made, again, by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee   in consultation with the Open Market Desk  We would keep the FOMC closely informed, and   we would revisit and discuss this issue again in October  Is that an acceptable resolution?  Any   amendments to that?  Further discussion, comments, or concerns?  President Stern    Why don’t we have discussions with our counterparties—  we won’t announce anything today, I would assume?    Right  We’ll announce something    Of course  When would we announce this measure?    All right  So this is all conditional on agreements and   discussions with other counterparties  We will come up with a joint communication   announcement strategy  President Plosser    Existing facilities go to January 31, is that right?    January 30  Would that be acceptable?    Of course    Okay  So I amend the proposal to terminate on January 30    President Lacker    It’s not open ended in the sense that it is not an open window   that anybody can come to and take  It just gives us the authority to adjust the amount    We will certainly negotiate with the other central banks and   tell them what we’re doing now  But we want to have the flexibility in case of an emergency to   respond, and we also don’t want to communicate to the markets somehow that we have a hard limit   that is not going to be changed  That would be potentially bad for confidence    I think it is mostly a communication issue  Anything else?    All right  Do you want to call the roll on this one?      We need a second      All right  Thank you    The resolution is to provide to the Foreign Currency   Subcommittee the authority to enter into swap agreements with the foreign central banks as needed   to address strains in money markets in other jurisdictions  This will be done in cooperation with the   Open Market Desk and in consultation with those other central banks  The amounts are unlimited   in principle, but the decisions will be made by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee as needed and   as appropriate for the particular circumstances  The FOMC is providing this authority through   January 30  It will, of course, be open to discussion at any meeting    Of course  All right  Let’s take a vote    Thank you  Brian, have you circulated the statement?    Has everyone a copy of that?  Good  Before we get started on   that, I just want to comment that we may want to say something in the statement about financial   conditions, but we’ll come back to that later  We need also now a vote to ratify the domestic open   market operations     Any objections?  Okay  Thank you  Let’s turn now to the   economic situation  Dave Stockton and Nathan Sheets    Thank you  Are there questions for Dave and Nathan?    President Fisher    Three is a lucky number in China  Don was going to tell you   that 3 cubed is 27  [Laughter]    I think we have good feng shui here    Any other deep questions for our colleagues?  I’m a little   surprised      Everyone has been very brief  I’m shocked  [Laughter]  My   proposal, which I can be argued out of, is to do one round, if that’s acceptable  Please indicate your   September 16, 2008 24 of 108    preliminary view on policy, and you will have another opportunity to refine and extend your views    Is that acceptable with everybody?     Yes, of course  I was about to turn to that  If that’s   acceptable, let’s turn to Brian and have your discussion       President Fisher    Just on the issue of trading soft, though, the October-  December has also come down, and there is certainly some shift in the actual policy expectation    Other questions?  All right  If not, let’s begin with President   Lockhart     Thank you  President Rosengren    President Hoenig      Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Stern    President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    President Lacker, I have a question  I really would like your   advice on this  Historically, if we look at situations like Japan and Scandinavia, ultimately there   comes a point at which the banking system is decapitalized and dysfunctional and the government   intervenes on a large scale  Those interventions have been very expensive, but in those cases I   mentioned, they have generally restored the banking system to health and have helped the economy   recover  What’s your view on the right sequencing?  Do you think that we should remain very   tough until such time as it becomes inevitable that fiscal intervention is needed?  Do you think that   we should avoid fiscal intervention at all stages?  I’m seriously interested in knowing what you, or   anyone else who would like to comment, think is the appropriate stage, if any, at which fiscal   intervention becomes necessary    But I think this is a historical fact—that, once the banks   became decapitalized, there were also capital injections into the banks in both of those cases   September 16, 2008 49 of 108     Right    President Hoenig    I certainly agree—and the Treasury Secretary and I have said   publicly—that we need a strong, well-defined, ex ante, clear regime  But we have the problem now   that we don’t have such a regime, and we’re dealing on a daily basis with these very severe   consequences  So it is a difficult problem    President Rosengren    Okay  President Fisher   September 16, 2008 51 of 108     Thank you very much  Coffee is ready  Why don’t we take   about thirty minutes?  I have a couple of calls to make  See you at about 1120   [Coffee break]    Okay  If we’re ready, we can reconvene  First Vice President   Cumming    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner   September 16, 2008 63 of 108     Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for very   helpful comments  Let me try to summarize, and I will just make some comments, and then we   can turn to the statement and policy     The group indicated, of course, that economic growth has slowed and looks to be quite   sluggish in the second half  I didn’t hear a great deal of change in the general profile, with most   people still viewing growth as being slow in the near term but perhaps recovering somewhat in   2009  But obviously there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that judgment  The ongoing   problems in housing and the financial system are, of course, the downside risks to growth    Another factor, which is becoming more relevant, is the slowing global economy, which together   with the stronger dollar may mean that US export growth will be somewhat less  Despite the   tax rebate, consumer spending seems likely to be weak in the near term, reflecting a variety of   factors that we noted before, including housing and equity wealth, credit conditions, and   particularly perhaps the ongoing weakness in the labor market  The labor market is   deteriorating, with unemployment up, although UI programs may play some role in the   unemployment rate  It is somewhat difficult to predict the peak of the unemployment rate, given   September 16, 2008 70 of 108    the upward momentum we are seeing  Declines in energy prices, however, will improve real   incomes and help consumer sentiment—so that is a potentially positive factor   The housing sector continues to be the central concern in the economy, in both the real   and the financial sides  There are no clear signs of stabilization, although obviously regional   conditions vary considerably  The government action regarding the GSEs has lowered mortgage   rates and may be of some assistance  Credit conditions have tightened, though, in other areas as   well, including nonresidential construction   Firms are continuing to struggle with weaker demand, higher uncertainty, and high costs    Manufacturing has been relatively stable to weaker, but we had at least one report of a survey   that in the medium term the outlook is looking a little better  Inventories appear to be relatively   well managed  Credit conditions for business vary, but there are indications that some firms are   finding it very difficult to attract capital   Financial markets received a lot of attention around the table  Conditions clearly have   worsened recently, despite the rescue of the GSEs, the latest stressor being the bankruptcy of   Lehman Brothers and other factors such as AIG  Almost all major financial institutions are   facing significant stress, particularly difficulties in raising capital, and credit quality is   problematic, particularly in residential-related areas  One member noted that it is not evident   that markets are clearly differentiating between weaker and stronger firms at this point    Deleveraging is continuing, and securitization markets are moribund  Credit terms and   conditions are quite tight and may be a significant drag on the economy  However, the medium-  term implications of the recent increases in financial stress for the economy are difficult to   assess  We may have to wait for some time to get greater clarity on the implications of the last   week or so   September 16, 2008 71 of 108    On the inflation front, recent core and headline numbers have been high, reflecting earlier   increases in the prices of energy and raw materials  There are positive factors, including the   significant intermeeting declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, which, if maintained,   would bring headline inflation down rather notably by the end of the year or next year  The   dollar has also strengthened  Generally speaking, inflation expectations, though noisy, have   improved  We have seen a decline in TIPS breakevens and some decline in survey expectations   as well  But it was noted that the five-by-five TIPS breakeven remains above a level consistent   with long-term price stability  Nominal wage growth has remained subdued so far, slack is   increasing, productivity has been strong, and therefore, unit labor costs are well controlled    Again, all of these factors are positive in terms of a better inflation picture going forward  On   the other hand, recent declines notwithstanding, the cumulative increases in commodity prices   over the past year or so do remain large, and there is some evidence that these cost increases are   being passed through into core prices  Commodity prices are extremely volatile, which makes   inflation very difficult to forecast and makes the inflation outlook, therefore, quite uncertain    Wages could also begin to rise more quickly as the economy strengthens  For all these reasons,   inflation risks are still in play and remain a concern for the Committee  Some participants   reiterated their concern that maintaining rates too low for too long risks compromising our   credibility and stimulating inflation over the medium run  That is a very quick survey of the   comments  Are there any comments or questions?       If not, let me just make a few comments  Personally, I see the prospects for economic   growth in the foreseeable future as quite weak, notwithstanding the second quarter’s strength  I   think what we saw in the recent labor reports removes any real doubt that we are in a period that   will be designated as an official NBER recession  Unemployment rose 11 percentage points in   September 16, 2008 72 of 108    four months, which is a relatively rapid rate of increase  The significance of that for our   deliberations is, again, that there does seem to be some evidence that, in recession regimes, the   dynamics are somewhat more powerful and we tend to see more negative and correlated   innovations in spending equations  So I think that we are in for a period of quite slow growth    That is confirmed by what we are seeing in consumption, which probably would be quite   negative if it weren’t for the remainder of the fiscal stimulus package  Other components of   demand are, likewise, quite weak  We are all familiar with the housing situation  Some other   factors that were supportive in Q2 are weakening—a number of people have noted the export   growth  Actually, it is net exports—which is important—not just exports, and we are seeing both   slowing growth in exports and some forecast of increased growth in imports   A factor that we haven’t talked about much is the fiscal side  That has been supportive   and may be less supportive going forward  Generally speaking, though, I do think—and I have   said this for a long time—that the credit effects will be important  They operate with a lag  It is   very difficult to judge the lag  But my strong sense is that they are still some distance from their   peak; that they will begin to be felt outside of housing, in nonresidential construction, for   example, in consumer spending, and in investment; and that this is going to be independent of   last week’s financial developments  I think that is going to be a major drag, probably well into   next year   There are a few positives, which give some hope of some improvement next year  We   have talked about energy and commodity prices as they relate to inflation, but of course, the   decline in energy and commodity prices is also a plus for consumers and raises real incomes and   would be supportive of sentiment, as we have already seen  There are a few positive indications   here and there on the housing market, a few glimmers of stability, particularly in some regions  I   September 16, 2008 73 of 108    think that the GSE stabilization is going to be very important  It has already lowered mortgage   rates  It suggests that there will be a market for securitized mortgages, and I think that is   positive  So if I wanted to outline an optimistic scenario, it would involve stronger indications of   stabilization in housing, which in turn would feed into more confidence in the financial sector   and would lead over time to improvement in the broader economy   I do think that financial conditions are a major concern  The situation right now is very   uncertain, and we are not by any means away from significant systemic risk  Even if we avoid a   major systemic event, the increase in risk aversion, the pullback from all counterparties, the   deleveraging, the sale of assets—all of these things are going to continue for some time and are   going to make the financial sector very stressed, which obviously will have effects on the   economy    I have been grappling with the question I raised for President Lacker, and I would be very   interested in hearing other views either now or some other time  The ideal way to deal with   moral hazard is to have in place before the crisis begins a well-developed structure that gives   clear indications in what circumstances and on what terms the government will intervene with   respect to a systemically important institution  We have found ourselves, though, in this episode   in a situation in which events are happening quickly, and we don’t have those things in place    We don’t have a set of criteria, we don’t have fiscal backstops, and we don’t have clear   congressional intent  So in each event, in each instance, even though there is this sort of   unavoidable ad hoc character to it, we are trying to make a judgment about the costs—from a   fiscal perspective, from a moral hazard perspective, and so on—of taking action versus the real   possibility in some cases that you might have very severe consequences for the financial system   and, therefore, for the economy of not taking action  Frankly, I am decidedly confused and very   September 16, 2008 74 of 108    muddled about this  I think it is very difficult to make strong, bright lines given that we don’t   have a structure that has been well communicated and well established for how to deal with these   conditions  I do think there is some chance—it is not yet large, but still some chance—that we   will in fact see a much bigger intervention at the fiscal level  One is tempted to argue that by   doing more earlier you can avoid even more later, but of course that is all contingent and   uncertain  So we will collectively do our best to deal with these very stressful financial   conditions, which I don’t think will be calm for some time   With respect to inflation, I accept the many caveats around the table  I have to say that I   think, on net, inflation pressures are less worrisome now  The last two meetings have been very   positive in that respect  The declines in energy and commodity prices are quite substantial    Natural gas, for example, has reversed all of its gains of the year  Steel scrap is down 40 percent   in two months  We are seeing many other indications that commodity prices really have come   down quite a bit  The dollar’s increase is also quite striking, and we have talked about wages,   TIPS, and other factors  So I think overall I see at least the near-term inflation risk as   considerably reduced  I do agree, though, with the points that were made that we may well see   pressure on core inflation for a while longer, despite this morning’s reasonably benign number    The increases in commodity costs, although they have been partially reversed, have not been   entirely reversed  Certainly over the last year to year and a half there is still a net substantial   increase, which will show up as firms begin to pass through those costs   It is also the case, of course, that we have seen a very, very sharp movement in   commodity prices and the dollar  Therefore, there is no logical reason why that couldn’t be   reversed  Clearly, one problem we face is that the uncertainty about forecasting commodity   prices is so large that it makes our forecasting exercises extraordinarily uncertain and means that   September 16, 2008 75 of 108    we need to be somewhat more careful than we otherwise would be if we were back in the days of   the Texas Railroad Commission, when we knew the price of oil six months in advance  We   don’t have that privilege anymore  So I think core inflation may be elevated for a while  It may   take a while for inflation to moderate  Everything I say is contingent on the dollar and   commodity trends not being strongly reversed  But if those things are not reversed, I think we   will see some improvement in inflation in the near term   I also agree with those who say that, when the time comes, we do need to be prompt at   removing accommodation  It is just as much a mistake to move too late and allow inflation, and   perhaps even financial imbalances, to grow as it is to move too early and be premature in terms   of assuming a recovery  I think that is a very difficult challenge for us going forward, and I   acknowledge the importance of that, which a number of people have noted   So that is a quick summary of my views  Let me just turn briefly, then, to policy  Do we   have the statement?  Let me just preview  I talked with Governor Warsh, and he gave me now   during the break some of those suggestions he made  As they fit closely with other things that   people said around the table, we have made a version here that incorporates them  I’ll discuss   that in just a minute3     First, as a number of people have said, let me just say that I thought the memo that the   staff prepared over the intermeeting period was extraordinarily helpful  We have been debating   around the table for quite a while what the right indicator of monetary policy is  Is it the federal   funds rate?  Is it some measure of financial stress?  Or what is it?  I think the only answer is that   the right measure is contingent on a model  As President Lacker and President Plosser pointed   out, you have to have a model and a forecasting mechanism to think about where the interest rate   is that best achieves your objectives  It was a very useful exercise to find out, at least to some                                                    3 The statement referred to here is appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   September 16, 2008 76 of 108    extent, how the decline in the funds rate that we have put into place is motivated  In particular,   the financial conditions do appear to be important both directly and indirectly—directly via the   spreads and other observables that were put into the model and indirectly in terms of negative   residuals in spending equations and the like  The recession dynamics were also a big part of the   story  I hope that what this memo does for us—again, I think it’s extraordinarily helpful—is to   focus our debate better  As President Plosser pointed out, we really shouldn’t argue about the   level of the funds rate or the level of the spreads  We should think about the forecast and   whether our policy path is consistent with achieving our objectives over the forecast period  I   am sympathetic to the general view taken by the staff, which argues that those recession   dynamics and financial restraints are important, that we are looking at slow growth going   forward, and that inflation is likely to moderate  Based on those assumptions, I think that our   policy is looking actually pretty good  To my mind, our quick move early this year, which was   obviously very controversial and uncertain, was appropriate  Their analysis also suggests that   the amount of insurance that we have is perhaps limited, given that they take a risk-neutral kind   of modeling approach  Having said that, I think they have also clearly set out the conditions and   the framework in which we can debate going forward exactly where we should be going  To the   extent that those around the table disagree with the model or with the projection, then that is the   appropriate way, it seems to me, to address our policy situation  So, again, I do very much   appreciate that  It helped me think about the policy situation  As I said, I think our aggressive   approach earlier in the year is looking pretty good, particularly as inflation pressures have   seemed to moderate     Overall I believe that our current funds rate setting is appropriate, and I don’t really see   any reason to change  On the one hand, I think it would be inappropriate to increase rates at this   September 16, 2008 77 of 108    point  It is simply premature  We don’t have enough information  There is not enough pressure   on inflation at this juncture to do that  On the other hand, cutting rates would be a very big step   that would send a very strong signal about our views on the economy and about our intentions   going forward, and I think we should view that step as a very discrete thing rather than as a 25   basis point kind of thing  We should be very certain about that change before we undertake it   because I would be concerned, for example, about the implications for the dollar, commodity   prices, and the like  So it is a step we should take only if we are very confident that that is the   direction in which we want to go   Therefore my recommendation to the Committee—and I will open it up for comment in a   moment—is to keep the funds rate at its current level  I listened very carefully to the   conversation around the table in terms of the statement  I think it was President Lockhart,   President Stern, and Governor Warsh, among others, who talked about strengthening the   language on financial markets  So the draft statement that you have in front of you is an attempt   to make that change  It has two changes relative to existing alternative B  First, as Governor   Warsh suggested, it reverses the first two sentences and so focuses in the first sentence on   “Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened   further,” and then the rest of it is basically the same as it was  The other change, which is in the   last paragraph in the risk assessment, is pretty small, but it is probably worth considering  The   word “closely” has been added to suggest, obviously, that we understand that the situation is   changing rapidly and that we are carefully following conditions as they evolve  Kevin, we took   your word “market” there—what was the rationale for it?    Okay  So I think that’s useful, although I do note that, all   else being equal, there’s a slight barrier for making any change, and that one word is a change    President Fisher    All right  Let me open it up for any other comments on the   statement or the policy action  President Evans    Okay  We will decide  We will take a vote on it, if   necessary  President Lacker    I think it was “monitor closely”  Is that what it was?    Yes, “monitor closely”  Maybe you’re right    Okay  So the sentiment over here on this side is that   nobody thinks “market” is important  Let’s get rid of “market”  We’ll discuss “closely”    President Plosser    “Market” is already gone  All right  Other comments,   suggestions, or thoughts?  Governor Kroszner    The sad thing is that Governor Kroszner is right  We have   seventeen people debating over this word, and it actually does matter  Does anyone else want to   weigh in?  Okay  I think my sense is that there should be a barrier, a bit of a hurdle, to changing;   so I am leaning toward sticking with what we have  Would that be okay, Governor Warsh, do   you think?     Getting rid of “closely”    Well, it is not an analytical thing we are doing  We are just   watching closely    Yes  President Lacker    No, it’s an adverb     September 16, 2008 82 of 108     What we have done in the past is basically just use a new   phrase      Is that better?  President Evans    No, you’re right  But there is another issue, which I think is   the thing we’re concerned about and which motivates the change in alternative B, paragraph 2    We don’t want the world to feel that we are not awake, that we are not paying attention  We   know that very unusual things are going on in the financial markets; and we are prepared, maybe   not through monetary policy but through whatever mechanism is necessary, to address that    Other comments?  President Plosser    Any other comments?  All right  Let me just ask for a straw   vote “closely,” no “closely,” or “carefully”  Do we want “carefully”?  All right  Is “carefully”   more acceptable to those who are concerned?   MRKOHN  It’s less of a code word  The intention was to loosen it up a bit but not   revert to those code words that nearly promise intermeeting action    The semiotics class will begin as soon as the—[Laughter]    All right  “Carefully”—is that okay?  I’m seeing nodding  All right?  Governor Warsh?    All right  So we are changing the last part of that sentence    We are striking the word “market” and changing “closely” to “carefully”  Any other comments   or thoughts on the substance, sizzle, or marketing?  Or as Rick would say, “moychandising”—  but he’s not here  [Laughter]  All right  If not, Ms Danker    Thank you  The next meeting is October 28 and 29  Lunch   will be available in the anteroom  While we have lunch, Laricke Blanchard will provide us with   an update on congressional developments  Thank you all very much  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   September 16, 2008 85 of 108     "
8547,2008-09-29,BERNANKE,"  Thank you  Good morning, everybody  Thank you as always   for your flexibility and meeting on short notice—particularly to Janet  How are you feeling today,   Janet?    I have three topics to raise with you today  First, financial   market conditions, as you know, remain quite strained, and in response to that we are proposing   some additional liquidity measures  Mostly this is informational  However, we are proposing to   increase the swap lines fairly significantly, and although you have authorized the Foreign Currency   Subcommittee to take those actions, we thought that, given the size of the change, it would be   worthwhile to bring this back to you for your attention and your vote just to get the Committee’s   agreement on this issue  The second issue is Wachovia  As you may have heard, Wachovia was   purchased, or there’s a plan to purchase, by Citigroup this morning  To facilitate that purchase, the   Board invoked the systemic risk exception, which has not been done before  So we want to give   you a chance to catch up on what’s going on there  Then third, we want to talk a bit about interest   on reserves, which will be provided in the Paulson financial rescue bill, which is supposed to be up   for a vote on Wednesday  I just want to brief you on what we’re planning in that regard  So let me   start by turning to Bill Dudley in New York  Bill, if you could give us a brief overview of the   financial conditions that motivate these actions, review the actions we’re proposing, and take Q&A,   that would be very helpful    Okay  So just to clarify, we’ll be asking you for the following   two actions after the question-and-answer period  One is, again, that although the Foreign Currency   Subcommittee was authorized to increase swaps, because we are essentially doubling the   outstanding swap lines, we would like to go back to the Committee for a vote, or to hear your views,   to get approval for those swap lines, which pending approval, we plan to announce shortly, right?    Yes, very shortly  The other thing, which also requires a vote,   is that, in order to do three-month swaps over year-end, some of the three-month swaps would go   beyond January 30  So we’re asking for the extension not for all programs but only for the swap   lines to April 30  Is that right?    So that’s the second request—to extend the swap line   authorizations to April 30 of next year  With those two points in mind, are there any questions for   Bill?  President Plosser    The issue of unusual and exigent is not coming up here   because we’re not dealing with any section 13(3) lending today  President Evans    Of course, for the balance sheet—and we’ll discuss that also   with interest on reserves—it has the benefit of having zero credit risk because the other central   banks are our counterparties  President Evans, did you have another comment?      Other questions for Bill?  If there are no questions, since Bill   has to go and get ready for the announcement—sorry, President Plosser    With the anticipated passage of the fiscal plan, a lot of our   intellectual talents are going to be harnessed trying to support the Treasury in thinking about their   auctions and other strategies that they’re going to use  The Board, New York, and others have been   working very closely with the Treasury staff  Other questions?  President Lacker, do you have a   question?      They have already put in place a program that insures deposits   that were there before a fixed date  In other words, new deposits are not protected  They made that   change because they were generating runs from banks into money market mutual funds and the   banks were complaining   September 29, 2008 8 of 16     Other questions, comments?  Let me ask  Scott, are you   prepared to state the resolutions we would like?  Brian?  Anyone?  I’d like to note for the record that   all three of the staff briefers today—Bill, Brian, and Scott—worked all night last night  So we have   dedicated employees here in the System  Brian    He has that  Okay  So there’s a motion  Any further   questions or comments?  If there’s no objection, may I take a vote now?  Debbie    Thank you very much  I’m going to excuse Bill if he wants to   go  There he goes  [Laughter]  All right  Let me turn now to the second item, which is a briefing   by Scott Alvarez, who as I said worked all night on the Wachovia situation  If President Lacker   would like to add anything, he is certainly welcome to do so  Scott   September 29, 2008 10 of 16     Are there questions for Scott?  President Lacker, would you   like to add anything?   September 29, 2008 11 of 16     Thank you very much  We’ll take questions for either Scott or   Jeff  President Plosser, I think you were first   September 29, 2008 12 of 16     President Fisher    Well, let me just add that I share your concern  There is an   increasing concentration  On the other hand, you could also view it as part of a process of   consolidation as well, as we have reduced the number of independent investment banks, for   example  But I agree with that  We have been very constrained throughout this entire crisis, as you   know, by the existing facilities for dealing with failing institutions and mergers being one of the   only tools we have  Going forward, I think there is some hope in the near term under the new   TARP, which would allow resolutions using capital injections basically without necessarily doing a   merger  Then subsequently, I think it’s very important, as we look toward restructuring our   financial regulatory system, to develop good resolution mechanisms and to think about the issues of   concentration and too big to fail  So I take your point, basically    Any other questions for Scott or for Jeff?  All right  If not, let   me turn to our last item on the agenda, which is interest on reserves  The TARP legislation provides   for that, and Brian will talk a bit about how we might use that    Thanks, Brian  Are there questions for Brian?  President   Lacker    Other questions for Brian?  Jeff, did you have another   question?  No  Okay  Any other comments or issues?  If not, thank you very much, again, for the   short notice, and we’ll obviously keep you well briefed, and we hope you’ll do the same for us    Good morning   END OF MEETING      September 29, 2008 16 of 16     "
8558,2008-10-07,BERNANKE,"  All right  Let’s begin  Thank you all for joining this meeting    We’re having a lot of meetings off the regular cycle  I think it’s just a sign of the extraordinary   times that we’re currently living through  The only agenda item for this meeting is the discussion of   a proposed coordinated action with five other major central banks  It will be a six-bank coordinated   action  Besides ourselves, the other banks involved are the European Central Bank, the Bank of   England, and the Bank of Canada, and since I spoke to you, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank   of Sweden have joined in this collective action  Japan has its own issues and will not be cutting but   will be expressing support and has been consulted  The plan, conditional on our approval, would be   for all six major central banks to cut policy rates by 50 basis points jointly and announce tomorrow   at 700 am Eastern time before the US markets open  There are two statements  There’s a short   joint statement by all of the central banks, which has been negotiated  I don’t know if you have   access to it  I will read it to you shortly, if necessary  Then it is proposed that we have our own   short statement, which I know has been circulated and which you should have in front of you     So that’s the issue we’re here to discuss  My proposal would be, first, to begin with some   short briefings by the staff  Bill Dudley in New York, Larry Slifman here at the Board, and Nathan   Sheets here at the Board would just give us a short update on what’s transpiring in the financial   markets and the broader economy  We will have an opportunity for Q&A with the staff  I’d then   like to introduce the subject briefly and just talk about the rationale, and the floor will be open for   your comments on the action, on the economy, and on the statement, as you see fit  So without   further ado, let me turn to Bill Dudley  Bill, are you there?    We’ll take any questions or comments at this point  Since Bill   has covered the financial area, are there any questions for him?  President Lacker    Other questions for Bill?  President Lockhart     All right  Let’s go on now and hear from Larry Slifman and   Nathan Sheets   October 7, 2008 7 of 30     Are there questions for Larry or for Nathan?  Governor Kohn    President Fisher    Thank you  Other questions for Nathan or Larry?  President   Evans    Bill, do you want to tackle that?    Other questions?  Vice Chairman Geithner    Certainly    Thank you  Other questions?  All right  If not, let me just say   a few words  I will be brief  It’s more than obvious that we have an extraordinary situation  It is   not a single market  It’s not like the 1987 stock market crash or the 1970 commercial paper crisis    Virtually all the markets—particularly the credit markets—are not functioning or are in extreme   stress  It’s really an extraordinary situation, and I think everyone can agree that it’s creating   enormous risks for the global economy   What to do about it?  The exchange we just had suggests that we may have disagreements   about the benefits of liquidity provision  I personally think that it has been helpful  But I think we   can agree that it is obviously not a panacea because, as the Vice Chairman points out, it doesn’t   address the underlying capital issues  That suggests that the right solutions probably have a   significant fiscal element to them  However, one feature of the last few days is how striking, how   uncoordinated, and how erratic some of the fiscal approaches have been—particularly in Europe,   where there has been a remarkable lack of coordination in the European Union  So the fiscal   October 7, 2008 12 of 30    solutions are coming, but they’re not there yet, and it is going to be a while  We need greater clarity   on those issues  We had a meeting today on the Treasury’s authority, and they are hoping in the   next few weeks to begin to provide greater clarity, which will be very helpful  But I think that, if we   can find some kind of bridge, it would be helpful, and that’s what this meeting is about   Although the financial markets are the dramatic element of the situation, I think we can   make a case for easing policy today on the macro outlook, as given by Larry and Nathan  I won’t   go into detail  I think it’s fairly clear  You look first at inflation, and you see the remarkable decline   in commodity prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and the decline in breakevens  The 10-year   breakeven this morning was about 135  Of course, that could be a noisy indicator, but certainly it’s   quite low  I would say that, in terms of activity and the relation to inflation, we don’t have to rely   on any flat Phillips curves here  We have a global slowdown, and the implications for commodity   prices are first order for our inflation forecast  It is never safe to declare inflation under complete   control, and I certainly don’t claim that no risks are there; but clearly the outlook for inflation is not   looking nearly so threatening as it may have in the past   On the economic growth side, what is particularly worrisome to me is that, before this latest   upsurge in financial stress, we had already seen deceleration in growth, including the declines, for   example, in consumer spending  Everyone I know who has looked at it—outside forecasters and   the Greenbook producers here at the Board—believes that the financial stress we are seeing now is   going to have a significant additional effect on growth  Larry gave some estimates of   unemployment above 7 percent for a couple of years  So even putting aside the extraordinary   conditions in financial markets, I think the macro outlook has shifted decisively toward output risks   and away from inflation risks, and on that basis, I think that a policy move is justified   October 7, 2008 13 of 30    I should say that this comes as a surprise to me  I very much expected that we could stay at   2 percent for a long time, and then when the economy began to recover, we could begin to   normalize interest rates  But clearly things have gone off in a direction that is quite worrisome    One could legitimately ask questions about the transmission mechanism under these conditions, and   I think those are good questions  But first it seems to me that we can, to some extent, offset costs of   credit through our actions, even if spreads are wide  Second, to the extent that the global   coordination creates some more optimism about the future of the global economy, we may see some   improvements in credit spreads  We may not, but it seems to me that this is the right direction in   which to go   Despite everything that’s happening, I might not be bringing this to you at this point, except   that we have the opportunity to move jointly with five other major central banks, and I think the   coordination and cooperation is a very important element of this proposal  First of all, again, I   mentioned before the lurching and the lack of coordination among fiscal authorities and other   governments  I think it would be extraordinarily helpful to confidence to show that the world   central banks are working closely together, have a similar view of global economic conditions, and   are willing to take strong actions to address those conditions  I think that there is a multiplier effect,   if you will  Our move, along with these other moves, will have a stronger effect on the global   economy and on the US economy than our acting alone  Moving together has other benefits  Just   to note one, we can have less concern about the dollar if we’re all moving together and less concern   about inflation expectations given that all the banks are moving and all see the same problem   There is a tactical issue  I think the real key to this is actually the European Central Bank    They have had some difficulty coming to the realization that Europe would be under a great deal of   stress and was not going to be decoupled from the United States  They made an important   October 7, 2008 14 of 30    rhetorical step at their last meeting to open the way for a potential cut, but I think that this   coordinated action gives them an opportunity to get out of the corner into which they are somewhat   painted and their move will have a big impact on global expectations about policy responsiveness    So, again, I think the coordination is a very important part of this   I want to say once again that I don’t think that monetary policy is going to solve this   problem  I don’t think liquidity policy is going to solve this problem  I think the only way out of   this is fiscal and perhaps some regulatory and other related policies  But we don’t have that yet    We’re working toward that  We are in a very serious situation  So it seems to me that there is a   case for moving now in an attempt to provide some reassurance—it may or may not do so—but in   any case, to try to do what we can to make a bridge toward the broader approach to the crisis   So that’s my recommendation, that we join the other central banks in a 50 basis point move   before markets open tomorrow morning  If we proceed in that direction, there are, as I mentioned,   two statements  Brian, do the Presidents have the joint statement?    All right  I’m going to read the joint statement by central   banks, which has been negotiated with the other central banks  So we really can’t edit this one   because of the negotiations that have already taken place  However, you should already have the   FOMC statement  So here’s the joint statement by central banks   “Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close   consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to   reduce strains in financial markets  Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of   countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices  Inflation   expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability  The recent intensification of   October 7, 2008 15 of 30    the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the   upside risks to price stability  Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted    Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal   Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in   policy interest rates  The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions”    So that would be the joint statement  Then we would issue separately on our website the   FOMC statement  Let me stop there and open the floor for comments on the action, on the general   situation, on the statement, or whatever you would like to talk about  Would anyone like to speak?    President Yellen    Thank you  Vice Chairman Geithner, you had a two-hander?    Somebody send me a photograph    I don’t know where to go from there  [Laughter]  Are there   any other comments?  President Plosser    To respond to your question, I am not planning any particular   action at the regular meeting at this point or any particular recommendation  Obviously, given how   quickly things are changing, the world could be very different then from the way it is now  I think   this is a good opportunity to move with the other central banks, as you mentioned   Thinking about funds rate paths, we all have to be aware that we are, in fact, now at a very   low level, and there are serious questions about the functioning of markets and the economy at   extraordinary low levels of interest rates  So that constraint is going to be an issue, and it will affect   our decision as we think about it  But I feel rather unconfident about predicting the path of rates six   months in the future because I’m not quite sure what is going to happen tomorrow at this point  Let   me turn to President Stern    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lockhart    President Lockhart, just again the structure of the   announcement  There will be two parts  The first part is joint from all of the central banks and, of   course, will focus on the coordinated aspects of this  The second part is specific to each central   bank reflecting on its own national situation  So, in fact, the common announcement will begin   with an emphasis on the coordination aspects of this move  President Lacker    Quoting Keynes, I see, Jeff  All right  President Pianalto    Thank you  Actually, going back to President Lacker and   President Plosser, President Lacker made the point about the joint statement  The joint statement   with respect to inflation says “the recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the   downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability”  I   would be content if the preference of others is to take out the word “materially” and just say “have   reduced the upside risks to inflation”  That would be perhaps more consistent, but I’m happy either   way  So that’s just a suggestion  Let me go on now to Bob Rasche   October 7, 2008 24 of 30     Go ahead    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Okay  Anyone else?  First Vice President Rasdall from   Kansas City    Thank you  I didn’t hear a clear sense on the word   “materially,” but if there’s not a strong view one way or the other, I guess I would suggest striking it   on the grounds that it’s a little more continuous with our previous communication and similar to the   common statement  Is there anyone who is concerned about that change?  President Plosser, did   you have a comment?    Okay Thank you  Anyone else?  If not, Ms Danker, can you   call the roll please?    Thank you  Thank you for a constructive discussion  Again, I   believe it is 700 am tomorrow for the release of the information  Brian has handed me a note   here  We’re going to be considering the request of Boston to reduce the discount rate by 50 basis   points  That’s the request that we have  All right  Thank you very much   END OF MEETING            October 7, 2008 30 of 30     "
8581,2008-10-28,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  We received requests from   members for more time at this meeting to discuss the economic situation and our policy   response  So as you know, we postponed the special presentations on inflation—my apologies to   the presenters  We will come back to that at the appropriate time   What we are going to do instead is to have three rounds of briefings today and tomorrow    We are going to start in the first round with Bill Dudley and his usual presentation on open   market operations, followed by Nathan Sheets on the swaps proposals that you have been   informed about, and then Bill Bassett will give a supplementary briefing on financial markets to   complete that round  Then we’ll have Q&A at that point  We will then turn to the economic   situation and hear from Norm Morin on the nonfinancial economy and Linda Kole on the   international economy and from Brian Madigan on our projections  Then we will have another   round of questions  Tomorrow at lunch, after the close of the formal meeting, we will have some   additional briefings on the TARP (troubled asset relief program), on the FDIC program, and on   the supervisory and regulatory implications of that  So we hope to make this a very informative   two days, and we hope to have plenty of interaction and conversation about our broad policy   response to these very difficult times  So let me start, then, by turning to Bill Dudley  Bill    Thank you, Bill  Nathan      October 28–29, 2008 9 of 206     Thank you  I’m going to open up in a minute to questions   for Bill, Nathan, and Bill  I want to say just three brief things about the emerging market swaps    First, we have been talking with these countries for some time, and I think when the   conversations began it was more of a preventive measure than a response to conditions  But the   EMEs are now at a flashpoint in the financial crisis, and as I think Linda Kole will probably   discuss, the urgency has increased, and the risks to the broader global economy are probably   higher than they were a few weeks ago  Second, with respect to the choice of four countries that   Nathan proposed—as he mentioned, we have talked to the Treasury and the State Department  I   spoke to Secretaries Paulson and Rice about this  There was an interesting confluence of   agreement that, if you are going to do this, these are the right four countries and we probably   shouldn’t do more, both from an economic perspective and a diplomatic perspective in the sense   that these are the countries that among the emerging markets are the most important from a   financial and economic point of view  Third, as I think Nathan also mentioned, the IMF is   planning to create a liquidity facility, which will be a low-conditionality facility available to a   broad range of countries  So there has been some discussion back and forth about the   relationship between this, if we do it, and the IMF facility  I had a conversation this morning   with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the IMF, and we agreed that the two facilities are   complementary—that ours would provide important additional resources to the total availability   of liquid resources for these countries  If we decide to take this step, we have agreed that   tomorrow, after the IMF board approves their facility, we would jointly announce these two   actions so that it would create an impression of cooperation and coordination between the   Federal Reserve and the IMF   October 28–29, 2008 16 of 206    So those are just a few additional pieces of information  I’m sure that you have plenty of   questions  Who is first?  No one?  Ah, President Fisher     Thank you  President Evans    Vice Chairman?     Vice Chairman    President Lacker, you had a two-hander?    The question is whether, in an unlikely but possible state of   the world in which they don’t want to pay us back, they could withdraw their Treasuries in   advance of defaulting      That would basically be a repo agreement, I guess    Governor Kohn      President Fisher, a two-hander?    Let me say just a couple of quick things  One is that this   would require renegotiating the whole thing from the beginning, and we would like, if possible,   to do this tomorrow with the IMF  The second point I would make is that we do have   October 28–29, 2008 23 of 206    considerable security, and we will be dispensing this—under strict conditions—in limited   tranches  I think we could monitor pretty well what was going on  But the point is well taken    President Plosser    Let me go to President Rosengren, who has been waiting   patiently    President Hoenig  I’m sorry, Nathan had an answer    Go ahead    President Hoenig, I’m sorry  Go ahead    But we have not encouraged that    Just to be clear    President Lockhart     Vice Chair    Very good  President Lacker    Vice Chair, did you have a two-hander?    President Plosser    President Plosser, a couple of things  The IMF has very   limited resources  They’re not remotely able to meet the needs of—    Well, the resources are very limited  The other thing is that   the staff asked for guidance on the limits here  I’d like to propose that, when we get to that point, to   ask the voters to suggest how they stand and what qualifications they might have  One thing that   you could do, for example, would be to say, “I do or do not support this, but if I do, I think a very   sharp line should be drawn at this point and be communicated that way”  The legislative history can   be part of this, and we can communicate to the staff how we feel about potential extensions    President Bullard    President Lockhart    President Plosser    If it’s okay, maybe we could just go ahead with the votes on   this  I’d like first to do the open market operations, which I hope are not too controversial  There   was no discussion of the New Zealand swap line  I’ll ask to see if there is any comment on that    Then on this issue, I’ll take a set of positions from the voters, if that’s okay  So let’s go back to   domestic open market operations    Without objection  The New Zealand swap    Is there any discussion or concern?  All right  Without   objection  Now, turning to the resolution on the EME swaps, in the interest of time I propose—and   I hope it is okay—to go through the voters and ask each one to state whether you are in favor or   opposed  You can say what you want and, if you want, whether you have some argument to make   or if you’re conditionally in favor—for example, I’m in favor if X or if we do Y—but just to get a   October 28–29, 2008 40 of 206    sense of where everybody is, and then we’ll decide what to do  Okay?  So let’s go down the roll   here  I’m in favor    I think we should be fairly tough at this point  Vice   Chairman    Governor Duke    President Fisher    Okay  That’s understood  Governor Kohn   October 28–29, 2008 41 of 206     Governor Kroszner    President Pianalto    Understood  President Plosser    President Stern    Governor Warsh    Okay  Thank you  So the sense I hear is that people are   willing to accept it, but the bar for additional countries should be high  We should bring any   country that we propose to add back to the FOMC for approval, and we will keep you well briefed   on the conditionality, the draws, and anything else that happens  Okay?  May I have a motion?    I am going to say without objection because we had a   unanimous view  Okay  Thank you  Let me go on next to the economic situation    Yes    Go ahead    President Plosser    Oh, yes    Learning theory in practice  Thank you very much  Very   helpful  All right  Mr Morin    Thank you  Before we go too long, we’ll take a coffee break,   but now let’s take some questions  President Lacker    May I?  You can answer, but let me just make a suggestion,   which is that there were a number of memos and studies done in 2003  I think we ought to look at   them, update them, and circulate them fairly soon  So we’ll do this in some detail; but by all means,   let’s hear the answer    I don’t think that’s right  I think the thrust of the elementary   approach to quantitative easing is the old Milton Friedman idea—that changing the composition of   money and other assets changes relative returns  So it’s a way to bring down returns on other assets   and create stimulus even if the policy rate is down to zero    Eventually, but through the aggregate demand mechanism    We should look at the Woodford thing, but I don’t think that’s   quite the right characterization of his view   October 28–29, 2008 59 of 206     We’re pretty close, yes    I don’t think that’s the right characterization, but I’d be happy   to talk about it off line  President Plosser    President Fisher    Not anymore  [Laughter]    Okay  Why don’t we take fifteen minutes for coffee, and   then we’ll do part of the go-round  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Well, why don’t we turn part of our dinner period to the go-  round  Let’s start with President Lockhart    Thank you  President Fisher    Well, I for one will certainly give my response to that at the   appropriate time, and we need to hear from everybody  But everyone is obviously free to talk   about whatever they want to talk about  President Yellen    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Rosengren    Nice job, Dave  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser    I have a question about the potential output view  So you   would also have to argue that the natural rate of unemployment is higher because of this    You think that’s plausible?  I mean, I understand why   productive capacity would be affected, but why do you—   October 28–29, 2008 85 of 206     But it rises because of the financial situation  I see    Employment fluctuates, but to get unemployment you need a   richer picture of matching, or something like that    President Stern    Okay  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  Well, it’s a little after 600 pm, a long afternoon    Why don’t we recess the meeting until tomorrow morning?  There’s a reception and a dinner up on   the terrace, which is for your convenience  There’s no business being conducted, and we’ll see you   in the morning  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]   October 28–29, 2008 92 of 206    October 29, 2008—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody   PARTICIPANTS  Good morning    We have some data this morning  Dave, would you like to   discuss this?    Does the resolution of the Boeing strike have any macro   implications?    Other questions for Dave?  Okay  If not, let’s continue with   our go-round  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Duke     President Fisher    President Lacker    Okay  Thank you  Let me try to summarize all that I heard   today and yesterday, and then I’ll try to add some new comments to that  The outlook for   economic growth appears to have deteriorated quite significantly since the last meeting  Data on   consumer spending, production, and employment had weakened more than expected even before   the recent intensification of the financial crisis  Over the past six weeks or so, however, financial   conditions have greatly worsened, and risk aversion has increased, despite actions here and   abroad to stabilize the banking system  Equity values have declined sharply amid conditions of   low liquidity and extraordinary volatility   Credit market conditions have improved modestly since the global actions to recapitalize   banks and guarantee their deposits, assisted also by additional central bank liquidity actions    However, in almost all credit markets, spreads remain much wider, maturities shorter, and   availability more constrained than was the case before the intensification of the crisis  Firms   face continued funding risk and rollover risk  Banks have probably not reserved sufficiently for   the credit losses to come, and hedge funds will be hitting their net asset value triggers in greater   numbers, forcing them to liquidate assets  The duration of future financial turmoil is hard to   judge, but it could be lengthy   The worst thing is that financial conditions appear already to have had a significant and   remarkably quick effect on activity and consumer and business expectations and plans  Most   Committee participants see us in or entering a recession and have marked down significantly   their expectations for near-term growth or for the pace of the recovery  The difficulty of   predicting the course of the crisis or its effects on the economy has also increased forecast   October 28–29, 2008 112 of 206    uncertainty  In particular, the ultimate effects of some major policy actions, such as the creation   of the TARP and the bank guarantee, are not yet known  Uncertainty about future policy actions,   as well as uncertainty about the economy, has affected behavior in markets and the broader   economy   Consumer spending has weakened considerably and probably fell sharply in the third   quarter, reflecting in part a recessionary psychology  Consumer durables, such as automobiles   and discretionary expenditures, have been particularly hard hit  This weakness reflects the same   set of negative influences on consumption that we have been seeing for a while, now   compounded by losses of equity wealth and confidence effects on prices, although lower oil   prices may provide some relief  The labor market continues to decline, with many firms   reporting that they are cutting back workers  The housing sector has not been noticeably worse   than expected, and reports are somewhat mixed  But on a national basis, the contraction is   continuing, and recent developments in the economy and credit markets are likely to have   adverse effects  Inventories of unsold new homes remain high, putting pressure on prices    Nonresidential construction continues at a moderate pace; but backlogs are falling, and the sector   is looking increasingly vulnerable to weakening fundamentals and tighter credit conditions    Whether a new fiscal stimulus package will be passed and to what extent such a package would   be helpful remain open questions  Manufacturing production has weakened significantly as have   expectations of demand, including export demand  Credit is becoming more of a problem for   many firms and their customers  Spending on equipment and software appears to have slowed,   reflecting greater pessimism and uncertainty  Falling commodity prices may reduce mining   activity and cool the boom in agriculture  On the plus side, firms are reporting fewer cost   pressures, and inventories do not appear excessive   October 28–29, 2008 113 of 206    Deterioration in global growth expectations has been marked  Industrial economies had   already shown signs of slowing, and they have been hit hard by recent financial developments    Emerging market economies, until recently evidently not much affected by the US slowdown,   have in recent weeks also been hit hard by the spreading financial crisis  Together with the   stronger dollar, these developments are likely to restrain future growth of US exports   Inflation risks have declined materially, reflecting the fall in the prices of energy and   other commodities, the stronger dollar, and the prospect of considerable economic slack  Firms   report much reduced pricing power and lower markups  Inflation expectations have come down,   both in the surveys and in the TIPS market, though it wasn’t noted—but I will note—that the   TIPS market is distorted by illiquidity and other problems there  Most participants see both   overall and core inflation moderating in the coming quarters toward levels consistent with price   stability, with some seeing a risk of undesirably low rates of inflation  Some note, however, that   financial dislocations affect aggregate supply as well as aggregate demand and may reduce the   extent to which slower growth damps inflation  So that’s just my sense  Any comments?    Additions?     Let me make just a few additional comments, none of which will be radically different   from what we have already discussed  I do think it is overwhelmingly clear that we are now in a   recession and that it is going to be a severe one  To give some sense of perspective, the postwar   record for duration is 16 months  If the NBER sets this experience as having begun early this   year, I think we have a reasonable chance to break that record  The largest increase from peak to   trough in unemployment rate was in 1981  It was 36 percentage points  Starting from   44 percent, I think we have a chance to come close to that number  Yesterday’s drop in   consumer confidence in one month from 61 to 38 shattered the previous low of 43 in December   October 28–29, 2008 114 of 206    1975  So I think we are talking about an episode here that could easily be among the largest   postwar recessions   We don’t know how things would have evolved without the developments in September,   but obviously we have to deal with that reality  It was just a few weeks ago that we were dealing   with what might have been a true systemic crisis, in the week leading up to the G-7 and IMF   meeting  I think it has been very fortunate that Europe, the United States, and other countries   have adopted vigorous responses to that, including bank capitalization, bank guarantees, and   other measures  That has been very important in calming the situation somewhat and reducing   the systemic aspects of investor concerns  That being said, concern about counterparties remains   very strong  Risk aversion is intense, spreads remain high, and I think that this has now become   really pervasive  It isn’t just a question of junk bonds and weak borrowers or weak credit   histories  The spreads on GSE debt, on high-grade corporate debt, and other areas have also   widened, leading to a very broad based tightening in credit conditions  So I think that, overall,   any reasonable reading of financial conditions suggests that the tightening of credit or financial   conditions in the last six weeks or so has been quite substantial and overwhelms the effects of   our coordinated rate cut   Now, normally you would expect to see a tightening of credit conditions affect the   economy with some lag  It takes time for people to borrow money and to use the money they   borrow to make expenditures  But compared with that prediction, we have instead seen a sudden   stop—a remarkable and very rapid effect on economic activity  It is possible this is due less to   the direct effects of credit availability and more to the psychological impact of these events  One   possible analogy is the 1980 Carter credit controls, when the government announced what   seemed to be a tightening of credit  There was a very sharp response in economic activity,   October 28–29, 2008 115 of 206    probably based more on expectations than on actual credit availability  Unfortunately, the credit   controls could be removed by government fiat; we are not able to do that today   One interesting development is that the labor market has not yet shown as much   weakness as one would expect  Unemployment insurance claims and other indicators do not yet   show a marked deterioration  I expect that we will see more deterioration of the labor market   Besides the intensification of the financial crisis that has markedly increased the   restrictiveness of financial conditions, I think the other very important development since our last   meeting has been the internationalization of the crisis  We had already seen weakening in   Europe before the most recent intensification, but it has become much more severe  There is   little doubt that the United Kingdom and Europe are in or about to enter recession  My sense is   that their monetary policy responses will be stronger than what the Greenbook anticipates  I   believe they will be very aggressive in responding to that   A new and particularly worrying development is the fact that the crisis has now spread   beyond the industrial countries to the emerging markets  The G-7 weekend was quite an   interesting one  It was a striking experience  I heard over and over again from the Indians, from   the Brazilians, and from all over the world that, until the middle of September we were fine, we   were not being much affected, we didn’t see much effect on our trade flows, and suddenly   everything changed; and now we are under severe stress  We are seeing tremendous outflows    Our currencies are plummeting  Commodity price declines are hurting many countries  I think   that is going to be a very significant development as we go forward     Just to give some data, in just a few weeks the EMBI spread, the emerging market   sovereign debt spread, went from 280 basis points to 850 basis points; and the emerging market   equity index has fallen about 40 percent since the last meeting  It is not obvious that these   October 28–29, 2008 116 of 206    changes were justified by economic fundamentals  Many of these countries are very well run   and had shown a lot of progress in their domestic policies and their domestic economies    Instead, I think they are suffering contagion from us mostly  Unfortunately, the implications of   this will be not only the usual trade and commodity price type of implications but also, and even   more important, financial implications  We are now seeing that the adverse feedback loop,   which we’ve been talking about for a long time in the United States, is becoming a global   phenomenon  In particular, European banks are very heavily exposed to emerging market debt    So we are going to see yet more of this interaction between the financial markets and the broader   economy, except at a global rather than a national level  These developments, obviously, are   very disturbing and don’t bode well for US growth or now for global growth  Somewhat   ironically, all of this deterioration in the global outlook has led the dollar to appreciate very   sharply, which is interesting to say the least  For us that obviously also has important   implications for inflation, and as Governor Kohn mentioned, it means that we will be less a   recipient of foreign strength and more a supporter of foreign weakness than we have been until   now   On inflation, I know there is some discomfort in talking about a 1 percent policy rate and   promising to keep it low for a protracted period—and all those things  We have seen this movie   before, and I think we all have to recognize the importance of watching the implications of that   for our economy and for asset prices and to take quite seriously the responsibility for removing   accommodation in a timely fashion once the crisis has begun to moderate  That being said, I   don’t think that there is really any case in the near term to be worrying very much about   inflation—or, perhaps even less so, the dollar—as we look at our policy  Pricing power is   evaporating  And given what is happening in the global economy, I don’t see a commodity price   October 28–29, 2008 117 of 206    boom any time soon, although I think as the economies do begin to recover in the next year or so   that we might see some recovery in commodity prices   So I think that, as everyone has indicated, this is a very worrisome situation  I don’t think   we have control of it  I don’t think we know what the bottom is, so we have to remain very   flexible and very open to new initiatives as they become necessary  There has been some   comparison of this to the Japanese situation  I’m beginning to wonder if that might not be a   good outcome  The advantage of the Japanese was, first of all, that they were isolated  The rest   of the world was doing okay, and they were able to draw strength from their exports and the rest   of the global economy  Although they had very slow growth, they never really had a deep   recession or big increases in unemployment  I think we are looking at perhaps a much sharper   episode, and our challenge will be to make sure that it doesn’t persist longer   I do think that one lesson of both Japan and the 1930s as well as other experiences is that   passivity is not a good answer  We do have to continue to be aggressive  We have to continue to   look for solutions  Some of them are not going to work  Some of them are going to add to   uncertainty  I recognize that critique  I realize it’s a valid critique  But I don’t think that this is   going to be a self-correcting thing anytime soon  I think we are going to have to continue to   provide support of all kinds to the economy  Let me stop there and, unless there is any question   or comment, ask Brian to introduce the policy round    Thank you  Questions for Brian?  All right  If there are no   questions, why don’t we begin our go-round  President Lockhart   October 28–29, 2008 120 of 206     Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Kohn     Thank you  President Rosengren    Okay  Thank you  President Evans    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Bullard, you have a handout?    Everybody have a copy?  President Bullard    Thank you  Let’s see, President Fisher    President Fisher, I promised you answers, and I will deliver   them  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    Just to support what you said, we are obviously still trying   to find our way in how to use this in the new regime with the excess reserves interest rate  It is   possible that at some point we might decide to target that interest rate  That might be the most   straightforward thing to do  But as I understand it—and, in fact, I’m quite confident—the   intention of the staff and the Board is to try to figure out what the relationship is between the   excess reserves interest rate and the federal funds rate as normally measured  If we can establish   a reliable relationship, then we should try to—and we will—use that to hit the target  It’s   coming close to it  We certainly are not trying intentionally to come under the target  If that   fails, then we will go to what you are suggesting, which is effectively what I’m saying, and make   them the same  Then, effectively, there is no difference between targeting the interest rate on   excess reserves and targeting the federal funds rate  We are certainly open to that, and there is   October 28–29, 2008 139 of 206    no intention to do anything other than to try to figure out a way to take the FOMC’s decision and   put it into practice in the money markets  President Stern    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  President Plosser    Okay  Thank you  Let me just offer some thoughts that may   be somewhat more expansive than usual in response to the questions that have been raised  Some of   this is extemporaneous, so you’ll have to bear with me  Let me first talk about the strategy we   pursued thus far and where we are and then think about where we might go as a country as well as   an institution going forward     Without going through all of the familiar discussion about how the crisis began, what the   sources of it were, I think that the Federal Reserve’s responses are essentially three  First, we were   relatively early and aggressive in our monetary policy easing, particularly compared with other   countries  Second, we have been creative and expansive in our use of liquidity tools, including a   October 28–29, 2008 147 of 206    wide variety of lending programs  Third, we have used our available, but not always adequate, tools   to try to stabilize systemically critical failing institutions and to try to mitigate systemic risk   Without sounding too defensive, I will try to argue that I think on all three of these we have   been more or less in the right direction  First, on the early and aggressive monetary policy easing,   obviously there was a lot of concern—a lot expressed abroad that we were going to create a   stagflationary 1970s type of situation and that we were going to destroy the dollar and its role as an   international currency  Our response essentially was that we thought that the increases in   commodity prices were mostly a relative price change induced by changes in real demand for   commodities and in the supply of commodities across the globe and that, at some point, those   commodity price increases would stabilize, which would lead to a moderation of the inflationary   effects and concerns  It took longer than we had expected; but once it began, it was more   pronounced than we had expected  Inflation has not become the problem that was anticipated by   many early on, and the dollar, of course, is now stronger than it was before we began our cutting of   interest rates  So in retrospect, I think our monetary policy, although not perfect certainly—and our   communication was not always perfect—broadly speaking was appropriate given what has turned   out to be a very severe economic situation   Liquidity expansion also received some criticism early on  There was a view that this was   inducing moral hazard  There was also some question of whether this was an effective approach    We were helped in this respect by the fact that the ECB joined us very early in this type of   aggressive policy  I don’t know the counterfactual  It has obviously not solved all of the problems    But I think there’s a strong perception in the markets and in the general public that these actions   have been supportive, and they helped mitigate the effects of the crisis on the functioning of the   financial system  So I feel comfortable also with that approach   October 28–29, 2008 148 of 206    The attempts to stabilize failing systemically critical institutions, beginning with Bear   Stearns, have obviously been very controversial  There have been criticisms from the right and   from the left  From the right, the initial criticism was that we have no business interfering with the   market process  We should let them fail  The market will take care of it  What are we doing?  We   heard this as recently as Jackson Hole  I never took this seriously  I just don’t believe that you can   allow systemically critical institutions to fail in the middle of financial crises and expect it to be not   a problem  I don’t want to get into the issue about the inconsistency  It’s true that we treated senior   debt differently between Fannie and Freddie and WaMu and Wachovia, but I don’t think that that is   the reason we are having the financial crisis we’re having  I think there was a panic brought about   by the underlying concerns about the solvency of our financial institutions  That panic essentially   turned into a run  Companies like Wachovia that had adequate Basel capital faced a run on their   deposits, which was self-fulfilling  The investment banks essentially faced runs  We did our best to   stabilize them, but I think that it was that run, that panic, and then the impact the panic had on these   major institutions that was the source of the intensification of financial crisis  So I don’t buy the   argument that we should stay out of the business of protecting the financial system, and I think that   the major factor was, in fact, the panic that was generated by the underlying uncertainties and the   effect that had on critical institutions   Also more recently we have heard more of a critique from the left, which is, What in the   heck were you guys doing letting Lehman fail?  This is interesting given that the critique had been   the other one for quite a while  I think that critique is unfair at a narrow level in that, first, Lehman   was a symptom as well as a cause of the recent crisis and, second, the Fed and the Treasury simply   had no tools to address both Lehman and the other companies that were under stress at that time  I   think that criticism is appropriate, though, as directed toward the United States as a whole  We did   October 28–29, 2008 149 of 206    not have—as the Europeans have or as we have FDICIA for banks—a system that was set up to   allow a reasonable and responsible orderly resolution of nonbank systemically critical institutions  I   think we now have made a lot of progress there  The TARP will provide a good interim solution  It   is very important that in the future we address the too-big-to-fail problem that we have, that we find   ways to reduce that problem, and that we find ways to deal systematically with firms that are in   crisis  So given the fog of war—which has, of course, been intense going back for more than a   year—I would defend what we’ve done in terms of the general direction, acknowledging that   execution is not always perfect and that communication is not always perfect   Now, what about the future?  History suggests that, whenever a financial crisis becomes   sufficiently severe, ultimately the only solution is a fiscal solution, and we will have a fiscal   solution  There are two possibilities  One is that the financial system will muddle through, in which   case the fiscal solution will be of the sort we’ve already seen  injections of capital, support for   critical firms, support for the credit markets in general; Keynesian-style demand support  That’s   one possibility  I hope that’s where we’re going to be  In my own testimony, I argued that we   should try to focus whatever stimulus we have in solving the underlying problems rather than   simply handing out money and that we could do that, again, by addressing credit markets  I would   add, foreclosure, homeownership, and some of those issues as well  So I hope that’s where the   fiscal policy will be  I hope that will take the lead from us going forward  Obviously, we’ll have to   continue to play a supporting role in a lot of different ways     The other possibility, of course, is that things get much worse and that we are in the same   situation as Sweden or Japan, in which case a massive recapitalization of the banking system will be   necessary  That will eventually happen, but I just note that, in all of these fiscal dynamics, there is a   political economy overlay  You have to get to the point that it is not only the right policy to induce   October 28–29, 2008 150 of 206    fiscal support but also that it is politically possible  That’s one reason that I think the TARP was not   possible before the most recent period  In fact, it was barely possible recently  So, again, I believe   that fiscal policy will have to be a critical part of the solution going forward     Another part that we should not forget about is the international response, which is now just   beginning really to become serious  The responses after the G7 weekend on banks and bank   guarantees were important and suggested a commitment by other countries to stabilize the system    That’s very important  I think we will see aggressive monetary policy going forward, and I think   we’ll see increasingly aggressive fiscal policy in other countries because they recognize that the   decoupling is no longer a realistic story  So that’s going to be important as well   With respect to the Federal Reserve, just generally speaking—and I’ll come back to the   specific recommendation for today—again, I think that our liquidity provision has been   constructive  It has allowed the use of our balance sheet to help push in the deleveraging process   that’s been going on now for more than a year  My guess is it will probably expand some more, but   I don’t see it expanding a lot more, if for no other reason than we are reaching the limits of our   operational capacity as well as balance sheet capacity  I think we have been reasonably successful   in staying on the side of liquidity provision and not straying into credit or taking credit risk  I want   to stay on that side of the line both for legal reasons and because that’s the way monetary policy and   lender-of-last-resort policy are supposed to work  Again, I hope that the fiscal interventions will   now be able to take away some of these responsibilities from us, but we’ll have to see how they play   out   I confess that I hear President Plosser’s concerns about reversing these programs  I   recognize that it’s something we’ll have to do carefully  But I just don’t see it as being something   that will be a huge problem if the economy begins to recover and credit markets begin to function   October 28–29, 2008 151 of 206    more normally  I think we’ll be able to do it  Japan was able to get out the quantitative easing   without too much difficulty  But I acknowledge the point that it is something we’re going to have to   plan for and think about   On monetary policy, I think it is important for us to be responsive  Even if we stipulate for   the moment that the interest rate changes we might make today have a minimal effect on the cost of   capital—and I don’t necessarily agree with that, but let me stipulate it—there is still the importance   of the signaling and what we’re trying to tell the markets about what we plan to do in the future    Frankly, I don’t think that we should try to signal that we are going to stand pat, that we are   reluctant or refuse to move lower  We have to be prepared to move as low as makes sense  By that   I mean in part that there are institutional factors that affect the efficacy of monetary policy at very   low interest rates  We’re all aware of that  I asked yesterday, and I’ll ask again, for the staff to go   back to the 2003 work, to update it, and to think it through and help us understand what I would call   the effective zero  What is the real zero?  Is it zero?  Is it 50 basis points?  Is it 75 basis points?  We   have to recognize that if we do go to literal zero, it would have very substantial effects on a number   of financial markets, and we would have to ask ourselves whether the benefits from that are worth   the dislocations  The Japanese thought they were, and for example, they did shut down the   interbank market for a long time  Maybe doing it is worth that  Those are decisions that we need to   make before the next meeting, and we will have opportunities to talk about this together and in   public as well  But I do think that monetary policy needs to be proactive and to continue to be part   of the solution here going forward   What about today’s action?  I essentially accept the general change in outlook as proposed   by the Greenbook  Since our last meeting there has been an effective tightening in financial   conditions, which has overwhelmed the 50 basis point cut that we did with the other central banks    October 28–29, 2008 152 of 206    The outlook has become much worse  So it is important for us to act aggressively and to signal   essentially that we’re willing to do whatever is necessary to support the recovery of this economy    There has been a lot of talk about confidence  I think the best thing we can do for confidence is to   say that we’re going to do whatever it takes, even if it involves extraordinary actions, to get this   economy back onto a path where it can begin to grow in a reasonable way again  Signaling   coyness, being cute, is not a safe strategy right now  We just need to be straightforward and say that   we’re going to do what it takes  In my view, just to be specific, 50 basis points is the right step   today   Now, a number of concerns and objections have been raised  Let me address just a few of   them  One is President Bullard’s very interesting presentation on the inflation trap, and intuitively   it’s clear that, for a given real interest rate, you can have an equilibrium at which you have a high   nominal rate and a high expected inflation rate or you can have a low nominal rate and deflation    Both of those things are possible  That was the trap that Japan got into  We obviously want to   avoid the deflation trap  The question is, How do you avoid it?  As far as I can see—obviously we   can get further into this—the best two ways to avoid it are, first, as President Lacker suggested,   reaffirm our commitment to price stability defined as 1½ to 2 percent or whatever our Committee’s   general view is  We’re going to try to do that with our projections and potentially with the trial   projection that we’re doing, and I think we can continue to strengthen our commitment to   maintaining a positive inflation rate  The other thing, in terms of the dynamics, is to be aggressive   in trying to avoid getting to a deflationary situation, where those expectations move in that direction    I don’t think deflation expectations will arise spontaneously because we’re cutting interest rates  I   think they’ll arise because the economy is expected to be extremely weak, and anything we can do   to eliminate that expectation in my view would be helpful    October 28–29, 2008 153 of 206    The second objection I’ve heard is the question of whether or not these actions are effective    I think they are effective  Maybe they’re not as effective as under normal circumstances, but let me   put it to you this way  If we cut 50 basis points today and the LIBOR–OIS spread rises 50 basis   points tomorrow, I will accept that there’s a problem  But if the LIBOR spread doesn’t move much   and the overall LIBOR drops 50 basis points, then I think that we’re having an effect  If you look at   LIBOR over the past year, you’ll see a dramatic decline even though the spreads have widened  I   don’t think you can argue that we’re not having any effect  To the extent that we’re having a muted   effect, you can just as well argue that we should be more aggressive because you need to do more to   get the same impact  So I understand those concerns, and I reiterate, responding to Governor Duke   and others, that as we get very low, there are side effects on certain institutions and financial   markets  We need to understand those, and that’s part of our decision process  But I don’t think it’s   the case that monetary policy has zero impact   The third argument I’ve heard is the “keep the power dry” argument  Unless you think that   movements in the rate are entirely psychological in their effect, I don’t think that that’s a strong   argument in this particular circumstance  Again, we analyzed this quite a bit in the 2003 episode,   and the general outcome from the literature and from simulations done by our own staff—Dave   Reifschneider, John Williams, and others have published research on this—is that the best way to   avoid the zero bound is to be more aggressive than normal to try to avoid the accumulation of   weakness and try to avoid getting into that trap  So more-preemptive strategies are, in fact,   consistent with what we’ve done for the last year   My recommendation for today is 50 basis points and the language in alternative A  I do   think that it will be at least moderately beneficial both in terms of psychology and in terms of   reducing the cost of funding and giving some additional support to funding markets  I hope that in   October 28–29, 2008 154 of 206    these remarks, which again are somewhat extemporaneous, I have addressed to some extent the   future steps  We ought, again, to think very hard in the next six weeks about what the real zero is   and what the implications are of going below, say, 75 basis points  Then we ought to make a   determination, and it may be that we can sit still in December  It may be that things improve quite a   bit in the markets, for example  It’s possible  One advantage of doing 50 today is that we almost   certainly will not have to do anything intermeeting because we will have done this significant step   today  So in December we’ll be able to look at the situation  We may be able to do little or   nothing—it is possible  But if we decide that further action is needed, at that point we should be   prepared to decide what the regime is going to be, how far we’re going to go, and what the effective   zero is, and I think that we shouldn’t hesitate to do that if that’s what the situation calls for  So I   think there is a way forward  I understand the need to withdraw all these policy actions at an   appropriate time  But I don’t think that focusing on the near term for the moment is at all   inconsistent with the fact that at some point these things will have to be reversed  So, any further   questions or comments?  President Fisher    Thank you  Other questions?  President Plosser    I think there’s no problem doing that  I can do that  That is   not a problem  President Lacker    Vice Chairman    President Plosser    Okay  Other comments?  Would you call the roll, please,   Debbie?    All right  I’ll need the governors to join me in my office for   just a moment  Everyone else, let’s all take a twenty-minute coffee break  When we come back,   maybe we can start at that point with your briefing, David, on the TARP, and around 1215 we’ll   break and get lunch and hear the end of the briefing, if that all works for everybody    We should be done by 100    It’s only a briefing, not a meeting, once we come back  Okay    A twenty-minute break now and then we’ll have a briefing and lunch   [Recess]    Well, let me officially get to the point of adjourning the   FOMC meeting just by first noting that the next meeting is Tuesday, December 16  Put that on your   calendar    I’d like to remind you that you have until 500 pm on   Thursday to submit revisions to your economic projections, in case the markets change your views    Sorry—using information only through the end of today’s   meeting  All right, the FOMC meeting is adjourned  Thank you   END OF MEETING   October 28–29, 2008 159 of 206     "
8608,2008-12-15,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  We welcome Chris Cumming,   who is sitting in for New York  As you know, under the extraordinary circumstances we added an   extra day to the meeting  The purpose of the meeting taking place today is to discuss the zero lower   bound and related policy and governance issues, and I hope that the discussion today will set up our   policy decision for tomorrow   Just for preview purposes, the program today will start with Bill Dudley and Q&A  We’ll   then have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound and alternative policies  We’ll have a go-  round on those issues, including nontraditional policies and communications associated with it and   so on  Let me just mention that on the agenda for tomorrow, after the policy decision, we have the   subcommittee’s report on long-run projections and the quarterly projections  We put that there to   save time and to make sure that we met our deadlines; but obviously there’s some linkage between   that and the discussion today, and if anyone wants to bring that up today, please feel free to do so    Finally, if we’re very efficient—as I hope we will be—I’d like to get to the staff economic briefing   at the end of today, if possible—if not, not—and then there’s dinner afterwards  So without further   ado, let me turn to Bill Dudley  Bill    Thank you  There was a sharp decline in the spike in the fails   recently?    Thank you  Questions for Bill?  President Hoenig    President Fisher    Any other questions?  President Bullard    In fairness, these are junk bonds  These are low-rated   companies   December 15–16, 2008 12 of 284     Michael Milken hadn’t been born yet  [Laughter]  President   Lacker    President Lacker has a two-hander    Okay  Other questions for Bill?  If not, we need a motion to   ratify domestic open market operations    Any objections?  All right  Thank you  Let’s turn now to   Brian, and we’ll have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound  I’m being reminded that this is a   December 15–16, 2008 15 of 284    joint Board–FOMC meeting  I’m reconvening a Board meeting that began this morning  Thank   you    Thank you very much  I would like to give special thanks to   the staff, some of whom are here and some of whom are not, for an extraordinary amount of work   on these difficult topics over a short period of time  We very much appreciate those efforts   Are there questions for Brian or Steve or anyone else?  If there are no questions, we’re ready   for the go-round on this topic  I’d like to ask your indulgence  There’s an awful lot here, and I’d   like to go first this time and try to clear out some underbrush and to lay down some issues in the   hope that it will perhaps focus our discussion a bit more   As you know, we are at a historic juncture—both for the US economy and for the Federal   Reserve  The financial and economic crisis is severe despite extraordinary efforts not only by the   Federal Reserve but also by other policymakers here and around the world  With respect to   December 15–16, 2008 22 of 284    monetary policy, we are at this point moving away from the standard interest rate targeting   approach and, of necessity, moving toward new approaches  Obviously, these are very deep and   difficult issues that we are going to have to address collectively today and tomorrow  I want to say   that, although we are certainly moving in a new direction and the outlines of that new direction are   not yet clear, this is a work in progress  The discussion we’re having today is a beginning  It’s not   a conclusion  Everyone can rest assured that this conversation is going to continue for additional   meetings, and today we’re not going to be setting in stone an approach that will be used indefinitely    In fact, it would be hubristic to do so, given all the uncertainties and changes that we face  I’m not   going to try to address all of these questions, but I thought it would be useful for me to talk a bit,   first, about nontraditional policies and then, second, about the important issue of governance, which   I know a lot of people are concerned about     So let me start, first, with nontraditional policies  I want to note that we are working and we   should continue to work to improve our control of the effective funds rate  The interest rate paid on   reserves is not currently sufficient to keep the rate at the target  That’s for a lot of reasons with   which you are all familiar  I would just note that the staff is still working  We should not give up   on that  The interest rate on reserves may be more effective as people get used to it, as balance   sheet constraints ease, and as the rate gets higher if we decide to raise rates  So I think that is still a   tool that we should keep and be aware of  There are other strategies—opening term accounts of   various kinds, taking steps to encourage arbitrage, using Treasury bills, or perhaps issuing our own   bills  In fact, we have had a lengthy discussion in this Committee of alternative structures for   implementing monetary policy that involve different ways of setting up reserve requirements   So first of all, let’s just acknowledge that, although we are not keeping the effective funds   rate at the target currently, we should not assume that that’s always going to be the case  We do   December 15–16, 2008 23 of 284    have some optionality in that direction  That being said, it’s obvious that the effective funds rate   now is quite low, and given the amount of excess reserves in the system, we’re going to have to find   other ways at least in the near term to address the economic crisis  One approach, as was discussed   by Steve and others, is communications  Here, in particular, I think, we are at early stages  I don’t   think we’re going to come to any conclusions today  There is a lot of interest in terms of   possibilities  The one thing I would say is that, if we do use communications as a way of providing   information about future policy moves, we should be very careful to make those interest rate   forecasts, if you will, conditional on the state of the economy  It should be very clear, if we give   forward guidance of some kind, that the evolution of the policy rate will depend on how the   economy evolves  The more clarity we can provide in that direction, the more effective our policy   will be and the less problem we will have exiting from that strategy in the future   The statements that were circulated in the Bluebook gave two examples just for discussion,   both of them in alternative A  In paragraph 2, there was some suggested language for using an   inflation target as a way of managing expectations  Let me just read the sentence  “In support of its   dual mandate, the Committee will seek to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index   for personal consumption expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term”  The idea there   would be to try to stabilize inflation expectations, avert deflationary expectations, and keep real   rates lower than they otherwise would be  The 2 percent in that statement is a placeholder    Obviously if we do this, we would have to talk more about what 2 percent means  Is it a permanent   level?  Is it a temporary number?  But that is one strategy   I would add that, of course, as we have discussed, adopting what might be a de facto   inflation target is a pretty big deal, and if we decide to do that, I would like to have some   opportunity to consult with the Congress appropriately  But if we decide to go in this direction, I do   December 15–16, 2008 24 of 284    think that this might be a good time because it is certainly not a negative as far as employment   growth is concerned in this context, and so it might be easier to explain   The other example of communication, also in alternative A, ties policy to economic   forecasts  “The Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant federal   funds rates near zero for some time”  I note that this is a forecast of policy rather than a   commitment to policy, but it does provide some information about the Committee’s expectations   and should affect market rates  So, again, I think we’re at early stages of this particular approach,   but it may be promising, and I hope today’s discussion will provide some insight   The second general approach to conducting nontraditional monetary policy is by use of the   balance sheet  We have already begun to do this to some extent, as you know  In some respects our   policies are similar to the quantitative easing of the Japanese, but I would argue that, when you look   at it more carefully, what we’re doing is fundamentally different from the Japanese approach  Let   me talk about that a bit  The Japanese approach, the quantitative easing approach, was focused on   the liability side of the balance sheet—specifically the quantity of bank reserves, the monetary base,   or however you want to put it, in the system  The theory behind quantitative easing was that   providing enormous amounts of very cheap liquidity to banks, as Steve discussed, would encourage   them to lend and that lending, in turn, would increase the broader measures of the money supply,   which in turn would raise prices and stimulate asset prices, and so on, and that would suffice to   stimulate the economy  Again, the focus of the quantitative easing was on the liability side, and   indeed, there were targets, as you know, for the amount of excess reserves or reserves in the system    I think that the verdict on quantitative easing is fairly negative  It didn’t seem to have a great deal of   effect, mostly because banks would not lend out the reserves that they were holding  The one thing   that it did seem to do was affect expectations of policy rates because everyone understood it would   December 15–16, 2008 25 of 284    take some time to unwind the quantitative easing  Therefore, that pushed out into the future the   increase in the policy rate   So I would argue that what we are doing is different from quantitative easing because,   unlike the Japanese focus on the liability side of the balance sheet, we are focused on the asset side   of the balance sheet  In particular, we have adopted a series of programs, all of which involve some   type of lending or asset purchase, which has brought onto our balance sheet securities other than the   typical Treasuries that we usually transact in  You are all aware of the lending facilities for banks   and dealers, the swaps with foreign central banks, the promised purchases of MBS, the various   credit facilities for which even I do not know all the acronyms anymore  [Laughter]  In this case,   rather than being a target of policy, the quantity of excess reserves in the system is a byproduct of   the decisions to make these various types of credit available  I think that’s a very different strategy,   and Bill gave some evidence—we can debate it further—that these different policies have had some   effects on the markets at which they’re aimed   Again, to distinguish between the balance-sheet, quantitative-easing, liability-side approach   and the asset-side approach that we have been using, I do not think—and I feel this quite strongly—  that it makes any sense for us to have or try to describe monetary policy with a single number,   which is the size of the balance sheet or the size of our liabilities, as the Japanese did  There are a   number of reasons for this, but the least important reason is probably just the fact that many of our   programs don’t have fixed sizes  They are open-ended—like the swap programs, for example    Also, many of the programs have different timing, different durations, maturities, beginning points,   ending points, and the like, and so in that respect I think it would be difficult to put in a single   number  More important, the programs on the asset side of our balance sheet serve different   purposes and have different structures, and aggregating a dollar of MBS purchase, a dollar of   December 15–16, 2008 26 of 284    commercial paper purchase, and a dollar of swaps to make three dollars strikes me as being apples   and oranges  I do not think that is the right way to think about it  Furthermore, and finally, these   programs obviously have different operational costs and risks, different risks of losses, different   maturities, and most important, they present different issues with respect to the exit strategy, which   we will want to talk about  Rather than looking at this as a single number, as a measure of the   liability side of the balance sheet, I think we ought to think about it as a portfolio of assets, a   combination of things that we are doing on the asset side of our balance sheet, that have specific   purposes and that may or may not be effective; but we can look at them individually   Let me turn now quickly to the governance issues  Before getting into them, let me just say   that, whatever difficulties we may have finding appropriate governance, it is certainly the case that   the Federal Reserve Act did not exactly contemplate the situation in which we find ourselves today    I think we all agree that getting the right policies for the US economy is the top priority and,   whatever we do, we need to find a way to get the right policies in place  Frankly, I think the best   way to achieve that—I am going to talk about some details—is through operating in good faith    If we work together and keep each other apprised of developments and our views, we will be   able to make this work  If we take too narrow an approach, too legalistic an approach, I think it   will be much more difficult   So let me make a few comments  I think I can focus this best by simply answering the   question  If the federal funds rate is at zero and the FOMC no longer sets the target, then what is   the role of the FOMC in monetary policy?  I have four answers to that question  The first is that   the Federal Reserve’s outlook is the FOMC’s outlook  That is, the FOMC’s views about the   evolution of the economy, of prices, and of financial conditions will govern our policy decisions    In particular, it is the FOMC’s outlook that appears in the minutes, it is the FOMC’s outlook that   December 15–16, 2008 27 of 284    appears in the projections, and it is the FOMC’s outlook that appears in our communications    Therefore, if your board members ask you with respect to monetary policy, “Well, what are we   doing now?” the answer is, “Keep telling us what you are seeing in the economy and financial   markets  We will transmit that to the full FOMC because the FOMC’s outlook is the perspective   that governs the policy actions that we take”   The second role of the FOMC, I believe, is in the communication policy, both in the   narrow and in the large  In the narrow, if we decide to adopt a target, make a commitment about   the length of time in which we hold rates low, or make any other kind of verbal promise in our   statements or in other contexts, that is obviously the FOMC’s prerogative, and I think we   understand that that’s how it would work   The third area is the most difficult one, and that has to do with the balance sheet  The   law provides a kind of odd co-dependence, if you will, between the Board and the FOMC with   respect to the balance sheet  Both the Board and the FOMC are enjoined by the Federal Reserve   Act to pursue the dual mandate, and both the Board and the FOMC have powers that affect the   size and composition of the balance sheet  In particular, the FOMC has authority over   Treasuries, agency purchases, and swaps, whereas the Board has, in particular, the 13(3)   authority, which has been utilized a lot lately for credit programs  So we have dual authority,   and we have dual or joint responsibility  I think the only way to deal with that essentially is   through close consultation and collaboration  My commitment to you is that we will work   together even more closely, even more collegially, going forward to make sure that everyone is   on board and understands what we are doing with respect to our various programs on the asset   side of our balance sheet and that each person on this Committee is well informed and is able to   give views and input into the discussions that we have   December 15–16, 2008 28 of 284    The legal authorities are what they are, but I do think that a collective and cooperative   effort can help us solve this problem  In particular, I understand that the briefing sessions that I   have provided have been useful  I am willing to commit to do those as frequently as necessary,   and I am willing to make them into meetings if we need to have two-way discussions and input   from the Committee with respect to policy actions  So it is a bit awkward, but I hope that   cooperation will allow us to work together on the balance sheet   Now, there is a special issue here, though, which is the unwind issue  One way in which   the balance sheet affects the responsibilities of the FOMC is that, if the FOMC is going to be   raising interest rates at some point in the future, clearly, it needs to have information and   understanding about the constraints being placed on policy by the size and composition of the   balance sheet  So I think that keeping the FOMC as a whole informed about the balance sheet,   about the programs, about the constraints that may be placed on the unwind, and about   alternative strategies for raising rates once the time comes, is incumbent upon me and the rest of   the Board to do  As a down payment on that, I have asked Bill Dudley, if there is time   tomorrow, to give you a bit of an update on the TALF, the asset-backed securities loan facility,   and talk to you about some issues that it raises for the unwind and for future interest rate policies   Fourth, and finally, with respect to the FOMC responsibilities, is communication to the   public  The public doesn’t make the distinction between the Board of Governors and the FOMC    The public understands the Federal Reserve  What we need to do is to come together and decide   what policies we want to pursue and then collectively take responsibility for those policies and   communicate them in a coherent and consistent way to the broad public  That is the   responsibility of all of us, and I hope we can work together to provide everybody with the   information that they need to do that effectively  In particular, I am going to say that, given the   December 15–16, 2008 29 of 284    state of confidence in the markets and in the economy, I hope whatever disagreements we may   have that as much as possible we can keep them within these walls  With respect to the public,   we need, as much as possible, to communicate a clear strategy going forward   So those are just some thoughts on governance  I recognize the problems  I am eager to   hear your views about how to do it better  I am also interested in knowing how you think these   governance issues should translate into the statements and into the directives  I think we have   thrown out some suggestions there  We are not in any way wedded to them  If other people   have other ideas, we are very open to adopting those ideas  But at least I want to say that I am   fully aware of these issues, and I think that however many structures we may impose, nothing is   going to substitute for a good faith, collaborative effort in making this work  Let me stop there   and begin the go-round with President Lacker    I won’t try to respond, but I do want to ask you what your   interpretation of the Japanese experience is  They had enormous increases in the base, no   increase in M1, and no inflation     President Fisher, you had a two-hander   December 15–16, 2008 35 of 284     President Plosser    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  Why don’t we take fifteen minutes for coffee   and then come back and continue   [Coffee break]    President Hoenig, whenever you are ready    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Are you in charge of drafting it?  [Laughter]  President   Stern    President Rosengren    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  First Vice President Cumming    Thank you  Several people have mentioned press   conferences  I should say that we’re looking very carefully at the idea of doing quarterly press   conferences with the release of the projections, along the lines of the Bank of England  If we decide   to do that—and input from the Committee is welcome—the first one would be in February  It   would coincide in this case with the Humphrey-Hawkins additional presentation  I have a speech at   the London School of Economics in mid-January in which I will be able to lay out a lot of these   issues  I don’t know if that’s soon enough, but I don’t know whether we think we should do more   communication or not  That’s something we can talk about tomorrow perhaps, but I did want you   to know that we are looking at the quarterly press conference model  President Fisher    I’m in awe of a presentation that has Rube Goldberg, the   Black Death, “Bennie and the Jets,” and full frontal view all in it  [Laughter]  Governor Warsh      Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Governor Duke    Thank you  Thank you all  I actually would like to try to   distill some impressions from our discussion and, going even a step further, maybe draw some very   tentative conclusions for the statement and decision tomorrow  I do that in the spirit of fairness   because tomorrow you have a chance to rebut what I say now  So let me just draw some tentative   conclusions, and if you disagree or if there are multiple options, perhaps you can respond in our go-  rounds tomorrow   First, with respect to the level of the fed funds rate, I think generally speaking people want   to be aggressive  They recognize the difficulty, the severity, of the situation  Some were somewhat   fatalistic, saying, well, we can’t really keep the rate much above zero anyway, so it’s somewhat of a   moot question  With that said, Governor Duke was just the last of a number of people who did   point out that there are various institutional, market, and other considerations that would suggest   trying to keep the rate above zero if possible, although she had a very interesting alternative, which   is just not to have a target, which might be helpful in at least a few contexts  Let me ask Bill about   feasibility here  Suppose for the sake of argument that we had a range of 25 to 50 and we set the   interest rate on reserves at 50  Would that be feasible?  Could that work?   December 15–16, 2008 99 of 284     All right  Well, that’s relevant information  So it may be that   our options are a range of 0 to 25 or no target, but those are two options that I would point to  I   should also say, as I discuss the statement here, I think that in a very real sense this is a transitional   meeting  I mean, we can’t go from 0 to 60 in one meeting, and I think we have to allow for the   possibility that there will be further refinement as we go forward into January  So I raise, as the first   point, exactly how we state the policy decision  Do we make reference to the funds rate?  Are we   okay with a 0 to 25 range?  I hear and recognize the concerns about too low a rate, and it’s just a   question of feasibility in the short term  One advantage about having a range is that we could   indicate that over time we’re trying to get to 25  That would be at least slightly helpful, I think   The second issue I want to mention is communication  I thought there was actually a good   bit of consensus  A number of people spoke somewhat approvingly of an inflation target or some   broader inflation objective, but I didn’t hear much sentiment for doing it immediately or in the very   December 15–16, 2008 100 of 284    near term  I think it is something that we ought to take very seriously, particularly if inflation starts   to drop further  We should do it in a prepared way, and I need to consult and so on  But I agree   with the comment that this is a long-term objective that we have  This may be an excellent   opportunity to do it because not only is there no tradeoff between growth and inflation in this   context but also there won’t be any suspicion that we’re choosing a rate that’s convenient  I mean,   we are probably below the rate that we would choose as a target  So it might be worth considering   in the longer term   For tomorrow, though, I did hear quite a bit of interest in conditionality in terms of the ZIRP   (zero interest rate policy) type of strategy  We had—I think it was in alternative A, paragraph 3—a   statement that said, “The Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant   a federal funds rate near zero for some time”  I wonder if that meets what people were talking   about, or were there people who wanted to express it more explicitly in terms of our qualitative   objectives or otherwise?  I hear a willingness to have at least a qualitative conditionality for our   policy  I would invite overnight or tomorrow any alternative phrasing that people think might be   more effective  It is an important decision to make   The third issue—and I’m just making very high level comments here; I have a whole bunch   of notes that I’m not going to repeat at this point—has to do with our various programs and   purchases  I think that the great majority of the Committee is comfortable with MBS and Treasury   purchases  At least that’s what I heard  I took a majority to be in favor of, or at least accepting, the   credit facilities that we have  There were requests for more metrics, more explanation, more   criteria, more exit strategies, and so on, and I think those were all valid points  What I take from   this is that these asset-side programs, the credit facilities as well as the MBS and other programs, are   part of our new regime, that most people view them as part of our new regime, and that the   December 15–16, 2008 101 of 284    inclusion in our statement of some reference to these kinds of programs, as in the variants that were   circulated in the Bluebook, would probably be desirable   A point of considerable discussion and some contention, with respect to both governance   and communication, was the use of a measure of the base or excess reserves as a quantitative   indicator of monetary policy  With those who advocated it, I think there were really two objectives,   if I may  One was to have a measure of monetary policy that would influence expectations and, if   effective, would raise inflation expectations and the like  But another function of that, I believe,   was the desire to have, from a governance perspective, the FOMC setting some kind of indicator of   monetary policy  With respect to the use of, say, the base as a measure of monetary policy, I would   say that for tomorrow we’re pretty far from being able to feel comfortable doing that  We haven’t   done the work  We haven’t done the analysis of the transmission mechanisms  We haven’t looked   at what monitoring ranges and how they might work  So it would be a radical step to take in one   meeting  I leave that open as we continue to think about what the right indicators of policy are   I understand the desire for governance  I think what I would propose—and again, by all   means, respond tomorrow—would be, at least in our directive, that we have, as somewhat suggested   already, the Committee affirm or otherwise indicate its approval of quantitative programs—  $500 billion MBS; $100 billion GSE debt; $200 billion for TALF, if you are willing; et cetera—and   pursuant to that, that the Board make a regular practice of bringing any new program or any   expansion of existing programs to the FOMC for review and discussion  That may not be entirely   satisfactory, but it would certainly indicate to the public that the FOMC has reviewed it from a   monetary policy perspective, and it would appear in the directive, the minutes, and so on  I put that   out as just a possible compromise on that issue   December 15–16, 2008 102 of 284    I think those are the main elements of the statement and the directive  I heard a lot about a   desire for an explanatory document, talking points, other supporting material, speeches, and press   conferences  We hear that, and it will be very important for us to try to develop such materials  I   said at the beginning that I think it’s unusually important for us to try to speak in a unified way   externally, not because I want to avoid dissent—and of course, everyone’s views can be   expressed—but as Governor Duke pointed out, because I think we have an educational mission here   that needs to be taken seriously  So the more consistent we can be in our explanations and our   discussion, the better it will be   Those are just some things that I drew from the discussion  Again, you’ll have an   opportunity tomorrow, at least one go-round or maybe two go-rounds, to agree or disagree  Any   comments?  Final thoughts?   All right  The first question is, What time do we begin tomorrow?  We are scheduled for   900 am  I think that would be adequate  Does everyone feel comfortable keeping their economic   go-round remarks reasonably short?  That’s the tradeoff  If everyone is game for that, we’ll start   tomorrow morning at 900 and now adjourn the Board meeting—you didn’t notice that—and also   just remind you that there’s a reception and dinner available for your convenience  There will be no   business conducted at that dinner  Thank you  See you in the morning   [Meeting recessed]   December 15–16, 2008 103 of 284    December 15, 2008—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody  Let’s start off today with the   economic outlook  Dan, will you be taking the lead?    Thank you  Remind me what your anticipation of the   current account deficit is for next year    Okay  Thank you  Questions for our colleagues?  President   Bullard    President Fisher    President Lacker    Jeff, are you feeling okay?  [Laughter]    President Evans    President Bullard    President Lockhart    Other questions?  If not, let’s start our go-round with First   Vice President Cumming    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Lacker    All of these strategies are time-inconsistent, of course  So we   have to be willing as a Committee to sit here and accept higher-than-normal inflation ex post  I just   point that out  We have to ask ourselves if we would be willing and if the public would be willing   to accept that    I understand  I’m just saying that there are also different ways   to do it  We could also just target a higher inflation rate, which is probably another way of doing it    I would just comment—and I think that your point is a good   one—as we go forward, we are going to be thinking hard about how to influence expectations    Absolutely  Your point is also right, as we discussed earlier, about why we need additional policies   besides our zero rate policy, either other kinds of quantitative policies that are obviously linked to   December 15–16, 2008 132 of 284    base movements or fiscal or other policies as well  So I don’t think there is that much disagreement   on the analysis    Okay  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you, and if there has been any intervention in hedge   funds, the Chairman is unaware of it  [Laughter]    President Hoenig   December 15–16, 2008 137 of 284     Thank you  It was a good suggestion  I have looked at that   example and had a chance to talk with Stefan Ingves, who is the Governor of the Central Bank of   Sweden and was very much involved in that  It was a very good and prompt response, but it was   different from our current situation in that the banks were already mostly insolvent and no longer   functioning when the government intervened  They took the standard steps of taking off   nonperforming loans—so the usual process  They still had a significant recession  I think the basic   lessons are there, but we have some characteristics in this particular episode—banks still   functioning, the complexity of the assets, and so on—that make it even more difficult    If you can indulge just one more observation, which is that   one thing we learn from these episodes is that the political economy matters tremendously  The   public is very reluctant to get involved in putting money into banks, and only when they become   persuaded that doing so is essential do you get that result  In Japan it took a long time  In Sweden it   was much quicker, and that’s an important element  A two-hander from President Bullard  Yes   December 15–16, 2008 139 of 284     Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Stern    President Bullard    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Kohn      Thank you  Governor Warsh     Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  And thanks, everyone, for a very concise but   also very informative roundtable  Why don’t we take a coffee break until 1130  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we reconvene, have a brief summary of our go-  round, and then I will make just a few additional comments  The participants noted that the   economic downturn has intensified sharply recently with significant downside risks to the   outlook  Recessionary dynamics have set in, with interplays among real and financial variables    The economy is likely to contract through early next year, with considerable uncertainty about   subsequent developments  Consumption, employment, and production indicators have weakened   further  Financial conditions remain very strained, with improvement in some areas, but many   the same or worse  The global economy has also slowed markedly   Looking more specifically at different sectors, credit conditions continue to tighten, with   credit lines not being renewed and banks, including smaller banks, hunkering down    Securitization markets are still largely dysfunctional  The overall deleveraging process continues   to be a powerful drag on activity  Delinquencies are increasing, implying greater credit losses   for banks and other lenders, with small businesses being among the borrowers facing tighter   conditions  Banks continue to face intense balance sheet pressures and are reluctant to lend or   make markets, and feedback effects from worsening credit quality to the balance sheets of   financial institutions are evident   Regarding the consumer, spending continues to contract, as households face ongoing   pressures with respect to wealth, income, credit availability, and job security  Psychology is very   December 15–16, 2008 157 of 284    negative, and luxury and discretionary expenditures are being cut back  Labor market   developments have been negative as well, with accelerating job losses and participation finally   declining after remaining high for a period of time  The latest housing numbers suggest a   continued contraction in that sector  The fall in mortgage rates has sparked some refinancing and   purchase mortgage applications, but the longer-term impact on housing demand is not yet   evident  Nonresidential construction is projected to fall significantly, reflecting poor   fundamentals and tight credit  Federal fiscal policy will likely provide aid to states, including   funds for infrastructure, but the size and the timing of the economic impact of that policy remain   uncertain   Manufacturing production continues to slow, along with new orders, capital spending,   and business expectations; mining and drilling activities have been reacting to the decline in   commodity prices, as has agricultural activity to some extent  Export demand has weakened   with the sharp slowing in the global economy of recent months and the strengthening of the   dollar since the summer  The sharp global slowdown, including emerging markets, will make   recovery more difficult  Manufacturing surveys show that firms expect considerable near-term   weakness and declining pricing power     Finally, inflation looks set to decline significantly, reflecting falling commodity prices,   rising slack, limited pricing power, and falling inflation expectations  Participants cited the risk   that inflation could fall below desired levels  That is just a very quick summary  Any   comments?     Let me make just a few additional comments, but I won’t add, I think, a great deal of   insight to our discussion  I will just note for the record here that the NBER has finally   recognized that a recession began in December 2007  I said in the Christmas tree lighting   December 15–16, 2008 158 of 284    ceremony that they also recognized that Christmas was on December 25 last year  [Laughter]    The Committee was a little more forward-thinking  We began cutting rates, of course, in   September 2007 and did 100 basis points of cuts in January 2008     Despite our efforts, this recession, in terms of duration and depth, is likely to be equal to   or greater than the two largest previous postwar recessions, those in 1974-75 and 1981-82    There are a number of reasons that may be the case, and some of them were already discussed by   the staff  The financial conditions are the most obvious difference between this recession and the   earlier ones  A number of previous recessions have had financial headwinds of one type or   another  For example, the current financial crisis and housing correction bear some family   relationship to the stock market decline and the capital overhang in the 2001 recession  But   overall, the financial aspects of this episode are, I think, much more serious than in previous   cases  To cite two aspects  One, as Governor Warsh noted, there has been a big impact on   household wealth  The flow of funds accounts show a decline in nominal wealth of about   11 percent in the last year or, as he said, a decline in real wealth of about 15 percent  This is   going to lead to an increase in saving, which would be desirable in the longer term but in the   short term is going to create dislocation  Two, this financial crisis has affected the   intermediation of credit far more severely than any other episode since the 1930s  We have   already seen a big impact on intermediary capital and bank activity  The deleveraging process is   continuing  It is very intense  Again, reduced risk-taking, deleveraging, all of those things are   not necessarily bad, but the adjustment process is a very difficult one     A second reason that this recession could well be more severe than the previous ones has   to do with the cyclical position of monetary policy, a fact also noted by the staff  The 1974-75   and 1981-82 recessions were basically generated by a tightening of monetary policy, and when   December 15–16, 2008 159 of 284    the Federal Reserve decided to let up, essentially conditions began to rebound  Obviously, in   this case, other factors have driven the downturn  Monetary policy was proactive in trying to   promote recovery  But given where we are today, at the zero lower bound, we are unable to ease   policy in the way that we saw in those previous episodes  This suggests, as others have noted,   the need for additional policy actions, either on our part or by the fiscal authorities, to get the   economy moving again   Finally, a third reason that I think this episode is particularly severe is the global nature of   the downturn, which a number of people have also noted  It has always been said that, if the   United States sneezes, the rest of the world catches cold  So there has always been a certain   amount of coherence or synchronicity between US downturns and those around the world  But   the extent of the global downturn this time is really quite exceptional  It is striking that global   growth over the past few years has been between 4 and 5 percent, and now the Greenbook is   looking at a 16 percent decline for global activity in the fourth quarter and a decline of about   06 percent in the first quarter  That is quite a big difference between what we might think of as   potential and actual growth   So, as I said, there are a number of reasons to think that this is going to be a very severe   episode and that we are far from being at the turning point  I won’t go through the sectors  We   have all discussed consumption, employment, housing, commercial real estate, and financial   markets  These are all aspects of the downturn that continue to be exceptional and very   worrisome as we look forward   I will make just a couple of comments about inflation or disinflation  The forecast is for   significant disinflation—perhaps not deflation, although deflation is easily within the standard   errors of the forecast  A number of factors may affect this forecast or create risks on both sides   December 15–16, 2008 160 of 284    Stephanie talked about structural unemployment perhaps being a factor that might make the   effect of slack less than otherwise  On the other hand, there may be some evidence that the   Phillips curve is steeper when unemployment is high—that is, recessions tend to have a greater   impact on inflation than do small changes in growth  That only goes to say that there is a lot of   uncertainty about exactly how far the inflation rate will fall  Although we might reach a   technical deflation, I guess it is worth pointing out here that there is nothing special about zero    That is, from this point on, any further disinflation will have the effects of making a given   nominal interest rate a higher real interest rate  It is making monetary policy de facto tighter and   perhaps having debt deflation effects as the real value of debts and debt payments becomes   greater as inflation falls  Because we are already at the zero lower bound, obviously that   constraint is already in play  So I think we shouldn’t focus too much or focus the public too   much on the deflation line, on that zero number  It is not all that consequential  Rather, the   disinflation process—and a very low rate of inflation—is a source of concern   Just to summarize, I don’t think my outlook differs very significantly from what I have   heard around the table  I think the issues are what we do about it, and in that spirit, we should   turn now to the policy round  So let me turn to Brian to introduce the monetary policy   alternatives    Thank you  Questions for Brian?  President Lacker    Noted  I think I am somewhat at fault here  I did consult   with everyone on the Committee and discussed what we were going to do  I would say that,   going forward, we should probably bring all such plans to the Committee    President Fisher     President Plosser    We can discuss this in the go-round  President Evans    Other questions?  I think it might be helpful to flag just a   few things about which I would particularly appreciate the Committee’s advice  The first is the   issue that President Plosser was discussing, which is alternative A—not specifying a range or a   target—or alternative B—specifying a range  I think that the argument for specifying a range is   that it seems a little clearer  If you look at, for example, the Japanese experience, even when   they were in quantitative easing, they still had a target for the call rate, as I understand it  There   are some counter-arguments, which Governor Duke and others have raised, about the impact on   banks and so on  That is question number 1  Question number 2—and this doesn’t preclude   other points, of course—is that in paragraph 3 of alternative B, for example, we have bracketed   just for your reference the risk of inflation’s declining below optimal levels  I would be   interested to know your views on whether or not to include that bracketed phrase    Third—again looking at alternative B—in paragraph 4 we have the conditional statement   that “weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal   December 15–16, 2008 169 of 284    funds rate”  A little informal polling suggested that people were sort of okay with this way of   stating the conditionality  But if there are any concerns about that or, alternatively, if you would   like to include a reference to disinflation as one of the conditions, that is just something I want to   flag as a question   A fourth and final point I want to flag—and President Yellen pointed this out to me—in   paragraph 5 we have a sentence saying that “the Committee is also evaluating the potential   benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities”  I think to put that in there we should   feel that sometime in the next few meetings there is a significant chance that we would in fact   engage in some kind of a program  We don’t want to put it in there if it is a complete red   herring   So those are four points that I have, but of course, you may have other questions or issues   that you want to raise  Governor Duke    Thank you  All right  Let’s begin the go-round  We’ll   begin with President Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard     Thank you  President Lacker   December 15–16, 2008 173 of 284     That is going around  [Laughter]    Jeff, I just want to make a couple of comments  A very   small one is that, in an early draft, instead of saying “entail the use of the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet” we had “entail increasing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet”  We   thought that might not be appropriate because things go on and off    Right  We were probably going to do that as a trend,   maybe not day to day, but it has some of the flavor of increasing the base  So that is one just   observation  On the TALF, we have added a presentation today from Bill Dudley and Pat   Parkinson    Finally, on the directive, there is a bit of a difference, which   is that I do think we need to bring new programs, et cetera, for your information, as I said before    But this is actually a stronger statement in that it also means that we should report to you on the   ongoing implications of existing programs for the base and for the balance sheet  So there is a   bit of a difference in those two concepts    All right  One possibility is “entail increasing the size”    There is some risk there, but I think that would be the general trend that we are considering    Others can comment    You could say “increasing over time the size” or something   like that    Yes  That was the reason we switched    Right  That was the concern we had—that it wouldn’t   necessarily be a monotonic increase, that it could have ups and downs depending on usage and   so on    All right  Well, we can hear from others about that as well    President Evans      Thank you  Governor Kohn   December 15–16, 2008 180 of 284     Thank you    Yes    It is already Greek anyway  [Laughter]  President   Lockhart      Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Hoenig    Again, as I said yesterday, this is a work in progress    We’ll keep working on it  I didn’t quite get your proposal    Do you propose leaving in the sentence about Treasuries at this meeting?    Okay  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Stern    Thank you  Maybe I should ask Bill  Do you see any purely   operational issues in the next few months if we decide to purchase longer-term Treasuries?      We won’t    President Plosser   December 15–16, 2008 190 of 284     Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  First Vice President Cumming   December 15–16, 2008 196 of 284     I’m sorry  What was the beginning?    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Kroszner    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Boy, you’ve left me a simple task  Yes, a two-  hander from President Fisher    Well, let me comment    President Lacker    Let me just say, generally speaking, that we are making a lot   of changes here  I’d like to suggest that we move gradually  But one suggestion I did like and   would propose to see if it helps you is First Vice President Cumming’s suggestion of saying that   December 15–16, 2008 204 of 284    we’ll provide support with measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet at a   high level  That makes it very explicit  Later we can go further about quantitative guidelines and so   forth, but for the moment we’re saying that the balance sheet size itself is of importance    President Plosser, does that satisfy you for today?    Just for today, “the focus of policy going forward will be to   support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market   operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high   level”    The focus of the Committee’s policy    Is that okay?    All right  So in the spirit of trying to move gradually and not   just overwhelm the market, I would like, as I say, to move halfway to where we want to be  There   was a slight majority in favor of alternative A, but I’m very concerned that, if we don’t say anything   about the funds rate, there is just going to be confusion  I am also concerned about the view that   President Yellen, Governor Kroszner, and others raised if we sort of say that we’re not targeting it   December 15–16, 2008 205 of 284    anymore  It suggests that we’re indifferent to the rate or that we have no ability to raise it  What   does it mean to say that rates will be kept low for a long time, if we don’t have some view on that?    Again, I would cite the Japanese precedent  I understand the concerns about community banks  I   do think that’s not a reason that should control our policy, and they certainly can change their   pricing policy  So let me make some suggestions  Brian, will someone take notes?  Then we can   come back  In order to be conservative and avoid risk, I would like to propose alternative B  In the   first paragraph, I would take Governor Warsh’s suggestion and say “target range for the federal   funds rate between 0 and ¼ percent”    “Target range for the federal funds rate of between 0 and   ¼ percent”    Oh, sorry  Not “of between” but “a target for the federal funds   rate between 0 and ¼ percent”    Target range    “The target range for the federal funds rate between 0 and ¼   percent”    All right  Okay  Scratch it  Paragraph 1 is the same  That’s   simple  Paragraph 2 is the same, including the additional sentence about financial markets, no   December 15–16, 2008 206 of 284    longer bolded  Paragraph 3, President Stern was right about “quickly”  Why don’t we say   “appreciably”?  Now, a lot of people have talked about inflation targets  I think we should look at   that very seriously  Today is not the day to do it  Maybe that should be introduced simultaneously   with concerns about deflation  I propose that we strike the bracketed material but put the word   “further” after “moderate”  “The Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming   quarters”  The fourth paragraph as is—most people were okay with the conditionality there  In the   fifth paragraph, strike “continue to”  “The focus of the Committee’s policy going forward will be to   support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market   operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high   level”  You know, I get the sense from the Committee that they will entertain purchases of Treasury   securities in the next quarter or so  In order not to jerk the market around too much, I think we   should therefore mention it and leave it where it is  So the only change in paragraph 5 that I’m   proposing is in the first sentence    Okay  Let’s see  Yes, I think it has to be there  “The Federal   Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet”  I think we have to say that   because we have used it    Sorry?    “The Committee will continue to consider ways of using the   Federal Reserve’s balance sheet”  I think we should leave it where it is  Just leave it ambiguous for   December 15–16, 2008 207 of 284    now, if that’s okay  So those are the changes  Brian, would you like just to read that?  Are you able   to read it that?  Do you have the information?    Would you go ahead and read the thing?    And then the related action  President Plosser    Well, we need to talk about it  I think there are two promising   directions  One is to have an inflation target or something close to an inflation target, depending on   how the Committee decides, what we think is feasible, and so on  The other would be to develop a   more formalized structure for discussing the integrated responsibilities we have with respect to the   balance sheet, and that could involve quantitative ranges, for example  I didn’t quite like your   ceiling because I think in some cases you might want to have a floor  But I don’t think, as I said   yesterday, that we can describe our policies in a single number, and I don’t think that a target for the   overall size of the balance sheet is a sufficient statistic for what we’re doing  But I do think that, for   governance and other reasons, we can talk about ranges, consultation, and so on, about the size of   the balance sheet  Okay?  Again, I apologize that this is an imperfect document  Given the many   moving parts, as I said, I wanted to try to keep it from being too overwhelming  This is going to be   a big enough step as it is  Governor Kohn    That it’s going to be above $800 billion for some time I would   think is a fair statement  Does anyone else have a comment?  Governor Warsh    It would be a range of 0 to ¼ percent  I think that would be   right   PARTICIPANTS  Right    President Fisher    I think confusion is an extraordinarily dangerous thing for us    No, I agree with that  What B says is that this is the end of   one regime and the beginning of another  The first one says that this is the end, and then we say   what are we doing going forward  I think that clarity is needed  If we did what you’re suggesting, I   don’t know for sure what would happen, but I think there would be a lot of commentary and   questions  “What are they saying?  What do they mean?”  That would be much more than what B   does  I understand your point  I thought hard about it, and I know that there was a mixture of   views  Governor Duke    First Vice President Cumming    No, clearly the banks are not required to move their prime rate   with anything in particular   December 15–16, 2008 212 of 284     I agree with what you’re saying about the important part, but it   is nevertheless the case that—as President Yellen pointed out—if we wanted to, we could raise the   funds rate if we put on enough pressure  Therefore, in an important sense a decision is being made   here to end this particular policy approach and to move clearly to another one with the words “the   focus of the Committee’s policies going forward will be” and that is described in a lengthy   paragraph  I am just so concerned about what will happen if we say we’re not going to target it    What does that mean?  Is it going to be 5 percent tomorrow?  I just fear the confusion  President   Hoenig    No  Today is the end of the old regime  We have hit zero    We can’t go further  Going forward, this is what we’re going to do  I think that’s clearer  Again,   December 15–16, 2008 213 of 284    I’m just concerned about not saying what we’re doing with the funds rate  Are we going to let it do   whatever it wants to do from today?  I think that’s just going to create volatility  Again, I’m sorry   for those who are in disagreement    Most of them said it was pretty close, and it’s a matter of   communication  It’s my judgment that we are just going to cause a lot of criticism and a lot of   December 15–16, 2008 214 of 284    concern and confusion if we do it now  I also agree that it’s fairly close  But my feeling is that the   concern of clarity is more important to me  Others?  Would you call the roll, please?    Yes    The directive would stand as we’ve written it, with the   additional sentence at the end?    Thank you  Could we bring lunch back?  Would that work?    That doesn’t work well?  All right  Let’s have half an hour for   lunch    The Board meeting is adjourned  Hold on  The Board will go   into my office  Everyone else, lunch  We will take a half hour break, and then we have just a few   short items afterwards to complete  Okay?  Thank you   December 15–16, 2008 215 of 284    [Lunch break]    Let’s reconvene briefly for a couple of other items  On   consideration, in order to maintain a united front with the Committee, President Fisher changed   his vote to vote “yes” on the resolution  We have two items  First, Governor Kohn is going to   talk a bit about our longer-term projection, and then we would like just to hear a bit from Bill   Dudley and Pat Parkinson about the TALF  We have had several previous briefings on this, but   we will update this and talk a bit about its implications for balance sheet management  Governor   Kohn    President Lacker    This is why they need to look at it now because I think they   really are substitutes    Any other comments or questions?     December 15–16, 2008 217 of 284     Okay  Anyone else?  All right  Let me turn to Bill, who   very kindly learned that he was on the program about fifteen hours ago    I am going to need to consult on an informal basis with the   other Board members on this  But in the spirit of our discussion yesterday, I invite questions or   comments, which will inform our thinking on this as well  Does anyone have any questions or   thoughts on this?  President Lacker   December 15–16, 2008 221 of 284     There is an ongoing discussion about whether prices in   markets are in some sense Pareto optimal prices or whether there is liquidity risk, other   premiums, that the central bank could do something about  I don’t know any way to resolve it    We have the same discussion each time  President Hoenig    Governor Kohn, did you have a comment?    President Lacker    In general    President Lacker, I guess there are at least a couple of theories   you could have  One of them has to do with capital  If you think that certain types of intermediaries   have specialized knowledge and their ability to lend depends on their capital, then there are   informational asymmetries in which clearly exogenous destruction of part of that capital is going to   affect equilibrium outcomes in the market  That’s one possibility  The other class of models has to   do with liquidity, where you have thick or thin markets depending on “I trade if you trade” and so   on and you have markets in which nobody is trading and so no one wants to be the first to enter  By   becoming a marketmaker, you can perhaps generate more activity   I think there are some   interesting perspectives out there    No, we should discuss them off line  President Rosengren    President Hoenig    Currently we have the class of securities  We’re looking at   consumer and small-business ABS    That’s agreed and understood  Again, the limits include the   TARP capital, our own willingness with respect to the balance sheet, and so on  There really are   limits to what this can accomplish  President Plosser   December 15–16, 2008 234 of 284     That’s a good point, and I think one thing that is a problem   now is the transition between Administrations  We’ll soon have a new Treasury Secretary and a   new Administration  I think it’s very important—I’ve discussed this with Tim Geithner and   others—that as soon as possible we lay out a broad strategy  What are the components of our   strategy?  What are we going to do going forward?    Well, implicitly, what are the limits to it?  How are we going   to approach the banking issue?  What are we going to do about failing firms?  How are we going to   try to address the securitization markets?  I think the more clarity we can provide—I fully agree   with the critique that lurching is very bad, and we need to provide an overview  There is a lot of   sympathy from the new Treasury to do that, and we just have to overcome the fact that we’re in a   transition at the moment  But I take that point  It’s a very good point    I don’t think you read it, though  [Laughter]    Other questions for Bill?    It’s not clear  The commercial paper market might be a   counter-example to that    It’s not a moderate recession, and it’s not a normal financial   downturn    You have to have a deep recession and a financial crisis    That’s pretty unusual  Twice a century, or once a century so far    Certainly I’m concerned  I’m very concerned  But I’m also   concerned about getting through this recession  So those are the tradeoffs    Other questions about the program?  If not, let me just tell you   that I’m going to be doing a call with the press at 315 in the Special Library  Any FOMC member   who has nothing else to do and would like to join is welcome  Michelle has given your Public   Affairs people the phone number so that they can listen in, and we’ll see how that goes  The next   meeting is Tuesday-Wednesday, January 27-28  The meeting is adjourned  Thank you   END OF MEETING   December 15–16, 2008 237 of 284     "
8635,2009-01-16,BERNANKE," Good morning, everybody  The principal item on the   agenda today is to have a preliminary discussion on inflation objectives and that range of   communication issues, and I will come back and provide some more introduction to that shortly    We also should take the opportunity to talk a bit about the structure of the FOMC meeting, which   we can then apply to the regular meeting coming up in about ten days   Before we get into the regular agenda, though, I would like in a moment to ask Scott   Alvarez to describe the terms of the Treasury–FDIC–Fed deal with Bank of America  That deal   was originally scheduled to take place—or to be announced—after the close of markets today,   and so my hope had been that I would be able to present this to you before completion or   announcement  In part because of market conditions, the bank asked for an acceleration to this   morning, and so that news, obviously, is already out  I apologize that we were surprised and   weren’t able to provide as much advance warning as we would have liked  In any case, I am   going to turn to Scott and let him just outline what we did and why we did it  The Richmond   Bank was very much involved in this, as was New York  After Scott’s comments, President   Lacker, if you would like to add anything, you are welcome at that point to do so, and then we   will have any Q&A that people want to do  Let me turn now to Scott to give us a quick overview   of the transaction   President Lacker   Thanks, President Lacker  I agree with Jeff that this is   uncomfortable It is a significant improvement, I would say, over some of the things we have   had to do in the past in that the Treasury obviously is taking by far the bulk of both the capital   investment and the fiscal risk and the FDIC is fully engaged as well  The FDIC also announced   its intention to expand the loan guarantee program to allow for up to ten-year covered bond type   of instruments, which will be interesting  They are going to go out for comment on that, and we   will see how that works out  So they are very much engaged   I would make a couple of other points  One is that we also had the benefit of knowing   somewhat longer in advance than had been the case in other situations and so had more time to   determine what strategy to follow  I think the agreement will reflect that greater time and greater   attention Finally, and this perhaps anticipates some of our later discussion, we have been very   attuned not only to the credit risks but also to the monetary policy implications of these deep-tail   loans We don’t expect to have to make the loans, but if we do, we want to make sure that they   don’t create balance sheet problems in terms of our monetary policy  Both in this case and in the   final negotiation with Citi, we have worked it out in a way that, if we make loans, it will be on a   tranched basis so that we wouldn’t have to make a loan of $300 billion or $100 billion in one   shot—rather, somewhat smaller loans that could be better managed from a monetary policy point   of view So that is the overview Let me see now if there are any questions for Scott, for me, or   for Jeff President Fisher   Well, the agreement took place over the Lehman Brothers   weekend in a situation of considerable stress and anxiety  But it was a freely negotiated   agreement between Bank of America and Merrill  There was no government assistance, and   there was no request for government assistance  It was a commercial decision  At that time, we   were actually quite happy to see it happen because we were concerned about the pressures on   Merrill But it was their decision, and we had no particular reason to think that there would be   extraordinary losses in this case   Of course, the world has changed in just a few months, and this whole situation was   stimulated by a call from Ken Lewis just a few weeks ago to the effect that the losses that Merrill   Lynch was going to report at the end of the fourth quarter had risen on the order of $10 billion or   $15 billion in just a couple of weeks, in terms of what they were reporting to Bank of America    So these losses were not anticipated, certainly not at the time of the merger agreement, and they   were actually quite a shock We were a little disappointed in Bank of America’s monitoring in   that they seemed a bit behind the curve in terms of following the developments at Merrill Lynch    But there were enormous losses at Merrill Lynch that emerged very quickly and that surprised        January 16, 2009 8 of 69  Bank of America and us as well I don’t know if I am answering your question, but we did not   anticipate this problem when the transaction was originally agreed to  You had a follow-up   question?   It is a legitimate question, President Fisher  This particular   transaction, as I was just saying, was different from, say, Bear Stearns, where our intention was   to arrange a merger in order to stabilize the company  In this case, as I said, it was a freely   undertaken business transaction in which the government was not involved   It is clear that, on the one hand, we are seeing a consolidation of firms and some increase   in concentration At the same time, the industry overall is shrinking and needs to shrink, and that   is going to be a structural problem going forward  I think the right approach—and I have said   this most recently in my speech this week—is that there needs to be a wholesale policy response   to the question of “too big to fail”  President Stern, of course, is very familiar with this issue and   has written on it That could involve breaking up firms  It could also involve a tougher   regulatory regime for so-called systemically relevant firms  There are different ways to address   it It must be addressed  It is very important to address   But right now we are doing the best that we can to address the immediate threats to the   system  I think we are making progress  As I said before, the Fed’s role is still there, and it     January 16, 2009 9 of 69  shouldn’t be there at all ideally, but it is now at least subsidiary to the Treasury and the FDIC  I   am hopeful that going forward the Administration will be able to develop a systematic,   comprehensive approach to the banking problems that will leave us out of it entirely, or at least   keep us in our appropriate liquidity provision role  So the answer to your question in short is that   it is very important, but we can’t address it simultaneously with addressing the near-term threats   to the system But the regulatory and legislative response clearly has to address those issues   Well, I think that speaking about it is, obviously, one useful   way of counteracting the concern  President Rosengren   Well, first, there are three classes of firms  There are the   so-called healthy firms that are eligible for the CPP  There are the very sick firms that require   emergency assistance  And somewhere in the middle are the targeted-investment programs—   Citi and BAC are now the two examples of that  These are firms that were not immediately in a   state of failure but were obviously under serious stress, and there is a set of criteria for those   firms and the way we approach those firms              January 16, 2009 10 of 69  The specific combination of capital and ring-fencing is, to some extent, a matter of   judgment—you know, looking at the situation of the individual firm, the market conditions, and   so on But there is a general feeling—I think we all may be seeing this—that the preferred   capital approach is reaching its limits  The markets don’t view preferred capital injections as   being a perfect substitute for common equity On the other hand, there is resistance on the   Treasury’s part to injecting significant amounts of common equity because they don’t want to   own the bank, among other things  So you need another mechanism, and ideally the mechanism   would be a good bank/bad bank or a purchase of assets—a way of getting some of the downside   risk off the balance sheet This has been the most effective way essentially to provide contingent   capital without creating a capital instrument  As we go forward, I expect to see more   combinations of what are effectively capital injections and removal or ring-fencing or insuring   troubled assets  I think we will see more of that going forward, but a substantial amount of   individual analysis of this particular case led to the particular combination of measures    President Lacker   Thank you President Hoenig   Well, I would welcome any assistance from an appropriate   governor or supervisor We have been concerned about Citi from a supervisory perspective for   some time  One of the key problems was the difficulty of managing and dealing with risk in   such a complex and loosely structured organization  So we—the Federal Reserve, the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York—had been pushing Citi to try to rationalize, sell off assets, refocus,   and improve risk management and management competency for some time  That wasn’t   motivated primarily by a concentration issue but was just trying to make Citi a more viable firm    Governor Warsh   Any other questions?  President Bullard   Well, speaking for myself, I am not going to draw the line   somewhere that involves the failure of a firm the size of Bank of America  But that said, we   need to find better solutions to this problem, and the new team—Geithner, Summers, and   Christina Romer—is very focused on trying to use the available TARP money, which of course   was just approved yesterday, plus other funding and other authorities, to develop a more   systematic and more comprehensive approach to the banking crisis  We have been trying to   support that analytically, and we are certainly also going to support it politically, because it is           January 16, 2009 14 of 69  very important that this be done both in a consistent and a well-thought-out way and that fiscal   authorities take the appropriate responsibility   So let me just say that I know President Lacker was uncomfortable with this arrangement    I am certainly very uncomfortable with it  But for whatever reason, our system is not working   the way it should in order to address the crisis in a quick and timely way  Until the   reinforcements arrive, I don’t think we have much choice but to try to work with other parts of   the government to prevent a financial meltdown  But I am very sympathetic to the view that the   faster we can get a comprehensive, appropriate fiscal response—and that is the goal of the new   Administration—the better off the country will be and the better off the Federal Reserve will be   Okay If there are no other questions, maybe we could turn to the main topic of inflation   objectives Let me make just a couple of very short introductory comments  First of all,   obviously, we have talked about this issue many times before  I think in 1995 President Yellen   was involved in a debate or a discussion on this topic, so it is an oldie but goodie  The reason   that there has been interest—and I feel this interest has welled up to some extent from the   Committee as a whole—is that, in the current situation, there are some circumstances that might   make an explicit numerical objective more attractive   There are a number of considerations, but the two I would mention are, first, that we do   face, if not deflation, certainly some disinflation; and disinflation, if it proceeds too quickly, can   be counterproductive because it raises real interest rates  So to the extent that we can, through   expectations management or policy communication, reduce disinflationary pressures, that is a   positive  This is one way perhaps to do that  At the same time that we are using every power we   have to try to fight this incredible crisis, there are concerns on the other side that, by expanding   our balance sheet and the like, we risk inflation increasing in the medium term  It is important           January 16, 2009 15 of 69  for us to communicate that we will be effective and timely in removing that stimulus, so that we   will not have an inflation problem during the exit from our current policies  In that respect, there   may be some special features of the current environment that make this topic worth thinking   about once again   Now, we have been through this process a number of times  As I mentioned, we have   made some steps in this direction with our communication strategy—our projections, for   example, particularly the long-term projections we are planning for January  So I think the   question is whether we want to take another step  If so, what should it be?  We all agree—and   we have discussed it also on numerous occasions—that this has to be managed very carefully   from a political perspective  I think we need to go slowly on that front  Don and I and the staff   met this morning with some representatives of the Administration  I did not detect any strong   opposition on the substance, but they didn’t want to incur heavy political costs themselves or use   up political capital at the beginning of the Administration  Their view was that whatever we did   needed to be very carefully managed to avoid getting blown out of proportion in the political   sphere So we will work very carefully and closely with the Administration in thinking about   this, not only in the substantive details but also in terms of the political communication   One point that was made in the meeting this morning, which may affect our thinking on   timing if we do decide to go forward, is that the new President has already appointed one   member of the Board and will have two more slots to fill  We should pay attention to the   schedule of appointments, and to the extent that appointments by the new President can be   known and can be consulted in this process, it might ease the political consideration somewhat    That is something we may have to take into account, and it may somewhat affect our timing                                                                  January 16, 2009 16 of 69  So we do want to discuss today a bit of the substance of what we would like to do  But I   think we should all have a sensitivity—whatever steps we take—to the need to do it very   carefully from a political perspective and perhaps think about the extent of the change, the step   we want to take, to balance a more dramatic or discrete step against whatever additional costs or   risks there might be from a political perspective  I just want to emphasize that and note that it   probably suggests that we should go a little more slowly than at the January meeting  Certainly   it is a good idea at this point to get a sense of the Committee’s preferences to give me guidance   in doing my consultation and getting feedback on further steps   Let me turn now to Brian Madigan to introduce the topic, and then we will do a go-round   on this issue Brian   Thank you, Brian Are there any questions for Brian?  If   not, would anyone like to comment on this issue?  I see President Yellen  President Yellen   Thank you We have had some work here by the staff   about what kind of press release we might do, and the focus has been on explaining how it   relates to the dual mandate in some particular situations  So I think this is absolutely right   President Plosser   President Evans   Thank you  President Bullard   President Lacker   Thank you very much  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Hoenig   Thank you, President Hoenig  President Stern   President Rosengren   Thank you  Governor Kohn   Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you  President Fisher—back from the Galapagos, by   the way   Thank you First Vice President Cumming   Thank you  Governor Warsh                                   January 16, 2009 52 of 69  Thank you  Governor Duke   Thank you all very much  Let me just try to summarize a bit   what I heard and make a few additional comments  We have had this discussion a number of times                       January 16, 2009 54 of 69  before, but I actually am learning, and I think the views are evolving, becoming more subtle, and in   many ways converging  So I do find it useful, and I appreciate everybody’s willingness to   participate in this   I was going to say before the last two or three speakers that I thought we had a pretty broad   agreement with the idea in principle  Now, maybe I cannot quite say that at the end of the round,   but it is still the case that purely in principle it seems that the great majority of the Committee is   comfortable with the idea of inflation targets  Again, abstracting for the moment from political and   other considerations, the Committee made both the general arguments that we have heard before   about anchoring inflation expectations, reducing uncertainty, improving communication, and the   like, while noting that there are some special features now including risk of deflation and concerns   about inflation that might make a communication device of this type particularly useful   I think there is wide agreement in the Committee that an inflation target is not only   consistent with the dual mandate but also supportive of the dual mandate in general and that our   policies already approximate inflation targeting in that respect  Such a change would affect   communication more than policy  For the most part, people agreed this would not affect our ability   to address financial stability issues, although Governor Kohn mentioned the asset bubble question    I think that is an interesting question  Just speaking parenthetically, when Mark Gertler and I wrote   on this in Jackson Hole as academics about ten years ago, I think our message was misunderstood;   our message was not so much that bubbles are unimportant but rather that a strong inflation-oriented   policy would, as a side effect, be an effective response to bubbles  But, anyway, there is an   interaction, but most people today did not feel that it could not be overcome  So, again, on general   principles, I hear pretty widespread support for the idea                                January 16, 2009 55 of 69  In terms of specifics, there remain some not heartfelt but nevertheless some differences   about the details of what an inflation-targeting program would look like  There remains some   disagreement about the PCE versus the CPI  One place in which there is agreement is that the   headline inflation number is the right one—certainly if the range we are looking at is longer than a   year or two  I thought perhaps a slight majority was in favor of a point as opposed to a range, but it   was not overwhelming  For the actual number, I actually expected maybe slightly more interest in   moving up from our so-called comfort zones, given our recent experience with deflation risk and   zero lower bound There was a bit of that, but people are still mostly in the 1½ to 2 percent range,   in general   On the horizon, I think most people are comfortable with the implications of a quadratic   objective function model that says basically that the horizon should be somewhat variable   depending on initial conditions and preferences, although a couple of people talked about having a   more long-run perspective that would be more aspirational and not as constraining in the short term    There were a couple of interesting comments about having more information about our funds rate   expectations, which is something that we have not explicitly talked about much before and that we   need to think about over time  Certainly it is a direction that some central banks have decided to go    There was not much support for price-level targeting, as being too complex an approach and too   hard to communicate   Let me say a word about the projections, particularly in light of the consensus that, if we are   going to proceed with a target, we should not do it in a precipitate way  I think that there was a   pretty reasonable consensus—and I myself would support it—that we should go ahead with the   long-term projections that we discussed and were recommended by the Subcommittee on   Communications and that we should think about how we communicate those long-term projections                     January 16, 2009 56 of 69  and how that might be either a terminal point for the time being or a further step in the direction of   an explicit Committee target  So I think we ought to go ahead with that  I heard a lot of appropriate   concern about the political process, and I agree with it  I think it is a very difficult period  In some   ways this could be a propitious time because of concerns about deflation, for example  Periods in   which there are concerns about deflation are periods when there is not, in a congressperson’s point   of view, a tradeoff between inflation and growth, but rather inflation is in some sense promoting   growth So in some ways it is propitious and opportunistic, as President Evans described it  But I   think fairness to the process and fairness to the fact that we want to have a longer-term decision here   suggest that we need to do this very carefully  I will undertake to test the waters very carefully and   with great sensitivity to the reactions that I get both from the Administration and from the Congress   A point that President Plosser made, which I think was a very good one, was that it is not   enough to give a target or an objective but that it is important to be very transparent about the   linkages between our objectives and the actions that we are talking  I think this is very important,   particularly in the current circumstances, when we are working with such unusual tools and the   relationships between our tools and our objectives are much less clear even to us than normal  So I   am very much in favor going forward, whether or not we decide to have an explicit objective, of   doing everything we can collectively and individually to provide information and clarity about the   tools we are using and how we expect them to affect the economy and what our anticipations are for   the future in terms of using those tools, the criteria we will be using, and so on  I think that   transparency in general—if we think about this in a broader framework—is extraordinarily   important right now, and an explicit objective could be part of that  But even if it is not part of that,   creating more certainty for and understanding by the public about what we are doing is unusually   important in this context                             January 16, 2009 57 of 69  To summarize, I have heard a very interesting discussion  It has been very helpful  I hear   for the most part support for the idea of an explicit objective in principle  However, if we were to   move in that direction, there was considerable concern that we do it in such a way that it does not   use up too much political capital, create a backlash, or even create concerns that we were off   message  We would have to explain very carefully why this is not an off-message step  I would   propose to continue to discuss and evaluate this option and to do some gentle testing of it with the   various political actors and meanwhile to continue with the projections, with transparency efforts,   and with our discussion of this within the Committee as we go forward  So let me just stop there    We do not have to come to any conclusions today  I do think it is clear that it is very unlikely that   we would take a vote in January, at the next meeting in 10 days, on this matter, but I will continue to   report to you on what reactions I get as I test this out a bit   If it is okay, why don’t we just turn for a few minutes to the last item on the agenda, which   is the meeting structure  We received a couple of letters on this, which were posted  We are   obviously facing important challenges substantively in terms of finding a set of policies that will   address the financial instability and its consequences, and in doing so, we have been very creative   and have engaged in a number of unorthodox policies  Those policies, in turn, have created   governance and collaboration issues  As I discussed at the last meeting, I think fundamentally the   only solution for us if we want to, on the one hand, get the right policies and, on the other hand, to   work effectively is to do this in a collaborative and mutually respectful way  As a step toward   facilitating that collaboration, I asked the staff to propose a structure of the FOMC meeting, which   you received  Let me just talk about it for a couple of minutes  I do not know if we want to do a   whole go-round, although I am happy to sit here as long as people want to comment, but I would be   happy to take comments or questions about it                            January 16, 2009 58 of 69  Although the Board has responsibility for the section 13(3) credit policies, these policies   obviously have implications for overall monetary policy, including the effects on the balance sheet,   the effects on our dual mandate, and importantly, the exit strategy, which we discussed today as   well So there clearly is an interest of the FOMC to have oversight for and input into the credit   policies that are being used by the Federal Reserve   We discussed at the last meeting and I would reiterate why I think that setting a target, say,   for the size of the balance sheet or the monetary base, as attractive as that might be in the sense of   being similar to setting a federal funds rate target, is probably not a good way to go about it because   of the heterogeneity of the programs that we are using and the difficulty of summarizing them in a   single number  An additional point about using a single number is that, given that with many of the   facilities we have the usage is determined by demand rather than by supply, it is often the case that   when conditions worsen we get more demand  If we have a fixed target for the base or for the   balance sheet, we would perversely be tightening supply in periods just when the facilities are more   useful to the markets  Again, I do not think that setting a target for the base or for the balance sheet   is a very good summary statistic, not to mention the fact that many of our programs have variable   sizes and, therefore, it is not straightforward that we could even meet such an objective   So how can we set this up in a way to work effectively together?  The memorandum that   was circulated discussed a possible structure for the meeting  Let me go through it very quickly    First, I proposed to make the meeting a joint FOMC–Board meeting  The purpose of doing that   would be to ensure that there is no barrier to discussing any of the programs, including those that are   legally the province of the Board, and to emphasize that this is a collaborative process as we work   together on these various policies  The second element would be that the usual briefing about   financial markets and the economy would be expanded to include a regular discussion of our                     January 16, 2009 59 of 69  various facilities, their usage, their effects on markets, their implications for the exit strategy and for   the balance sheet, and any plans or proposals that might exist for future changes or additional   programs so that there would be full information for the full Committee on these programs and our   evaluation of their effects  I propose that, after that and after a Q&A, we have an informal   discussion, not necessarily a go-round, just to get a sense of the Committee about various aspects of   these programs and their effects on monetary policy  I think I should reiterate—as everyone knows,   but I am going to state it again—that many of the components of these programs are, in fact, FOMC   responsibilities, including those related to open market operations, to swaps, and to purchases of   securities like GSE debt So to the extent that we want to make changes or discuss possible future   programs in those areas, we can do that certainly as a Committee and make decisions at some point   during the meeting   With respect to the Board’s 13(3) facilities, I think it is entirely appropriate for us to have a   full discussion of the implications of those present or future facilities for monetary policy and for   the exit strategy  I think that the Committee ought to express its views on the implications of those   programs and that the Board should and will fully take into account those views in whatever actions   it decides to take  Following this discussion there would be the normal economic outlook go-round   and the policy go-round, and there would be further opportunities for comments from the FOMC   participants  Then, of course, our discussions and actions would be reflected in the statement and in   the minutes  It was suggested—I think President Lacker suggested it—that another place to have   this discussion would be in the policy go-round, and I am perfectly fine with that  I think the   advantage of having some discussion at the beginning of the meeting is to give people a chance to   hear what others have to say and to get some sense of the Committee  Then in the policy go-round,                                January 16, 2009 60 of 69  if people have views that they would like to express at that point, that will be informed by an earlier   discussion  So I see no conflict with that   That’s my general recommendation  I will say just one more word about an alternative  An   alternative would be to have some kind of formal vote, resolution, sense of the Committee about   balance sheet programs  I am open to discussion of any such proposal, but I would just point out   that, again, effectively the only programs affecting the balance sheet that are not under the direct   control of the FOMC are the 13(3) credit facilities  At this point going forward, it looks as though   we have the TALF and maybe variants of the TALF for the main direction that it is going to go  So   I think it would be really quite effective for the Board to bring such proposals before the Committee   and get their input and views, and it would probably be a more straightforward way to manage it    But I am not wedded to anything  I really want to make sure that the Committee is comfortable that   it is fully exercising its authority and responsibility and that its views are being taken into account as   the Board takes any actions related to credit facilities and the like  Those are just some thoughts,   and I guess I would emphasize finally that whatever we do for January is an experiment  We can   see how it works, and we can evolve over time as we gain experience and information  But let me   stop there and just invite any comments or questions on this general topic  President Plosser   Thank you  President Stern                  January 16, 2009 62 of 69  Thank you  President Evans   Thanks  I hope the kind of analysis that we can do for the   Committee will be complementary with improving our explanation for the public as we develop   metrics and criteria  Governor Duke   I think that is a good suggestion  But you said intermeeting   period, and I think we would probably want to look at longer horizons as well   That’s a good suggestion  Anybody else?  President Fisher   Thank you  President Bullard   Well, I think a more accessible way to say what you said was   going back to what President Evans said and what Governor Duke said, which is to have forecasts   or projections of the balance sheet, perhaps under different scenarios  That is a way essentially of   trying to figure out what the permanent component is or what the longer-maturity component is   under different scenarios  Any other questions or comments?  Again, it has been a long and very   fruitful discussion, and I look forward to seeing you in Washington in about 10 days  Thank you   END OF MEETING      "
8652,2009-01-27,BERNANKE," Good afternoon, everybody  Last night Michelle Smith and   I attended the swearing in of Tim Geithner by Vice President Biden, with President Obama in   attendance So we now have a new Treasury Secretary  There will be a dinner tonight after the   meeting at which we will honor Tim and say good-bye from this post as he goes into another    This is a new year and new things, and so this morning the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   announced their new President—Bill Dudley Congratulations, Bill  You made it all the way   across the table [Laughter, followed by applause]  We welcome you and look forward to   working with you in your new capacity   As you know, Governor Kroszner resigned in anticipation   of the appointment of the new Governor, Dan Tarullo  But Dan has not yet cleared the Senate,   so obviously he won’t be attending the meeting, which leaves the Governors here as an   embattled few, [laughter] and I think the lowest number of sitting Governors probably in a very   long time    Thank you Let me also welcome the new members cycling   into the FOMC as voting members—Jeff Lacker, Charlie Evans, Dennis Lockhart, and Janet   Yellen The first part of the meeting is the annual organizational part for the FOMC, so we will   be just in FOMC mode for the next few minutes  After we do that business, we will go into a   joint Board–FOMC meeting, as earlier I discussed and we talked about this new way of                January 27–28, 2009 5 of 267  operating We need to begin with the election of Committee officers  I need a motion for   appointment of the Chairman   Is there a second?   Without objection  Thank you all very much     I need to recognize you again, Governor Kohn   Is there a second?   PARTICIPANT Second   Without objection  Thank you Now the staff officers of   the FOMC Debbie, would you please read the list?   Thank you May I have a motion?   Without objection  Thank you The next item on the   agenda is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open   Market Account Sorry, am I on the wrong item here?  Is that a different order?  Okay I’m   sorry, I missed an item  Item 2 is a proposed revision to the program for security of FOMC   information  You received a memo from Scott Alvarez and Debbie Danker  This appeared to be   mostly minor procedural changes to the rules  The most substantive change was a rule affecting   the access to confidential information of people who are not regular employees—ie,   consultants Are there any questions for Scott or Debbie or any comments?  A motion, please?   Without objection  Thank you  All right Now we go on to   item 3, selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to operate the SOMA  In a shocking development,   the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has again expressed willingness to serve in this capacity    [Laughter] In this context, I would like to take note of a memo that was sent to the Committee   by Louise Roseman and the Division of Reserve Bank Operations about their assessment of the   controls and procedures related to the SOMA and the management of the various new facilities    They found that those controls were effective and that the SOMA activities complied with   established directives, guidelines, and procedures  So I think the report we have is that New        January 27–28, 2009 7 of 267  York is doing a fine job and should continue to carry out this function  May I have a motion,   please?   Second Comment?  Without objection  Thank you   Item 4 is the selection of the manager of the System Open Market Account  We now have   changing leadership in New York, and therefore we are not quite ready to select a permanent   manager or to vote  Prior to the meeting, I appointed Trish Mosser as temporary manager of the   Open Market Desk  We will come back to the Committee for a vote when a permanent position   is established   Okay Now that Trish is here, she gets to do some work, I guess  We have three items—   5, 6, and 7 a proposed revision to the authorization for domestic open market operations, a   proposed revision to the authorization for foreign-currency operations, and a proposed treatment   of the guidelines for the conduct of system open market operations in federal agency issues    Trish, could you talk about all three of those briefly, please?   Could you go through all three, please?   Thank you I would like to comment on the implications of   items 5 and 7, in particular for our GSE purchase program  In late November, as you know, I   directed the Open Market Desk to begin a program of purchasing MBS and agency debt, based   on the authorizations to do that and a consultation by phone that Don and I had with all the   members of the FOMC  At the time, I felt comfortable with that decision  Since then, given   how central the MBS purchase program has become to our policy and given the issues of   governance that have been raised and we have all discussed, I now believe that I made a mistake   in doing that—I should have consulted more closely and then taken a vote of the FOMC  So I   want to pledge to you that I will not take any similar actions in the future without a formal   consultation Now, the effect of item 5 is essentially to make that part of the rules  Item 5 puts   the substantial changes in the portfolio on the same footing as a change in the federal funds   rate—ie, the strong presumption is that this will be done in formal consultation with the   Committee and that the Chairman retains the right to make intermeeting adjustments but only in        January 27–28, 2009 10 of 267  situations where consultation is not feasible  Again, I believe this is the right direction in which   to go, and I support making that change   On item 7, on the guidelines for purchases of agencies, I think this is a useful   clarification I also support this  But I would like to at least record that, in my own view, I don’t   think that our MBS purchase program is credit allocation in the sense that this guideline was   intended to address—for several reasons First, to my mind, credit allocation involves a   preference for a certain class of borrowers relative to what normally functioning markets would   throw up In this case, the issue is not an attempt to distort allocations away from some efficient   outcome; rather, it is our intention to try to make markets work better and to bring us closer to a   normal market outcome  Second, I view the MBS purchase program as being really very close to   monetary policy in spirit and intent in that we are trying to address broad issues of   macroeconomic stability by stimulating an important component of aggregate demand  So we   are using this particular tool not because we have a preference for housing but because we are   trying to stimulate overall aggregate demand  Indeed, as you know, we are in fact looking at   various types of credit in order to achieve that  I think this is similar to the normal use of   monetary policy, which affects different sectors differently, not because we have a preference for   one sector or another but because our tools allow us to address different components of   aggregate demand with different force   I am saying all of this because I do have this view, and I want to get it out on the table    Nevertheless, I think it is a clarification and useful for us to formally suspend these guidelines   for the time being  That is my take  Let me open the floor for comments and questions on any   of these three items  President Fisher                 January 27–28, 2009 11 of 267  President Lacker   Certainly Other questions or comments?  All right If we   are ready to vote, then, why don’t we do them separately, beginning first with the revision to the   Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations  Do we have a motion?   Are there any objections?  Any “no” votes?  Everybody   okay?  I take that as unanimous  Second, the revision to the Authorization for Foreign Currency   Operations I need a motion   Thank you Are there any objections?  “No” votes?   Hearing none Third, the proposed treatment of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System   Operations in Federal Agency Issues  Given what President Lacker said, why don’t we call the   roll on this one    Thank you All right  That covers the organizational items    At this point I would like to convene a Board meeting joint with the FOMC  I need a motion to   close the meeting   All right Thank you  So now for the rest of today and   tomorrow, we will be in joint session  Let’s turn now to our regular Desk reports, starting with   Trish, and these reports will include not only our regular financial updates but also the broader   discussion of balance sheet issues and so on that we talked about at our videoconference  Trish                                                                        1 The materials used by Ms Mosser and Mr Hilton are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 27–28, 2009 14 of 267  Thank you That was very informative and a lot to digest as   well Let me just remind the Committee that the only action item in the list, other than the   ratification of domestic open market operations, is the proposal to extend the programs  The   discussions of Treasury purchases and foreign-currency swaps are just for information at this   point We will have an opportunity in a few minutes to have a discussion on these issues, but   before we do that, let me first see if there are any questions for our colleagues  Any questions   for Trish or her colleagues?  President Rosengren   There is a tradeoff between giving people the assurance of a   long period, and flexibility—not committing our balance sheet for an extended period  But I   agree with you that, if we do this, we ought to revisit it earlier rather than close to the date   President Evans   Vice Chairman, did you have an intervention?   President Lacker, do you have an intervention?   There’s an element of hedging here  President Fisher   President Lockhart   Other questions?  If not, we can go to a Committee   discussion We are going to have two more go-rounds in which everybody gets to state their   views, so I was hoping that instead of a go-round we could have a more interactive, unstructured   discussion of the issues that have been raised by the presentations  If you allow me, I would like   to start by just posting you on a few items and making a few comments, and then we will open   the floor for discussion   I think it is important to understand that the calls on our balance sheet and our programs   will be very much conditioned by the decisions being made in the Administration and the   Congress about the kinds of support they are intending to provide and the approach they are   going to take As you know, Tim Geithner, who was sworn in just yesterday, is overseeing the   work with the remainder of the TARP and perhaps an expansion of the TARP, depending on   how things go Staff members at the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks have been working   very extensively on programs with our fellow bank regulators and have provided a great deal of   support and information to the Treasury as they have been trying to think about how to go about   stabilizing the banking system           January 27–28, 2009 35 of 267  It seems clear at this point that any solution they are going to come up with is going to   have at least two components  One would be the removal of bad assets in some way from the   balance sheets of the banks For that purpose, there has been discussion, as you know, of an   aggregator bank, ring-fencing, or some kind of insurance program that would allow banks to   purchase insurance against tail risk for their assets  The second component that is almost certain   to be involved would be capital  But there are a lot of open issues  What is the appropriate   instrument, what control rights would be associated with it, should the capital be put in just in   time or should it be put in preemptively to make sure that there is coverage for subsequent losses,   and what would be the ultimate cost?  In particular, will the remaining monies in the TARP be   sufficient? I think the smart money is betting no  In addition, the Treasury is working on the   foreclosure programs, which will probably involve up to $50 billion to $100 billion of the TARP,   and is looking to support credit markets  I assume that the TALF would be part of that program   I have had a few very preliminary discussions with Tim Geithner about the consequences   for these programs, for the Federal Reserve, and tried to talk about our priorities and our   concerns I think it is a bit strong to say that I am looking for a new Fed–Treasury accord here,   but maybe not that strong  This is a good opportunity, the next couple of months, as planning is   done and as the Administration goes to the Congress and makes requests, to try to clarify as   much as possible what role the Fed is expected to play  In particular, I think we should be as   allergic as possible to (a) long-term commitments of our balance sheet because of the difficulty   of unwinding and (b) credit risk Those are the two things that concern us  For example, if we   do an aggregator bank, it would be important to make sure that it is financed not by long-term   Federal Reserve liquidity but by, as one option, private financing guaranteed by the FDIC,   although I think the Fed should be open to doing short-term collateralized lending, as it would              January 27–28, 2009 36 of 267  for any bank, as part of that process  Likewise, if ring-fencing becomes part of the plan, I would   defend our actions with respect to two large banks, where we have taken tail risk positions as   being necessary for financial stability  But going forward, I hope that we will find solutions that   don’t involve that kind of glitchy approach   I think that the top priority is to try to get the bank resolution program done in a way that   is consistent with good practices on our part I have a couple of other requests for Tim, and I   should just emphasize this is very, very preliminary  I have no commitments  Ideally, one   would be that, if the government at some point does develop a resolution trust company or an   aggregator bank, they should consider, for example, taking off our balance sheet some of the   assets that we have acquired at our Maiden Lane facilities  Second, an important issue for us   would be the management of the exit strategy  The Treasury has already requested from us some   memorandums on the supplementary financing bills and on the Fed bills idea, and I believe that   they will give serious consideration as to how they can assist us in the exit   The lowest priority for me at this point would be the TALF-like approach, for two   reasons at least One is that it is an effective approach that will not happen unless the Fed is   involved, because of the TARP scoring method—the fact that the TARP is scored in terms of the   full amount that is lent or purchased rather than in terms of some measure of credit risk    Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the Congress would give any kind of authorization that   would allow for the TALF to continue, absent some kind of Fed cooperation  I would also argue   that the TALF is much closer to conventional central bank activity than some of the other things   that we are concerned about—ie, it is given the capital support from the Treasury, it is protected   from credit risk, and it is mostly short-term lending  For those reasons, I would put that as   lowest priority Obviously, I think that, as much as possible, we need to cooperate and work           January 27–28, 2009 37 of 267  with the Treasury to try to get the banking system and the economy stabilized  But this is an   opportunity, and I will do what I can to try to get assurances from the Treasury about how things   will evolve in the future   In my view, the main constraint will be certainly not the goodwill of the Treasury or of   the Administration but rather the constraints that they face in dealing with the Congress  As you   know, the TARP and the bank stabilization programs are extremely unpopular  It is going to   take a certain amount of political capital to get additional resources  Therefore, they are going to   have to dole out their political capital in a quite sparing way  But I will continue to work on   these issues, and I understand that they are important to the Committee   I support the extension of the programs to October  We did discuss going over year-end    The tradeoff is the commitment to a longer outstanding funding, but I do think that we ought to   revisit that in a timely way  On Treasury purchases, I would like to reiterate what Trish said  I   think that there is good reason to keep this on the table, that it is not really a good idea to throw   away this option at this point, but that it is probably not an efficient way to use those balance   sheet capacities at this juncture  So I would agree with the recommendation of the staff on that,   and I think part of our discussion certainly tomorrow in the policy round would be exactly how   to express that in our statement language   Just a couple of other comments First, one of the issues, which you can see in the press   commentary—“murky new territory,” “unknown, uncharted waters,” et cetera, et cetera—is that,   clearly, for us to be successful with our current set of policies, it is important for us to be as open   and transparent as possible and to provide as much information as possible  I want you to know   that we have here at the Board, in cooperation with the Reserve Banks, a new transparency   initiative which has at least two parts, maybe three  One is that Governor Kohn has consented to              January 27–28, 2009 38 of 267  head a committee that is going to review all of the information associated with our balance sheet,   the programs, collateral, and all of those things and ask the question, for information that we do   not release, whether we have a good, strong policy justification for not releasing it  If not, then   we should be as forthcoming as possible about providing the public with information about the   collateral, about the programs, and so on  So that is ongoing  I will have a hearing on February   10, when I will discuss these issues in front of Barney Frank’s committee, and I have a speech at   the National Press Club the week after that, when I will address the press and let them ask   questions about these issues   The other part of the transparency initiative is to try to make our programs more   accessible to the general public, including the media, congressional staffers, and the like  We   have an effort under way to develop a website, essentially, that will link to all of the information   that we have and that will provide overall discussion and education about our various programs,   which we hope to get going within a month at the latest  I think the educational aspect of this is   very important in trying to get people more comfortable with the regime that we are operating in,   given the constraint on the federal funds rate   Finally, going along with our discussion about extending the various facilities, I should   tell you that, using the authority vested in me, I extended the TAF—the auction facility—until   the end of the quarter at the current level of $150 billion  So that particular item goes to the end   of March But that is an authority, as I understand it, that we can use here at the Board  Okay I   have taken a good bit of time  Let me stop and turn to President Lacker for comment or   discussion on the issues of the balance sheet   Thank you I think, in principle, that we agree that it would   be better to have all of this done by the Treasury  I think we have to accept political realities,   prioritize, and try to address the most important issues first and see how far we can get   On Treasuries versus other purchases, I don’t want to get deeply into it, but any kind of   model without perfect, complete markets has to recognize the existence of liquidity premiums,   which can differ across markets and which affect the effect of a given amount of demand on a   purchase of a given asset So it isn’t evident that applying our purchasing power on assets where   markets are deep and liquid and liquidity premiums are low would have the same effect as on   other markets where liquidity premiums are high  But I am just addressing that there is a reason   that it is not a purely neutral operation  Yes?   Vice Chairman   President Fisher, you had a two-handed intervention?           January 27–28, 2009 47 of 267  Trish?   President Plosser has been very patient  May I turn to you?   President Lacker, you had a quick two-hander?        January 27–28, 2009 55 of 267  Okay   I am going to regret this, but I am going to ask you a   question [Laughter]  Do you think the United States economy is at a Pareto efficient point at   this moment?   With the best position we can be at right now?   The question was, Is the United States economy at a Pareto   efficient point at this moment?  And the answer was “yes”  Okay So that is obviously a   different view   Okay   Yes   Let me just say in response to President Plosser, I should   tell everyone that, assuming that we extend these programs and the swaps, we will not announce             January 27–28, 2009 59 of 267  anything until Thursday morning because we want to coordinate with the foreign central banks    Is that correct?   So, first of all, obviously, please keep it confidential  But   could I ask the Board and the New York staff to have at least a discussion about the two   programs that President Plosser mentioned, the GSE approval and the AMLF  I think I would   propose to extend the AMLF today as part of the package, but the Board would have the ability   to reverse that tomorrow by notation vote if we decide that we get some kind of support  Okay   I understand that, but what I am saying is that I am hearing   what you are saying, and I think we ought to look at that particular program  We have to be a   little careful because we don’t have a lot of advance time here But we should look at that   President Lacker, quickly   President Hoenig, on that note—           January 27–28, 2009 60 of 267  Thank you  President Rosengren   President Plosser   President Plosser, we do have a shadow value on our   balance sheet constraint, right? So we do have limits to what we can do, and so we have to make   choices about where the impact will be most effective and where it will be the best for the   economy  Vice Chairman Dudley and then President Rosengren, and then I am going to go   without hesitation to President Evans, who has been waiting   President Rosengren—quickly   Thank you President Evans   I certainly agree that you cannot trust academics    [Laughter] President Lockhart   Well, we have a mark-to-market loss on the Bear Stearns   assets in Maiden Lane I We don’t have mark-to-market losses in anything else  What would be   ideal would be to work out some arrangement  It would take some accounting work, but at   Maiden Lane I, we have a letter from the Treasury saying that the Treasury will bear those losses   through seigniorage, and there should be some way to arrange an asset called future reductions of   seigniorage or something like that that would make us whole  I think that those things can be   worked through, but obviously there is a lot of technical work to be done on that   That has not come up   The fiscal package has a great deal of money for states and   localities, which would probably be the primary source of support for those   I do want to pick up on what President Evans and President   Rosengren said, which is that I think it is possible to set criteria, but there is a constraint on how   much we can do in terms of both size and duration and, of course, limits on credit risk  Given   those constraints, we have to make choices  Although I do not think that this is actually science   here, I do think we can try to think about, for example, interest-sensitive sectors or sectors in   which our interventions will have particularly strong effects on liquidity premiums and the like    So it is not science, but I do think there is a sense in which we can make those choices and in   which we are constrained But I recognize that this is a whole new field   I would make the comment that I have had recent conversations with foreign leaders,   including Prime Minister Brown—all of whom said that the Federal Reserve is leading the way    The United Kingdom is undertaking these programs  Japan is undertaking these programs  It is   becoming a new approach  When you hit zero, you have to think about other ways to affect the   economy, and so at least in that respect we are not the outlier anymore  President Yellen   Let me turn to Governor Kohn and then take a coffee break    Then we can continue if people are so inclined  Governor Kohn   Thank you Why don’t we take a coffee break until 430,   and then if anyone else would like to enter in when we come back, that would be fine   [Coffee break]   Okay Let’s resume  I do not want to cut anyone off   Would anyone else like to comment?  President Bullard   Let me say something about these frictions and why we can   affect them  There are two frictions that I think are important  One of them relates to the friction   of illiquidity  It is a tradition of central banking that we lend against illiquid assets when there is   a panic run, and we know that panic runs are equilibrium phenomena and they can occur even   though the assets are worth more than the liabilities  I would argue that that kind of phenomenon   has generalized into a lot of aspects of our economy—for example, the funding of various kinds   of off-balance-sheet instruments, the commercial paper market, the money market mutual funds,   and lots of other vehicles—and a lot of what we are doing is very much consistent in spirit with   the idea of providing backup liquidity to allow firms to meet redemption demands without   having to sell off assets into illiquid markets  I think that is the thrust of a lot of what we are   trying to do   The other type of friction that I think is important has to do with information capital    There is a sense in which the capital of the banking system is the most important wealth in the   world because it supports the information gathering and other institutional activities that banks   can do When, for whatever reason, there is a loss of bank capital and their activities are   restrained and they are not able to make full use of the information and other skills that they   have; that is a problem  I would argue that in a world where there are other frictions—sticky        January 27–28, 2009 79 of 267  prices or wages, for example—the inability of the banks to fully use their information capital to   extend credit and make loans and make markets will lead to a bad outcome for the economy as a   whole The intellectual argument then is that there is a social benefit, a social externality, to   providing more capital, and that is what a lot of the TARP and these other things involve   Now, traditionally in your comment about credit, it is not easy to make a clear distinction    There is always the issue of liquidity versus solvency and so on, but it is not easy to make a clear   distinction between lending against solvent but illiquid assets versus providing capital for   informationally intensive agents, like banks  So that line is not completely clear  But by history   and tradition, the central bank has always leaned toward liquidity provision  The government   has always leaned toward credit allocation  I think that is a distinction that is worth trying to   preserve, although admittedly we are not always going to do it perfectly  So I think we can   specify what the frictions are, make coherent sense of them, and try to explain how our actions   are related to them   Well, we have taken on credit risk in emergency situations,   as you know But as I promised at the beginning, I think to the extent that we can use the   opportunity of a new Administration and so on to clarify responsibilities in a better way, then we   ought to do so I think we all appreciate what an extraordinary situation we are in and have   experienced for the last eighteen months  A lot of what we are doing is requiring our good sense   and historical knowledge and our intuition  But as I think maybe the Vice Chairman mentioned,        January 27–28, 2009 80 of 267  we do not really have the historical basis for all of the things that we are having to deal with   here President Lacker   Thank you  President Stern           January 27–28, 2009 81 of 267  Thank you  President Lockhart   As you point out, an important point is that institutional   structures, contracts, and so on are endogenous, and policy affects them  But we are in a   situation at this point where past is past and what is sunk is sunk  We have to deal with the                    January 27–28, 2009 82 of 267  situation And it is very, very important for us to go forward to try to change the legal structure,   the regulatory structure, and even Federal Reserve operating procedures in ways that will   encourage more-stable systems in the future  But at the moment, the fire is burning, and we have   to think about that   Yes, that is right All right Unless there is anyone else, let   me thank you for a very useful discussion  I am sure that we will have more in the future, but   this really sets the parameters and the issues  I took many things away from this discussion  One   of them is that we need to keep thinking about our metrics regarding the efficiency and efficacy   of our programs—in particular, how the shadow value of duration or illiquidity in our balance   sheet is matched against the benefits of a particular program that has certain implications for our   balance sheet I would challenge the staff—as all the hard tasks go to the staff—to think more   about how we can evaluate the efficacy of our programs, in particular, and the opportunity costs   as well, in terms of the space they take up or the duration that we create in our balance sheet    One useful exercise that we ought to be thinking about is, if we were to go another step, where   would it be and on what criteria would it be decided  That would perhaps answer the question   about there being no plan, no control, and no delimiting factors  I think that we can make   progress on trying to answer these questions  It is not going to happen immediately, but I hope   over time it will help        January 27–28, 2009 83 of 267  I agree with that, and I thought we would have done more   of that today, in fact But what we can do—and what we ought to think about for future   reference—is maybe scenarios as opposed to forecasts  That might be a better way to think   about it President Plosser   All right  If we are ready, we still have some votes to take   here Let me first ask the FOMC to do the routine ratification of domestic open market   operations Do I have a motion?   Any discussion?  All in favor?   PARTICIPANTS  Aye   Opposed?  Hearing no objection, thank you  All right   Now, to approve the extension of the programs, I would like to propose that we extend the list of   programs through October 30, as proposed by the staff  We should have some discussion about   the AMLF and others, recognizing that, even if we announce an extension, rationalization down           January 27–28, 2009 84 of 267  the road or restructuring is always a possibility  So this would be a motion for the Board to   extend the 13(3) programs   All Board members okay with this?  All right  Hearing no   objection, thank you We need from the FOMC a resolution to extend the swap arrangements   through October 30 A motion?   Further comments or discussion?  Any?  All right Any   objections?  Not hearing any objections, the motion is approved  We need a separate resolution   from the FOMC to extend the TSLF through October 30  Motion?   Any concerns, objections, or comments?  Hearing no   objections, thank you All right Let me remind you again that this is all confidential until   Thursday morning because we want to coordinate our announcements with other central banks,   and we will take the opportunity to at least look at the two programs that President Plosser   mentioned   Let me turn now to the economic situation  Boy, I think it has been a while since we   were three and a half hours into the meeting before we got to the staff forecast   Actually I do not want to give President Lacker any   concerns about whom he is listening to  So I want to introduce Dan Sichel, Karen Dynan, and   Trevor Reeve, who will be presenting the outlook  Dan                                                                  2 The materials used by Mr Sichel, Ms Dynan, and Mr Reeve are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 27–28, 2009 85 of 267  Thank you Do we have questions for the staff?  President   Plosser   Other questions for the staff?  President Bullard   We are doing Bayesian decision analysis and not classical   hypothesis testing here That is a very different proposition  President Lockhart   President Stern        January 27–28, 2009 108 of 267  It depends on the composition of the programs, too   President Fisher   Other questions?  President Lacker   It could go the other way  You could say that the trouble   with the fixed target is that it doesn’t allow for knowledge to accumulate  I mean, there really   has been another deflation scare, and it may affect our views   It would be interesting to compare the Senior Loan Officer   Opinion Survey over different cycles, for example                 January 27–28, 2009 114 of 267  Seeing no other questions, why don’t we adjourn for today,   and we will begin tomorrow the first thing—900 am—with the go-round  There is a reception   across the way and dinner   [Meeting recessed]        January 27–28, 2009 115 of 267  January 28, 2009—Morning Session   Good morning, everybody  On the announcement of the   extension of our various programs, we have had additional communication with the European   Central Bank, and they are well disposed toward extending the swap arrangement  But it turns   out that they need a few more days to get formal approval from the Governing Council  Their   proposal is that we announce next Tuesday morning so that they can get the approval on   Monday We have had some discussions about communication strategy, and the view appears to   be that putting all of our programs in one announcement is probably the best way to go because   otherwise you create questions about why this and not that  So although it puts some pressure on   our confidentiality and all the other things, I think the plan—and I would be happy to take   comments or advice—would be to hold off until next Tuesday morning to announce both the   swap extensions and the credit programs that we voted on yesterday   President Plosser, we did inquire about the AMLF and had some discussions—talked   with President Rosengren and his staff The view is that there are some complications and   difficulties with ending it in a peremptory way  We will continue to discuss that, but we think   for the moment we should not cancel it immediately  President Rosengren, would you like to   comment on that?   With the understanding that we will continue to look at all   these programs and review them and that we always have the option to restructure and   rationalize what we do Any thoughts or comments on the communication issue?  All right If   not, it is time for the economic go-round, and we will start with President Lockhart    Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you President Fisher   I think greater clarity on the TARP and the bank rescue   programs is essential, and it is obviously a very high priority for the Treasury and for the   government  I just want to comment that the animal spirit theory of the business cycle seems to   be getting some resuscitation here  President Evans   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you Anticipating for a moment the statement in the   policy round, there is a proposed sentence that says that the Committee anticipates a gradual   recovery later this year with downside risks  I am listening to the discussion about near-term   pessimism and concern and uncertainty, but then you mentioned your forecast of minus   08 percent for 2009, which arithmetically suggests that you do think there will be positive        January 27–28, 2009 141 of 267  economic growth later in the year, and I think many of the projections that we got were in the   same general ballpark  I just want to flag that as an issue for the next round, which is whether   we are comfortable talking about positive growth later in the year or whether we think we should   just remain agnostic on that  President Rosengren   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you President Lacker     January 27–28, 2009 144 of 267  Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor Kohn           January 27–28, 2009 148 of 267  Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you Thank you all very much Debbie informs me   that coffee is ready Why don’t we take a 20-minute break  Thank you   [Coffee break]   Why don’t we reconvene  I can start by offering a   summary of the discussion around the table, which was informative as always but fairly uniform   this time  The intermeeting data, as we have seen, indicate a very sharp contraction, both   domestically and abroad, which reflects in large part the effects of the intensification of the   financial crisis but also the increasingly powerful feedback loop from the economy to financial   conditions Many people noted that the financial conditions remain very fragile  Consumption,   employment, and production indicators suggest that the pronounced contraction in activity in the   fourth quarter is likely to continue through the first part of 2009  Participants noted that the   slowdown is very widespread across sectors Some participants expect a return to positive   economic growth later this year, citing such factors as fiscal policy, lower oil prices, inventory   adjustments, government efforts to stabilize the financial sector, and the possibility of improving   confidence However, uncertainty remains high, and risks are to the downside as sentiment is        January 27–28, 2009 163 of 267  currently very depressed Moreover, based on experiences with other financial crises, the   possibility of a protracted slump or L-shaped recovery remains significant   Some financial markets, including markets that have received Fed support, such as the   money and mortgage markets, have shown modest signs of improvement  However, bank losses   for the fourth quarter were greater than markets anticipated, and many institutions remain under   substantial stress Bank loans are declining with tighter terms, falling credit demand, and a lack   of creditworthy borrowers Very tight credit conditions are, in turn, affecting both households   and firms  Declining asset values are also affecting wealth and confidence, including declines in   defined-contribution pension plans  Whether the new government initiatives to stabilize banking   are successful will be an important factor in the outlook   Consumers continue to retrench, cutting back as balance sheets are repaired and   precautionary saving rises in an uncertain environment  Employment declines have been large,   with firms projecting further job cuts ahead, and there are wage and salary freezes occurring    Fiscal stimulus could also provide a boost to consumer income and support state and local   spending, which is currently contracted There has been little indication of stabilization in the   housing sector as house prices and building activity continue to decline  Nonresidential   construction is likely to fall as financing dries up and fundamentals weaken  A number of   participants expressed concern that commercial real estate could follow the path of residential   real estate Other investment has also contracted in light of prevailing uncertainties, including   uncertainties about government policy, tight credit, and low capacity utilization  Lower   commodity prices have affected drilling and mining activity and to a lesser extent agriculture    Exports and imports have both fallen sharply, reflecting both domestic and global slowdowns   and possibly lessened availability of trade finance           January 27–28, 2009 164 of 267  Inflation has fallen significantly and looks likely to be low in the medium term  There is   some risk that inflation could fall below levels consistent with good economic performance, and   some expressed concern about a deflationary trap possibly at the global level  However,   maintaining stable inflation expectations remains very important  Currently there appears to be   quite a bit of diversity in the public’s inflation expectations, including concerns about both   deflationary and inflationary outcomes  That is just a summary of comments I heard     I do not have a great deal to add on my own Let me make just a few remarks    Obviously, I share with everyone the observation that activity has fallen very rapidly, perhaps   not much more quickly than expected at our last meeting but still confirming the very substantial   effects of the financial crisis and the overall tightening in the credit markets  A somewhat bigger   surprise is the decline in global economies, which has been more severe than anticipated  On a   global basis, this seems very likely to be the worst postwar recession, and the global declines will   make it more difficult for the US economy to recover   As others have noted, there have been some marginal improvements in a few financial   markets, and the Fed’s programs, at least in those markets, seem to have had some benefits  We   have seen a little improvement in corporate bond markets as well  The most important news on   the financial side since the last meeting, though, has been the worse-than-expected results in the   banking system, the fact that we have had to go back and address instability in two of our largest   four banking organizations, despite the large injections of TARP capital  It is indicative of the   tremendous concerns about the stability of the banking system  The continuing credit losses   pose a real challenge both to the banking system and to efforts by the government and the   Treasury to restore stability           January 27–28, 2009 165 of 267  My general view is that, although fiscal policy could be helpful and will probably provide   some impetus later this year and next year, we may see something similar to what we saw in the   spring, which was a temporary boost and then very little sustained recovery unless we can get   substantial improvement in the banking situation  I share the same uncertainties about the   prospects of recovery or at least the beginning of positive economic growth later this year that   others have The Greenbook case relies fairly heavily on inventory dynamics  Currently   inventory liquidation is subtracting from growth, and so stabilizing final sales at zero by   midyear, which seems like an easy task, would be sufficient to give us some positive growth    That said, it is probably not such an easy thing to ensure that final sales stabilize  We should   expect to see continued declines in investment and in trade  We may see some growth in   government, obviously with the fiscal programs; but even so, to get to zero growth in final sales,   the Greenbook needs to forecast growth of about 2 percent in real consumption in the second half   of the year, which given current developments may not be so easy to obtain  So like many of   you, I guess that we will see a stabilization, perhaps some modest positive growth, in the latter   part of this year, but this is by no means a certainty  It will depend very substantially and   perhaps most fundamentally on achieving some stabilization in the banking sector  I don’t think   that other financial improvements will compensate for continued deterioration in bank balance   sheets   The next intermeeting period will be very important  It is of great significance that we   have now made it through the political transition period  I think it did create additional   uncertainty It is interesting that the implications of the March inauguration in 1933 were the   reason we pushed it back to January, and we may make it November 5 next time  [Laughter]   But I think it is good that we do have—political views notwithstanding one way or the other—a           January 27–28, 2009 166 of 267  new Administration with some political capital and with a mandate to take action, and we ought   to know a lot more by the next meeting about what those plans are and how the Federal Reserve   fits into the overall program for stabilization  So I think that this intermeeting period will be   critical   On inflation, I tend to take the conventional view that the extent of slack and declining   commodity prices, because of both domestic and foreign slow growth, will lead to declining   inflation I recognize the issues about expectations  I think on the whole, though, that they will   move down rather than up It is important to note that, given that we are already at zero in terms   of the policy rate, the dividing line between deflation and inflation is not really that significant    It’s disinflation at this point, which both raises real interest rates and creates the debt deflation   mechanism that moves wealth from debtors to creditors, which for good reasons is probably not   a neutral transfer because of the effects it has on financial stability  So I do think that   disinflation is a concern, but that is probably a relatively slow moving process, and we can keep   our eye on it I do hope that improving our communication with respect to our inflation   objectives will, on the margin, be beneficial  Of course, inflation expectations are important both   in financial markets and in the general public  I imagine our communications are more effective   on the financial side, but we can also try to have a more aggressive communication strategy with   respect to the broader public   I will make just one comment anticipating policy a bit, which is that I think we ought to   recognize that we could be at zero for quite a long time  There were a few comments that, with   economic growth expected beginning in the second half, we might be coming out of zero   relatively soon, and it could be the case  I think we have to be prepared to do that But even   aside from the Greenbook’s very long term projection of zero rates, I noted that, if you take the                                                                        4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   January 27–28, 2009 167 of 267  central tendencies of this Committee for 2011 and stick them into a Taylor rule, you still get   minus interest rates  So I still think, based on the median and modal views of this Committee, it   is likely that rates will be low for some time  Therefore I agree with President Bullard that we do   have to think very hard about our quantitative approaches and, as we discussed yesterday, find   ways to make them more effective, to communicate them more accurately, and to assess them   quantitatively Those are all critical steps, and that will be a challenge for us as we go forward    So even if we are not moving the federal funds rate around, there is still going to be a great deal   to do and a great deal to think about  Let me stop there and turn now to Brian Madigan to   introduce the policy round   Thank you Questions?  All right  If there are no questions,   why don’t we begin our policy and statement go-round  Let’s start with President Rosengren   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Pianalto   Just to clarify, I think what Brian says is right  The only   difference between alternative A, paragraph 2, and alternative B, paragraph 2 is that in A(2) it   says “weakened somewhat more than anticipated” whereas in B(2) it says just “remains weak”   Okay Thank you President Bullard   Thank you Governor Kohn    Yes, President Hoenig           January 27–28, 2009 183 of 267  It is a very difficult question  On the other hand, it also   suggests that our policy will be more aggressive  So it is a bit hard I honestly do not know   I see President Lacker   Vice Chairman   That is also factually correct  [Laughter] Others can   comment on this I must admit to not having a strong view myself  I think the coward’s way out   is to say that we do not know yet That would be one reason, President Yellen, to delay a   meeting or two before putting that in  But, of course, I understand exactly what you are saying,   and it may well be the case that this is yet another way of signaling a long-term, aggressive   policy But, President Evans, you are next, so why don’t we just go straight to you?   I do not think so, and that is why I am a little leery   Thank you President Lacker   Just a small point  I would view it as unlikely that   conditions would be unusual and exigent across a wide span of credit markets simultaneously   when we were having a significant recovery in the economy  But of course, that is an empirical   issue President Plosser   Right, which is similar, for example, to what the FDIC is   doing with the systemic risk exception with the 10-year bond issuance  Also, from a monetary   policy point of view, our plan for these programs is to create terms that will automatically   extinguish interest at some point as conditions normalize   Well, there are some legal niceties here that we can get to   another time   President Plosser   Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you President Fisher   My remark about Bank of America referred to a disorderly   or uncontrolled failure  Obviously an orderly wind-down that preserves stability is a different   matter  Governor Warsh   Thank you  President Rosengren   To complicate this even further, on the one hand this would   be a change from December, and there has not been a big change, in our view, since December    On the other hand, Debbie points out to me that the minutes from the December meeting had   exactly this sentence about inflation—that some members saw significant risks that inflation   could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels, and then similar language that   relates to being below the sustainable level, and so on  President Lacker   All right We are going to have to review all of these things   in the end here Governor Duke     January 27–28, 2009 198 of 267  Let’s go through that again   PARTICIPANT But only marginally  [Laughter]   Thank you Vice Chairman   That last thing worries me quite a bit  I don’t know What   did we have in December?      I thought of that as well, but does that satisfy you there,   Vice Chairman?   We have a lot to go through here  So just to get factual   information here, my understanding from the staff was that we were well on track to implement   during February, and I have heard nothing from the Treasury to indicate anything other than   support for this program   Are you okay with “will soon implement”?    All right Okay  Brian, let’s accept that one, unless—   President Fisher   All right Is that okay with everybody?        January 27–28, 2009 203 of 267  All right  “The Federal Reserve will be implementing”    Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for the useful comments  Let me try to address a few other   things here I think we are very much in agreement on the substance—that we want to maintain   an aggressive stance I also would just say, as a general point, that I fully agree—and I am sure   everyone does—that we want to look for better metrics and better ways of communicating and   expressing  As a general invitation to all of you and your staffs, you don’t have to wait until the   next meeting, and you don’t have to wait until the week before the next meeting  We are   delighted to hear explicit proposals for metrics or communication or statements that you would   like to circulate, and we can discuss throughout the entire intermeeting period  There is no need   for us to wait until the last minute  So let me just encourage you to follow through with that, and   let us see your proposals   There have been a number of suggestions  In the spirit of temporizing, I do believe that,   although we want to convey our concern about the economy and our willingness to be aggressive   with policy, there really is a high likelihood that we will learn a great deal in the next   intermeeting period about what the Treasury will be proposing, what the Congress will be   proposing, and what our role will best be fitting into those overall ideas  Therefore, hearing you,   I am a bit reluctant to commit at this moment to a specific increase in either our GSE or our   Treasury purchase program  Perhaps we should have made more explicit yesterday what our   plan was going to be So I would prefer to maintain the optionality of alternative B, which talks   about standing ready both to expand the GSE program and to purchase Treasuries under the   appropriate circumstances, and I will come back to that           January 27–28, 2009 204 of 267  The second set of suggestions had to do with the characterization of the economy and   inflation There are two in particular  One was whether to characterize the economy as weak or   weakened somewhat more than anticipated  I am actually a little surprised to hear the support   for “weaker than anticipated” in that the Greenbook has not really changed much since   December and the thrust of the commentary was that things were weak but not much weaker   than anticipated I am in your hands  I am going to be taking some straw votes in a few minutes,   so this is just a question My sense on that one is that I could consider different language, but it   seems as though “the outlook remains weak” conveys our view  I am not sure that I have heard   that the outlook itself has changed significantly since our last meeting  That was my sense, but I   am willing to be instructed on that  On the statement about inflation being below the level   consistent with economic growth and price stability, a number of people suggested that  I think I   am okay with that  It was introduced in the minutes  What I am going to do in a minute—let me   just warn you—is take a couple of straw votes, and I will ask all participants to tell me whether   you would like to add that sentence or not I don’t know any other way to resolve this, since I   personally think we could go either way   Other issues—I think it is a very interesting suggestion to move the material about the   federal funds rate into paragraph 4  I wish that you had sent that in a week ago so we could have   thought about it I think it makes sense, but I guess at the last minute here I am a bit anxious   about making that big a change in the structure of our statement  But I reiterate our interest in   hearing proposals for statements throughout the intermeeting period   On the issue about Treasuries—it is difficult in both directions  President Plosser raises   the question about raising a possibility and then not doing it, which is certainly an issue  On the   other hand, we have also been criticized for calling audibles on the line at the last minute and                 January 27–28, 2009 205 of 267  surprising people So it is difficult  Based on the discussion and on things that President Lacker   said, and so on, I think it is in fact a possibility that we would take this route  I personally think   that we shouldn’t rule it out  It is not something we want to undertake yet because we certainly   want to find out what the other options are going to be in terms of the other things that the   Treasury is proposing and so on   Well, I was diagramming that sentence  [Laughter]   Well, as simplified by President Lacker, it was “is prepared   to purchase longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such   transactions would be particularly effective”  I think that’s three subjunctives  [Laughter]   But see, the purpose of “evolving” is the sense that—don’t   you want to convey the optionality that this is going to take place and will be evaluated over   time?  The word “evolving” suggests an ongoing process   So, Governor Warsh, there is an “if” here  I mean, that   certainly implies that our action is conditional on certain things happening that may or may not   happen   Well, for example, one possible theory would be that we   will respond only if there is a big backup in rates and that seems to be an effective approach    That would be an example of evolving circumstances  My guess is—though it is always foolish   to make guesses—that this will be viewed as slightly negative news, not positive news, for the   Treasury market  We will have to see   Well, I fear that taking out “evolving” actually reduces the   clarity because “evolving” implies an ongoing process  Without the word “evolving,” it suggests   that we are still evaluating the current situation and then trying to assess whether the conditions   are met to take the action  President Fisher    Again, we already have a number of subjunctives   One reason that I was comfortable with this language was   that I do think that we will not be maintaining the world in suspended animation indefinitely    We will have much more clarity, I believe, by the next meeting, and at the next meeting we   would be able to say something like “the Federal Reserve will be focusing its attention on X, Y,   or Z”   And I don’t want to pull back completely because I do think   there is a realistic possibility—and I realize that there are different views—that it is going to   evolve over time  We still have a lot of discussion and further thinking to do, not only about the     January 27–28, 2009 208 of 267  specific types of purchases and programs but also about how we are going to evaluate the overall   thrust of policy, and so on   All right Have I addressed the major questions?  I don’t   know Okay  What I would like to do is propose alternative B with two issues that we will now   take a straw vote on  The one change we have agreed on so far is “the Federal Reserve will be   implementing the TALF”  The other two possible changes have to do with the characterization   of the economy The first one would be in B2, to replace the first sentence with the first sentence   from A2, “suggests that the economy has weakened somewhat more than anticipated”   Well, there is a distinction between the outlook and the   economy itself  The outlook remains weak   All right Well, do you want to say, “The economy has   weakened somewhat further”?     President Pianalto, do you have a view?   How about “suggests that the economy has weakened   further”?   No one seemed to object to the last sentence, which gives a   recovery but with downside risks   I think “weakened further” is not dangerous   The economy   Okay So I hear a slight preference for—okay, Brian—   “suggests that the economy has weakened further”   All right The last question, then, is whether or not to add or replace B3 with A3  That   would add the sentence that “the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time   below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability”  I propose to take a straw vote   of all of the participants—not just members but participants  All those in favor of making the   change?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  All opposed?  One, two, three, four,   five, six All right I think it is a reasonable change  I don’t think it is dramatic  Any other   comments?        January 27–28, 2009 210 of 267  All right I guess we have made three changes now  I propose alternative B I think it   conveys the sense of the Committee  It maintains, as much as possible, our optionality while   suggesting that we are going to be aggressive  Again, we will be looking both to the Treasury   and to the government for their actions over the next intermeeting period  Once again, I invite   members and other participants to submit their suggestions for communication and measurement   over the intermeeting period   I probably should mention that there will be opportunities for us to communicate about   our views further In particular, I have a testimony on February 10 on our transparency and our   communication I have a speech at the National Press Club, which will have more of a press   conference type of flavor, sort of between a speech and a press conference, on February 18    Then, I have the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings, followed by Budget Committee hearings, so you   will be seeing a lot of me on television  My complexion is not usually green but probably will be   by then [Laughter] So we will have a chance to communicate  And I hope that each of you, in   your own speeches and other interactions with the public, will take as much of the opportunity as   you can to try to explain what we are doing, how we are thinking about the economy, and how   we are thinking about our policy in this unusual environment  Any other comments?  President   Fisher   Thank you All right If we are ready for a roll call vote    Why don’t you?   Thank you very much  A couple of other small items    Item 11 is the longer-run projections  Many of you commented  I heard no concerns about it, so   why don’t we go ahead and—President Lacker   I was about to report   I agree with you that this has disadvantages and advantages   relative to a formal target  Absolutely I wanted to thank everybody for the very useful   discussion that we had in the videoconference, and I promise not to have a full discussion of   inflation targets any time soon because I do think we do have a pretty good sense of people’s   views What I took from the conference call, among other things, was that the Committee was   willing to grant me some discretion to try to discuss with the political bodies what their views   would be on going forward with an explicit objective     As I mentioned to you even before the meeting, I had spoken to the Administration, and I   have had some follow-up discussions there  My sense is that there would not be any serious   opposition from that side, although I need to continue to talk with them  But the more difficult   question is on the congressional side, and I have a meeting with Barney Frank on Monday, in   which I will raise this issue among other issues  My sense of the meeting was that it was worth            January 27–28, 2009 214 of 267  doing some socializing and some exploring of these issues but that we wanted to be very careful   and very sensitive at this difficult juncture about not creating new political problems for   ourselves but only if we can persuade the leaders of the country that this is something   constructive  So I will continue to try to do that and continue to work on this  I do think,   frankly, that this continued expansion of our projections actually makes it much easier to sell   because it creates a context in which the Congress can see that this is only part of a program that   involves meeting both parts of our mandate   I don’t know  I will have to see It will depend a lot on the   reaction I get from a few key people   Vice Chairman, did you have a comment?   Okay Thank you for that  Again, I think we see that there   are both advantages and disadvantages of doing this  I guess I would disagree only slightly on   the issue of timing in that, to the extent that this does give some sense of what the Committee’s   preferences are on appropriate monetary policy over the longer term, certainly an issue that has   come around the table quite a bit is the need to stabilize inflation expectations in a situation   where they might be quite potentially unstable in either direction  So that is one consideration   President Evans   It seemed to be noted that the mode is 2, and so the majority   believe that 2 is the right number, and there are arguments for allowing a slightly higher target   given the recent experience Other comments about the projections or inflation targets?  Well,   with the caveats that were raised, I still believe that there was a general view that we ought to go   ahead with the longer-term projections as part of the summary that will be published along with   the minutes  So why don’t we do that I have updated you on inflation targets, which is still   really at just the discussion stage   Let me just ask you quickly—this was our first experiment with the somewhat modified   meeting structure—either now or in the intermeeting period, give us your feedback or comments   about the effectiveness of this structure  Also, if we are going to have an issue in a one-day   context, we are going to have find ways to condense parts of the discussion some way or another,   perhaps by sending out materials in advance  Is there anyone who would like to comment at this   point about the meeting structure or make suggestions?  President Rosengren   Is that a widespread view?  All right We will investigate    We will make sure that it works with people’s schedules and see if it is feasible  But I agree that        January 27–28, 2009 217 of 267  it would be very difficult to do what we did in this meeting in one day  Other comments or   feedback?  All right Hearing none, the next meeting is Tuesday, March 17  That’s St Patrick’s   Day, isn’t it?  Very nice [Laughter] We have a lunch available  There is no briefing planned,   so our work is done I hope you will have a safe trip through the weather back to your home   cities Thank you very much   END OF MEETING      "
8679,2009-02-07,BERNANKE," A good Saturday morning to everybody  Thank you for   joining this meeting  This is going to be a joint FOMC–Board meeting because, although I do   not anticipate we will be taking any formal action today, I do want to give everyone the   opportunity to express views and to discuss policy issues  With that said, I need a motion to   close the meeting   Without objection  The Board is in session as well as the   FOMC Let me just welcome Governor Tarullo, who is joining us in his first meeting  He has   been here working for about a week and is already contributing to discussions at the Board  The   purpose of the meeting today is for me to discuss with you the Treasury’s proposed financial   stabilization plan and, in particular, the Fed’s proposed role in that overall structure  This is a   “close hold” There have been a number of leaks, as often happens, which is very   counterproductive; but I think the Fed has done well, and I would not like those leaks to come   from the Fed  So I appreciate your keeping your confidence close   We have been discussing, and by “we” I mean primarily the Treasury, the Federal   Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC, the last week or so—with a lot of staff work before that—a   plan that Secretary Geithner will propose on Monday at 1230 in a speech at the Treasury  They   have been very wide-ranging discussions, and, frankly, there was little in the way of resolution or   focus until very recently—only in the last 24 hours or so have we begun to see where Secretary   Geithner wants to take the plan; in fact, we got a very substantial revision of the document this   morning at 915, so you can see this is very much a work in progress                  February 7, 2009 4 of 65  But given the schedule for Secretary Geithner to announce the plan on Monday, I thought   this was an opportune point for us to review the plan and the Fed’s potential role  As you’ll see   when I go through the plan with you, the details are fairly lacking  There is an overall structure    That, in part, is on purpose The political strategy is to provide an overall structure with some    detail, but not a great deal of detail, with the idea that the public discussion and the congressional   discussion will create some buy-in on the political side  It’s like selling a car Only when the   customer is sold on the leather seats do you actually reveal the price  So the strategy, again, is to   provide the framework to get the Congress involved within certain parameters, and then, only   when there is some consensus on how the plan will work and what the key elements will be, to   negotiate whether additional funding beyond $350 billion is necessary    But I think there are some advantages to that from a political point of view  I will say   that both I and the staff—Bill Dudley and others—are somewhat concerned, at least given the   way things stand now, about the market reaction  First, the lack of details will create some   uncertainty and concern, particularly because there’s not a great deal said about the “problem   children,” the BAC and Citi  Secondly, I think the markets will be disappointed in the following   sense As I will describe, this is a real truth-telling kind of plan  It’s fundamentalist  It’s not   about giving the banks a break  It’s not about using accounting principles to give them back-  door capital It’s very much market-oriented and “tough love”  And I think we all will like that   I like that But the banks’ shareholders aren’t going to be thrilled about it   As I will explain—and I’ll go through this whole thing in detail in just a minute—the   Fed’s role in the bank stabilization plan per se is minimal  We may be called upon to do some   transition or bridge-financing of parts of the aggregator bank concept to a more permanent, non-  Fed financing, but we’re not involved in any wraps or anything like that, so in the broad           February 7, 2009 5 of 65  elements of the bank stabilization plan, we are pretty much on the sidelines  Where we are part   of the overall stabilization plan is in a proposed expansion of the TALF to include additional   types of ABS  An important element of that would be that the Treasury will be proposing   legislative action to ensure that we can sterilize the effects of any expansion of our balance sheet   on bank reserves; and that would be, I think, a condition for us to fully meet the size of the   expansion that they want I’ll come back to that in detail, but that, essentially, is where the Fed’s   role is visualized    Let me go ahead now and go through the plan  I’ll talk about the overall plan  I’ll talk   about the Fed’s role I’ll give you some reasons why I think the Fed’s role is appropriate for the   economy and advances our own narrow institutional interests  Then we will take all the   comments and questions that you would like to make  Again, because this is a meeting, voicing   your views is certainly appropriate   The first element of the stabilization plan is summarized as enhanced transparency about   asset valuations and capital needs So there’s a principle here that I believe to be very important    The more disclosure and clarity there is, the less uncertainty there is and the better the chance   that we’ll come to some kind of stability   One part of this first element will be a coordinated supervisory scrub of at least the top   20 banks or so to ensure that we understand how they are valuing their assets  We want to find   some consistency in their marks, we want to find consistency in their provisioning, and we want   to go beyond provisioning, which is focused on one-year losses, to look at expected losses   beyond one year So we’re going to do a tough scrub of the balance sheets  We’re going to   require enhanced disclosure so that there will be as much information as possible, with as much   consistency as possible, about the balance sheets of the banks        February 7, 2009 6 of 65  Another part of this element is that this is going to be a forward-looking exercise  In   particular, the standard Basel II regulatory capital standards are to some extent going to be   subsumed in the following sense  There will be either explicitly or implicitly an analysis of bank   balance sheets based not only on the current expectations or current modal forecasts, but on a   stress scenario as well And the presumption is that banks will have enough capital that they will   be able to meet regulatory standards even in the stress scenario; that means there will be some   presumption of a capital buffer—not a permanent increase in capital standards, but rather a   temporary increase in capital required that could be run down over time in order to meet the   standards even in a period of extreme stress   The language of the presentation will be something along the lines that we want to be   sure that our most important and largest banks, at least, and all of those banks are going to be   resilient, even in the case of a very bad macroeconomic outcome  A forward-looking approach   gets around the accounting issues about reserving versus marking to market, and we’ll be very   aggressive in terms of trying to get a proactive capital injection  They’ll use this scenario to size   the capital needs of particularly the top 20-25 banks, and, moreover, we will be looking not   strictly at Basel II standards, as I said, but also at market-relevant standards, like TCE to total   assets, as well as the Basel risk-weighted asset standards  So Step 1 is a scrub for consistency   and an evaluation of the ability of banks to meet capital standards even in a bad scenario in the   future   The second element of the bank program is a capital facility  Of course, the first line of   defense, to the extent that banks can, is accessing private capital markets, and they’ll be strongly   encouraged to do so Obviously, that is very difficult except for a very few banks, so there will   be a backup US government capital facility  What appears to be now the most likely form of              February 7, 2009 7 of 65  capital is a convertible preferred instrument, which could be put in as preferred but converted to   common as needed to meet the “well-capitalized” standard of 3 percent of risk-weighted assets   for common equity   I think about this as like an initial margin versus a maintenance margin  The initial   margin you can think of as being 4 percent, either common or convertible preferred, which   would be enough common or implicit common to meet the bad scenario  That’s the initial   margin  The maintenance margin, though, is 3 percent common  Going forward, as the amount   of common slips below 3 percent, then the banks will be forced to convert their preferred stock   into common stock to maintain that common ratio of at least 3 percent; 3 and 4 percent are not   the exact numbers—these numbers will be calibrated by these exercises looking at the scenarios    Again, this is focused primarily on the largest institutions, the top 22 or so, which are the ones   above $100 billion, but all banks would be eligible to take this common should they so desire    Again, the purpose is to capitalize banks in a forward-looking way so that they are able to   withstand severe scenarios, and to focus more on common  I should add that I believe that the   assumption is that even the existing preferred—the preferred that was injected under the first   TARP round—would be changed to convertible, so that the initial TARP could be converted into   common as needed   We discussed at great length methods of taking bad assets off of bank balance sheets or   insuring them  There are a lot of problems with these  There’s a sense that we need to do that   but a lot of concern, in particular, about how to price, because too low a price will not attract any   interest and too high a price will be a subsidy from the taxpayer  There was also a general   preference—putting aside the accounting issues and so on, which are very important—for an   aggregator bank, which takes assets off the balance sheets, as opposed to a ring fence or a              February 7, 2009 8 of 65  guarantee, which provides downside risk protection but doesn’t clean the assets off of the bank’s   balance sheet   So the current plan is to have an aggregator bank with initial capacity up to about   $500 billion, which is low—potentially it’s expandable  The way it would be run would be as a   public-private partnership I’m speaking roughly—I don’t have all the exact details—but the   basic idea would be that there would be bidding by the private sector for the right to participate    The bids would reflect the amount of capital that the private sector agents were willing to   contribute The instrument that would be created would be a bank that would have both public   and private capital Regarding the funding, as I said, the Fed might place some initial bridge-  financing to get the thing up and going initially, but in very short order the idea is that the   funding would be through FDIC-insured liabilities, so the Fed would not be involved in any   sustained way in this organization   The government would give the bank instructions about broad asset classes to purchase,   and there’s some debate about this  There was some discussion about whether the asset   purchases had to come from banks or not, or were just general  I think right now we’re leaning   towards restricting it to assets that are on bank balance sheets  But the asset price and purchase   decisions would be made by the private sector with the profit motive guiding them; and the idea   would be that this would avoid concerns about overpayment and would be an effective   mechanism for price revelation and price discovery in these markets  So the third element would   be the aggregator bank  Again, I think that will be viewed as very small, and banks will be   disappointed about the pricing mechanism, which will not be some kind of subsidy to them; but   it does have the advantage of being a market-based, truth-telling type of mechanism           February 7, 2009 9 of 65  The fourth element is an extension of the FDIC program—the temporary liquidity   guarantee program  The current plan is to extend it from July to October, a three-month   extension, and perhaps to expand the cap, as well The FDIC is also very eager to introduce a   “covered bond”-type program, which would allow banks to finance for up to ten years on a   heavily collateralized basis along the lines that we see in Europe, for example; and those covered   bonds would be FDIC-guaranteed as well   This capital process is going to end up with substantial government minority shares, at   the least, in many large banks and majority shares in a few  So a very difficult and important   question is How are we going to manage that?  We don’t want to do it in a way that destroys the   company, or destroys the franchise value, but, at the same time, we have to accept the reality of   government ownership  The proposal from the Treasury is to set up an independent body called   a Government Investment Board, the fifth element in the plan  The Government Investment   Board would control all the shares, including not only the preferred but also the common shares   that are invested in the banks and manage them from a wealth-maximization point of view  It   also would be involved in setting guidelines, perhaps according to the share of ownership, for   bank dividend policy, compensation policy, governance, and so on  So you can imagine the   situation—in particular for a couple of banks we have in mind—where the government would   have majority ownership  The bank would become subject to tough dividend and compensation   restrictions, and the Government Investment Board, together with the supervisory authorities,   would direct the bank in terms of issues like changing management, changing business plans,   and so on It would not be the government running the bank, but, in cases where the government   has a high ownership share, it would assert those rights in the way that a supervisory authority           February 7, 2009 10 of 65  would There will be an explicit objective to return ownership to the private sector as soon as   possible, consistent with maintaining financial stability    Sixth and finally, on the bank conditions, the President has already indicated some   stronger conditions on lending and executive compensation  For lending there would be—and I   will just quote the language—“banks would indicate a commitment to increase lending above a   baseline, consistent with safety and soundness”  They would provide detailed information about   their lending on a monthly basis, as well as a “qualitative description of the lending   environment”  So this is an attempt to finesse the difficulties of measuring lending against an   unknown baseline, but there will be some reporting requirements that will try to satisfy the   political need to say the banks are making efforts to lend  This is obviously a very difficult issue   and one in which the supervisors will have to play a role, because we’ll have to help mediate   issues about when banks should be lending more and when we think that doing so is not   consistent with safety and soundness  As already indicated, there will be stronger executive   compensation restrictions  They are contemplating a dividend holiday—restricting dividends at   all participants to one cent, at least for 2009  Finally, there would continue to be a distinction   between banks voluntarily participating and those that are required to participate or are receiving   exceptional support, in which case the dividend and compensation and other restrictions would   be correspondingly tougher   So that’s the broad nature of the plan It’s got forward-looking capital It’s got   convertible capital It’s got a Government Investment Board to manage that common stock  It’s   got conditions on the banks It has a private-public aggregator bank   As I said, I think that will be somewhat disappointing to the market, and I hope that the   Treasury will at least clarify in greater detail something about how to deal with the banks that        February 7, 2009 11 of 65  will almost immediately become government majority-owned  But there are still 48 hours to go,   and, given the past experience, that’s enough time  for at least four major changes in the program   Now to the Federal Reserve role  The Federal Reserve’s principal role in this will be an   expansion of the TALF, the asset-backed securities loan facility  There will be a joint   announcement of an agreement between the Treasury and the Fed to expand the TALF from its   current planned level of $200 billion to potentially as high as $1 trillion  The expansion will take   place over time—based on learning, based on Fed management—but I think it will be made   explicit, as we’ve already done, that we will be considering, besides the assets we are already   looking at, ABS that include CMBS and private-label RMBS, which would include prime jumbo   mortgages   The initial plan for this expansion had the Fed program taking legacy assets  We have   pushed back against that very hard, and we have gotten agreement that, as with the current   TALF, the expanded TALF would take only newly securitized and newly rated ABS, not legacy   assets So we will not be involved in the aggregator bank or in the toxic asset removal process  I   will note, just for clarity, that not all the assets themselves will be new; for example, in the case   of commercial real estate, some of the underlying assets are existing buildings  But the   securitizations and the ratings will be fresh; so that will reduce our risk, and, of course, the risk   also is reduced substantially by the Treasury element   Legally, in order for the TARP scoring to work in a favorable way, this has to be a   Federal Reserve facility  So it will be a Federal Reserve facility  We will be the lead agency    We will be in charge of developing the program  We will have final say on the decisions with   respect to the assets to be taken, the rate of expansion, the scale of expansion, and so on  I think           February 7, 2009 12 of 65  this is very important, and it will be clear that the Fed is autonomous and controlling its own   balance sheet   Finally, as I already mentioned, as part of this, very importantly, and as an explicit part of   the announcements that Tim Geithner will make on Monday, the Treasury will propose to the   Congress legislative changes that will allow the Fed to sterilize the implications of all of our   lending, not just the TALF lending, on bank reserves and the money supply  So if that is done,   that will be a major gain for us in terms of our concerns about macroeconomic stability   I’m going to give you an opportunity in just a few minutes to comment and ask questions,   but let me just say that this has gone through a lot of discussion and negotiation, and I can   personally argue that I think that where the TALF and the Fed’s role is now is good for the   economy and is good for the Fed  On the economy, clearly, any understanding of what’s   happening in financial markets and the banking system has to recognize that one of the big   problems is the shutdown of the securitization markets  Getting the banks lending again is all   well and good, but there are limits to that  There needs to be additional lending capacity  We   need to get the securitization markets going again  We are facing some very specific issues that   were discussed at the FOMC meeting, like the upcoming crunch in commercial real estate   finance I think that this TALF program—although, again, we want to reserve the right to see   how it works and to make changes and so on—is addressing a very important problem  And at   this point, it would be doing so in a very broad-based way, because it will be covering a whole   range of different kinds of assets; and the notion that we’re somehow focusing on very narrow   sets of assets would not be legitimate  I think this is good for the economy  I think it will be an   important complement and perhaps one of the most powerful elements of this plan  And as we   think about ways to use our balance sheet to stimulate the economy and ease financial           February 7, 2009 13 of 65  conditions, I think this is a very promising direction, consistent with stabilization of the banking   system more broadly   Looking at this from the Fed’s perspective, just to reiterate, I think this is good for our   institutional objectives First of all, it respects Fed autonomy  This is a joint project As I   indicated, the Fed will take the lead in decisions about expansion and assets  We will not be   taking legacy assets, and we will not be participating in wraps or running an aggregator bank    Those were some of the objectives, in terms of things that we wanted to stay away from, that I   talked about at the last meeting, and we will not be involved in them   Secondly, I think this overall is a very good step in the direction of protecting our balance   sheet For one thing, there is the Treasury’s contribution  Our analysis of the first $200 billion   of the TALF suggests that the $20 billion and 10 percent capital from the Treasury provide   extremely good protection against any credit risk, so that we see very, very little risk of any   credit losses to the Fed For another thing, from a liquidity perspective, there is the very   important step for the Treasury to support legislation to help us drain excess reserves   There have been various discussions about the need for congressional approval, input,   and so on That will come, beginning with my testimony on Tuesday, which is on our use of our   13(3) authorities and a discussion of our role in bank rescues, et cetera, and in which I will,   among other things, be saying that if there’s a good resolution regime in place, we will be very   comfortable with an accord that takes us out of that business  But more broadly, this whole plan   will be presented to the Congress, including the TALF  We will get their feedback and their   views, and in particular, they will have to take positive action on the reserve-draining mechanism   for us to be able to undertake the TALF on the scale that has been described           February 7, 2009 14 of 65  So I think this is positive It moves us in the direction of the objectives I set forth at the   FOMC meeting about where we want to go in terms of an accord  And I would add that, in   working closely with the Treasury on these important matters and developing a good   relationship, I think we increase the odds of getting cooperation in other areas we’re concerned   about, including removal of the SPVs from our balance sheet  And let me just say, on a very   preliminary and close-hold basis, that I have also had some rather encouraging discussions with   both the Treasury and the Congress on an inflation objective, and I think that also would be   something I would want to preserve as we develop a good relationship with the Treasury   I’ve spoken for quite a while  Let me stop now, and the rest of the meeting will just be   your questions and your comments Does anyone have any comments or question, Board or   Presidents?  I see President Lockhart   The language on Monday would be that the Treasury will   be pushing legislation to achieve this objective—it will not specify  I believe their preference   would be to do it through the financing bills, but there will be two important improvements over   the existing program  One is that it will be explicitly outside the debt limit; so there would be no   constraints from the debt limit in terms of their ability to help us sterilize the balance sheet    Secondly, there would have to be a clear understanding that this was at the discretion of the Fed   and not the Treasury; that is, the Treasury could not withhold a reasonable request from the Fed   to provide those bills President Fisher              February 7, 2009 15 of 65  Well, staff members have worked through the details for the   first $200 billion very carefully  They have developed haircuts for the various types of assets   based on generous allowances for risk of loss And then, of course, we have the $20 billion of   capital The result that has been presented to me is that, for midrange haircuts—which are more   generous than what the market is offering now but would be punitive under normal times—we   see the risks to the Federal Reserve from the credit as being extraordinarily low   Going forward, we would have the same process  The Treasury would provide capital   The haircuts would be set by some systematic process  I don’t absolutely guarantee that the   capital ratio would be 10 to 1, but whatever ratio it is would be set based on the presumption that   with virtual certainty there would be no losses to the Federal Reserve   There will definitely be Treasury capital  Will it be 10 to   1?  You know, there are a number of parameters  There’s the size of the haircut, there’s the   variability in the loss rates and the different assets that we consider, and then there’s the capital    We can trade off among those things  Suppose we learn, for example, in the first round that the   haircuts we’re providing are in some sense too generous and that we get tremendous demand for               February 7, 2009 16 of 65  this lending Then in the second round we could consider some tradeoff between bigger haircuts   and lower capital But in any case, it would be thoroughly vetted by the Board staff and the New   York Fed and others to give us comfort that the risk of loss to the Federal Reserve is extremely   low In fact, under the current parameters, the risk of loss to the Treasury appears to be quite   low; and there’s $20 billion ahead of us  So the basic principle—that there will be enough   capital and sufficiently large haircuts to essentially eliminate any realistic risk of credit loss—   will be preserved    Do you want to help, Bill?   Well, it may or may not be needed  The maximum scale of   the bank is $500 billion at initial stages  It is a bank, and I assume it will be structured as a bank   and, therefore, be eligible for normal discount window collateral-based lending  I think the   notion is that in the very short run there may be some timing differences between the purchases   being made by the asset managers and the acquisition of the financing  So there might be short   periods of mismatch where Fed financing would allow the thing to operate   I view this as being very short-term, well-collateralized, normal bank lending, and it   should have no implications, I think, for our balance sheet or our monetary policy, because it will   be a matter of weeks or a month or two at the most, I would imagine, and may not be necessary   at all; but it’s just a backstop as the thing gets running  We have a good bit of confidence that we   can find long-term financing mechanisms other than the Fed, including even the possibility, for   example, that the assets that are purchased might be paid for with guaranteed liabilities of the   aggregator bank So I don’t view this as really a problem that any of us should be particularly   concerned about, and it will not invoke any special authority  It will not invoke 13(3) or   anything like that   President Hoenig           February 7, 2009 18 of 65  So this is a very, very close hold  Our very rough estimates   suggest that it’s conceivable, particularly given the assumption that the TARP I preferred stock   could be converted to common, that we could actually manage this whole thing, including the   expansion of the TALF, et cetera, and including $50 billion plus for foreclosures within the   existing authority, within the remaining $350 billion (I should also mention I was at the White   House last night discussing foreclosures, and that will be part of the program, perhaps later this   week) That being said, it’s not certain, and that’s why, for better or worse, the Treasury’s   strategy is to unveil a program and approach, to be a little coy about cost, to see what they get in   terms of political and industry reactions, with the idea that if the program itself gains some   support, it will be easier at that point to say, “Well, here’s what we need to fund it”  But I don’t   know whether that’s going to succeed They’re going to ask Tim that question, but I’m sure he’ll   try to dodge it But the hope is, and I think there is some chance, that we’re not talking about a   massive increase in the TARP   Part of this, of course, is a bit of an end run around the TARP’s original scoring—which   is irrational scoring and had TARP being charged for the total value of any amount of assets   purchased or insured—by using the TALF and by using the aggregator bank with public capital   but private FDIC-insured financing and private capital  The capacity of those instruments to buy   assets is a multiple of what the TARP contribution is, which makes good sense both politically   and economically, I think           February 7, 2009 19 of 65  Because of those types of things, it does seem that somewhere around what we have   might be adequate; but, on the other hand, it needs to be clear to the banks that we’re not going   to go out there and say, “Well, you need so much capital, but—sorry, we ran out”  Also, there’s   always the risk of other emergencies  So we have to have some confidence that there will be   enough capital to meet whatever the size that the scrub suggests   The plan is not as explicit as I would like  Maybe there’s   some constructive ambiguity going on  Yes, if a bank is insolvent, then presumably what will   happen is that we’ll use a systemic risk exception  The FDIC will seize the bank  It will zero out   the shareholders It will make whole all of the major debt holders—following, again, the   systemic risk exception which allows for non-least-cost resolution—and it will liquidate the   bank So that’s certainly one possibility It’s a more complex situation, though, particularly at   the two biggest problem banks, because, even though their asset losses might exceed their   capital, they do have franchise values; and it’s a bit of a judgment call as to whether the   economic interest is in liquidating them or in trying to preserve them, or at least parts of them    So that’s a decision that, presumably, this investment board is going to have to make  But, yes,   the FDIC will definitely be prepared to do either open bank or closed bank assistance if the bank   is ruled insolvent   For banks beyond the 22, my understanding would be that   —just because of lack of resources—they’re not going to go through the same scrub with the   same forward-looking buffer requirement  They will instead go through the usual supervisory   process Presumably they have less or no systemic consequences  So they will be where they   are now, basically  They may be helped or not by the asset purchases going on, but they will   have access, obviously, to the aggregator bank, and they’ll have access to the capital should they   choose to take it But they will be in a different place  Bill   Deborah Bailey wants to add to the answer    The way this works is that the asset-backed securities are   originated typically by banks; incidentally, it would be those banks that are creating the ABS that   are subject to the TARP restrictions on compensation and so on  But we are not buying the ABS    What we are doing is lending to investors who, in turn, want to buy the ABS  Those investors   could be hedge funds, or they could be other kinds of investors; but the counterparty is not really   that important, because this is a nonrecourse loan  So the loan, in any event, is based on the   collateral and the haircut   From a political point of view, we’ve developed some talking points on this  Governor   Tarullo raised this question, as well We do restrict the counterparties to US institutions, so   foreign institutions are not eligible  I should say that going forward, although initially we are   going to be taking them “first come, first serve,” if there is strong demand, then we are prepared   either to adjust the terms to reduce the attractiveness or to go explicitly to some kind of auction   mechanism  So one way or another, there will not be excess returns being earned by anybody,   because if there are excess returns, they will be competed away through the auction process or              February 7, 2009 23 of 65  whatever mechanism we use to allocate these funds  But our direct counterparties will be   nonbanks—the investors who buy the ABS—but it’s a nonrecourse loan, so the fact that we   don’t supervise them is really not very relevant   My understanding is the Government Investment Board is   an attempt—whether it will be successful or not is debatable—to insulate a bit the running of the   business from the political process, to have some kind of business-oriented oversight  In fact, for   banks that are in trouble and have substantial government ownership, there will really be two   complementary enforcement mechanisms  One is the supervisory mechanism, and the other will   be this oversight board, which will be essentially voting the government’s stock  I assume that   those two mechanisms would collaborate  For troubled banks, the supervisors might demand a   change in the board of directors and a change in management, and they probably would get   agreement from the Government Investment Board  The oversight board can do what it wants,   basically It might just demand a change in the management and change in the board of   directors, or it might decide that it wants to put its own hand-picked people on the board of   directors But, again, the hope is that this will be a step removed from direct government   decisions about loans, for example, and will simply be an attempt to get the business in as good a   shape as possible either to sell it off or, at some point, to dismember it   Thank you  President Evans              February 7, 2009 24 of 65  Also, these are only new assets and not legacy assets  So   that reduces the uncertainty as well   If there are questions related to the announcement   yesterday, Bill Nelson and many others here can address those  Don’t hesitate to put those in    On the $1 trillion, I think the announcement will be something like “up to $1 trillion,” and   depending on what we learn, et cetera  So I think the headline number will be out there, but   certainly we have to be comfortable with the structure of the program, its utility, the applicability   of 13(3)—that is, are conditions still warranting that kind of activity—the credit protection, et   cetera So there’s no commitment here  There’s  no way that they could force us or otherwise   claim that we had committed to $1 trillion  But I do think, given the fact that our balance sheet   has actually shrunk recently, that this commitment plus the GSE purchases puts us in a range   which is very substantially supportive but is manageable from a monetary policy point of view  I   should never, ever, ever make promises or say “never,” because I’ve been wrong every time as   the economy has deteriorated, but I’m hopeful that this would be the last key initiative—but,   who knows?   I think they’ll like that   First of all, it’s at their option They don’t have to do it   They only do it if they need it  Of course, that will depend   both on their need for capital and on the price, and I don’t know what the strike price is  I don’t   know how that’s set up—that’s another piece of important information  The downside, of   course, is, if you’re converting huge amounts of capital into common, you have to deal with the   control issue   Thank you Okay, Charlie?   All right  President Stern   Okay Governor Duke   Well, mostly  If the legislation giving the ability to sterilize   is not passed, then we’re back to where we were last week, which is that we have to make   judgments about how much expansion of what programs we’re comfortable with, based on our   assessment of the duration of those commitments and on the presumed effectiveness of things   like interest on reserves and so on  But I think clearly there’s a tit for tat, in that there is no   commitment on our part to do $1 trillion  I mean, we may nonetheless make the decision to do   something  I think we need to make judgments as a Committee about what we’re comfortable   with in terms of ultimately unwinding and sterilizing those impacts   I would guess that, without the legislation, the $1 trillion would probably be quite   uncomfortable for us, because, assuming that the new ABS is done on the same terms as the   initial, it’s a three-year commitment with some tail potentially after that if they put assets to us    That’s worrisome in terms of the size and duration of the balance sheet So I wouldn’t say that   we wouldn’t go beyond $200 billion, necessarily, but I think the chance that we would go even   substantially towards $1 trillion would be quite unlikely   I think we have had various strategies in the past, including   injection of capital and so on, and I guess under the current situation, they’d be prepared to inject   common It would be the first time they’ve done that  I will raise this with Tim Geithner, but   there’s been no discussion in our group  Deborah has a comment   We agree with that concern very much, and we’re going to   raise this again with Tim  I guess there are always these short-run versus long-run concerns  I   think, on the other hand, we do not want to commit to maintaining the existence of every current   bank that is operating, and, as I said, one thing I like about this in principle, although the   communication is a huge problem, is that it is very market-based and very “tough love”  The   hope is to come out the other side with a banking system which is plausibly well-capitalized and   can inspire investor confidence  But the transition could be very tricky, and we need to think   very hard about contingency plans and about our communications   Vice Chairman, you have a two-hander?   President Fisher had a two-handed intervention     Governor Warsh, you had a two-hander, but also a regular   question?   We hear that  President Pianalto had a two-hander     The SEC has not been involved in this discussion  I haven’t   heard any plans to do that, but it’s an idea Governor Duke had a two-handed intervention   So the language in the document as it currently stands “In   conjunction with the review of the capital planning process, supervisors are undertaking a   coordinated review of banks’ reserving and valuation to ensure consistency and appropriateness   across banks  Supervisors will also work with institutions to increase the transparency by   enhancing each firm’s public disclosure of exposures, non-performing assets, and reserves, as   well as firms’ internal assessments of expected credit losses”   So I think the emphasis is a bit more on consistency, but the point you raise is one that   has been mentioned and was noted on the communication issue   Any other two-handers?  [No response] Okay So back to   the normal cycle here  President Plosser    So, just to reiterate, the $1 trillion is contingent on liquidity   support, in the sense that we will have to take into account the availability of the sterilization   facility in thinking about what we can do And we all understand and take very seriously our   responsibility to be able to unwind the programs in a timely way   The language on the “independent”—it says here—Government Investment Board is a   little vague It says, “The Board will oversee the management of our investments in financial   institutions,” which I guess means from an asset management point of view  “The Board will   establish guidelines for and monitor our investment interests in financial institutions on questions   of voting rights, dividend policy, compensation issues, and governance  But it will also ensure   compliance with conditions associated with USG investment, and will ensure transparency”   It sounds to me as if it’s going to serve, to some extent, as a board that votes the   government’s interest  And I assume that common will have different interest than preferred    But I am sure there will be general terms for accepting the money that are in the legislation or in   the policy stated by the Treasury regarding executive compensation and so on  Those will be   universally applied  The board will just make sure that they’re applied  But the board will have   the authority to go further, depending, for example, on the state of the bank        February 7, 2009 37 of 65  On the aggregator bank, we looked at a huge number of different models  I think if we   had done the entirely public-controlled one, which, I should say, our staff generally tended to   prefer to the public–private partnership, the argument would have been to create silos in the   aggregator bank, one for each bank that participates, and then to pay for the assets acquired, in   part with shares in those silo banks—sort of a first-loss position  That was the leading public   alternative   The problem was that it’s not just an economic issue, but the Treasury feels very   politically vulnerable to the charge that we are negotiating high prices and giving a back-door   subsidy to the banks Although our staff felt that we could do reverse auctions for broad classes   of assets, the Treasury remained concerned, for example, about individual loans and other very   idiosyncratic types of assets  I think there is still some willingness to consider perhaps a   combination of public and private acquisition, but they felt that having the private acquisition   would look better in terms of ensuring that good prices were being obtained   Once you have private acquisition, however, then you have to give the private investment   managers scope to buy whatever they want from any bank  In fact, the initial idea was not even   having to buy from banks, in which case it’s no longer a question of a bank saying, “Well, here’s   the share of stuff we want to put into our bad bank”  It really depends on what they can sell to   the private investment manager  So the good bank–bad bank structure in each bank fits less   comfortably, less easily, with this private–public arrangement   In terms of the details, there are not very many  Again, I’ve got this draft, and everything   is time dated, because it’s a moving target  It says, “The Treasury will invest capital alongside   private investors for the purchase of up to $500 billion in legacy assets from regulated financial   institutions Purchases through the investment portfolio will be guided by appropriate risk and              February 7, 2009 38 of 65  return objectives”  And there will be definitions of which classes are eligible; it refers to a   competitive bidding process or private sector process  Financing will be provided by the   government “with the degree of leverage guided by requirements consistent with a triple-A   rating from an NRSRO”  So I think that means also that they’re taking some steps to make sure   there’s not a subsidy in the pricing mechanism or in the terms on which you finance the   aggregator bank either But we’ll see  Vice Chairman   The theory is that the reason there’s such a huge bid–asked   spread between what the banks are willing to accept and what the investors are willing to pay is   that there’s this huge liquidity premium, basically because investors don’t have long-term   financing So we are going to give them long-term financing  That ought to make them willing   to see through the liquidity premium  That certainly will bring them closer together  If they’re   still not willing to sell, then it suggests that there’s some informational difference—or   something—that goes beyond the liquidity premium  So at least it does address that important   part of the bid–asked spread Two-hander from President Plosser   I think that’s right For example, consider an asset that is   carried on the banking book at 90 and for which the bank has reserved only for the next year  If   the government says, “We’re going to take seriously that your expected losses after the first year   are 20, and we’re going to make you put in capital to match that 20,” then maybe it makes more   sense to sell at 75, right?  So, there should be some impact from that  But it all depends on the   execution as well as the concept  Governor Kohn   We’re going into the period of the financial crisis where the   government is going to begin to dictate capital requirements, so a lot of people are going to be   facing that In principle, our existing requirements require holding capital against expected   losses beyond the reservable period So this is not a departure in principle  It’s just something   that hasn’t been effectively executed in the context of a rapidly declining economy   So the current document says that the capital is going to be   “sized on the basis of the capital planning process, undertaken in conjunction with the firm’s   supervisor The capital buffer established under this program does not represent a new capital   standard, and it is not expected to be maintained on an ongoing basis  Instead, the buffer is   available to help absorb larger-than-expected future losses and to support lending to creditworthy   borrowers” Governor Duke   Governor Duke   I’m taking some notes on what everyone is saying, and I   want to say that many of the views I’ve heard are consistent with what I and some of the staff   believe  We will communicate this to the Treasury Secretary  But if anybody, including   presidents, wants to communicate specific points or specific concerns to me, do it via Michelle,   if you’d like I will aggregate them into an e-mail or into a memo and send it to him saying,   “This is the sense of the FOMC; here are some issues that were raised,” and just make sure, at   least, that he is aware of some of these concerns  President Lacker   Yes But with separate—   Yes   Deborah talked about an alternative discussion about setting   capital in terms of quantities instead of ratios, but that’s not something that, as far as I know, is in   the plan at this juncture  I think there will be some deleveraging that will go on  The hope   would be that the aggregator bank, et cetera, would be a safety valve for that   So, President Lacker, I don’t think that’s in the current   version of the plan I guess you could call it a benefit that the concern that the aggregator bank   wouldn’t have any business gives an additional reason for banks to offload assets to the   aggregator bank   The argument is analogous to the TALF in a way  As I was   saying before, the idea is that there’s lots of money on the sidelines willing to buy these troubled   assets The rate of expected return is now very high, because of liquidity and risk premia  But   what’s preventing the purchases is lack of long-term reliable financing  The bank would make   that financing available but not at concessional rates; also—and this may not be fully market-  based—it would provide a little bit of downside tail risk, because there’d be some government   capital involved But, of course, on the other hand, you’d have to share the returns with the   government based on their capital contribution   The idea is that you give these investors some long-term financing, so they don’t have to   worry so much about the short-term holding risks and liquidity risks, and, therefore, they would   be able to buy more and offer better prices than they’re able to now without that support  So                 February 7, 2009 46 of 65  that’s the logic of it  And because they share in the profits, they have no incentive whatsoever to   overpay for whatever assets they acquire  They’ll pay as little as they can, and so arguably we   can tell the public that they’re getting the benefits of aggressive market-based pricing   That’s right, but also, there’s going to be competition   among the potential investors for this license, and that will bid away some of the rents, I think   Again, this is as much about optics as it is about economics    They want to be able to portray a market-based system that is not suffering from serious adverse   selection and overpayment issues   How about a presentation at the next FOMC?  Would that   be acceptable?   No, with documents and details  We can send you analysis,   if you’d like But you might prefer to have a discussion and a verbal presentation as well   That’s a good question  I don’t have a really satisfactory   answer On the one hand, we have had legal consultations, which persuaded us and the Treasury   that, as far as meeting the letter of the law of the TARP is concerned, it’s sufficient to impose   those compensation and other restrictions on the issuers of the ABS as opposed to the investors   who are buying it But, of course, you’re right—there’s always political risk there  The other   point is the communication issue, and we’ve made some efforts to set up some talking points to   explain what this does and why it’s important Michelle, can you send the Presidents a list of our           February 7, 2009 49 of 65  talking points about why this is a benefit for the general public?  But you raise a good point—it’s   a risk President Evans just wants to interject     That’s a similar question—and I assume not  President   Lacker   Let me respond very quickly  Of course, I’ve thought about   this a great deal and tried to trade off various concerns  I think we’re going to make progress   towards an accord I think we’re on a path in that direction  In particular, we now have two   “asks” in front of the Congress  One—which we will press very hard for as part of regulatory   reform—will be for a strong resolution regime for non-depository institutions  If done properly,                 February 7, 2009 52 of 65  that will eliminate the most vexatious and difficult and painful part of the 13(3) authority, which   we used in the Sunday night massacres  So that’s very important   The second is this sterilization ask I think that will also give us a great deal more   independence in the sense that we’ll be able to separate whatever decisions we make on our   balance sheet from our monetary policy decisions  And just so you know, certainly part of the   deal with the Treasury is that, if they get a supplementary financing authority, it’s the Fed that   will have the right to call for the use of those bills—it will not be at the Treasury’s discretion   As to your perspective on the Congress and the amount of time available—putting aside   politically feasible, I don’t think it’s technically feasible for the Congress  Look at their inability   to function on even relatively straightforward economic measures  These things we’re doing,   such as the TALF, they’re very complex, they’ve been based on elaborate analysis of market and   financial conditions, they have a lot of subtleties as far as legal issues, et cetera  There’s just no   way that the Congress can do that They can’t do that  They created the Fed They gave us   13(3) authority We are making a judgment  And I just want to say, in all of these discussions,   we have to remember every minute that there were 600,000 jobs lost in January  This is an   enormously serious economic situation, and it requires unusual responses   We believe that the Congress doesn’t have the capacity to come up with something like   the TALF, that it is going to be constructive, and that it’s very important in the context of the   current economic crisis  And the Congress has every ability to shut it down—they have every   ability We’re going to go to the Congress  I’m going to testify on 13(3) authorities on Tuesday    The Treasury plan is going to make the sterilization part of the explicit legislative ask  All they   have to do is not accept that  That will limit us very substantially  So I think that we are   comfortably within our rights, within the law, and within reason to take these actions,                 February 7, 2009 53 of 65  understanding that we are not in normal times—we are in what you could very well call war   time, and war time sometimes creates unusual necessities    As I said, I think we are on the right path towards an accord, one that will take us out of   the business of Sunday rescues, one that will give us flexibility on monetary policy separate from   lending I think ultimately we will have some more clarity, at least with the Treasury, regarding   what conditions and terms under which we should get involved in any such lending program  I   think reasonable people can disagree about whether, for example, our swaps activities and some   of the other things we’ve done are within the purview of the central bank in a financial crisis  I   would argue that they are But that’s something to be negotiated, and the current Treasury is, I   think, very open to those negotiations   I think the political risk is overstated It’s possible that we may come up against this   concern that you raised about restrictions on compensation of the hedge funds  In that case, they   will probably shut down the program, and that’s yet another way in which the Congress can shut   it down if they want to But, even though we’re in the middle of the deepest part of the crisis, I   get very few letters from the Congress saying “we need to protect this or that sector,” and the   ones that I get are very perfunctory; and we reply saying, “Well, we are doing X,” and they never   come back  I just don’t feel the pressure  I think the pressure would come if the Fed stood by   and let the economy fall into the abyss, which is a very real possibility  So I think we’re trying   to balance these concerns in a reasonable way  My expectation is that we’re moving in the right   direction in terms of getting an accord, and I believe that, given what I feel is actually a relative   lack of pressure to make unusual lending in the current circumstances, when things return to   normal, we should be able to draw lines and, indeed, as part of the process of financial   reregulation and so on, should be able to clarify these things much better  So I’m less concerned           February 7, 2009 54 of 65  than you are, and I understand that there are judgments that have to be made about this  But,   remember, as I said—600,000 jobs  If we can do something about that in ways that have limited   and manageable risk to us, I think we need to take that into account  President Fisher, did you   have a comment?   I don’t have the number   There are a couple of different numbers that are relevant    One is gross issuance, which, of course, includes replacement of—    Net new issuance But there again, there should be some   distinction between the TARP issuance, which is asset acquisition, and the other issuance  But I   don’t know the number  We don’t have anyone here who knows the number, but we can clearly   look into it   They’ve never raised that with me at all  No, there is no   understanding   Thank you Vice Chairman   President Bullard   Thank you You should tell your board that, in every one of   the cases where we have taken risks, including the wraps for Bank of America and Citi, we have   a letter from the Treasury saying that it’s understood that this is a responsibility of the US   government, and that any losses would come out of seignorage  We haven’t worked out how   that would be done exactly, but the long-term impact on the Federal Reserve’s capital should be   nil based on those representations   I appreciate that And I guess I would add that seignorage   obviously is adjusted over a period of years We haven’t done a recent calculation  Perhaps it   would be in our interest to do so  But I think we’re probably in the black on balance, because   those are the only losses Everywhere else the lending programs are providing us with some               February 7, 2009 59 of 65  additional interest income So I think our net seignorage is probably positive  The Vice   Chairman is nodding his head   At this point in time, anyway  So I think overall that we’re   doing pretty well in terms of the financial implications for the Federal Reserve and for the   government  Governor Duke   On the second question, I think the idea is just to make sure   that everybody is using comparable standards, but not to change the rules  The rules would be   what they are for mark-to-market and for banking book assets  So on the mark-to-market side,   you’d be looking to see what the methodologies are and so on, and on the banking book side,   you’d be looking to see whether reserving is taking place in an appropriate way and whether the                 February 7, 2009 60 of 65  estimates of the credit losses are reasonable  In a sense, it is the worst of both worlds, I guess,   but it’s within the context of the existing accounting structure for banks   Vice Chairman, do you want to respond to the first question?   President Hoenig   I understand that concern You often hear people say,   “Well, we need people to save more  Why are we taking fiscal policy actions to try to get them   to spend more?  Isn’t that inconsistent?”   I would say it’s not inconsistent, because in the short term—I’m adopting a New   Keynesian framework here—sharp adjustments in aggregate demand not only move us towards   the long-term desired adjustment, but they also can create excess capacity (loss of use of   resources) over and above the natural adjustment process that we need in the long run  So there   is a case—for example, when there is a movement from low saving to high saving—for trying to   provide mechanisms to maintain something close to full employment as you make that transition    By the same token, we need to go from high leverage to low leverage  That process is   happening The losses are occurring One thing I like about this bank program is that it’s very   honest I think it’s a very truth-telling program  It’s not trying to hide things  But the   deleveraging process has a side effect, which is to bring down aggregate demand and to create   enormous excess capacity in the economy, which, I think, is partially wasted  Therefore, there is   a social gain involved not in trying to stop this adjustment, or reverse it, but rather in trying to   allow the economy to adapt to it in a more gradual way   And I’m not particularly persuaded that we are misallocating credit, because I think the   credit markets are just not working very well  There are all kinds of informational and capital                 February 7, 2009 63 of 65  and other issues which are preventing the markets from working in anything remotely like a   good way We are trying to use the tools we have to mitigate the implications for the broader   economy, not because we’re trying to affect credit allocation per se, but because we’re interested   in the effect on overall demand and the economy  You mentioned CRE [commercial real estate],   and, by the way, that’s likely to be a thing that we would try to address in the TALF context     So I understand all of the complexities here, and crises are a time when you have to   examine orthodoxies and try to think about the complexity of the world  And we’re making all   kinds of tradeoffs But I think we’re better off trying to get to where we need to be in a more   gradual and buffered way than allowing the system to go through a violent, wrenching process,   which could very easily get us trapped in some Japanese-style situation where the usual dynamic   mechanisms for adjustment are strongly attenuated and it takes a very long time  So I understand   what you’re saying, but I don’t think there’s a contradiction between trying to achieve a   rationalization of leverage and consumption in the long run and trying in the intermediate term to   mitigate the effects of that on aggregate demand and on the broad economy  I think it is a   consistent intellectual position You may not agree with it, but I think it’s not inconsistent   Other questions or comments?  President Lacker   I disagree with that  I think that what happened was that   they were very slow in adjusting to the financial crisis in the banking system  I don’t know what   you’re referring to, frankly   Well, that wasn’t government action, that was government   inaction It took a tough guy like Takenaka to confront the banks and force them to write down   their positions and to recognize their losses—which is what I think is the positive virtue of the   Geithner approach—which was the first step to recovery  People say, “Well, fiscal policy was   insufficient”  Well, maybe so, but there weren’t a whole lot of intrinsic dynamics in that   economy to restore full employment absent government policy, either  I view Japan as being a   case of mostly insufficient action rather than excessive or incorrect action  But we don’t want to   debate that I think in any detail today   Okay Other comments?  President Fisher   I’d like to point out Governor Tarullo has a 14-year term    [Laughter]   A term, not a sentence  Thank you, everybody   END OF MEETING      "
8697,2009-03-17,BERNANKE," Good afternoon and happy St Patrick’s Day, everybody    I’d like to start by welcoming Governor Tarullo to his first non-video [laughter] FOMC meeting    Dan has been here for a while, and he’s already making very substantial contributions  We’re   happy to welcome him to the table  I’ll also mention that we will have a dinner tonight, and our   special guest will be Randy Kroszner  This is a joint Board–FOMC meeting, so I need a motion   to close the Board meeting   Without objection  The first item on the agenda is Desk   operations and liquidity programs  The FOMC asked for lots of information, and now you’re   going to be sorry [Laughter] We have a record number of presenters who are going to cover a   range of issues relating to our balance sheet, our lending programs, and a variety of policy   options In order to make sure this is not a three-day meeting, I’d like you to hold your non-  clarifying questions till the end If you have clarifying questions, by all means ask them, but at   the end we’ll have an opportunity for full Q&A for the presenters  So let me turn it over now to   Trish Mosser   Trish, does that proposal require any approval?   Surely   Before you start, let me just say that I’ll give a briefing on   the Treasury’s plans and all of these issues after the presentations here   Thank you for a very thorough set of reports  Out of those   reports, there was, I believe, one action item we’ll come back to—besides ratifying the open   market operations—which is the swap proposal that Nathan discussed  But let’s open now for   questions to any of the staff  President Fisher   That’s very good advice  President Hoenig   President Lacker   Separate from conforming mortgage markets, where we   have a different program, all other ABS markets, to my knowledge, are pretty much shut down                 March 17–18, 2009 29 of 266  President Plosser   There will be a discussion period as well  This is just for   questions   Trish, did you have a comment?           March 17–18, 2009 39 of 266  Okay President Evans   Do you think there’s an aggregation externality in   liquidity—getting activity going again so that people issue and so on?  That would be one reason   why it would stimulate additional activity   I think that’s our best tool right now  President Lockhart   Sure   Nathan, would you address an elementary question?  If we   delegate the authority to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, why wouldn’t that appear in the   minutes, for example?   Thank you  President Pianalto   We’re not trying to fill up the bucket   President Yellen   President Yellen, in just a few minutes I will brief on all of   the developments in the Treasury program, including this and the PPIF, and the FDIC role                   March 17–18, 2009 49 of 266  President Bullard   I think it’s the problem President Yellen raised, which is the   exit strategy  Is there a cost to exiting?  I think that’s the main constraint  Also, there are   probably some costs associated with having banks holding enormous amounts of excess reserves   Ms Mosser   We could just acquire Fannie and Freddie directly    [Laughter]   Speaking of facility usage—[laughter]—why don’t we take   a coffee break for about 15 minutes, and then we will recommence around 430  Thank you   [Coffee break]   The next item on the agenda is billed as a discussion of the   balance sheet and lending program issues  What I’d like to do, with your indulgence, is to start   off by posting you on a number of developments that pertain to these programs, and then make   some comments on some policy issues, and then we can have an open discussion  I just want to   remind everyone, of course, that we have two full go-rounds subsequent to this discussion, so   let’s make this part of it more informal, and then everyone will have an opportunity, of course, in   the go-rounds to give their views if they haven’t had a chance in the discussion   Let me begin with some postings  First, a relatively minor point  It’s time to announce   the amounts and schedules for the term auction facility for the second quarter  Unless there are              March 17–18, 2009 54 of 266  objections, I propose to follow the recommendation of the staff and approve $150 billion per   auction in April That would be the same as we’ve had for some time now   The second thing I wanted to talk about is the accord discussions with the Treasury,   which I have mentioned a few times  I think that we are getting somewhat close to a possible   agreement, and I want to update you on where that’s going, and it’s going to be relevant to some   of the other points I want to make  The subject of the accord will be a potential conflict between   the Fed’s role as a monetary authority and as a financial stability authority, the point being  How   do we define the role of the Fed in such a way as to minimize the conflicts between those two   functions?  Currently what we have in mind is a short document that would have—besides an   introduction stating the motivation—four key general points   The first point would be a positive statement of the need for Treasury–Federal Reserve   co-equal cooperation during this financial crisis, so that is a positive good and something that we   want to continue to do   The second point is that, although the Fed may provide liquidity in its role of pursuing   financial stability, the Fed must be insulated from credit risk and must not undertake credit   allocation, which the accord will state are within the province of the fiscal authorities  What is   meant by “credit allocation”—and this relates to some of the discussion about the TALF—is   that, to the extent that the Federal Reserve gets involved in credit markets, we should try to do so   in a broad way that addresses the macroeconomic situation as opposed to picking winners and   losers within small categories of credit   The third of the four principles is the need to protect the Fed’s monetary stability function   from the financial stability function, if you will  In particular, the Fed and the Treasury have   agreed on the need for sterilization tools that will allow the Fed to prevent any increases in its              March 17–18, 2009 55 of 266  balance sheet from affecting its ability to conduct normal monetary policy  As Brian already   said, we have developed legislative language, and I have promises from the Administration of   the highest level of effort to go to the Congress immediately—today—to try to get reactions, try   to get some approval of either Fed bills or the SFP program, and that would be attached to   legislation that is currently being contemplated  I’ll say more about that  As Brian mentioned, I   think we would prefer Fed bills, but we are putting both out there  The other thing that we are   prepared to do, if we get resistance, and which I think a few people around the table might   prefer, is to put a sunset on Fed bills or on this provision, so that it’s only for the current   situation   The fourth element of the accord would be an agreement between us on the need for a   comprehensive resolution regime for systemically critical nonbank financial institutions, which   we do not have, and which I have called for and others have called for—a way to wind down   nonbanks in a safe and orderly way In particular, we would want to say that a key element of   any such regime would be a careful definition of what role would be expected of the central   bank We might have a role—we might have a liquidity provision role, we might have other   roles, depending on what the Congress wants to do—but it should be carefully defined  As part   of this, sort of aspirationally, the Treasury at this point—and we’ll just have to see how the   negotiation comes out—will state its intention that when it is able to do so it will remove from   our balance sheet the Maiden Lanes and the other residuals from our various rescue operations   So I believe that these are the main elements that we need  From my perspective, it   preserves our ability to do what we’re doing now, which is to continue to support credit market   functioning and to address the macroeconomic situation, even though the interest rate is at the   zero bound I realize it doesn’t go as far as some perhaps might like, but I do think that it will be           March 17–18, 2009 56 of 266  an important step, a historic step, towards defining an appropriate line between our various   functions   It should be clear that a principal reason that the Treasury is being so cooperative is that   they would like us to support them in their bank rescue program  So what I’d like to do now is   tell you where that is and what’s going on there, and talk to you about what the Fed’s role, if any,   would be in that And I should say that we have not approved anything  But they are looking for   some kind of answer from us very quickly, and, therefore, this would be an opportunity for   people to make comments   The original bank proposal of the Treasury had five elements, of which four have now   been laid out to the public the supervisory assessment, with the stress scenario; the equity   instrument—the mandatory convertible preferred—that would be given to banks that need it; the   TALF—the joint TALF—which, of course, is already, as of this week, in operation; and the   foreclosure mitigation plan  The last element, which has not yet been described and that we want   to get to, is a public–private partnership for dealing with what they now call “legacy assets”  I   guess it’s like “legacy systems”—and the word “legacy” used to be a good word  [Laughter]   I have to say that I agree with the objective  I supported the original TARP motivation,   and a big part of that was to remove opaque and damaged assets from bank balance sheets  I   believe that is part of any successful bank cleanup program, because it will allow banks to attract   private capital and give them balance sheet space to go back to normal lending  So I do think   that’s an important element of the plan   Currently, this fifth element has, in turn, three parts  This is very complicated—sorry    The first part, which has nothing to do with the Fed, is an FDIC facility  The purpose of the   FDIC facility would be to take damaged portfolios directly off of the balance sheets of banks;              March 17–18, 2009 57 of 266  this would happen after the conclusion of our supervisory assessment, during the six-month   period in which banks are supposed to be raising capital or otherwise taking action to stabilize   themselves  A bank would offer an asset pool, and a third-party valuation agent would estimate   an expected price on the pool Then, the supervisor and the bank would discuss implications for   pro forma valuations and the stability of the bank—capital needs, and the like  So there would   be some preliminary discussion about whether or not the bank should actually engage in making   this offer If the bank decides to offer the asset pool, then the FDIC would dispose of it in the   same way that it currently disposes of assets of failing banks  It would have an auction, and the   price that the bank receives for the pool would be determined by the winning bidder  This is   going to be highly leveraged, which is the reason that they hope to attract bidders who will pay   more than fire-sale prices  The leverage will come in two forms  One is that there will be an   80/20 partnership between the US government and the private participant, with 80 percent of   the capital from the government  And then, there is leverage provided by the FDIC, which is   supported by FDIC guarantees, to attract funding  An example of the leverage is that given a   $195 billion portfolio, a private investor could have a 20 percent interest in it for $557 million—   obviously, this is a very highly leveraged position    Why would banks want to do this?  It’s not clear that they will, but there are some   possible reasons One is that we are looking in our supervisory assessment at embedded losses   that go beyond one year, beyond the provisions  So banks may make the determination that it’s   in their interest to sell some portfolios, even if they’re in the accrual book  Second is the   proposition that, by selling off assets, a bank can make itself attractive to private equity and   thereby, perhaps, avoid a capital injection from the US government  So that’s the motivation    Of course, typically, the sale of assets, if they’re marked down, would create a bigger capital           March 17–18, 2009 58 of 266  hole than initially, and so the US government will have to stand ready to provide enough capital   in case the private sector is not forthcoming   That’s the FDIC part of the plan  It covers only portfolios sold directly by banks and   possibly bank holding companies The FDIC is not willing, or says it doesn’t have the authority,   to deal with assets that are not taken directly from banks  The other two parts of the plan involve   creating facilities to buy various classes of troubled or legacy assets, essentially from anybody in   the market  And the question is How would they work?  So that’s where the Fed would be   involved under the Treasury’s proposal   Before I talk about them, let me just say one word about process  The Fed has been a full   participant in all of these discussions  We’ve done the lion’s share of the work on a number of   these issues And we have, in general, tried to resist the Treasury’s strong demand for   precipitant action, and tried to slow them down, and tried to make sure that we get this right, if at   all possible We’ve also been very careful throughout this process in trying to ensure necessary   protections for the Fed—that’s what the accord is about  Another example is that we essentially   vetoed a ring-fencing proposal, because we didn’t like the way the Fed was involved in those   types of operations I should also say that I did have the opportunity to meet with the President   on these issues; of course, we talked about a wide variety of things, but we spent about   20 minutes talking about the Fed’s role and our concerns and our issues, and he was very   receptive  In particular, he promised his full support for sterilization tools  And I’ll mention   parenthetically that I have talked to him about inflation targets as well, and he said, “That sounds   really good”  I’m sure his advisers will get to him before long—[laughter]—but he was   interested in that                 March 17–18, 2009 59 of 266  Okay So what are these two last parts of the plan?  One part is public–private   partnerships, which are basically hedge funds that have 80 percent government ownership and   20 percent private ownership You could have the US government in partnership with PIMCO,   for example  Those hedge funds will be able to buy assets essentially from anybody; there may   be some restrictions on the type of asset, but not restrictions on whom they can buy them from    There would be a 20/80 share in terms of returns, because the private sector is putting up   20 percent of the capital   The final part is TALF financing—that is, the Fed would allow these legacy assets to be   financed in the TALF It’s a little hard to see at first, but if you look at it carefully, you’ll see   that the combination of the public–private partnership—where the equity share gives shares in   the assets—with the financing facility is really economically equivalent to the FDIC facility    And what appears to be a difference—the put option in the TALF and the haircuts having to   differ according to the asset risk—is actually paralleled in the FDIC program, because there   they’re going to have to set leverage according to asset class in more or less the same way  So   the combination of the two is essentially the same kind of thing, but it works for any type of   asset   There are a number of issues  One is certainly the viability and workability of the   program  I have to say that our initial reactions were negative, and we told the Treasury that    Our concern was that it would be very, very difficult to deal with these very heterogeneous assets   and to find haircuts that would work for each asset  However, we have looked at it more   carefully A team that included Mike Gibson from the Board, and people from New York as   well, has done what they called a “proof of concept” analysis to ask whether this could be made   to work They looked at some representative asset classes, and their conclusion is that it is           March 17–18, 2009 60 of 266  workable But they think that, if we’re going to do this, it would be necessary to get outside   contractors to recommend to us what the haircuts ought to be, what the risk profiles ought to be,   and what capital we should require for safety  In addition, they think we should have asset   managers to take care of these things, so that we don’t have to burden our staff further   The second issue is what it implies for the size of the Fed balance sheet  We had   previously discussed this when Secretary Geithner first put out the bank plan  He announced,   with our agreement, that the $200 billion TALF program could be expanded “up to”—a very   cautious set of words—“up to” $1 trillion At that time, we thought that the extra money would   go into CMBS and RMBS  The idea here is that we would not have a change in that—that even   if legacy assets are included, we would still be “up to” $1 trillion  So, in that sense, we would   not be changing the rules of the game   My own view is that we will not get to $1 trillion  First of all, the Treasury is very short   of capital It has to fund not only the capital of the banks, but it also has to fund the FDIC   program and the public–private funds, as well as the TALF  So that’s going to be a significant   barrier to expansion Then, I think that, practically, as we’ve seen, the process is just very   difficult It requires a lot of analysis, and what we’ve seen in the initial work on some of the   simpler assets is that we may not get the demand that we thought  And, in any case, it’s not   going to happen for some months down the road So there are implications for the balance sheet,   but they’re not different from what they were prior to this   With respect to assurances, I’ve already talked about the accord  And, particularly with   regard to the Fed bills work, we will maintain the “no credit risk” principle by insisting that we   be fully protected if we do this  I’ll mention one other thing, which has not been explored, but   which seems to me to be a very live possibility  The senior debt obligations of the TALF would           March 17–18, 2009 61 of 266  be very safe assets, because they would be senior not only to the Fed and the Treasury, but also   to the haircuts, so it seems possible to me that one other way to mitigate the effects of this on the   Fed’s balance sheet would be to sell debt to the private sector to finance part of the TALF  I   should say that we had at least one presentation on this to the Board  The Board has not taken a   decision We wanted to bring this up here and hear comments from the FOMC  We are not fully   persuaded that it’s workable and viable In any case, we’re going to have to come to some   conclusion pretty soon, because the Treasury is very eager to get going  But we did want to   bring this to you and tell you what was going on  I’ll be happy to answer questions about this in   a moment   Before I give up the floor, though, I want to talk just a bit about the policy decision for   this meeting  The most likely direction that we would go, as suggested by the alternative   statements, would be to increase our asset purchases  I’m concerned—I don’t want us to be   making that decision in the last five minutes tomorrow when we’re trying to work on the   statement  So I’d like to encourage at least some discussion of that today, because it fits in with   the presentations that we heard Although we don’t have to make a final decision until   tomorrow, at least I’d like to know where people are, roughly speaking, on this topic   I will tell you what I think, because I’m fairly open on the subject  I do think that, as we   will discuss, the economy has deteriorated  Our balance sheet has shrunk over the last few   months It’s true that we’ll continue to buy MBS, but our TALF activities, even if we get into   the legacy TALF, are not likely to scale up for some time  So my own view—again, I want to   hear everybody’s views—is that at this meeting, we ought to approve an additional asset   purchase One possibility, which is probably the minimum we ought to do, would be to double   the agency program from $500 billion MBS and $100 billion debt by midyear, to $1 trillion and                  March 17–18, 2009 62 of 266  $200 billion by the end of the year This would essentially do for the second six months what   we’re doing for the first six months of 2009  That certainly would be a possibility  Let me just   say that I’m very interested to hear views  We might want to go bigger than that, if we think that   we want to be more aggressive   The other possibility, of course, as we’ve discussed, is also or alternatively to buy   Treasury securities People will express their views on that  I think that’s a potentially useful   direction to go in, and I’m very open to that, if that’s what people want to do  I think the UK   example is promising  It does show that there can be benefits not only to the Treasury market   but also to the broader private markets  And I’m not that concerned about adverse implications,   say, for inflation expectations, because we’ve all seen Treasury purchases in many other   contexts; besides the British context, the Japanese have done a lot of this, the Swiss, the   Canadians are going to start doing this It would be potentially in conjunction with MBS   purchases So I think there are issues there, but I’m open to this possibility   I want to say that I would like to hear some discussion today and in the go-round   tomorrow, so that when we get to the final policy decision we won’t be making a spur-of-the­  moment decision  We’ll have a sense of where everybody is and what the best outcome might   be Let me stop there and open it up for general discussion or questions  Let’s try to maintain an   informal format, and, remember, we have two go-rounds ahead of us  Questions or comments?   President Plosser   Basically, what happens now is that an investor buys a   security and leaves that security with the Fed and gets 90 percent financing—or   10 to 1 leverage—against that security  There’s a put option, because it’s nonrecourse lending    So it would be the same thing  In this case, the public–private hedge fund—80 percent Treasury,   20 percent private sector—would purchase some RMBS, and it would finance that RMBS—get   leverage on that RMBS—by depositing it at the TALF in the same way that an investor does   currently  The main difference is that the haircuts would have to adjust according to the risk   characteristics of the assets   Yes And we’d have to make sure we had sufficient capital   from the Treasury  I think that what might be going on is that these might happen in one-off   deals where portfolios are being presented, and that would require us to hire investment banks or   asset analysts to do the work for us and give us their assessments of the risk characteristics   In one indirect sense—if we find that we can no longer   finance them because of monetary policy considerations, then, under the SFP model, Treasury   financing would replace Fed financing  But the difference between this and Maiden Lane is that   Maiden Lane involves very long-term assets, and the TALF program is a three-year program,   and presumably it would be winding down                 March 17–18, 2009 64 of 266   A two-hander from President Evans   Within the current limits, yes  President Lacker   I was talking about the possibility of getting private debt as   a substitute for Fed financing in the TALF  So that’s a hypothetical possibility  But, in general,   the way the TALF works is that we have a haircut to protect us, and, if there are any further   losses, then the Treasury is the first to take them   No, they are two separate things   We’ve got to figure out two parameters  Probably the   simplest thing would be to pick a single ratio of Treasury capital to leverage, because we don’t   want to do that asset by asset So the haircuts will have to vary, and the combination of the   haircut and the Treasury capital will protect the Fed against loss   That’s what I’m saying, yes              March 17–18, 2009 65 of 266  That’s separate from it, yes  Treasury capital comes in in   two places—one to give leverage and the other to protect the Fed   Again, this is aspirational  It’s not going to happen in the   next six weeks It’s not going to happen in the current political atmosphere  But it would be a   stated intention of the Treasury that, at some point, they would be looking to take these things off   our hands, and that would, in my mind, include those things as well    Yes, within a week or two   It will state that we are actively engaged on the Fed   bills-SFP front It will state the principle that the Fed is not to take credit risk, which we will   enforce It will state our intention, which is a strong intention on both sides, to undertake the   negotiation on a resolution regime that will define what role the Fed might have in those kinds of   contexts And it will state the aspirational goal of the Treasury taking Maiden Lane off our   balance sheet   Well, de minimis Obviously, we take credit risk—even the   CDS spreads on Treasuries are not zero   Bill talked about it  In the case of the TALF, we have   worked out criteria where very extreme—very extreme—loss outcomes do not touch the Fed,   and probably don’t even touch the Treasury; but they don’t touch the Fed   Bill, do you want to talk about that?   President Hoenig   We’re financing the bad banks  We aren’t the capital in the   bad bank   That’s right But in terms of your other question, we’ll   have to be very careful about maturities, and so on  For a three-year loan, when the three years   are up, if the value of the asset has fallen by more than the haircut, they will put the asset to the   bad bank, and the asset managers of the bad bank will sell it or dispose of it  If the value of the   asset has not fallen as much as the haircut, then there will be a strong incentive for the public–   private partners—and, of course, for the government, because the Treasury will be the dominant   partner—to find other financing   I think the Administration is weighing the possibility of   legislation to get additional authorities, for example, considering whether it would be possible to   change the scoring on the TARP, which is very unfavorable  If they can get appropriate   authorities, I think they would do that But the politics is just unbelievably bad, and it’s very   difficult to get anything done I think it’s their intention to try  I think they believe that they   may not have enough resources to do all they need to do, in which case they will pursue other   resources, and we can see what happens My own guess is that, one way or another, we’re                 March 17–18, 2009 68 of 266  probably not going to end up taking very much stuff, either because there won’t be that much   interest, or because there will be other facilities, or because some other arrangement will   develop This is in order to have something that’s part of the bigger program in the short term   Yes   I was just conjecturing that, in the end, this legacy TALF   would probably not do very much business   Because of the pricing and the difficulty of finding private   sector participants   Right So we have to mark it down to a market price which   we’d lend against, and then there’s a haircut on top of that, of course  So, the question is Is that   attractive?   The complexity is one issue  Would we be able to figure   out how to do haircuts in a way that would be meaningful—that is, so that, on the one hand, the   haircuts would be not so conservative as to imply no business, and, on the other hand, they’d be               March 17–18, 2009 69 of 266  conservative enough to provide enough safety? Another issue that we and the FOMC are   considering more broadly is What are the implications for our balance sheet, and management   of our balance sheet?   The way it is now conceived, the FDIC would be   responsible for taking portfolios directly from banks and probably bank holding companies  So   the answer to that question I guess is, “no”  The intent would be to try to create more liquidity   and pricing discovery, and so on, in these markets generally   Correct And I suppose if they wanted to buy from a bank,   I don’t think there would be any restriction on that  But that’s not the point of it   As I said, I’m sure this will not be operational for months    So that’s one reason that I think that we can’t wait for it in terms of our broader policy   objectives   It’s still going to be months, I am sure   As I said, economically they’re very similar  The FDIC,   though, would deal directly with banks and could take a whole portfolio—it could be a   completely heterogeneous portfolio—and there would be a bid on that portfolio, just the same   way as when you wind down a failed bank I would imagine that the remit for these hedge funds   would be “buy RMBS on the market”  I think it would be less heterogeneous than the portfolios   that the FDIC would be taking  The FDIC would be a much more classic bad bank type of   structure   If I’m incorrect on anything, please, staff members, don’t   hesitate to correct me, but my understanding is that the supervisors and the bank together would   determine the portfolio  So in many cases there would presumably be a mixture of accrual and   marked-to-market assets, a mixture of different kinds of assets, derivatives, and other things that   are hard to break off but can be part of a portfolio  President Bullard   Well, we’re one step ahead of the 1951 accord, which   wasn’t even written down [Laughter]   To my knowledge, there is no document representing the   1951 accord   This would be an agreement signed by me and by the   Treasury Secretary and approved also by the President and the Administration  We would share   it with congressional leaders as well   Right They are asks from the Congress  The Treasury and   the Fed agree they are needed and will cooperate in trying to get those things passed   Well, that’s always, of course, a risk   For example, it will formalize the understanding that the   Fed will take no credit risk in the TALF   I’m happy to answer as many questions as people want to   ask, but, again, I also hope to hear something about asset purchases before we close today  Vice   Chairman   President Evans   Five years, probably              March 17–18, 2009 75 of 266  Well, my assumption is that they would move on to other   strategies, which would involve perhaps the Congress, not us  Which would be fine   President Rosengren           March 17–18, 2009 76 of 266  On the resolution authority, Board staff has been working   on legislative language, and Governor Tarullo and others are reviewing it  I think, frankly, that   the Congress will be looking to the Fed and the Treasury to come up with the language, because   it’s a very complex set of issues  And we are working on it  President Bullard   This is why I wanted to hear some of this today  If you   have a specific suggestion, you could bring it tomorrow  But I would comment that we have   been pretty clear about what the timeframe is  We’ve said $500 billion by midyear, and the   proposal would be a trillion by the end of the year  So we are effectively giving monthly rates   The Taylor rule, and so on, emerged essentially from   historical experience It wasn’t ever stated in advance  So that’s a problem  We don’t really   have a reaction function out there, we’re sort of just starting the rational expectations process    We need a way to think about that, and suggestions are welcome   We could say something like, “We will continue as long   as,” or something                 March 17–18, 2009 80 of 266  Okay I appreciate that, and suggestions are welcome    Governor Warsh   Thank you President Lacker   President Hoenig   On the interest rate on excess reserves, I think it’s coming   to play the same role as the discount rate  If the FOMC set a target for the federal funds rate, that   would essentially determine where the interest rate on excess reserves would be, analogous to the   discount rate I think that analogy will hold up pretty well in the future  President Fisher   President Stern   The legislation explicitly says it  It makes no sense to have   the SFP, in particular, if it’s subject to the debt ceiling, because then we would not be able to use   it    Yes President Yellen   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thanks Vice Chairman, did you have a two-hander?   President Fisher   President Lacker   Okay President Pianalto   Thank you  President Plosser   We’re not funding the bad bank   Thank you  President Lockhart   For those who have talked about rates, would expressing   purchases in terms of monthly rates be of any help?  I haven’t yet heard a specific suggestion   about how to do that Something like, say, “the Desk will aim to buy $80 billion a month of   mortgage-backed securities”   I’m looking for a concrete example  I’d be more than   happy to try to accommodate this kind of language if we can figure out how to do it  Brian is   already worried about missing dinner, I’m sure  [Laughter]   Okay, good We’ll discuss that in the morning  Governor   Tarullo        March 17–18, 2009 107 of 266  Thanks Governor Duke           March 17–18, 2009 109 of 266  Well, I’m certainly glad we avoided a go-round  [Laughter]   Before we leave, we have a little bit of business  We have to ratify domestic open market   operations   Without objection Thank you We do have to vote on the   temporary liquidity swap lines  I heard most people proposing A, which was the more   transparent alternative, understanding that there were perhaps some risks to that  Governor   Kohn, are you okay with that?   All right Would anyone else like to speak on that    question? (No response) If not, do you want to take the roll on the swap lines?   Okay Thank you very much  At dinner tonight we’ll   celebrate Governor Kroszner’s return, and we’ll begin tomorrow morning at 900 am  Thank   you very much   [Meeting recessed]                          March 17–18, 2009 112 of 266  March 18, 2009—Morning Session   Good morning, everybody  I guess we’re ready now,   finally, for the economic review  Let me turn it over to Dave Stockton   Thank you Questions for our colleagues?  President   Lacker   President Stern   President Lockhart   Others?  No other questions?  [No response] Okay Then,   we’re ready to begin our economic go-round  I’m going to start with President Bullard   Thank you President Fisher               March 17–18, 2009 123 of 266  Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you  President Rosengren   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you President Lacker   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo        March 17–18, 2009 161 of 266  Thank you I understand coffee is ready Why don’t we   take a 20-minute break?   [Coffee break]   Let me start by trying to summarize the discussion around   the table, and then I’ll give a few additional comments  The group agreed that the economic   outlook has worsened significantly, and although it wasn’t noted, we have seen very sharp   declines in both the fourth and the first quarters  The slowdown is widespread across sectors and        March 17–18, 2009 164 of 266  has included not only such areas as construction, manufacturing, and retail, but also hospitality,   shipping, and to some extent energy, agriculture, and other areas  A notable development has   been declines abroad, which have been exceptionally severe, and which, together with the   stronger dollar, are hurting US exports There was a view on the part of some that there might   be some stabilization later this year  Factors that might promote a weak recovery later this year   or in 2010 include fiscal policy, monetary stimulus, improvements of financial markets, slower   declines in housing, and working out of the inventory cycle  However, I have to say that there   wasn’t much conviction behind this view, and some saw at best an L-shaped recovery   Risks clearly remain to the downside, and a protracted period of economic weakness   remains a significant possibility, reflecting factors such as an ongoing lack of confidence in   government policy, general uncertainty, need for economic restructuring, and the ongoing   deleveraging process by both financial institutions and households  International prospects may   not be much better, as other countries also face needs for restructuring and many are having   inadequate policy responses Consumption data improved slightly in January and February, but   consumption fundamentals remain quite weak  Declines in wealth have been sharp and have led   consumers to attempt to repair balance sheets by increasing their saving  The labor market is   shedding jobs rapidly, and substantial job losses may continue for a while  Fiscal stimulus was   mentioned  Housing starts and permits have increased a bit, and the Administration’s   foreclosure mitigation plan may also be of some help in the housing market  Nevertheless,   housing continues to disappoint to the downside in general, and house prices continue to fall  It   was noted that declines in house prices affect not only the rates of residential construction but   also consumer wealth, as well as the quality of assets that are held by financial institutions        March 17–18, 2009 165 of 266  In the financial sector, many credit markets, especially those in which the Fed has   intervened, remained fairly stable in the intermeeting period, despite worsening economic news,   and some highly rated corporations have issued debt  However, confidence in the banking   system has deteriorated, as reflected, for example, in widening CDS spreads  Lending is down,   reflecting in part credit supply constraints, as well as lower loan demand and bank concerns   about credit quality and about the economy in general  Participants remain concerned about the   effects of lack of financing on the commercial real estate sector in particular  The success of   government actions to stabilize the banking system remains an important factor in the outlook    There’s a great deal of public skepticism about government efforts in this regard, as well as   populist reaction   Industrial production has fallen sharply both here and abroad as global trade declines    Managers remain pessimistic and uncertain about prospects for sales, prices, and employment   and are prepared to cut employment and investment further if improvement does not materialize    Demand for new capital goods remains weak, as capacity utilization has set a postwar low    Credit constraints are perceived to be an important problem   Most participants expect inflation to remain very low for a time, and some are concerned   about the risk for deflation, including falling wages  Deflationary trends could result in a   deflation trap or a debt–deflation dynamic  Expectations of inflation, but also general economic   conditions, will clearly play an important role going forward   Those are some of the things I took away from the discussion—I’m sure I left out many   points Are there any comments?  [No response]   Let me just add a bit to that  I don’t have a great deal to say  As everyone noted, the   intermeeting news was generally disappointing—below expectations  It’s notable that in        March 17–18, 2009 166 of 266  December we thought things were bad enough to cut rates to zero, and in the last two meetings   the changes in the outlook both times have been quite negative  In particular, like the rest of the   world, the US economy experienced very sharp declines in the fourth quarter and apparently   now in the first quarter   Perhaps the most striking development since the last meeting is the weakening of the   global economy  It’s really quite remarkable how quickly that happened  Many of you have   experienced being abroad and hearing people say that on Tuesday things looked okay and on   Thursday a sudden chill hit the atmosphere and there’s been a tremendous decline since then  I   think one interpretation of the worsening of our outlook is that, in fact, the shock that hit the   world economy in September and October was a truly enormous shock and that we have been   slow in understanding how big it was and how persistent it was  So, in some sense, it’s not that   we’ve had new shocks, but rather that we are just coming to the point of understanding how bad   that shock was   There were, of course, a few glimmers of positive news, and President Stern and others   made note of that  There were some indications of stabilization in consumption in January and   February, and that is before the actual fiscal stimulus kicks in, which may be of some help unless   you think people are anticipating it, which is possible  That seemed to happen last spring   actually Also, we saw a bit of improvement in the housing starts and the permits yesterday  So   there’s a little good news there, but, like most people, I wouldn’t want to take too much of a   signal from that  First of all, both of these data sets are very volatile month to month, and they   suffer from a great deal of seasonality and other factors  But more importantly, given the size of   the shock that the world economy apparently was hit with in the fall, there’s going to be an           March 17–18, 2009 167 of 266  unavoidable cyclical dynamic that’s just going to have to work its way out  There’s almost   nothing that can be done at this point to avoid it   In particular, consumer spending may stabilize, but it’s going to be facing very   substantial headwinds, including the familiar list of further stock price declines, house price   declines, ongoing job losses, confidence declines, and the same factors that we’ve talked about    I’d reiterate also the point that the Vice Chairman made about the saving rate  We have a recent   reading of about 5 percent in the household saving rate  That was possibly, to some extent,   exaggerated by temporary increases in income  If the consumer wants to maintain that saving   rate or go higher, it suggests a relatively weak consumption profile going forward   Moreover, even if consumption stabilizes, the rest of the dynamic is still very powerful    Inventories, for example—the inventory profile looks worse than it did at the last meeting, in the   sense that the overhang seems to be greater than we thought it might have been and, therefore,   the cycle will take longer to work its way through  I talked about this at the last meeting  At the   last meeting we had inventory dynamics leading possibly to slightly positive economic growth   by the third quarter Those dynamics now look distinctly less favorable  Inventory investment is   likely to be negative throughout the rest of the year  It may add to growth in the sense it will be   less negative going forward, but, certainly, that dynamic is going to be a very powerful one for   some time   The other dynamics that have been talked about around the table include investment  We   could hardly expect strong investment in the context of declining output, a postwar low in   capacity utilization, credit constraints, uncertainty, et cetera  With investment continuing to be   quite weak, final sales will be weak, and therefore, the inventory dynamic will be stretched out    There’s also, of course, an employment dynamic to the extent that the employment levels are              March 17–18, 2009 168 of 266  above the sustainable levels from the perspective of individual firms  As the continued   economic weakness is perceived, we’ll see further job losses and further dynamic adjustment   I would reiterate the importance of the global decline  Steve talked about the   implications for contributions to GDP of the swing in exports from early last year until now, and   there obviously is not going to be major change in that in the near term   And finally, there was a lot of discussion around the table, which I would reiterate, about   financial conditions There is some improvement, or at least some stabilization, in some credit   markets  I think that we’re certainly better off than we were at the beginning of the shock in   September and October, but banks are under exceptional stress  The CDS spreads were   mentioned  The political situation is very adverse in terms of ensuring that the government will   have the resources and support to take the necessary action to get the banking system stabilized    Thinking about the alternative simulations in the Greenbook, I think delayed financial repair   might well be one that we would want to consider  The experience of other countries and other   episodes is that that leads, at best, to a period of stagnation, if not to further decline   I don’t want to be completely bleak  Like others, I saw a few positive signs  There’s   some indication that the free fall of the fourth quarter and first quarter might be moderating to   some extent, particularly in consumer spending  If that’s so and if fears of a depression or some   extreme event begin to wane, we may see some stabilization of final demand, which then will   feed into the inventory and investment dynamic over time  But under any circumstances, and   particularly if the banking situation is not resolved in a favorable way, I think we can expect to   see very large output gaps develop and a very sustained, weak condition for the economy                                                                              5 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this document (appendix 5)   March 17–18, 2009 169 of 266  That obviously has implications for inflation  As I mentioned last time, deflation per se   is not necessarily the issue  The fact is that, as disinflation progresses, that itself will raise real   interest rates and exacerbate to some extent the debt issues and the housing-valuation issues   So putting that all together, as many people discussed yesterday, I do think that some   aggressive policies may be called for today, and with that I’ll stop and turn to Brian to introduce   the policy round   Thank you, Brian Are there questions?  President Evans           March 17–18, 2009 172 of 266  A two-handed intervention?   A question from President Fisher   Are there other questions?  Governor Duke   There was a two-hander from President Rosengren   Do you think the front-loading is more important than the   announcement effect?   Okay Can we find a phrase that would be added that   would say something like “with the greater portion to be done in the first—”?   Except it’s a little bit uncertain, because if we front-load it,   then later there’s less  Governor Tarullo   Could I interject something here for just a moment?  As I   asked yesterday, everyone gave their views, and I listened very carefully to what the options   were What was suggested here today was two approaches  One expanded on the MBS front,   going from $1 trillion for this year to $1¼ trillion, with a concomitant small increase in agency   debt, but no Treasuries The other approach was to maintain the same pace of MBS purchases   through the second half of the year—subject to a bit of language about timing, in response to the   point that was raised—and to open a new front on the Treasuries side; there I was responding to   concerns that a number of people raised about monetization and the independence perception,   and so on, trying to make it seem more like a step into this arena rather than a big-scale, new   intervention So that was the thinking on those two approaches   Let me now add, having heard the discussion around the table today, I think I would like   to raise a third option, which is the union of the two, which would be the $750 billion of MBS,   plus the $300 billion of Treasuries  I’d be open to that as well   I’m trying to avoid the proliferation of too many alternatives, but what I heard today   suggests that some people at least might be interested in yet a more aggressive approach, while   still attentive to the costs and benefits of expanding our balance sheet faster and further    Do I have clarity on sort of what the options are now?                 March 17–18, 2009 177 of 266  Okay Any other questions for Brian?  President Lacker   So, President Lacker, just to reiterate the options quickly    The “all MBS” option would be $850 billion—that’s $750 billion plus $100 billion  What I will   call the “Treasury” option is $900 billion—that’s $500 billion MBS plus $100 billion agency   debt plus $300 billion Treasuries The “combined” option is $115 trillion—that’s $750 billion   MBS, $100 billion debt, and $300 billion Treasuries    My reaction to your question is that, particularly if we front-load the MBS, even though   there might be some weekly variation in the base, the very strong trend of the base will be clearly   up for the rest of the year This will certainly make it very clear to everybody that that’s the   intention, and that will be the result   It would all have to roll off  It certainly would be very   unlikely, but okay Anyone else have a question for Brian?  [No response]   Just in terms of parameters, we have the three substantive options  I want to remind you   that there are also two statement options  One is more similar to what we’ve had before, which   states the economic situation first, and then goes through the paragraph on policy actions  We   also have proposed an alternative suggested by some comments that President Bullard made that   in some ways would be analogous to our old structure in that it would put the policy actions first    For the sake of convenience, let’s call that the “inverted” structure—without any derogation   implied  So let me now go to President Plosser, if you’re ready   I appreciate it Thank you It’s interesting, and some may   view the lack of specificity between MBS and Treasury as a plus, and some might view it as a   minus  But it’s an interesting alternative, so I appreciate your doing that  Did you want to talk at   all about the choice of the substantive alternatives?                    March 17–18, 2009 183 of 266  Okay Thank you President Fisher   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you again for constructive suggestions  I have a   couple of questions I do want to point out we did try in alternative A to create a reaction   function element in the very last sentence, where we say, “We will be assessing whether a faster   pace would be helpful” Essentially, the pace will be varying as conditions change—it’s hard to   be more specific than that  I guess I have one question for you and one for Trish  For Trish,   maybe you can help me  What do you think would be the effect of not specifying the breakdown   between Treasuries and MBS?   I have a question for Presidents Plosser and Bullard about   the flexibility you get by saying just “per month” without any specification of timeframe  I        March 17–18, 2009 191 of 266  imagine you would, therefore, have less of an announcement effect, and it would be more   difficult to do a persuasive front-load in that case   For example, one thing you could say—I’m just trying to be   helpful—would be “a combined average of about 10 percent per month in the next few quarters,”   or something like that, to give a bit of a horizon   This also relies on people being able to do geometric   calculations [Laughter] I’ll put that aside for now   Okay Let’s go on, if I might  President Rosengren        March 17–18, 2009 192 of 266  Thank you President Lacker   First, Trish and Spence, would you folks think about a   sentence that could be added to one of the directives, to the effect that “The Desk will strive to   ensure that the monetary base” or “the size of the portfolio,” or something like that, “has a   positive monthly growth rate,” or whatever you think would be realistic or manageable?  We   don’t want to put in something that, just for operational reasons, doesn’t work   “It is the expectation of the Committee that the base will be   growing over time,” or something like that?  Does that help?   Federal Reserve liabilities?  I’m just making this   assignment, and they’ll come up with a suggestion  We’ll discuss it at the end, okay?                  March 17–18, 2009 196 of 266  We’ll make some kind of attempt  It’s just a good faith   effort, that’s all   Well, we’ll worry about SFP when we get it  [Laughter]   Let me address this issue about pessimism  I just want to point out that the January statement   was isomorphic to what we’re proposing to say in this one  It’s in your handout  It’s not exactly   the same, but it’s very similar  The only difference is that the last sentence in January was that   the “downside risks are significant,” and we leave that out of this one   Yes, President Fisher   Okay  I hear the point   Okay Governor Kohn   President Lacker   President Hoenig              March 17–18, 2009 200 of 266  Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Bullard   President Evans   The rationale for a slightly smaller purchase of Treasuries is   that we don’t know what the effect will be, and it’s kind of a “toe in the water” thing   I am informed, President Fisher, that you have to leave for a   plane I am also informed that today is your 60th birthday Is that correct?        March 17–18, 2009 206 of 266  We do have to move along here  President Lockhart   President Lockhart, on the issue of explaining the Treasury   purchases in alternative A, if we do the combination, we’d want to import the sentence from   alternative A that starts with, “Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets,   the Committee decided”  So that follows up the previous language and explains that we’re not   monetizing the debt and so on  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   I must find new nomenclature, I’m afraid  Governor   Tarullo   I think one argument that’s been made here is that we want   to diversify in different markets   Vice Chairman   Thank you Let’s try to put this all together  Most   importantly, I think there’s a pretty strong consensus for the combined package, the total of   $115 trillion I heard the point about doing even more in Treasuries  I guess I think that just   crossing the Rubicon will have a significant announcement effect, because it will signal our   willingness to do more if necessary in the future  I am a little concerned about misinterpretation   of what we’re doing, so I guess I would like to propose to stay where we are for the moment    We can always change it   I very much appreciate the contribution from Presidents Plosser and Bullard  I don’t   think we’re quite ready to go there, but I do think we can start communicating in that way and   start trying to talk about percentages as we talk in speeches and other contexts  I think, in   particular, since we want to front-load, it’s hard to put it in percentage terms at the moment  And   I think that to get the maximum effect in the short run that Governor Duke talked about, it would   be better to have a headline number  But I think it’s actually a very constructive point, and we   should think about ways to move in that direction if we can   So what I propose is to start from alternative B  I think it’s reasonable to do either B or   B′, but I didn’t hear a huge amount of demand to go to B′ I heard the concerns about the first   paragraph What if we say that “the economy continues to contract,” as some suggested?   “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates the   economy continues to contract,” period, and we’d drop “the outlook has worsened” as well    Then, if you like, we could drop, say, the sentence that starts with “Weaker sales prospects,” but   I think that is consistent with our previous style in trying to describe elements of the economy    Then I would note that we have a somewhat optimistic ending in this paragraph  So I don’t think           March 17–18, 2009 216 of 266  that it’s going to be a huge shocker to anybody, and we do have to motivate why we’re taking   such a strong action Comments?   No I was trying to keep life as simple as I can, but let’s see   here Where is it?   Are people okay with substituting that sentence?   President Lacker   Well, all we’re saying here is that these things will   contribute We’re not saying that they’re the only reason   Let me go on  President Bullard           March 17–18, 2009 217 of 266  Again, I think what we’re saying here is that we anticipate   that these things will contribute to an overall dynamic   In B, in the third paragraph, we have the sentence about the “additional $750 billion of   agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to $125   trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by $100 billion to a total   of $200 billion” So that’s exactly as in B  Can we say something like, “the Desk has been   instructed to…”?   I don’t think that’s what people wanted to say, though     Is it okay to do it that way and not put it in the statement?   Okay I’ll come to that one  Thank you Let’s back up a   second There is the question of “federal funds rate for some time”  President Yellen suggested   going to “for an extended period”   Are we okay with that?   Because conditions have worsened, our expected liftoff   time is probably longer than it was   Then we have the sentence on the agency debt—that’s okay  Then the next sentence   about “prepared to purchase long-term Treasuries” is to be replaced by the sentence in alternative   A “Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to   purchase $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months”   Yes Do we have “up to’s” in the original announcements?   All right  So let’s make sure we have consistency with that    As Governor Duke and some others noted, there were questions about the last part  We should   end the last sentence, “The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and   composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market           March 17–18, 2009 219 of 266  developments,” period  Why don’t we say “in light of evolving financial and economic   developments” instead?     But I’m dropping all the stuff about assessing our lending   programs  At this point we’re in an assessment mode  I think the only question remaining,   Brian, is the “up to”   Why don’t we put “up to” in front of each?  So it’s “up to   an additional $750 billion”   And then on Treasuries, “purchase up to $300 billion”    Brian, are you ready to try to read?   The rest is the same, and the second paragraph is the same   Okay We’re ready then  President Lacker?   The directive, you’re right  Do we have something, Trish?   The directive is to be made consistent, and we said   something along the lines that—    We don’t issue the directive at 215, do we?   We’ll put in the Treasury part Then, can you include a   sentence like, “The Desk will endeavor to ensure that the size of the portfolio rose”?           March 17–18, 2009 221 of 266  “Expand significantly” even    Is that okay?    Okay Are we ready for a vote now?  Debbie, would you    call the roll, please?    Thank you very much  The next meeting is April 28 and   29 We’ll adjourn  Lunch will be available, and over lunch, Laricke Blanchard will provide us   with an update on congressional activities  	Thank you   END OF MEETING      "
8724,2009-04-28,BERNANKE," Good afternoon, everybody  This is a joint meeting of the   FOMC and the Board, so I need a motion to close the Board meeting   Without objection  Thank you Our first item of business   is to get reports on Desk operations, liquidity programs, and balance sheet developments  Let me    turn first to Trish Mosser  Trish    Thank you We will have an opportunity shortly to have a   general discussion of these issues, but for right now let’s just take any questions that might be for   the staff President Rosengren        April 28–29, 2009 14 of 201  Could I just follow up on that?  Looking at it from the other   side, we’re focused mostly on new issues  Is that right?   Why are we doing that instead of mixing new issues and   seasoned mortgages?   President Fisher   President Pianalto   Thank you Vice Chairman   I’d like to interject my thanks also, Trish, for a wonderful   job, and to the staff in general Our whole system has changed from interest rates to balance   sheets and from money supply to lending programs, and I have been very impressed  I think our   colleagues would share my view that the material you’ve provided to us on the various programs   and the analysis that the Board staff has done on their effects have been extremely helpful, and I   just want to express my appreciation for that  President Hoenig           April 28–29, 2009 20 of 201  President Lacker   Will you be able to take questions on that after your   presentation?  Yes, after the economic presentation   Anyone else? If not, I’d like to open the floor for a brief   interactive discussion We have two go-rounds to come, and so there’s no need for everyone   necessarily to state their views But I did want to leave open the opportunity so that we can   address any issues that are on people’s minds   Let me start  I want to make just a few preliminary comments  I will, in fact, be   repeating some things that Trish said, which is that, as we look at the time profile of the balance   sheet even under our current plan, it is evident that we are going to need various exit strategies    That is going to be very important  I want to reiterate that we are working very hard—and I will   talk specifically in a moment—to bring some specifics to the Committee in June   First of all, as I think Brian may discuss, one set of issues relates to winding down or   extending existing programs  Winding down could mean either letting them expire—many of   them are slated to end in October—or changing the terms over time so that they become less              April 28–29, 2009 22 of 201  attractive So in June we will bring to you a set of recommendations from the staff about which   programs might be extended over year-end and which might be either allowed to expire or   modified in some way so that they will naturally shut down  So that’s one element   Second, as Trish was discussing, we have a set of work streams looking at different ways   of sterilizing the balance sheet I want to begin by saying that, although I think it would be   prudent for us to assume that we do not have Fed bills or the supplemental financing program   from the Treasury, I think in fact there’s a reasonable chance that we will get one or the other at   least  The Administration and the Treasury are strongly supportive of Fed bills, and I have   gotten some good responses from some key congressmen  So although it may not be the   appropriate moment right now to do that, we will continue to pursue that  If that doesn’t come   through, then of course we can go back also to the SFP, which I think under your assumption   was not included in the analysis So that’s a direction in which to go   In addition, the staff will continue to work on interest on reserves to make that more   effective I think that there are things we can do  Trish mentioned a redeposit facility or a term   deposit facility, changing the structure of reserve requirements, and other things that we can do   to make that more effective  Another thing we can perhaps do is work with the Treasury to   manage GSE balances in a better way so that they don’t get dumped into the market  The issue   of reverse repos has come up, which would be a way to essentially fund our holdings in the   markets other than via excess reserves  Utilizing the repo markets has the advantage of putting   upward pressure on short-term interest rates at the same time that we’re trying to raise the federal   funds rate So it will have, in some sense, a double effect—both a market effect and an effect on   reserve balances The TALF doesn’t look to be likely to go to $1 trillion  We’ll see how it   evolves In any case, we have limited at this point the longer-term commitments to $100 billion,              April 28–29, 2009 23 of 201  and we are looking at possible options for finding different ways to finance the TALF, which   also might relieve our balance sheet to some extent  Then, if necessary, we can sell assets, which   in turn would be tightening   So I think these are extraordinarily important  We need to have a good sense of what our   exit strategy is as soon as possible, both because we want to be able to reassure markets and   ourselves that we are comfortable with where we are and because, if we do decide to become   more aggressive and do additional purchases, we would obviously be much more willing to do   that if we were quite confident about our ability to exit in a timely manner  I just wanted to   assure everyone that we are working on those things, and we plan more-extensive presentations   in June on all those issues Let me now just ask  Does anyone want to comment or raise any   issues on this whole set of topics?  President Plosser   Let me just comment  It’s a very good question I would   first like to make the observation that Fed bills are not an exotic instrument  We are about the   only major central bank that doesn’t have this capacity  I was having a very entertaining   conversation with Governor Shirakawa of the Bank of Japan, and he was explaining to me the   subtleties  They have the ability both to take interest on reserves and to issue their own bills and   he was saying, “Well, it depends whether it’s two o’clock or four o’clock in the afternoon, which   one is better for fine tuning;” and I was saying that I wish I had exactly that kind of flexibility    But what I perceive—and of course, politics are always difficult to assess—is that the resistance   that we might get would be less a desire to force us to use Fed bills to support certain credit   programs but rather the opposite  I think the concern of the Congress is that it might give us too   much unchecked authority, and they might be resistant to doing that  So one possible   compromise that might come up, which might answer your concerns to some extent, would be to   put a strict time limit in terms of allowing this for the exit strategy but not after that, for example   About strings being attached, obviously strings that compromise monetary policy   independence would not be acceptable, and I do think that we have the Administration’s support        April 28–29, 2009 25 of 201  on that issue For example, if they involved disclosures about programs and things of that sort, if   we felt that they were consistent with the effectiveness of those programs and monetary policy   independence, those would be the kinds of things we could discuss  At the end of the meeting   tomorrow, Governor Kohn is going to talk about some of our transparency initiatives, things   we’re trying to do that will make us more open in the information we disclose—again, without   compromising either the effectiveness of our lending programs or monetary policy   independence So that would clearly be my set of criteria  But I appreciate your point, and I   understand that Fed bills are not necessarily an unadulterated blessing   No, but things are tough all over   Yes, we’ve decided that we would like the Administration   to affirmatively say, “We think this is a good idea”  We think that’s a possibility, but there’s an   awful lot going on right now, and that doesn’t seem to be the top priority  But it certainly is on   the agenda It is still quite alive, and one of the issues would be just when the right time is  You   and I would probably agree that there would be advantages to doing it at some point relatively   soon, given the uncertainties about exit strategies, Fed policies, et cetera  But we’re going to   have to let the crush of events to some extent determine what is the optimal point in doing that  I   think the Administration has considerable interest in supporting this, and as I said, I got fairly                 April 28–29, 2009 26 of 201  good responses from a couple of key congressional people as well  So I think it is alive, but we   should not be too impatient and should wait for it to mature in the fullness of time   Other comments?  Questions?  President Fisher   I would imagine it would be the oversight committees—the   Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in the Senate and the Financial Services   Committee in the House   True   I understand that, and as I said, I think we have to plan  We   may have this tool, but we should plan as if we will not have it  Other comments?  All right  If   there are no other comments, we have a couple of votes to take  The first is to ratify domestic   open market operations                                                              April 28–29, 2009 27 of 201  PARTICIPANT So move   Objection?  I see none  Second, Trish mentioned very   quickly—and you did receive a memo—the annual renewal of the swap lines with Mexico and   Canada This has been going on for many years  I think that they are somewhat redundant at   this point, given the other swap lines that we have, but we have maintained this relationship for   some time  Is there any discussion or are there questions about that?  President Lacker   Thank you Other comments or questions?  Could I have a   motion?    Without objection  Thank you very much  Let’s turn now   to the economic situation and Dave Stockton   Thank you very much  Are there questions for Dave,   Nathan, or Brian?  President Lacker   Couldn’t you just as well argue that, if they ran into that   constraint, they’d want to get rid of the reserves and lend them out?   I have two-handers from Governor Kohn and President   Yellen   President Yellen   Trish   This is a good issue for us to look at more carefully    President Lacker   I think those are solvable problems  President Evans,   you’ve been waiting   President Fisher   Other questions? Okay If not, it’s 400 pm I understand   that coffee is ready Why don’t we take a 20-minute break  Thank you   [Coffee break]   Okay We’re ready to begin with our economic go-round    Let me start with President Rosengren  Eric, when you’re ready   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Fisher   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you We can add to the statement, “Wait until next   year” [Laughter]  President Pianalto   Thank you President Lacker   Any charge for the pins?   Your drawl will be reflected in the transcript [Laughter]   President Stern   Thank you President Hoenig        April 28–29, 2009 78 of 201  Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you And thank you all for a very interesting set of   comments This is a good time for us to break  There is a reception and dinner upstairs  No   business will be conducted, just for your convenience  We will begin tomorrow at 900 am    Thank you   [Meeting recessed]                                                                  5 The materials used by Mr Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   April 28–29, 2009 97 of 201  April 29—Morning Session   Good morning, everybody  I think we have some data to   begin with Dave   Any questions? Okay  I have the rare advantage of having   had overnight to work out my summary of the discussion so it may be somewhat more coherent   than usual  Let me start with that  The intermeeting period saw some tentative evidence of   stabilization of real activity, or at least a slower decline relative to the earlier sharp contraction    Indicators of possible stabilization appeared in data on consumption, housing, durable goods,   regional manufacturing reports, and other areas  Surveys and some anecdotal reports suggested a   slightly greater confidence on the part of households and businesses  Financial markets also   generally improved  Inventory decumulation has been brisk, suggesting possible increases in   production in the medium term  However, labor markets remained weak and global economic   and financial conditions, adverse   Overall, participants were very cautious about taking too much signal from the incoming   data, noting its tentative nature, particularly the improvement in the financial markets  False   dawns have occurred in previous recessions To the extent that participants saw an upturn   materializing, most thought that it would be relatively anemic because of factors such as   financial headwinds, including ongoing deleveraging; the need for economic restructuring; slow   global economic growth that may be lagging the US cycle; and the high vulnerability of the   fragile economy and financial system to shocks  Further policy support, both in the United        April 28–29, 2009 99 of 201  States and abroad, would be constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates and by the   already high level of fiscal borrowing   Consumer spending shows some signs of bottoming out  Fiscal stimulus will support   consumer income going forward, and the rising stock market and possibly slower declines in   house prices imply that wealth is no longer dropping so sharply  There are at best, however, only   the slightest indications of improvement in labor markets  Unemployment claims and job losses   remain high; firms are undertaking permanent reductions in labor force; and involuntary part-  time work is unusually elevated  Housing activity is giving some indications of stabilizing at a   very low level, with affordability and buyer traffic up and inventories down  However, prices   are likely to continue to fall, in part because of the additions to supply from high rates of   foreclosure   Production and investment remain weak, although firms’ attitudes are not quite as   negative as they recently were  Drilling and mining have been affected by commodity prices    Export demand remains depressed  Industrial production has continued to fall both here and   abroad, and growth rates in both advanced and emerging-market economies have fallen   significantly China is somewhat stronger than other Asian countries, but perhaps not as strong   as its official statistics imply; and like many other countries, it remains dependent on export   demand  Europe faces slow growth and potentially serious banking problems, including   exposures to Eastern Europe   Financial market conditions generally had a better tone  Stock prices rose, money   markets exhibited better liquidity and lower spreads, corporate issuance of bonds and convertible   securities is healthy, volatility is down, and other indicators of market functioning have   improved  Better financial conditions have helped confidence, even as indications of economic        April 28–29, 2009 100 of 201  improvement have reduced risk aversion in markets  However, financial markets had shown   signs of improvement on several previous occasions before worsening again  Moreover,   although banks generally reported good earnings in the first quarter and their share prices rose,   confidence in banks—as shown in CDS spreads, for example—remains tenuous  A number of   people observed that the disclosure of the capital assessment results on Monday will be a stress   test in itself for the banks and the markets  Credit continues to contract because of declining   credit quality and loan demand, capital constraints on banks that don’t want to base increased   lending on government capital, and the unavailability of financing through securitization   markets  Lack of financing for commercial real estate remains a particularly serious issue     Most see inflation as remaining low for the foreseeable future  Slack looks to be high   and increasing, as reflected in high unemployment and low capacity utilization  Wages are   growing more slowly  With the slight improvement in the outlook and the incoming inflation   data not particularly low, deflation risks have moderated but remain a worry for some   participants On the other hand, some expressed concerns about upside inflation risks, reflecting   the possibility that the output gap is being overestimated and that forward-looking expectations   may react to factors such as the Fed’s rapid balance sheet expansion and its purchases of   Treasury securities Effective exit strategies from Fed policies and good communication are   necessary to maintain confidence that price stability will be achieved   So that is my overview  Any comments or questions?  If not, let me make just a few   comments, as usual I am after Governor Tarullo, and so it is even more difficult for me than for   him to come up with something new  On the proverbial green shoots, [laughter] we all want to   be cautious, but it is nevertheless better to see good news than to see bad news, and we have seen   some nascent signs of improvement  Although they are small, subject to revision, and so on,                 April 28–29, 2009 101 of 201  they do occur across a number of areas, and so that is a positive  But, of course, I agree that we   need to be very cautious about overinterpreting what are still relatively modest changes  I am   reminded of a comment I heard on MSNBC while I was watching Tim Geithner’s press   conference after the G–7 Tim had said something to the effect that the rate of decline had   slowed, and the commentator said, “Well, if you close all the factories in the first quarter, the   rate of growth will stop declining”   I think one area that we all do feel somewhat better about is the financial markets  There   has been a range of improvements in areas where the Fed has been involved but also in other   areas like the corporate markets  A wide range of volatility and stress measures have also looked   a bit better, and we saw a bit of improvement in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  It   could be that we are seeing a bit of the adverse feedback loop working in the other direction,   which is, of course, good The markets, in turn, have responded to some extent to improved   news, and higher stock markets, for example, have helped confidence and probably spurred some   extra consumer spending  But, again, back to the theme of not overinterpreting or   overextrapolating, we have seen how quickly those gains can be lost   As we look at the economy and try to think about where it is going, it is useful to have on   two sets of glasses—both a short-term cyclical-dynamic set of glasses and a medium-term   adjustment set of glasses  On the short-run cyclical dynamics, we are seeing what may be the   working-through of a classic inventory cycle  The GDP data just shown were a striking contrast   between the fourth quarter and the first quarter in terms of the composition of final demand   versus inventory decumulation  In that respect, it is encouraging that inventories are moving   back toward balance The Greenbook sees that process as ongoing, with inventory decumulation   in the second quarter being about as large as in the first quarter  Nevertheless, obviously, as that        April 28–29, 2009 102 of 201  cycle proceeds, we will perhaps see some improvement in production  Of course that depends   on seeing stabilization in final demand, which ultimately drives the short-run cycle, and there are   a lot of risks here People have talked about the risks to commercial real estate, other   construction, trade, and so on The key element, as usual, will be the consumer, and I do think   that the improvement in the first quarter is not entirely a fluke  I think there are some signs of   improvement in that area, notably that wealth is not declining as quickly—the stock market and   housing prices are not falling as much  We saw a rather marked increase in sentiment yesterday    Fiscal policy is going to be supportive of consumer spending  Credit is tight but probably not   getting worse  The main uncertainty there, as a number of you pointed out, is the labor market    Until we see a bit of improvement there, that will remain a major source of uncertainty  But in   the surveys and so on, we have seen just a bit of indication that consumers see strengthening in   the labor market   So the combination of some potential stabilization in final demand and the working-  through of the inventory dynamics does give some hope—again, with all the caveats that   everyone has expressed—that we will see somewhat better economic growth performance in the   next couple of quarters and possibly even the end of the technical recession by the fall  In   thinking about that, though, we should also keep in mind not just the short-run growth dynamics   but also the amplitude of this whole episode  Burns and Mitchell, in their original classic work,   divided the business cycle into six stages, which were of indeterminate length  And the bigger   the recession, the longer each of the cycle’s six stages was  Obviously, the shock that hit the   economy in the fall of last year was enormous, and it was global  So even if we see the usual   inventory–final demand dynamics working through, that combined with the restraining effects of   financial stress and the like suggests that this will be a slower, deeper cyclical pattern than is                 April 28–29, 2009 103 of 201  normal  So, to summarize, on the cyclical side, while Governor Tarullo’s examples of false   dawns are very instructive, I think there is a decent chance that we will see some improvement in   the near term   The other perspective, however, which I think is very important and a number of people   pointed out, is the medium-term constraints and dynamics that affect the economy    Unfortunately, our economy still has a significant number of very serious imbalances that need   to be resolved before it can grow at a healthy pace Just to list five First, the leverage issue of   both the financial and the household sectors  Second, wealth–income ratios are well below   normal, and therefore more saving is needed to rebuild those ratios  Third, we have dramatic   fiscal imbalances, which have to be reconciled at some point  Fourth, we have current account   imbalances, which are at least temporarily down, but the Greenbook forecast for the medium   term is that there is probably some worsening in that dimension  And fifth, as a number of   people mentioned, the unemployment we are seeing is probably not mostly a temporary-layoff   type of unemployment  There is a lot of reallocation going on  The financial and the   construction sectors are probably not going to be as big in the future as they have been recently,   so there will need to be that readjustment across sectors   If you put all of those imbalances together and you think about what is going to support   sustainable economic growth, it is a little hard to see where a robust recovery is going to come   from  In particular, consumption is unlikely to be dynamic, as President Trichet would put it,   because of leverage and the need to build wealth and because of lower employment and those   factors The government sector is unlikely to be a major support indefinitely because of the need   to rebalance the fiscal budget Therefore, by arithmetic, that leaves only two categories, which   are investment and net exports  A capital boom would be very good news  Among other things,                                                           April 28–29, 2009 104 of 201  it would help solve some of these reallocation problems and allow new industries to expand or to   grow But it is not obvious where that is going to come from, and the financial constraints are   also a drag on that direction Finally, what we really and truly need, as we have been saying for   many years, is a rebalancing of global demand that would allow the United States to have better   external demand  Again, there are some preliminary steps in that direction, notably in China and   a few other countries that are beginning to understand that full reliance on exports is not   necessarily a safe strategy But that is not likely to be a near-term solution   So when you look at the economy from both of these short-term dynamic and medium-  term dynamic approaches, the conclusion is that we may have some improvement this year    That, of course, is hostage to financial conditions and to consumer behavior and attitudes  But I   don’t see much scope for a stronger recovery  I could be wrong  There are things going in that   direction, such as the depth of the recession, which may at some point mean a stronger recovery    But it is difficult to see the underlying factors that will lead to a powerful recovery in the near   term, and so we will have to deal with that  The implications for policy, as people have pointed   out, are not entirely unambiguous because, to the extent that slow growth reflects things like   reallocation and changes in the structure of the economy, it is as much a potential growth issue as   it is an aggregate demand issue  So that is my assessment  Unless there is any comment or   question, let me turn now to the policy round, and I will call on Brian    Thank you Are there questions for Brian?  President   Evans   President Lockhart   President Fisher   President Bullard     April 28–29, 2009 113 of 201  I’d like to say, though, that I don’t see any reason that you   couldn’t say that we’re going to extend this three months but we’re going to have a tapering off   Other questions? Okay  If not, we are ready for our policy   go-round Let me start with President Plosser   I have just one small comment  I appreciate your doing   what I asked, which is to work in advance and provide a concrete alternative, which I think is   very helpful I have a question about B′′ versus B′′′—the 18 to 20 percent versus the $160 billion   per month  I think a problem with the 18 to 20 percent is, of course, that if we follow our plan, a   week from now we’ll be announcing 15 to 18 percent or something, and that could be   misconstrued as a change in our strategy  It isn’t quite as transparent in that respect  So in doing   this, my inclination would be to go with the dollar number  But I just raise that point   President Hoenig           April 28–29, 2009 120 of 201  Thank you President Yellen   President Evans   Trish, on President Yellen’s suggestion of shortening   maturities, that has the other benefit of making our exit strategy easier   Do you see similar market benefits of mixing in more one­  to-three-year maturities, for example?   Thank you Vice Chairman   President Rosengren   President Lacker   President Stern   Okay Let me just say that, although we have to manage   expectations, we’ve made a commitment to what we’ve made a commitment to, and with the   federal funds rate, we have surprised markets, and if we have to surprise markets, we’ll do it   again So there is no commitment to do anything other than what we’ve said  We have the right,   as we say explicitly in the statement, to adjust the timing  We could, for example, phase out by   extending the period but not the amount in order to go out more slowly  There are other things   we can do So let’s not jump the gun here  But I do want to ask you—just because this came up   earlier—to think for the next meeting a bit about the idea of whether shorter maturity MBS   would have benefits because it would, in addition, have some exit benefits    Not just ARMs but also seasoned MBS with shorter   duration   Were there other two-handers?  President Evans    It says we will adjust our magnitude and timing according   to the information as it comes in  So we could expand the program, we could reduce it, or we   could spread it out All of those things are options  I don’t think it’s fundamentally different   from other monetary policy decisions, which involve both communication and responding to   new information that comes across the transom  Trish   Yes, that’s right  A two-hander from the Vice Chairman           April 28–29, 2009 127 of 201  But it also depends on the economic outlook   President Lockhart   President Bullard   Okay Let’s go back to our regularly scheduled program    [Laughter] President Lacker   Okay Governor Kohn   President Plosser   President Bullard           April 28–29, 2009 133 of 201  Just for clarity, backstop pricing is part of our thinking on   exit that we’ll be talking about, Brian?  Yes President Rosengren   Thank you President Fisher   Thank you  President Evans   All right  I’ll ask President Pianalto to go ahead, but then   maybe we can take a coffee break  How about that?  Go ahead   Very efficient Thank you Why don’t we take a 20-minute   coffee break Thank you   [Coffee break]   All right Why don’t we recommence  President Lockhart,   whenever you are ready   President Stern   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you All right  Well, I again have benefited from a   good discussion I think the policy discussions—don’t take this the wrong way—are getting   better [Laughter] I think they are getting more informative and more interesting as we go   along And I do appreciate it   On the substance there is a good bit of consensus—not complete consensus—on standing   pat We have seen a bit of improvement, but it is very tentative, and other factors, like the bank   assessment program and fiscal policy, are in train  So there is some benefit in watchful waiting   for a time  We have, of course, taken very strong actions in the last few meetings, including a   December move to zero and the large asset purchases that we announced last time  Also, before   substantial increases in our balance sheet, I think many of us—certainly, I—feel that we need to   get further advanced in our understanding of the exit strategy and the tools we will have and   what we will be doing as we go forward  So understanding that more stimulus would be good, as   suggested by the Taylor rule, for example, I think that it would be better to stand pat on the   purchases this time   With respect to the statement, I appreciate very much the discussion on alternative B′′′   and so on I think the consensus for the group was to stay with what we have  The issue here is   that we haven’t quite figured out how to express the state contingency  If we had a Taylor rule           April 28–29, 2009 151 of 201  that would tie the monthly purchases to observables, as President Bullard was suggesting, I think   that would be right and good Unfortunately, the only way to establish such a rule is through a   long period of experience, unless we are prepared to write it down, which I am not quite sure we   are Another issue related to that is—the analogy is not perfect—whether it is the flow of   purchases or the stock of purchases that matters  That is a question Given our inability to write   down a contemporaneous Taylor rule, another alternative approach that one might use in an   interest rate context would be to specify a path and then to change that path as new information   comes in  That is part of the debate between instruments and target rules, for example   So as I said, I very much appreciate the insight and discussion of this issue, and I hope we   will continue to make progress  I would take some exception to the view that we are making up   numbers entirely, because we have done our best—and the staff has certainly done its best—to   try to assess the market and interest rate effects of these actions and feed them into the model    Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty, but being uncertain doesn’t mean you do nothing  It   means you do the best you can, given the information that you have   On state contingency, Governor Warsh raised the concern about the new sentence, three   from the bottom, that “the Committee stands ready to adjust the timing and overall amounts of its   purchases of securities”  Governor Warsh, is your concern that this signals that we are going to   increase?  My thought about this was that it would in fact signal that we are being   state-contingent and that this would be equally likely to induce us to decrease as to increase   Well, the way I thought the two sentences were different is   that the first one speaks specifically to the securities purchases, which is the topic immediately   before it, and it creates for us the flexibility to adjust the timing, for example, to taper off or, for   that matter, to adjust the size of the program  I view the last sentence as addressing the static   overall size and also, when we say “composition,” as implying that we are looking at the mix of   programs and so on as well as the securities purchases  So that was the intent Are others   uncomfortable with that sentence?  President Lacker?   Governor Kohn   “Will consider”—was that what you said?   Okay But get rid of “as appropriate”  “The Committee   will evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases in view of the evolving economic   outlook”   President Fisher   Okay Are there any defenders of that sentence?  All right   Seeing none—yes?  No?   Well, I am prepared to strike it, if that is the will of the   group   President Bullard   Okay I am going to propose a modification, and then we   are going to take a straw vote  Okay?  The modification is, “The Committee will continue to   evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchase of securities,”—get rid of “as   appropriate”—“in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets”    Is that an improvement, Governor Warsh?   All right  So let me ask all participants, all 1 people, for a   “yes” or “no”—or feel free not to vote [Laughter]  All right So how many would like to retain   that sentence as amended?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  Ten?  Okay Well,   that is a majority then  So the sentence will be changed to, “The Committee will continue to   evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving   outlook and conditions in financial markets”   As for the other suggestions that were made for paragraph 1, President Fisher made a   suggestion close to this, and I was thinking how to respond to President Plosser’s concern about   balancing our concerns about growth and price stability  I am not quite sure that President   Fisher’s suggestion of saying “without sacrificing” quite works because the causal factors in that   last sentence in paragraph 1 include not only the Fed but also fiscal and monetary stimulus,   market forces, and a whole variety of things  What if we add to the end of alternative B,   paragraph 1, the words “in a context of price stability”?  So it would say, “The Committee              April 28–29, 2009 155 of 201  continues to anticipate that these various factors will contribute to a gradual resumption of   sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability”?   But the first sentence of paragraph 3, though, says, “Will   employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability”  So that   links our tools   Is this last phrase helpful to you, President Fisher?   All right If everybody is okay—   I am going to add the phrase at the very end of paragraph   B1, the words, “in a context of price stability”  All right  The last thing that came up, President   Fisher suggested in the third sentence of alternative B, “Weak sales have led businesses to cut   back on” then, instead of “inventories and fixed investment,” have “inventories, fixed   investment, and staffing”  I think that is fine substantively  The only thing I would note is that   we do reference job losses in the previous sentence  So does anyone have a view on that?  I am   happy to make the change  All right Shall we go ahead and make the change?  Is that okay?           April 28–29, 2009 156 of 201  All right So “inventories, fixed investment, and staffing”  Do you have all of those   changes now?  Are there further comments?   Yes President Lacker   We don’t want that  [Laughter]   How about “appears to be somewhat slower”?   I guess that pace requires an adjective—appears to be   somewhat slower, the pace is slower  Isn’t that right?   Isn’t that right, Brian?  Okay “The pace of contraction   appears to be somewhat slower”   Any grammarians with concerns?  You know, this is   actually kind of fun here  [Laughter] I have always enjoyed it  Other comments?  All right   Debbie, do you think you are able now to read the statement?   That is what I have as well    Thank you very much  We have a couple of other items   here—one substantive item  We have, as you know, a Transparency Committee, which has been   very actively investigating all aspects of our programs, our institutional structure, and everything   else to try to find whether there are opportunities to provide more information to the public about   our activities that would not compromise our legitimate need for confidentiality of our policy   objectives I asked Governor Kohn to report to us briefly on progress in that committee   Tuesday   Okay We have time now for questions and comments    President Lacker   Three   President Fisher   Except for the audit fees   President Hoenig   President Stern, did you have your opportunity?  Yes   President Lacker   Don’t get them started  [Laughter] Other comments or   questions for Don?  Well, we appreciate your taking this on in your voluminous spare time  It’s        April 28–29, 2009 164 of 201  very important  Our approach, it was suggested, is to do as much as we reasonably can and then   try to draw the line at that point That’s how we‘re going to try to approach this   I just have a few announcements, and then we will be free  First, you have until   tomorrow at 500 pm to submit your revisions, if you have any, to your projections  Second,   you’ll see an SDS transmission on your BlackBerry because we are putting up links to the 2003   transcripts—a very interesting set of transcripts of the FOMC meetings—which will be released   publicly on Friday So they are confidential until Friday  Finally, I know there are ongoing   conversations about the stress test, the capital supervisory program, but we have already   scheduled a video meeting on Friday for an update and how we’re going to manage things on   Monday That doesn’t mean that’s the only opportunity if you have particular banks that you are   concerned about or you want to hear more about what is going on Please don’t hesitate to get in   touch with us, but we thought Friday would be a good time to bring everybody up to date   Okay Again, lunch will be available in about five minutes for those who can stay  The   next meeting will be on Tuesday and Wednesday, June 23 and 24, and the meeting is adjourned    Thank you   END OF MEETING      "
8750,2009-06-03,BERNANKE," We have seen in recent weeks some significant increases in   Treasury yields and mortgage rates   I am sorry  This is a joint FOMC–Board meeting  I need a   motion to close the Board meeting   Thank you Again, we have seen a significant rise in   Treasury yields and mortgage rates, and the reason for having the meeting is just to have a bit of   interaction, I hope informal, about whether any policy action is worthwhile at this stage, and   whether it is or not, if we want to talk at all about how we communicate about this issue  As   usual in an FOMC meeting, we are going to have a presentation from the Desk and an economic   outlook update from Dave Stockton  Before doing that, we have one piece of business, which is   to vote to approve the selection of Brian Sack as manager of the SOMA  Many of you know   Brian, I am sure  He was here He went off to work with Larry Meyer for a while  Now we   welcome him back to the Fed family  May I have a motion?   Without objection  All right Seeing none, the motion is   carried Let me turn now to New York for a report on the Desk  Brian started yesterday, so I   guess we will leave him a little more slack and go to Trish Mosser  Trish   Thank you very much, Trish  And thank you for many   good reports Questions for Trish?  Governor Kohn   President Fisher   Thank you  President Rosengren   President Pianalto   I just want to say, to be clear, that we have not made any   changes We are maintaining the triple-A requirement  So if we don’t make changes, that would   eliminate close to half—or something like that—of the eligible assets   Okay Thank you President Bullard   The staff will keep working on these issues, and we will see   where that goes Anyone else, questions for Trish?  Not seeing anybody, I turn now to Dave   Stockton for a brief update on the outlook   Thank you, David, for this intermeeting report  Questions   for Dave? Vice Chairman   Other questions?  President Lockhart   Other questions? Okay Let me make just a couple of   comments about the situation, and then we’ll open it up for any questions or comments that     June 3, 2009 16 of 20  participants may have  Looking at the increase in yields, it is not an entirely benign   development, obviously  There is the undercurrent of huge deficits, and on a few specific days,   like the day on which the United Kingdom got the warning, we saw a bad combination of   movements  a decline in the dollar, a rise in yields, and a fall in equity prices, which is sort of   indicative of a flight from US debt  So a couple of days like that were somewhat worrisome   Having said that, my own view—and I will want to hear views of others and from the   staff—is that most of what we have seen since the FOMC meeting is the result of more-positive   influences, notably, first, the better outlook, which has caused the term premium to increase or   the yield curve to steepen, and second, the reversal in the flight to quality  We are seeing the   dollar decline and the yields rise at the same time that equity prices go up, which suggests a more   positive interpretation of the development  It is not clear what role inflation expectations are   playing It is certainly true that, mechanically, a significant part of the increase is tied to the   increase in 5- to 10-year breakevens But whether that is really a change in inflation   expectations arising, say, from reduced fear of deflation or whether it’s just better operation and   more liquidity in the TIPS market is not entirely clear  But either one, I think, is not particularly   worrisome because the breakevens now suggest a still well-controlled rate of inflation, pretty   close to what our target would be  So I guess my overall assessment is that, although we need to   watch carefully in terms of the risks associated with flight from the dollar or flight from   Treasuries, that this is mostly a benign development  Based on that, if I were recommending at   this point, I would not recommend any change in our policy  To the extent that this increase in   yields is being driven by a better outlook that is an endogenous part of the improvement of the   economy, I think our best approach there would just be to wait and watch and see how things go           June 3, 2009 17 of 20  I would also mention, as I did in my note to the Committee earlier, that I think that June’s   meeting is going to be very informative  We have presentations in June on a wide variety of   aspects of our program, including the effects of large-scale asset purchases; as Trish mentioned,   the tactics of making purchases; the exit strategy both from individual programs and from the   balance sheet; and managing the balance sheet more broadly  So I personally would think that   we would want to wait and hear more about those issues, particularly the exit strategy, before   making any changes in our programs   On communication, my suggestion would be, to the extent that you agree that this is   primarily a benign development, that we communicate that we are comfortable, that we are   taking a wait-and-see approach, and that we will just review as necessary our policies as the data   come in  That would be the summary of my own view at this point, but if others disagree or   want to amplify, I certainly would be happy and interested to hear that  So are there any   questions or comments?  President Lacker   Thank you, President Lacker  You raise some interesting   points In testimony and other contexts, I have said a couple of times that we weren’t trying to   defend any particular interest rate, which I think is appropriate given that, as you point out,   interest rates can change for different reasons  So I think that your point is well taken  Other   questions or comments?  All right  If there is no other discussion, I appreciate the opportunity to   talk a bit about these issues  Clearly, there is a lot more that we are going to learn between now   and a couple of weeks from now, and in particular, we do have a very full program of staff   materials about various aspects of this  I hope that we are going to show some “learning by   doing” here and that, as we go forward, we will refine our tactics and our strategy; and having   this input is very helpful   I would like to just mention to you that Debbie is pointing out to me that everyone has   now agreed with the proposed schedule of 2010 FOMC meetings, and so if there are no   objections, we are going to release that schedule to the public at the end of this week  Anything   else?  Okay  Thank you very much for your time, and we will see you in Washington in a few   weeks, if not sooner Thank you   END OF MEETING      "
8761,2009-06-23,BERNANKE," Good afternoon, everybody  This is a joint meeting of the   FOMC and the Board, as has been our custom in the past, so I need a motion to close the   meeting   Thank you Let me first welcome Brian Sack officially in   his role as manager of the System Open Market Account  We look forward to a long and   productive association   I also want to mention that I know there’s a great deal of interest in the Administration’s   financial regulatory reform plan and its implications for the Federal Reserve  Tomorrow at lunch   after the meeting, I will update you on what I know about it, and then we can have some   discussion if you’d like   We have a substantial number of presentations today  The staff has made an   extraordinary effort to provide us with a great deal of background information on the balance   sheet, reserve management, exit strategy, and important related issues  If the Committee is   willing, I’d like to go straight through the first set of presentations with clarifying questions only   and then have as much Q&A as the Committee would like and then a general discussion  If   that’s all right, then let’s begin with Brian Sack to report on market developments   Thank you If there are no clarifying questions, let me go   next to Seth Carpenter to talk about the balance sheet   Thank you Let me turn now to Bill English to talk about   the effects of high reserve balances on bank balance sheets   Thank you, Bill Let me turn now to Trish Mosser on large-  scale asset purchases   Thank you At the last meeting I promised we would focus   today a good bit on our exit strategy, that is, on how we’re going to unwind the policies that we   have put in place The last two presentations concentrate on that  Let me turn first to Jim Clouse   and Spence Hilton to talk about reserve management tools   Thanks very much  And batting clean-up, Brian Madigan is   going to talk about our credit and liquidity facilities   Thank you very much, and thanks again to the staff for the   extraordinary amount of very useful work behind these presentations   We will go over specifically what resolutions will be needed to address the program   recommendations  But before we go into Q&A, I just want to ask Trish and Brian what you’re   asking for today You’re asking for a vote, I understand, on the securities lending for GSEs  The        June 23–24, 2009 27 of 261  other things that you mentioned, Trish—like the portfolio approach, tapering, hybrid ARMs—are   you just looking for input at this point, or are you looking for a decision?   Okay Good Questions for the staff?  President Fisher   If you have other questions, go ahead   The Vice Chairman has a two-hander   Governor Kohn   President Lacker, did you have a two-hander?   It did sop up the excess reserves, though  [Laughter]   President Rosengren   Vice Chairman, you had a two-hander?   Thanks Let’s stay in question mode for a while, and then   we’ll have an opportunity for free discussion President Lacker   If that happened, the low short-term rates would be   transmitted to longer-term rates, and you would see a decline in rates across the board, which   would, of course, be stimulative  But presumably the economy doesn’t respond immediately,   and we’d be able to offset that by interest rate policy   No I assume that if we came to an exit point and started   raising rates, we would no longer be buying assets              June 23–24, 2009 41 of 261  We hope we’re successful in this regard  President Hoenig   has a two-hander   President Lacker, were you finished?   Governor Kohn   Well, the dividends are one buffer  Beyond the dividends,   presumably, and the capital, then you would be at the mercy, I would imagine   This is not going to happen in the intermeeting period    Vice Chairman   President Evans, do you have a two-hander on this?   I think it’s a consideration  First of all, you wouldn’t want   to be selling huge amounts  Second, you probably could mix different assets of different   vintages and do things of that sort But I think it is a consideration that we should pay attention   to   Most of them—like reverse repurchases, things that don’t   involve actually selling the assets, but rather involve financing them in different ways—don’t   have the capital loss component   Well, that’s the point  If it gets to 8 percent, then we’re in a   loss position   Governor Kohn, were you finished?   Okay  President Stern   Maybe I could intervene  There would be a press release   Thursday, which we’ve been working on, and we can show you a draft  Here are the proposed   final sentences of the introduction “The Board and the FOMC will continue to monitor closely   the condition of financial markets and the need for and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s   special liquidity facilities and arrangements  Should the recent improvements in market   conditions continue, the Board and the FOMC currently anticipate that a number of these   facilities may not need to be extended beyond February 1  However, if financial stresses do not   moderate as expected, the Board and the FOMC are prepared to extend the terms of some or all                    June 23–24, 2009 51 of 261  of the facilities as needed to promote financial stability and economic growth  The public will   receive timely notice of planned extensions, discontinuations, or modifications of Federal   Reserve programs”  That’s the kind of language that we were trying to communicate—not too   definitive, but clearly raising the possibility there won’t be any further renewals   President Hoenig   President Plosser   This is about making sure that you can deliver a specific   issue It doesn’t affect reserves or the stance of monetary policy, I don’t think   President Plosser, I think there are two mechanisms that   prevent this thing that you’re worried about from happening overnight   The first one is that, assuming that we have the power to   raise interest rates, which is what this whole discussion is about, then rates on longer-term   securities will reflect the expected path of future policy rates and, therefore, will not go to zero         June 23–24, 2009 58 of 261  So to the extent that there’s an expectation over the next three years the Fed will be raising rates   at a reasonable pace, that will limit the amount that the supply price of credit can fall  That’s the   first point And then, the second point is, of course, that, although financial markets move   quickly, all of our models tell us that the economy itself moves somewhat more slowly  With a   large output gap, it’s going to take some time certainly for the economy to reach its full potential    And I understand all of the issues with the output gap, and so on, but I don’t want to leave the   impression that this is something that’s going to require a turnaround within a matter of weeks  I   just don’t think that’s a real concern  President Evans   Okay  President Bullard   They wouldn’t affect the size of the balance sheet  They’re   just alternative ways of financing, which is what we are talking about   President Plosser   President Lockhart           June 23–24, 2009 64 of 261  I can build on that  Could you imagine language like,   “…will respond to market conditions, spreads, and the pace of issuance,” or something like that?    Would you recommend something like that?  Would you propose something like that?  If so, you   need to think about that Is that what you had in mind, President Lockhart?   I think many of us on the Committee would be looking to   you to tell us if you think there’s a strategy that, for a given amount of purchases, would achieve   better results, and, if so, what that is and how you would recommend communicating about it  I   think we have to rely on your market knowledge to do that  So if you do believe that’s the case,   perhaps for the next meeting or before then, you could present us with some alternatives  But if   you think where we are now is fine, that’s good, too  But let’s not fail to take advantage of some   improved operating process, if it gives us better results   Thank you Vice Chairman   But if we’re departing from what we’ve been doing, we   want the Committee to—   President Lacker, did you have a comment?   That’s fair enough, but there may even be technical issues,   like not wanting to be the only buyer, and things of that sort, that we would want to   communicate Other questions?  President Lockhart   As I mentioned, I would like to defer that to lunch   tomorrow, but I will present all of these issues and tell you about the report and the other aspects   that we’ll start undertaking, and then cover it at that time  Other questions?  Governor Tarullo   President Lacker   I think it’s mixed—there are extensions going on as well as   some trimming back           June 23–24, 2009 70 of 261  I’m not sure I want to litigate this here, although I’d be   happy to have discussions with people It’s very conditional  If I could once more read just part   of it “Should the recent improvements in market conditions continue, the Board and the FOMC   currently anticipate that a number of these facilities may not need to be extended beyond   February 1 However, if financial stresses do not moderate as expected, the Board and the   FOMC are prepared to extend…” and so on President Hoenig   Certainly That’s part of the policy strategy   In just a minute we can take a coffee break, if that is okay   When we come back, we will have a bit more discussion among the group on the issues that   were raised by the presentations Let me just try to identify three topics that we might want to   talk about   The first one is Brian’s recommendations on trimming back the various facilities or   extending facilities We’ll have to take some Board and FOMC votes on that  You have Brian’s   handout that shows the recommendations of the staff  So if anyone has thoughts on any of those,   that would be the first issue that I would suggest           June 23–24, 2009 71 of 261  The second is the set of issues related to exiting from our expanded balance sheet and   raising interest rates  Let me just say that many people have called for us to communicate more   about this, and I think that’s very important  The current plan is for the Monetary Policy Report,   which will be issued in a few weeks, to have a section which will describe, in some more detail   than we’ve given so far, the tools we’d be looking at to achieve the exit  We don’t want to put in   things that are very speculative  But to the extent that the Committee is comfortable with things   like reverse repos, and so on, we’d want to describe those in that section  So any thoughts or   comments about the relative value of different methods or concerns would be useful   And then, the third topic would be just the things that Trish and Brian were raising and   that President Hoenig alluded to, which is thinking about the asset purchase strategy  Even if we   don’t change our position at this meeting, do we want to begin thinking about a tapering   strategy?  Do we want to advise the Desk to change its reaction function?  So we can discuss   things related to that set of issues   Of course, whatever else you want to bring up is fine, but I thought those three areas   might be worth comments in the free discussion period   Before we do that, why don’t we refresh ourselves with about a fifteen-minute coffee   break?  Thank you   [Coffee break]   The floor is now open for people who’d like to make   comments on the three topics I mentioned before the break or anything else that the presentations   brought to mind  I want everyone to have a chance to speak, but I do hope we can get to the   economic presentation today  If we can do this in 45 minutes or so, that would be very helpful    Would anyone like to start off?  Governor Warsh              June 23–24, 2009 72 of 261  Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Fisher   If we got rid of it, it would be a relief for Bill Nelson, I’m   sure [Laughter] Governor Tarullo   Well, I’ll leave it to people to do what they want  I think   the issues that we were discussing were the exit tools, the tactics for the Desk in dealing with   large-scale asset purchases, and the winding down of the programs  Those were the things that I   asked people to talk about, so perhaps we could focus on those  President Yellen   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thanks Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor Duke   President Rosengren   Thanks President Bullard           June 23–24, 2009 93 of 261  Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you President Lacker   Thank you  President Lockhart   I thank you Just very quickly, let me summarize a few   things I think there was a lot of support for Brian’s recommendations  The only issue I heard   was some discussion about raising the bid rate on the TAF  You can raise the rate by cutting the   quantity or by raising the rate I think the optics are a little bit risky to be raising the rate  I   would be inclined to go with the recommendation that the staff has put forward   On the exit strategy, I guess I disagree with President Lacker  I think it’s important for us   to have these other tools to diversify our ability to sterilize reserves  A number of things are very   interesting—reverse repos, collateralized lending, term deposits  And we didn’t talk about   redemptions, but redemptions actually are part of this, too  That’s going to be significant over   the next couple of years I think most people agree that it would be very valuable to have as               June 23–24, 2009 99 of 261  detailed as possible a discussion of the exit strategy in the Monetary Policy Report  And I think   there was good support for that, and we should proceed with that   Finally, on the Desk and flexibility, there didn’t seem to be much interest in giving you a   great deal of flexibility  [Laughter]  But I want to make a couple of points  One is, clearly, we   don’t want purchases to be counterproductive, so if you are overwhelming the market, or   something like that, you should either adjust or let the Committee know about it  I think there   was also a good bit of interest in your promoting liquidity and, in that respect, considering   off-the-run securities, things of that sort But I personally also would support lending securities    I think that just adds to the liquidity in the market  We’ll talk more tomorrow about asset   purchases as a strategy, and so on   Let me just say to President Plosser and President Lacker, that we should close the GSE   lending authority It turned out to be an inconvenient moment, but we will do that as soon as we   can find an appropriate time  Anything else?   Let that be noted This is the latest we’ve ever ratified the   open market operations, I’m sure, in the history of the Federal Reserve  If there are no other   comments, we need to take a few votes First, by the FOMC to ratify domestic open market   operations   Any objections? [No response]  Thank you Next, by the   FOMC to modify the authorization to allow the lending of agency debt  Are there those who        June 23–24, 2009 100 of 261  would like to be recorded in opposition to that?  No?  Without objection  Thank you The   remaining votes are on the program extensions or modifications     Noted Thank you We need a motion to extend the swap   agreements   Is there anyone who objects?  [No response] Okay The   FOMC needs to extend the TSLF until February 1, understanding that the schedule 1 auctions   will be suspended and the schedule 2 auctions reduced in size and that the options program will   be suspended along the lines that Brian mentioned   Any objection, concerns?  Seeing none, okay For the   Board, we are asked to extend the AMLF, the commercial paper funding facility, the primary   dealer credit facility, and the TSLF  This includes the additional restrictions on the AMLF,   which Boston will take care of, the reduced offerings under the TSLF, and the tightening of   collateral conditions for the primary dealer credit facility  And we will not extend the MMIFF,   the money market facility  Brian?                                                             6 The materials used by Messrs Kiley and Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)                       June 23–24, 2009 101 of 261  Okay That will be clear in the statement tomorrow?  Yes,   okay   Any objection from the Board?  Seeing none Finally, from   the Board, the resolution to scale back the TAF according to the schedule that Brian suggested    Seeing no objection Thank you very much  Again, we’ll provide you with a press release as   soon as possible, and it will go out on Thursday, at noon, I believe   Let us go on now to the staff presentation on the economy  Michael Kiley and Nathan   Sheets will make the presentation  Whenever you are ready   Thank you Thank you for the presentation  Questions for   our colleagues?  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lockhart   President Evans   FOMC are not sheep  [Laughter] President Plosser   President Lacker   Other questions? [No response]  All right Thank you for a   very productive discussion Dinner tonight is purely social at the British Embassy at 730  We’ll   begin tomorrow at 900 am with the go-round   [Meeting recessed]                                                               8 The materials used by Mr Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 8)   June 23–24, 2009 117 of 261  June 24, 2009—Morning Session   Good morning, everybody  I think we have a report on   some data from Dave Stockton   Thank you We’ll begin our economic go-round with   President Plosser            June 23–24, 2009 118 of 261  Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you  President Rosengren   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you President Lacker   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you President Fisher   Is this the Warren Beatty who starred in Reds?  [Laughter]   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you This is a good time for a coffee break of about   20 minutes   [Coffee break]        June 23–24, 2009 160 of 261  Okay, let’s recommence  I have a summary, which I will   read to you Most participants saw a slowing contraction and tentative signs of stabilization in   economic activity  Business and household confidence has improved some, and surveys show   improved expectations for the future  Inventory liquidation continues, which is a positive for   growth later this year, and financial markets have continued to improve  Despite this relatively   good news, though, most saw the economy as still quite weak and fragile and vulnerable to new   shocks Labor markets are extremely soft, and financial markets may be ahead of themselves    While output should begin to grow again, the pace is likely to be quite slow and tentative    Although downside risks have been mitigated somewhat, they still exist  Likewise, recovery   abroad seems likely to be uneven and gradual, with Europe still facing financial problems and   East Asia still too reliant on exports   Consumer spending, though no longer declining, is not robust either, reflecting the weak   labor market, sharp wealth reductions, and higher oil prices  Real income growth is likely to   slow for the remainder of the year  Consumers continue to focus on necessities and appear   liquidity constrained Housing has shown a few signs of life but is vulnerable to the effects of   the rising mortgage rates and continuing high rates of foreclosure  Capital investment remains   very soft, reflecting unused capacity and uncertainty about the economy and about the policy   environment  Across industries, weakness is widespread and includes service industries,   although some areas, such as energy and agriculture, are doing better     Labor markets remain a particular area of concern  Despite some improvement in new   and continuing UI claims, and a less bad payroll report for May, the unemployment rate and the   rate of job loss remained high, with little near-term prospect for improvement  Workweeks are   shorter Total hours of work have fallen significantly  More layoffs are permanent, and the           June 23–24, 2009 161 of 261  amount of involuntary part-time work is high  I should add that participation rates have risen   also because of wealth effects Slow wage growth is reflecting this weakness  The NAIRU may   have risen somewhat, but a significant unemployment gap still probably exists   Financial markets continue to show improvement  The banking stress tests were   perceived to be successful and resulted in capital raises and improved funding conditions  Loan   volumes are not falling especially dramatically, but in part this reflects government support,   which may be withdrawn  Reduced lending and tighter terms also reflect worsening credit   quality, and banks still face substantial credit losses in coming quarters  Other credit markets   also continue to improve, including the corporate market and the ABS market  The financing of   commercial real estate remains problematic, however, and fundamentals for the sector are   weakening Improvements in financial markets support the stabilization of the broader economy   but could prove fleeting if the projected strengthening in growth and profits does not materialize   Higher oil and commodity prices will raise headline inflation in the near term, while core   inflation seems likely to be low  As noted, wages continue to remain nearly flat, and   productivity has been surprisingly high, so that the growth in unit labor costs is moderate    Overall, inflation seems likely to be well controlled in the near term, and most see deflation risks   as now relatively small  Some were concerned about inflation expectations in the medium term    As measured by TIPS breakevens and by most household and business surveys, inflation   expectations seem to be stable at reasonable levels  However, publicity about fiscal deficits and   the Fed’s balance sheet has concerned many in the public and may be reflected in inflation risk   premiums and longer-term interest rates  Communication about the exit strategy and the Fed’s   commitment to price stability is an important tool for managing expectations  At the same time,              June 23–24, 2009 162 of 261  some suggest that it is important not to signal that the unwinding of the Fed’s extraordinary   measures is imminent     That’s my summary of what I heard, which I do think was a fairly consistent message   around the table today   Let me just add a few thoughts, which will not be particularly novel, given all that has   been said First, I think one can’t help but be at least somewhat encouraged by the developments   in financial markets since our last meeting  The Federal Reserve staff and leadership, I think,   deserve some credit for the assessment of the banking system, and the results that that had  It’s   very encouraging that banks can raise equity and that their funding has improved—CDS spreads   have declined I think that, although systemic risk is still around, it is much less now than it was   a few months ago, and the reduced probability of a major calamity in the financial system is, in   itself, I think, a positive  We’ve also seen improvements, as I mentioned, in other credit markets   as well, partly because of government support, including Fed programs   Obviously, an important development in the financial markets in the intermeeting period   was the increase in long-term interest rates  Yesterday when the staff showed the changes in   government rates across a number of industrial countries, I thought it was interesting that the   increase in the UK rate was about the same as the increase in the German rate, both of which   were much less than the US rate  Since the UK is viewed as having many of the same   problems in terms of fiscal sustainability and the balance sheet that we have, the fact that those   rates had risen no more than rates in Germany suggests to me that a lot of what’s happening in   the US is the result of a stronger outlook and a reversal of the flight-to-quality flows, which in   itself is, I think, encouraging        June 23–24, 2009 163 of 261  So, again, I think one of the better developments of the intermeeting period is the broad-  based improvement in financial markets  Having said that, as someone already mentioned,   we’ve been head-faked on this before I recall October 2007 when our statement essentially   declared the financial crisis to be over, and again, in the summer of 2008 when we were   expecting growth and recovery, and then we got hit with calamities in September and October    So I do think we need to be very cautious and recognize that the financial improvements are, in   some sense, discounting progress that is expected in the future  And until we see concrete   evidence of that progress, we shouldn’t overreact to the financial improvements   As many people have noted, the explicit evidence even for stabilization, much less for   recovery, is not really at hand yet For example, consumption growth in the second quarter is   still likely to have been negative, and there are a number of drags that continue to be an issue   there In the labor markets, many have noted very severe conditions  Although UI claims have   come down a bit, they’re still at extraordinarily high levels, and we would expect to see   continuing job losses for some time  In housing, mortgage rates and foreclosures are going to be   a drag on the very tentative improvement    I think my message is that we should be encouraged by the financial improvements but   note that they are very contingent  They depend on the realization of actual improvement in the   economy  We have seen some stabilization, but the evidence of solid stabilization or the   beginnings of growth is certainly not here yet, and we should not overestimate that evidence  It’s   also important to keep in mind that, although we’re accustomed to thinking about the stages of   the cycle and to think about growth rates, the amplitude of the shock was extraordinarily large    So we are very far away by any measure, I think, from normalcy  Even if the economy does   begin to grow at a slow pace, we’ll be very far from full employment for some time, which has        June 23–24, 2009 164 of 261  implications  The longer you’re away from full employment, the worse credit losses will be, the   worse hysteresis will be in the labor market, the worse income effects will be on consumers, and   so on So the size of the decline also will have effects that could lead to a longer persistence as   well So, again, I think we should be somewhat cautious about declaring victory   Inflation—I heard both sides of this argument  I guess the standard view would be that   core inflation, at least, is likely to continue to moderate  There were a number of special factors   besides the tobacco taxes  There were some unusual aspects of the change in model year for   automobiles, which probably raised inflation in the last few months  So I would expect that to be   relatively soft It’s consistent with very slow growth in nominal wages  Also, there’s   productivity growth, which keeps unit labor costs under control   Inflation expectations are a somewhat different matter, as others have mentioned  What   has happened so far—namely, that inflation has come back up to more normal levels—I take as a   success, not a problem  Deflation risks were a concern  Within reason, an increase in inflation   expectations reduces real interest rates and reduces debt burdens and is actually positive  Of   course, as many people have noted, we don’t want too much of a good thing—we don’t want to   go further Higher inflation rates, besides being a problem for price stability, probably have   negative effects on growth as well  For example, higher nominal mortgage rates tend to raise   nominal payments, which could have effects on the demand for housing  So I agree with   President Plosser and others that we do have to pay very close attention to inflation expectations   and that our communication will be very important  In that respect, I think that the careful   description of our exit strategy in the Monetary Policy Report and the Humphrey-Hawkins will   be important  And all of us should continue to emphasize our ability to withdraw the stimulus                                                                   9 The corrected materials for Mr Carpenter’s briefing are appended to this transcript (appendix 9)  10 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 10)                         June 23–24, 2009 165 of 261  and to maintain our focus on price stability  Let me stop there and ask Brian to turn to the policy   round   Thank you, Brian Are there questions for Brian?  Not   seeing any questions, let’s start with President Plosser     Thank you President Lacker   Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Evans   President Rosengren   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you  President Bullard   President Bullard, we already moved it from the top of the   statement all the way down to paragraph 3  [Laughter]  I thought that was a fair compromise, by   the way President Pianalto   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you President Fisher   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you President Lacker, you had a comment?   Vice Chairman   Thank you, everybody I think that most of us are agreed   that, given the improvement in the economy, there’s not much need to change our policy stance   today, so we should keep our programs in place on the schedule that we have already announced   That would bring us to alternative B, which I think is the right choice  Most of you were   in favor of striking the last sentence I think that’s the right decision  I’m reminded of an   experience I had when I first took this job, when we were still raising interest rates  Remember   that?  I told a congressional committee that the time would come, eventually, when we would   have to stop raising interest rates  Of course, the expectation of an immediate rate change went   right through the market, and I was completely flabbergasted by the inability of the markets to   understand plain English  [Laughter] But, unfortunately, that’s reality  So I think there would   be a risk of suggesting that we were preparing to exit  In this case, we are taking very substantial   steps to address this particular issue, not just in testimony  Our current plan is to have a   significant description of exit strategy, tools, and so on, in the Monetary Policy Report, which   would obviously be available to everyone in more detail than I could give in a short testimony    So I would recommend dropping the last sentence        June 23–24, 2009 199 of 261  We had some original language on tapering, and I think the problem that we were having   with it was there’s no way to describe our plans to taper without essentially determining at this   point that we are almost certainly going to stop  We may well do that, but I think if we can   maintain that optionality for one more meeting it would probably be a good idea  I think we   could stop the Treasury program flat, or we could say we are doing $30 billion a month the rest   of the year, or whatever, but I don’t think that we need to take that decision yet   Two related things President Yellen, supported by President Rosengren, brought up the   mortgage rate issue, and I think she had two objectives  One was to point to an important factor;   the other was to kind of tone down the cheeriness of the first paragraph  I have a specific   concern with the mortgage rate sentence—if we say that mortgage rates are a big problem, that’s   going to signal something about our asset purchase program, I’m afraid, so that’s a concern that I   would have But I do understand the issue about general tone  Let me just raise this for   consideration The second sentence in alternative B, “Conditions in financial markets have   generally improved in recent months, and indicators of consumer and business sentiment have   risen,” is obviously a very positive sentence and one that has no parallel in the April statement    We could, if people like, either strike the sentence entirely, or, perhaps to recognize that there   has been general improvement in financial markets, strike the second part about consumer and   business sentiment, which would change the tone a bit  I don’t know if that would satisfy the   need Governor Tarullo mentioned this as well  Is there any response to that thought?   Striking the whole sentence, is everyone okay with that?   No?   All right So what I’m hearing is drop the second half, is   that okay? President Yellen, does that sound okay?   All right Brian will end the sentence after “in recent   months” and strike the part about sentiment  I think that is all that was on the table  As noted, it   is somewhat more upbeat  It does drop the concern about deflation, although it does say   “subdued for some time,” which is a strengthening of what we said last time  And, of course, it   does refer appropriately to the adjustments—the credit and liquidity programs—which will be   followed up on Thursday Any other comments?  If not, Debbie, would you take the roll?   Thank you very much  The next meeting is Tuesday and   Wednesday, August 11 and 12 Let me remind you that you have until 500 pm tomorrow to   submit any revisions to your projections based on data that you had available at the meeting   At this point, I will formally adjourn the meeting  Lunch is available, if you’d like to   come  Those of you who have to leave, by all means do so  But those of you who are able to   stay, I would be happy to talk a bit about the regulatory reform plan and its implications for the   Fed, and then we can have some discussion of that informally  Thank you   END OF MEETING      "
8790,2009-08-11,BERNANKE," Good afternoon, everybody  Today is the last meeting for   our colleague Gary Stern Gary first attended the FOMC meeting as a staffer in 1982 and then   was appointed President in March 1985 To provide some cultural context, in 1982 the top   grossing movie was “An Officer and a Gentleman,” followed closely by “Tootsie”  [Laughter]    The leading hit song was “Physical” by Olivia Newton-John  [Laughter] We are in a different   world, I think Gary, you have attended 218 regular FOMC meetings, so you are the most senior   member of this Committee by a small margin of six years  That is a remarkable record, and you   have provided a great deal of collegiality, insight, and wisdom over that period, and we want to   thank you for that But we will thank you in more substantial way at the September meeting  So   thank you [Applause]   As has been our custom, this is a joint Board–FOMC meeting  So I need a motion to   close the meeting    Thank you We’ll begin with staff presentations—first,   with open market operations by Brian Sack, followed by Q&A, and then some additional   presentations Brian   Thank you, Brian Questions for Brian?  President Bullard   President Fisher   One approach to addressing some of these issues would be   to take only 5/1s or longer initial periods  Then, you stay away from the 2/28s and 3/27s, and   you don’t have the issue that you have an incentive not to raise rates because that will not have   any effect on a five-year fixed rate  President Stern   Oh, sorry President Rosengren   President Stern   President Evans   President Plosser   Vice Chairman   Okay We are in the Q&A session for Brian  [Laughter]   We will have a chance to discuss these issues further, of course  President Lacker, did you want   to ask a question?   Okay President Yellen, a two-hander?   Yes   Let the record show that President Lacker’s reference to   ARMs dealers had to do with mortgages and not with other things  [Laughter] A short   intervention, President Plosser?   You can’t buy jumbos  They are not GSE guaranteed            August 11–12, 2009 25 of 165  No, no, no, no [Laughter]   President Hoenig   Just to be clear, we will survey everybody’s views either in   the go-round or, if you don’t express a view in the go-round, we will check with you after the   meeting  So everyone’s thoughts will be heard   Other questions for Brian?  President Lacker   This is how quantitative easing works  You induce banks   to substitute away from reserves, but they have to hold the reserves in the end   So the yields change, assuming that we would be more   accommodative  And that is exactly what we are trying to do                 August 11–12, 2009 28 of 165  Right   Well, these asset-purchase plans are not set in stone  We   began them in March at a time of very weak conditions  We have reviewed them at each   meeting  And if we decide there is too much stimulus in the economy, given our projections,   then we can reduce them So they are a choice variable at each meeting  But you have just   described exactly the way the quantitative easing part of this is supposed to work   I don’t see any reason why it would be discontinuous  I   think it is continuous   You have raised a good point, President Lacker, about the   substitutability between these two forms of stimulus, and I think we ought to continue to think   about that If there are no objections, I would like to go on to the next portion  We have some   staff presentations on reserve management, which bears exactly on some of these issues, and   then a presentation on the TALF  So let me turn first to Chris Burke  We will hear four   presentations, and then we will have Q&A for all four  Chris   Thank you very much  Just to summarize briefly—first, on   our exit strategy, we have a belt-and-suspenders approach, a two-pronged approach  One part is   the interest rate on reserves, and the other is management of reserve balances  What we heard   today was, I think, considerable progress on a variety of mechanisms that would allow us to   manage reserve balances to help us exit from our accommodative policies going forward  On the   TALF, to reiterate what Bill said, the sense of the Board—and we are interested in FOMC   input—was that we would suspend any further expansion to other asset classes  We looked at   CLOs, RMBS, and CDOs Is that the right list?   Yes So just for clarity, we would announce later this week   that we are suspending consideration of additional asset classes—not saying so, or perhaps even   saying so—but obviously, if conditions change radically, we could revisit that  But for now we   will suspend that  In the same press release we would announce the extension of the TALF to   March 31 and for new CMBS only to June, because that particular category requires a much   longer lead time to put together deals  So that is what is on the table as far as the Board’s   discussion is concerned  Now, let me turn first to Q&A for the staff, and then we will have an   opportunity for further discussion as well  Are there any questions for the staff?  Vice Chairman   Governor Kohn   Governor Warsh   Given these idiosyncrasies in the federal funds market, even   though we might be operating in the overnight market, we may have to consider alternative ways   of expressing our policy target  That should be something we should keep on the table    President Rosengren   Vice Chair   President Plosser   Buying and selling we know how to do  [Laughter]   Yes   President Evans   President Fisher   Okay Thanks President Lacker   A vertical supply curve   Vice Chairman   Once again, there is a lot of benefit to trying to figure out   what is the right target and what is the most meaningful target for policy  Are there more   questions or comments on this range of issues that anyone would like to bring up?  We will of   course have two more go-rounds  If not, we have a vote to ratify domestic open market   operations   Without objection Okay Why don’t we take a coffee   break?  We have coffee available  Return at 415  Thank you   [Coffee break]   Okay Why don’t we recommence and turn to the   economic situation  Presentation is by Larry Slifman and Nathan Sheets  Larry                 August 11–12, 2009 50 of 165  Thank you Are there questions for our colleagues?    President Lockhart    President Stern   President Bullard        August 11–12, 2009 57 of 165  President Fisher   I agree with the idea that they are looking to Europe and the   United States  But in the latest strategic and economic dialogue that we had with the Chinese—   Governor Warsh was there as well—I heard much more seriousness about a longer-term   transition to a more domestically driven economy  What time frame that has and how that bears   on the current situation is a different question, and I heard much more talk about that and a much   more detailed discussion of that   Other questions?  Seeing none, we are ready for our   economic go-round  President Evans   Thank you President Fisher   Thank you, President Fisher  Governor Tarullo           August 11–12, 2009 66 of 165  President Rosengren   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you President Yellen   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you President Hoenig   Okay We made a great deal of progress on our agenda,   and I understand that there is a 600 pm reception for the Conference of Presidents  So if   everyone is agreeable, why don’t we adjourn and begin tomorrow at 900 am  Thank you very   much   [Meeting recessed]     August 11–12, 2009 88 of 165  August 12, 2009—Morning Session   Good morning, everybody  Overnight, Brian Madigan   polled the members about the issue of adding ARMs to the MBS program, and we did not find a   consensus in either direction We are pretty evenly divided  So what I propose that we do is to   hold this in abeyance until such future date as we decide to make significant changes in the MBS   program one way or the other  At that point, if we were to expand it, for example, we might   want to reconsider But if we are winding it down, there would not be much point  So we won’t   take any further action on this until such time as we reconsider the MBS program  Let’s   continue with our economic go-round  President Pianalto, you are first up    Thank you President Lacker   Thank you Vice Chairman     August 11–12, 2009 95 of 165  Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you  Governor Duke                 August 11–12, 2009 105 of 165  Thank you, and thank you all  Let me try to summarize the   discussion I heard around the table, and then I’ll add a few comments  There was a substantial   consensus that the economy is stabilizing, albeit at a low level, and that the technical recession is   ending Conditions are quite heterogeneous, but that in itself was viewed by some as characteristic   of a turning point  Participants agree that output is likely to grow over the remainder of this year,   and the downside economic and financial risks may be moderating somewhat  Most expect the   recovery to continue into 2010, but there were divergent views about the strength of that recovery    Uncertainties include the strength of the consumer rebound, the extent to which credit conditions are                        August 11–12, 2009 109 of 165  normalized, and the rate of growth of economic potential  Fiscal stimulus should help to support   growth, but state and local governments remain severely constrained  Slack in resource utilization   may cap inflation in the near term, but there is a risk of an increase in inflation expectations   associated with aggressive monetary and fiscal initiatives   Now, turning to a bit of detail, consumer spending growth remains weak and discretionary   purchases are limited; nevertheless, most saw signs of stabilization in this sector  Households still   face considerable headwinds, including slow growth in labor income, uncertainty about jobs and job   security, declines in asset prices, excessive leverage, and tight credit  An important issue is whether   households’ propensity to save will be permanently altered by the recent experience  Real income   growth is likely to remain weak for the remainder of the year as stimulus payments decline and as   labor markets remain slack  Retail sales are weak, outside of autos where sales have responded to   the cash-for-clunkers program and perhaps greater stability in the industry Households are facing   much tougher terms on credit cards, home equity lines, mortgages, and other forms of credit, but   stimulus payments may have helped reduce financial stress for some consumers   Home sales, residential construction, and prices have shown signs of stability or even   improvement in some areas, especially at the low end  The more-serious concerns now seem to be   in the nonresidential sector, where deteriorating fundamentals, falling prices, and lack of refinancing   capacity are weighing down the sector  Commercial real estate defaults are a significant threat to   banks, especially small and medium-sized banks  Firms are seeing better-than-expected profits,   mostly from rigorous cost-cutting, but revenues remain weak  Inventories are under better control,   especially in the auto sector, although there is more to do  Firms are generally setting a high bar for   expansion either through capital investment or hiring as managers see a good deal of excess   capacity in the system  Uncertainty about government policy may also be slowing expansion plans                        August 11–12, 2009 110 of 165  However, some surveys show some optimism among manufacturers, particularly for the medium   term Manufacturers are benefiting to an extent from a better-than-expected global economy and   export demand and perhaps a weaker dollar  In the service sector, tourism and retail, transportation,   and other sectors are weak, but some areas such as health care continue to grow  Small businesses   may suffer disproportionately from the credit environment   In the labor market, employment data continue to be weak, but there is evidence that   payrolls are stabilizing or at least falling more slowly  Staffing is now quite lean, and productivity   has risen  Long-term unemployment and permanent separations remain high, suggesting possible   problems of skill loss and a need for labor reallocation that could slow recovery in aggregate output    There was considerable discussion that reallocation is linked to the NAIRU  Wage and benefits   growth continues to decelerate, reflecting poor labor market conditions   The cumulative improvement in financial markets since the spring is quite significant  The   stock market is up broadly  Private credit spreads continue to come in  Money markets are   performing better, and risk-taking has increased  Market participants see the risk of catastrophic   outcomes as much reduced  However, financial concerns remain  In particular, banks face   significant credit losses yet to come, and as I mentioned, small and medium banks are particularly   vulnerable to losses in commercial real estate  Bank lending has fallen dramatically  Loan officers   report tight terms  Deleveraging is still under way, and securitization markets for their part are not   yet taking up the slack   Inflation has been moderate and generally stable recently  As measured by TIPS   breakevens, inflation expectations have risen, especially at the medium-term horizon, though they   still may be characterized as anchored  On the other hand, utilization gaps remain large, and wage   growth has slowed markedly  Overall the risks to inflation seem balanced, with output gaps                                  August 11–12, 2009 111 of 165  exercising a deflationary influence and public concerns about the Fed’s balance sheet, the federal   deficit, and monetary and fiscal exit strategies tending to raise inflation expectations    Communication about the Fed’s ability and willingness to withdraw accommodation at the   appropriate time remains important  Any comments?   Let me add just a few words to that  Again, Governor Tarullo mentioned that coming last   has some difficulties  I agree, of course, with most of you that the intermeeting news has been quite   encouraging  On the real side, there had not really been much of a markup in the expected path of   growth, but we have seen now firm evidence of stabilization, and I think we can agree that the   downside risks to the real economy are moderating   In the financial markets, we have been head-faked before  We need to be careful   Nevertheless, improvements are substantial and do feel more durable  I think there may be some   evidence, in fact, that we are getting into a more beneficial feedback loop, the opposite of the   adverse feedback loop that we saw last fall as an improving economy raises stock prices, reduces   credit spreads, and improves confidence in the banking system, which in turn helps the economy   I think we will be seeing some growth for the rest of the year  In fact, I would venture to   guess that there may be some upside risk to the Greenbook forecast for H2 growth  There are a   number of forces that I think have baked-in growth for the next couple of quarters  Let me just give   a short list  First, obviously, is inventory dynamics, notably in autos, which is being helped by the   cash-for-clunkers program, but in other sectors as well  Inventories don’t have to increase to   improve economic growth; they just have to fall more slowly  Second, we have seen a rise in new   orders in manufacturing and significant increases in global industrial production, which suggest   some strength in the manufacturing sector  Third, there is a good bit of evidence of bottoming-out   of residential construction, which will remove a significant drag  Fourth, fiscal support  Fifth, the                              August 11–12, 2009 112 of 165  better-than-expected economic growth abroad, which both is directly supportive and suggests that   some of the forces at work may be reversing more quickly than expected  Then, sixth, we shouldn’t   forget about the normal cyclical patterns, which include a rebound in demand—pent-up demand, for   durable goods, for housing and other investment goods, and for other things that have been below   normal in the last year   So, again, I think the next half year will be reasonably good with positive growth  Of   course, the $64 billion or trillion question is what happens in 2010 going forward  I guess, as we   have discussed around the table, the two key questions will be, first, once the inventory cycle has   worked through, is final demand growth going to be sufficient to sustain a near-term recovery; and,   second, as evidenced by some of the discussion of the NAIRU, what is really happening to   potential, and what constraints will that put on growth?   The consumption path is very difficult to forecast  We are projecting recovery, and we   should just keep in mind that so far we really haven’t seen really strong evidence even on   stabilization at this point  Consumption and disposable income were revised down quite a bit in the   NIPA revisions Consumer confidence ticked down in the latest readings and is still very low in   absolute levels, and we have talked about all of the various constraints and drags on consumer   spending And so there certainly is some risk still in that sector  The question, again, is, Will   consumption begin to strengthen next year?  The Greenbook projects both real final demand and   real consumption growing at a rate of about 26 percent in 2010  The standard errors for this are   very wide, as I will discuss further, but I actually think this is a pretty reasonable guess  First of all,   we have to keep in mind always that what matters for growth is the rate of change and not the level   So even if consumption is weak relative to some benchmarks, so long as there is improvement   coming from higher asset prices, some improvement in labor markets, greater confidence, and                                      August 11–12, 2009 113 of 165  improving financial conditions, that would support growth in consumption even if the level in some   sense is low  So that is important   A deeper, almost philosophical question is, What is going to happen to saving rates?  The   Greenbook has households sticking with the household saving rate of about 4 percent that we have   seen recently, and that is what the staff projects into the 2010 period  In this respect, the Greenbook   saving rate projection is lower than that of many outside forecasters  I think the reason that some   people think the saving rate is likely to go up comes from staring at a picture that shows the   household saving rate over the last 20 years, which shows a steady decline from 8 or 9 percent to   close to zero to where we are today, about 4 percent  I am actually, again, inclined to side with the   staff on this  I think that the household saving rate is a pretty flawed measure of consumer behavior   for a number of reasons  One reason has to do with the artificial distinction between household   saving and private saving—private saving including the saving of businesses  To the extent that   households can either see stock prices going up or know what the value of their small business is,   they ought to integrate very largely their saving behavior with the business sector  When I was in   graduate school, I learned about Denison’s law from 1958, which said that private saving is more   stable than its components, sort of a preliminary to Ricardian equivalence in a way, and there is   some good evidence for that  If you look at the private saving rate, it has been much more stable   than household saving  Another indicator that I think is useful, and we discussed in the Board   meeting on Monday, is the wealth-to-income ratio, which theory says would be a determinant of   saving behavior  What is important to understand is that wealth-to-income ratio behavior was   abnormal in the late ’90s and the early part of this decade, when you had first a surge in stock prices   and then a surge in house prices, and in neither case was consumption able in some sense to keep up   with those increases in wealth  The longer-term wealth-to-income ratio is about 475 rather than the                               August 11–12, 2009 114 of 165  55 to 60 that we have seen recently, and it happens to be exactly where we are today  So there is   less of a sense that we need to have substantial wealth building when you look at those data than   when you look at the household saving rate  Finally, just in terms of looking at the data, despite all   the uncertainties and the drags on consumer spending, we really haven’t seen saving go above   4 percent thus far  The temporary increase in the second quarter was due largely to the transfer   payments   So just to reiterate, I think the Greenbook forecast for saving and final demand in 2010 is   reasonable That said, as I said initially, the standard errors around this are large  I think we can be   confident that, at some point, consumption will begin to grow again—we don’t have to worry about   secular stagnation—but the exact timing of the consumer recovery and the speed at which it occurs   will obviously make a big difference for medium-term cyclical dynamics  In particular, the   Greenbook simulation shows a case in which the saving rate rises sharply  That causes the   economy to be very weak in 2010 and then just to begin to grow again in 2011  Another possibility   is that the saving rate will rise but only very slowly, which would give us slower growth and a   longer, more-extended transition period  So this remains a very important question  Again, I think   the modal forecast of moderate growth next year is a good one, but there is an awful lot of   uncertainty about that   On the side of economic potential, we had some very interesting discussion today about   output gaps, the NAIRU, and so on, and I think it is an interesting question as to what extent the   NAIRU may have risen or may be rising going forward  There are some arguments for a higher   NAIRU  The level of long-term unemployment now is exceptionally high, and as we have seen in   other countries, the loss of skills and loss of job attachment can lead to hysteresis-type effects,   which can raise unemployment going forward  As I had noted myself in the past and others noted                                              August 11–12, 2009 115 of 165  today, there is a significant amount of sectoral reallocation going on from certain sectors that were   overexpanded to other sectors  Indeed, as others have noted, a relatively high fraction of layoffs in   this episode have been permanent rather than temporary  In the medium term also, we had very low   rates of capital formation  We have tight credit and other factors that may inhibit job creation and   business creation  So those are some factors that may raise the NAIRU     My own sense is that the NAIRU may be a bit higher, but I wouldn’t go nearly so far as the   6½ percent in the “labor market damage” scenario that the Greenbook looks at  There are a number   of reasons to think, in particular, that the reallocation argument should not be taken too far  First of   all, if you look at the cyclical variation across industries, it is, in fact, relatively normal for a deep   recession The sectors that are suffering the most are sectors like construction, manufacturing,   durable goods, wholesale, and transportation  Those are the sectors that normally are badly hit   during a recession, and of course, I would have to say that most of these sectors are now well below   what their steady state was likely to be  Diffusion indexes and cross-sectional standard deviations   of growth in employment also don’t suggest that we are in an extraordinarily different situation   from other recessions   With respect to the permanent layoffs, the real change seems to have happened around 1985    In the ’70s and early ’80s, we saw a dominant factor  The marginal firing in recession in the ’70s   and early ’80s was more likely to be temporary than permanent  But since about 1990, in the last   three recessions, the temporary and permanent shares have been about as constant on the margin as   they are on average  That did not say it very well, but what I am trying to convey is that the role of   permanent layoffs is not particularly striking compared with the last two recessions  It is striking   compared with the ’60s, ’70s, and early ’80s  In fact, there is a good bit of evidence of labor                     August 11–12, 2009 116 of 165  hoarding of different types  One example I would give is part-time work, which is a way of keeping   workers, who can be restored to full-time work when the economy recovers, connected to the firm   Finally, a note on the NIPA revisions  Prior to the revisions we had the puzzle that   unemployment seemed too high given the decline in real output, which suggested that maybe there   was a more-strenuous-than-normal effort to get rid of workers and to reduce staffing  With the   NIPA revisions, Okun’s law is looking better; again, it looks as though we are fitting a more normal   cyclical pattern  So there is a lot of uncertainty here, and I find it fully plausible that the NAIRU   will be a bit higher than it has been in the past  But in looking at that issue, I don’t think we should   overstate the differences between this recession and at least the last two recessions   By the way, there was an interesting interrelation between the two issues I talked about—the   consumer response and the NAIRU—which was, in fact, captured in the staff’s “labor market   damage” scenario  They assumed in their simulation that consumers understood that the NAIRU   was higher and that, therefore, employment, growth, and output will be lower in the future  That   feeds back on their consumption decisions in a permanent income sense, and as a result, the   simulation actually showed bigger effects on GDP than it did on inflation, contrary to your simple   intuition about what the NAIRU would do  I think that is an open question  If the NAIRU is larger   and we around this table are not sure, are consumers better able to assess that than we are?  That   may turn out to be an interesting question as we see what connections there are between the   potential of the economy, on the one hand, and consumer behavior, on the other hand   I don’t have much to add to what has been said about inflation  I think we have to wait and   see how the gap story works  I agree with President Plosser that in principle it depends a lot on the   source of the gap, although I do think that aggregate demand has been very important in this   particular episode  We did work very hard, all of us, during the intermeeting period to try to                                                                             2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 11–12, 2009 117 of 165  communicate our exit strategy and our resolve to defend price stability  We  should continue to do   that, and I hope that will be constructive going forward  So those are my comments  Brian, if you   will, we can just turn now to the policy alternative   Thank you, Brian Are there questions for Brian?  Seeing   none, we can begin our go-round with President Lockhart   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Fisher   Thank you Is the coffee ready, do you think?  [Laughter]   All right It is 1030 Why don’t we take a 20-minute break     August 11–12, 2009 127 of 165  [Coffee break]   Okay Why don’t we recommence  President Rosengren   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you  President Stern   Thank you President Lacker   President Lacker, I think that there is pretty strong   consensus that we do need to normalize and move out of special intervention as the economy   recovers And we have taken some steps in that direction, including letting one facility expire,   reducing the size of others, and announcing this week that we are not going to add any categories   to the TALF program  So I think we agree with your perspective on that   President Yellen   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Bullard   Just a question about your comment on the base  Why   wouldn’t Japan be a precedent for this experiment?    Okay President Hoenig   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Vice Chairman   Thank you Thank you all  If you recall last March where   we were and our concerns about both the financial system and the economy, we were extremely   aggressive; and whether by dumb luck or prescience or whatever, we seem to have hit the sweet   spot The economy is improving  The financial markets are improving, and I see little reason to   increase stimulus at this point  At the same time, obviously there is still a lot of uncertainty   about consumption, final demand, and the strength of recovery, and I think I agree with the Vice   Chairman that, by any reasonable calculation at least at this point, there still is a considerable   amount of excess capacity in the economy  So on that basis there is not much case either for     August 11–12, 2009 146 of 165  pulling back on stimulus  At the risk of sounding Nixonian, I think we should stay the course on   our policy and continue along the lines we have been following since March   I would agree with the majority of the participants in proposing that we go with the   revised version of alternative B There was little discussion this time of the descriptive   paragraphs, maybe again because we hit the sweet spot—I do not know—but the output   description in particular is a little more upbeat and, I think, conveys the sense that there has been   noticeable improvement even though there are still some important barriers to full recovery   I think that there is considerable agreement around the table that we should allow the   Treasury program to expire as previously signaled  I think the revised version of alternative B   will be read primarily as saying that the FOMC is allowing this program to expire  There is a bit   of flexibility in the sense that we do not completely rule out a future program, and as Governor   Kohn has pointed out, there could be contingencies in which we might want to consider a future   program  But I think it will be read mostly as just a bit of prudence on the part of the Committee   to leave that potential option open for the future  Again, I think the primary signal will be that   the program is being allowed to expire   I agree with the Vice Chairman that the tapering aspect is useful as a signal  It is going to   essentially provide a bit of foreshadowing to the markets about how we may exit from the larger   agency program  We discussed today and I gave a lot of thought to announcing a tapering of the   agency programs today as well  I found it very difficult to write that in a way that didn’t sound   as though we were conclusively ending those programs or going to the full extent  What I would   propose—along the lines of President Stern’s parting advice, which is always wise—is to do no   harm  I propose that we have at the next meeting a robust discussion of exactly how we want to   exit or proceed with the agency MBS program  And long the lines of what President Bullard           August 11–12, 2009 147 of 165  said, one possibility would be to extend it—to reduce the rate of purchase and extend it out  It   might be more effective in the sense that we would not be dominating the market as much but   maybe have a longer horizon   Those are the kinds of issues that I think we ought to talk about in the next meeting  On   that basis, I think it is a bit wiser to leave the status quo on the agencies for this meeting, and that   is also consistent with Brian Sack’s memo, which suggests that we do not yet have to begin the   tapering process in the agency markets  So my recommendation would be that we allow the   Treasury program to expire and that we adopt the revised version of alternative B  And before   we go further, let me just turn to Brian Madigan for a moment because there was an issue he   would like to highlight on the directive related to B   Question?           August 11–12, 2009 148 of 165  As you point out, President Lacker, we are getting close to   the zero bound on that side  So it looks like a good bet that we will continue to see an increase in   the overall balance   Brian, do you have a reply?   Any other questions or comments?  Yes   Well, the staff will look at that  I think it is an interesting   question, how much is pure substitution and how much the general improvements in markets are   changing demand as well  Any other questions or comments either for me or for Brian?  Seeing   none, Debbie, would you call the roll?   Thank you very much  The next meeting is Tuesday and   Wednesday, September 22 and 23  There is a buffet lunch available  There will be no further   business or presentations  So if you are able to stay, please do, and I guess we will be seeing   each other next in Jackson Hole  Thank you very much  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING      "
8818,2009-09-22,BERNANKE," Good afternoon   Yes   Please   And many thanks to the Committee for the collegial work   and discussions we’ve had through a very difficult period  I appreciate how much we’ve all   pulled together and dealt with some of these enormous problems   I need a motion to close the Board meeting   Let me first welcome Jim Lyon to the table  Jim will be   sitting in Gary Stern’s spot  Gary retired, as you know, two weeks ago, and we will have a   luncheon tomorrow after the meeting to honor Gary   The first item on the agenda is financial developments, open market operations, and   System credit facilities  We’ll start with a briefing from the Desk by Brian Sack  We’ll have a   Q&A after that, and then we’ll follow that with some additional staff briefings  Brian?                                                                               1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 22–23, 2009 4 of 212  Thank you very much  Questions for Brian?  Governor   Tarullo    President Evans   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman    How does that match up?  The dealers thought—what was   it, about 50 or 60 basis points from the end of the program?   Okay   President Lacker   Other questions?  Let me just recognize you, President   Bullard But let’s not get completely into the debate at this point  [Laughter] We’re still in   Q&A mode  President Bullard?   A two-hander, President Lacker?   One-hander, okay [Laughter] We’ll go one-hander to   President Fisher   I’m sorry  Okay President Plosser, yes   Two-hander, okay   Would you like to finish?   President Fisher   President Lacker    Any other questions for Brian?  (No response) Okay, seeing none,   I’m going to turn to Bill English, who is going to give the first of three briefings on the balance sheet,   reserve management, and associated issues, and then we’ll take questions for all three briefings at the   same time  Bill   Thank you very much  According to the agenda, the sequence of   the meeting goes as follows First, questions for the staff; there will then be an opportunity for    unstructured interaction on these issues; and then finally, of course, two full go-rounds  So everyone will   have ample opportunity to  express their views on all of these subjects   Let’s begin first with just questions for the staff  Are there questions?  Vice Chairman Dudley    President Rosengren   Governor Kohn    President Lacker    President Plosser    President Evans   Governor Duke    President Fisher                                          September 22–23, 2009 40 of 212   It wouldn’t be in the system at all if we weren’t doing the   quantitative easing, and it’s not constraining anything else because it’s not affecting leverage ratios    Right    President Plosser, you had a two-hander?    President Lacker   De facto sterilized because of the offsetting movements   I think I detected a little appetite for coffee around the table    [Laughter] So why don’t we take fifteen minutes and come back at 405 pm?  Thank you   [Coffee break]              September 22–23, 2009 46 of 212  Why don’t we recommence?  We’ve had a number of   issues raised by the presentations First, there were some recommendations from the Desk on   large-scale asset purchases, including possible tapering strategies  Second, we had some   discussion of reserve management tools and the progress there  Third, there was a proposal   essentially on the TAF and the TSLF Let me just mention parenthetically that, as I understand it   from talking to Scott, no votes are needed to implement those proposals, because the TSLF   directive in particular told the Desk to wind down the options as conditions permit  I’d be happy   to hear comments  But if people would like to disagree with the press release or the plan, please   say so If we get more or less consensus around the table, we won’t have to take a formal action   on that, I think So those are three topics that we can talk about   This part of the meeting is billed on the agenda as an opportunity for informal,   unstructured interaction [laughter], which I am going to duck, I think, in a minute  I hope this is   a chance for us just to have some interchange  Let me just be very clear that we will not be   making any decisions in this part of the meeting; the decisions on large-scale asset purchases,   and so on, will be taken tomorrow in the policy round  So please don’t feel that you are   compelled to speak in order to get your voice heard—you will be heard  But it would be useful,   I think, to have some additional discussion   Before we get into that, I just wanted to say a word or two about the quantitative easing   mechanism, because I feel as if there’s a certain amount of confusion going on  So let me just   say three straightforward things   The first point, and I think we all agree on this, is that any action we take—through   purchases or auctions or whatever—to put reserves into the banking system, on net, will be   expansionary, because whatever the banks do along the lines of what they told Bill English and              September 22–23, 2009 47 of 212  his colleagues—whether it’s buying other assets, or lending, or whatever action they take—will   tend to be expansionary  Of course, in equilibrium this will be reflected in lower short-term   interest rates across a range of potential assets  And that’s essentially how quantitative easing   works It’s meant to be expansionary, and I think it would be in the context that we’re using it   here President Yellen made a good point during the break, which was that quantitative easing   should be expansionary even if the leverage ratio were binding  The reason is that, in order to   avoid the leverage ratio, firms would either have to get rid of managed liabilities or lower deposit   rates and otherwise prevent the inflow of cash into their institution  If depositors are not   incentivized to put money into banks, they will go to money market mutual funds or to other   types of short-term credit markets, and that, again, will have the effect of lowering short-term   interest rates, and, therefore, be expansionary  So I don’t think that there really is any barrier to   quantitative easing being effective in our current institutional environment     The second observation I would make is based on Bill’s simulations; based on what we   know, we think the quantitative easing effects are probably pretty small  Short-term interest   rates are already low They might be made a little bit lower by quantitative easing, but I don’t   see much chance of a huge overshoot in a short period of time  I think that’s not what the   evidence suggests It’s not what the Japanese experience suggests  So quantitative easing should   be expansionary, but I don’t see it as being a major part of our overall monetary policy stance   And then, the third thing I’d like to say is that we can exit from the high level of reserves    We have, in fact, three methods to do that—we have two belts as well as a pair of suspenders    First of all, we have the interest on reserves, which may be leaky, but certainly if it’s raised high   enough it will tighten policy—there seems to be little doubt about that  Second, we have the   various ways of sterilizing reserves through reverse repos or time deposits  I wasn’t quite clear        September 22–23, 2009 48 of 212  about the timing, but my sense is that these things will be coming online by early next year  So   over the time frame in which we would have to do a significant amount of tightening, we should   have the tools in place to do that  Then, of course, the third method we know we can do is sell   assets I think that that would not only have effects via the reversal of quantitative easing, but it   also would have very powerful signaling and market effects     These are very important issues for us to understand  But I felt there was an impression   somehow that we were not in control of the situation  I don’t think that’s true  Obviously, it’s a   difficult and novel situation, but I do think that the staff and all of us working together have a   pretty good understanding of how to manage this and how this relates to standard monetary   policy   So that’s my little homily  Let me now open up the floor for any comments on asset   purchases, reserve management, TAF, TSLF, any of those things that anyone would like to bring   up, and I would invite interaction  Would anyone like to raise any points?  Ah, President Lacker,   I knew I could count on you [Laughter]   Yes, let me comment on that briefly  First of all, I think it’s   important for us to be able to do what we need to do without relying on the Treasury  Obviously,   we need to maintain that independence and that flexibility  Whatever help they can provide, of        September 22–23, 2009 49 of 212  course, is a bonus I’ve had some discussions with Secretary Geithner and others, and the view   was that because the debate on the debt ceiling—which will probably be toward the end of the   year—could be contentious for a lot of reasons, it would be a good idea for us to have a low   profile and not be part of this discussion For that reason, I suggested to him that they run it   down to a very low level until such time as all that discussion was completed  Once the debt   ceiling is raised, they are perfectly comfortable bringing the SFPs back up to some level  Of   course, at one point, it was over $500 billion—is that right, Brian?   So there’s some scope there, depending on how high the   debt ceiling goes But that being said, there is a sort of sine wave aspect of this, if we run into a   debt ceiling again, for example, at the end of next year  So I think it’s something that will on   average be of some assistance if we get into a sterilization mode, but clearly we don’t want to   count on that as an essential element of our strategy   When is the peak in the reserves?   Middle of next year, I thought   Right There’s a peak because of the SFP, but, of course,   the balance sheet doesn’t max out until after the MBS would be settled sometime early next year    And by that time, if all goes well, the SFP would be back in action        September 22–23, 2009 50 of 212  Well, given that we’re not in a mode of tightening at this   point, I think that the effects would occur only through quantitative easing  I think they’d be   modest But if necessary, of course, we can adjust in other dimensions    I don’t know   My personal discussions with the Secretary suggested that   they were very comfortable raising it up again when the debt ceiling permitted  But, again, I   don’t think we should have either a formal understanding nor should we rely on it because of the   independence issue   Vice Chairman, did you have a comment?   Let’s let him finish, and then you can respond   All right  Why don’t you defer that point until tomorrow?   Are there any other questions about the broader issues?   President Lockhart    Well, we weren’t really on a corridor system before  We   had a target, which was the federal funds rate, and we were manipulating reserves to hit that   target Our interest on reserves strategy would be a corridor system  It would be a rate at which   we would pay interest, which presumably would be the floor or would help establish the floor,   and then there would be a lending rate, which would presumably be the ceiling   I think that’s a really good question  Here’s the problem we have with the federal funds   rate Given some of the things we might be doing in order to try to get better control of reserves,   we may make the federal funds rate a less informative interest rate  For example, right now most   of the liquidity in the federal funds market is coming from the GSEs  If we start pulling their   liquidity out in order to firm up the interest rate floor, then the federal funds market might be a   very illiquid market  There’s still a bank-to-bank market, but we don’t have the same kind of   data on that           September 22–23, 2009 53 of 212  So I think we have three options—Brian, you and the staff can certainly comment  One   would be to find a way to do the federal funds rate, including perhaps additional information   from bank transactions  The second would be to choose another short-term rate, like the repo   rate, which might work  And the third would be to make the interest rate on reserves and the   primary credit rate the announced variables, which, of course, we know we can do  We could   imagine a statement of policy that would announce changes in those two interest rates, plus some   open market operations to sterilize a certain amount of reserves  I’ve mentioned this to staff  I   do think we need to give this some more thought  Brian, do you have anything to add?   You’re working on that?   Okay, good Any other points?  Governor Warsh   Let me give that a try  Just from a pure accounting   perspective, we’re on a cost basis, so we wouldn’t be reporting any capital losses  I think it’s not   clear that the capital losses or gains are very material to anything for the following reasons  So   long as our cost of carry—which is zero on cash plus whatever rates we pay on deposits, and so   on—is below the coupon on the MBS, then we would be making positive flow income, which is   seigniorage to the Treasury From an income perspective, unless we get to about 8 percent short-  term rates—I think that’s the number that was calculated in an earlier meeting—we’ll actually be   making money in some sense on these transactions, which will then be reflected in payments to   the Treasury So I think from that perspective the politics is okay   If we sell a lot of assets, then we have to realize the losses  That probably has not much   economic meaning; it could have some public relations implications  Since we’re dealing only   with appearances and not with actuality, one way to deal with that would be to try to sell assets   that are in the money first or pair them with assets that are in losses  That would be one way to   sell assets without realizing net losses     The final comment I would make is that I’ve had some discussions with the Treasury   about this, because we’ll be returning to the Treasury very high levels of seigniorage over the                               September 22–23, 2009 55 of 212  next few years I think there would be some basis for withholding some of those earnings to   augment our capital, so that if we do have losses, we’d be able to absorb them  Those are some   of the considerations Would Brian or anyone like to add to that?   Yes, absolutely   We don’t have statutory capital   Yes   I’m no accounting expert, but because we buy and sell   assets all the time and it doesn’t affect our cost basis accounting, I can’t imagine that that would   have a direct implication   Governor Duke?               September 22–23, 2009 56 of 212  Well, this may be it  [Laughter] Did anyone have any   concerns or comments?  President Plosser and President Fisher noted the issue on penalty rates,   but did anyone have any other issues about the proposal to reduce the two auction facilities?   Any other comments or observations?  President Lacker   Yes, I actually have some sympathy for this view, and the   only thing that worries me a bit at this juncture is that it’s kind of a funny time to be changing the   structure of the auction when we’re in the process of winding it down  But I think that arguably   we could have had a higher minimum bid rate earlier on   Absolutely My understanding is that, in order to have the   TAF as an ongoing facility, even in reserve, we would have to do a rulemaking  Is that correct?   I believe that’s right Scott?   Okay, we would do a rulemaking for comment  That would   be an excellent opportunity to make any revisions to the structure for our permanent facility   We do need to vote to ratify open market operations   Any opposed?   (No response)  Okay, thank you If   everyone is okay with it, why don’t we turn now to the economic outlook?  And the presentation   will be by Dave Stockton and Nathan Sheets  Dave   Thank you very much  Are there questions for our   colleagues?  President Plosser                  September 22–23, 2009 64 of 212  Governor Kohn, you had a two-hander?   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you  President Lockhart   Nathan, I think it’s worth pointing out, though, that the   behavior of the yields on Treasuries is a little bit inconsistent with this whole story and gives us   something of a puzzle   President Fisher   Thank you Other questions?  (No response) Okay, seeing   none, why don’t we begin our economic go-round? And President Lockhart, you’re the leadoff   hitter   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you President Lacker   Thank you  President Rosengren   Thank you President Fisher   What’s the difference between a checkmark recovery and a   V recovery?   I see   You don’t go with a square root sign, though  [Laughter]   Thank you  President Bullard   Thanks On state contingency, I think I should just raise the   possibility of corner solutions  If you have a constraint, you could be up against that   constraint—it wouldn’t be state contingent in that case  Although we want to talk about future   policy, and so on, but in terms of your actual instrument—   Yes, for example   President Fisher   Okay Thank you President Evans   We all have to make sacrifices  [Laughter] President   Yellen   Thank you I should just say that for the December   meeting, the current plan is to have a presentation—by Reserve Banks, I guess—on inflation   dynamics  So we’ll try to bring back the “continuing education” aspect of this meeting   We’re well into the 600 hour Thank you, everyone  Why don’t we adjourn until   900 am tomorrow morning  There’s a reception and a dinner, but no business—it’s an optional   dinner for your convenience 	So I’ll see you at 900  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]           September 22–23, 2009 100 of 212  September 23, 2009—Morning Session   Good morning, everybody  I recognize the Vice Chairman   Welcome  Good We can continue with the economic go-  round, and I have President Hoenig to lead off   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  First Vice President Lyon   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you Governor Warsh           September 22–23, 2009 113 of 212  Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you very much, and thanks to everyone for useful   discussion I’m going to attempt here to summarize what I’ve heard and then make a few   additional comments   In summary, the outlook improved during the intervening period, particularly with   respect to economic growth over the remainder of the year, and most participants believe that   recovery had begun Although anecdotal information suggests that businesses and households   remain quite cautious, a number of factors should support growth over the next few quarters,   including reduced inventory accumulation, higher auto sales and production, modest increases in        September 22–23, 2009 125 of 212  housing activity and prices, some stabilization in household spending, better financial conditions,   and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies   The outlook for the medium term also seems better than at the last meeting, but there   remains considerable uncertainty about whether final demand growth will be sustained once   government policy supports, including special measures such as “cash-for-clunkers” and the   first-time homebuyer’s credit, begin to wane  The modal view was that the recovery in 2010   could be relatively slow—maybe a checkmark [laughter]—perhaps around the long-run potential   growth rate, a rate that would be too slow to reduce the unemployment rate significantly next   year Some suggested that downside risks to growth remained as well  Inflation remains   relatively low, but there was some disagreement about the factors that most influence inflation in   the medium term and about the risks associated with our current mix of policies   Retail sales and consumer spending have picked up a bit, in part reflecting special factors,   such as the “cash-for-clunkers” program  Some consumer fundamentals are improved  Notably,   household wealth is rising again, and labor income may be stabilizing  Sentiment, though still   low, has improved, and there is possibly some pent-up demand  However, especially weak labor   markets, tight credit, and the slowing of the benefits of the stimulus package seem likely to   restrain consumption growth  Saving rates have been relatively stable, but the evolution of the   saving rate remains an important uncertainty in the near term   In the housing sector, sales and starts have looked somewhat better, and house prices   have actually risen a bit Higher house prices not only increase household wealth, but they also   improve the quality of mortgage-related assets and, by reducing the effective cost of capital,   encourage home purchase  However, foreclosures are likely to continue to put pressure on prices                 September 22–23, 2009 126 of 212  by raising supply Other risks to housing are the ending of the temporary tax credit for first-time   homebuyers and the end of the Fed’s MBS purchase program   Activity in the nonresidential sector continues to decline sharply in most Districts,   reflecting both worsening fundamentals and severe credit constraints  In the business sector,   managers are relieved that the worst scenarios have not come to pass, but, as already noted,   many remain wary and uncertain about the recovery, and there is some disconnect between their   perceptions and the relative strengths seen in the aggregate data   Business caution, together with low utilization rates and substantial excess capacity,   suggest that many firms may be slow to add workers and make new capital investments  Cost-  cutting has contributed to productivity gains  The sustainability of those gains is unclear but is   potentially an important issue, for example, in determining whether the recovery will be jobless   and how slack will evolve   Manufacturing surveys show some improvement, probably reflecting in part rising   volumes of global trade and activity  Indexes show a moderate increase in manufacturers’   expectations of prices paid and received  Reports on retailing and services remain somewhat   mixed  Health care has done well, transportation less so  Agriculture and natural gas production   have been affected by lower prices   The labor market remains very weak, but may be close to the bottom  Layoffs have   slowed somewhat They’re still high, and UI claims are falling only gradually  Gross hiring is   weak Wage growth is moderate, presumably reflecting the weakness of the market    Unemployment is expected to decline only slowly, given the expectation that economic growth   will not be significantly above potential next year, and given the recent experience of jobless   recoveries              September 22–23, 2009 127 of 212  Improvements in financial markets over the intermeeting period were not dramatic, but   the substantial gains in the past six months were largely sustained  Risk-taking and momentum   have returned to the markets  The decline in longer-term Treasury yields is somewhat puzzling,   but at least for now it is supportive of recovery  However, credit risks in the banking system   remain substantial, particularly in residential and commercial mortgages  Bank credit remains   tight Bank loans to smaller businesses, households, and commercial real estate, in particular,   have fallen dramatically  Securitization markets still are limited in their activity  Banks’ terms   continue to tighten, perhaps in part due to regulatory pressures   Inflation has been relatively stable, with a modest downward trend in the core, and the   risks around inflation seem more balanced  Wages and unit labor costs are decelerating, but, on   the other hand, the dollar is weakening and commodity prices are up  Participants differed on the   fundamental determinants of inflation and consequently on their forecasts, and emphasis on   inflation expectations as a driver of inflation, together with the Greenbook assumption that   policy will stay easy much longer than markets expect, led some to worry about higher inflation   in the medium term  Alternatively, even if slack is an unreliable determinant of inflation in   normal times, the very high level of slack that probably exists today could create disinflationary   pressures Very possibly, the stability of inflation expectations as measured in financial markets   or in surveys may be disguising a great deal of uncertainty about how policy and inflation will   ultimately evolve   Given the long lags of policy and uncertainties about the effects of unconventional   policies, continued clarity about and attention to the Fed’s policies and exit strategy are   important for retaining confidence        September 22–23, 2009 128 of 212  Any comments?  (No response) Okay With that let me just add a few thoughts  I come   after Governor Tarullo, so it’s even more difficult for me   I think we’re all glad that the general view seems to be that the near-term outlook will be   better; the data since the last meeting support that view  Of course, the question that everyone   has alluded to is whether this near-term pickup will be sustainable going into 2010  I think that   this is actually a very complicated question, and there are good arguments on both sides  So at   the risk of being a little bit pedantic, I’m going to do “point and counterpoint” and talk a bit   about some of what I see as the main forces on the two sides   If you look at the case for sustainability, there are a lot of factors which suggest that final   demand will be sustained next year  I think the housing market developments are particularly   important in this regard, and the staff has noted the improvements in house-price outlooks  As   President Yellen noted, this is not just a matter of wealth—it potentially affects asset quality  In   addition, because expected price changes are part of the cost of capital—or, put another way,   people don’t want to buy houses when the prices are falling—some sense that prices are   stabilizing may be very helpful in terms of residential construction  I think it is literally the case   that since I’ve been Chairman, there has not been a single quarter in which residential   construction has added to the GDP [Laughter] I won’t go down as the “housing Chairman,” but   the third quarter, apparently, may be different   The labor market is very weak, but overall, as job losses have moderated and as hours   have improved slightly and wages have improved slightly, labor income is beginning to stabilize,   which is an important precondition for multiplier–accelerator developments next year   Financial markets are, of course, very positive, and I would note that not only are they a   cause of improved conditions in terms of credit availability and in terms of the positive financial        September 22–23, 2009 129 of 212  feedback loop, but they are also reflective of expectations  In particular, developments in the   stock market and the shape of the yield curve are suggestive that confidence about recovery is   returning   On the consumer side, I mentioned last time that I felt comfortable with the Greenbook’s   assumption that saving rates will be stable going forward, in which case we should begin to see   growth in consumption that will support a more sustained recovery  And supporting that is the   fact that wealth is beginning to turn around and that the drag from the losses of wealth over the   last couple of years will begin to fade over time   The global recovery is another positive, although the effects are different and work   through different channels But, certainly, I think one of the reasons that manufacturing looks to   be leading this recovery must be at least in part because of the exposure of manufacturing to   trade   Finally, on the sustainability side, as Ted Truman and others have been reminding us, the   norm for a deep recession is a fairly strong recovery, and there certainly are factors like pent-up   demand and inventory adjustments that tend to bring economies back faster than sometimes is   anticipated   On the other hand [laughter], there are some things that go against some of these   basically optimistic forces  A number of people have talked about the temporary nature of many   of the government programs that are supporting economic growth now—the housing market is a   clear case of that  People have mentioned the first-time homebuyer’s tax credit, which is now   expiring Presumably the Fed at some point will not be able to maintain the downward pressure   on mortgage rates  And there are other things going on as well, including developments in the   GSEs, losses at the FHA that may force them to tighten their terms, and probably an increased     September 22–23, 2009 130 of 212  pace of foreclosures as some of the moratoria and other delays end  So the housing market is not   out of the woods by any means, and the Greenbook does take into account a possible relapse in   house prices   The labor market recovery looks much more like a jobless or very slow recovery than the   alternative For example, the UI claims, although falling, are doing so quite slowly, and we are   all aware of the fact that the duration of unemployment is quite high, which is going to affect   labor force attachment and skills and so on   The productivity issue really cuts both ways, as we discussed yesterday  At least in the   2001 recovery, there was a close relationship between productivity at the micro level and   phenomena associated with a jobless recovery  I would point out that the Greenbook is not   really forecasting a jobless recovery  They anticipate, as I count here, 22 million payroll jobs in   2010 and 38 million in 2011 being added, which of course is possible, but it could be weaker   than that if productivity and other forces are drags   The improvements in financial markets are very encouraging, but the banking system, I   think, remains the most important exception, with credit being quite tight and potential losses   being very, very important in that sector  I was interested to hear Governor Duke’s comments   about the banks’ views vis-à-vis my own views  In general they are being very, very cautious, in   any case, about lending   Consumer spending has not yet demonstrated that it will be sustainable  “Cash-for­  clunkers” and other measures, like the tax credits and transfers of the fiscal program, are, of   course, temporary, and more broadly, the fiscal stimulus will begin to decline next year, as will   the inventory correction        September 22–23, 2009 131 of 212  And finally, although there is a presumption that a deep recession will be followed by a   strong recovery, we have talked in this forum for a number of months about the many headwinds   that we face, including leverage issues, credit issues, and various imbalances, for example, fiscal   and trade imbalances, that need to be corrected   So I’ve gone through all of these things not only to show you what an open-minded   person I am [laughter], but also to say that I think our views need to be fairly nuanced at this   point I think the general outlook has improved, and I think there’s a reasonable chance for the   recovery to be sustained in 2010, but there are a lot of crosscurrents that we need to pay attention   to   If I had to take a modal position, I would reiterate what I said at the last meeting, which   is, again, I do anticipate the second half of this year to be pretty strong  I said so last time, and I   do think that the modal outlook for 2010 is for economic growth around potential, maybe a little   bit above potential, with, of course, only modest effects on unemployment and job creation  A   number of factors support that, and the two most important factors since last time that influence   my thinking are the improvements in the housing sector and house prices and the fact that global   growth continues to be above expectations   So that would be my modal forecast  I think we need to think about, if you will, the   distribution of costs on both sides of that expectation  And, putting aside the probabilities and   risks, I think you can make the case at this point that, given how far we are from full   employment, given the fact that banks are just going to skirt by in terms of their ability to   maintain adequate capital given the expected losses, the social costs of an outcome that’s weaker   than we currently anticipate are on the margin greater than those if the outcome is a bit stronger   than we currently anticipate  And independent of any considerations of insurance and risk           September 22–23, 2009 132 of 212  aversion, I think that asymmetry in the shape of the cost function ought to make us still be   focused primarily on supporting recovery, although we obviously need to pay close attention to   the medium-term risks that others have pointed to   As we will discuss in the next round, I think that high levels of policy stimulus are still   warranted, but, again, absolutely in the spirit of demonstrating my open-mindedness, I do, in   fact, quite seriously want to talk a bit about the downsides of policy stimulus which many people   have already noted Clearly, while inflation is not a concern now, we do have to pay some   attention to it, because, as President Hoenig points out, the lags can be long and variable  I think   someone mentioned that before you, President Hoenig   I will make one observation, though, on this  Let me talk a bit about the determinants of   inflation for just a moment  First, on the output gap side, I think I would like to associate myself   with some things that President Yellen and President Evans said, which is that a lot of the   ambiguities in the statistical and empirical work on the output gap and inflation come from the   fact that, over most of the data sample, the output gap is sufficiently small that it is dominated by   noise It is very hard to know whether there is a gap, how big it is, and indeed, there may be   nonlinear effects of the gap on inflation Let me propose a very simple analysis  Just look at   NBER peak dates—beginnings of recessions—which are typically known within a year or   16 months or so of the actual peak  Since 1960, looking at the second and third years after the   peak date from the NBER, in all cases, total inflation has fallen in the second and third year   relative to the year before the peak, and in most cases quite substantially, and in all but one,   1973, core inflation has also fallen, in most cases fairly substantially  So there does seem to be a   recession effect suggesting that large output gaps do affect inflation, even if the linkage is not   visible for small gaps        September 22–23, 2009 133 of 212  That being said, I think inflation expectations are important, and one way that shows up   is that the effects of output gaps are obviously much smaller now than in the past  We saw about   a 2 percentage point decline in total and core inflation after the 1990 recession and only about a   1 percentage point decline after the 2001 recession  Of course, this is a bigger recession than   either of those two, and we’ve already seen about a 1 percentage point decline in core, but I think   the direction there is correct   I think a few people talked about looking a bit at the components of inflation  We’re   seeing a substantial slowdown in services prices, including rents, which tend to be pretty inertial    So I think from that perspective we should see a slower rate of core inflation for a time, and from   a cost perspective, unit labor costs are low as well  At the same time, I recognize that, of course,   commodity prices, the dollar, and so on can move pretty quickly and probably respond much   more quickly to policy and policy expectations than these other factors do, and so we need to   take a balanced view   I would also add that, on this issue of stimulus, there are other factors that I, at least, pay   attention to in thinking about this over and above inflation per se—for example, the dollar  The   decline in the dollar we’ve been seeing has been relatively moderate  It has basically only offset   the gains that we saw late last year Nevertheless, I think it would be very unfortunate if we had   a more disorderly or more rapid decline in the dollar  It would potentially have implications for   domestic interest rates, it might lead to concerns about financial stability, and, more broadly, it   may exacerbate some of the problems of international economic relations and our role in the   international economic order that is a long-term consideration   Governor Warsh alluded to, I think, speculative activity in markets  Frankly, I don’t   really see any major bubbles at this point, but we haven’t been that good at identifying them in           September 22–23, 2009 134 of 212  the past, and we need to pay attention, I think, to any kind of excesses in financial markets that   might be generated by our activities   Finally, I think we do have to pay attention to our balance sheet  These issues are less   important, of course, than our macro objectives, but there are political implications from large   losses or difficulties in managing the balance sheet, and we have to think about that certainly as   part of our exit strategy   So, as a bottom line, like most of you, I see a strong second half as short-term factors   play out My modal forecast is for moderate growth next year  Again, like most of you, I do   think that the downside risks are significant, and we need to be particularly attentive to that, and   I think that core inflation, at least, should be well controlled in the short to medium term    Having said that, I fully understand and sympathize with the need for a balanced approach,   which, even as we support this economy, keeps us alert to the problems of exit, which are clearly   already beginning and will be an important part of our deliberations for some time   Any questions or comments?  President Lacker   It’s a good point, but I guess my quick reaction would be   that if you look at these recession episodes I just described, the role of monetary policy in those   has varied quite a bit Some of them earlier on were essentially caused by tight monetary policy,   others much less so  So I think the commonality would be an aggregate demand effect  But,   again, I’d be the first to agree that none of us has a really definitive, strong model of inflation,   although for what it’s worth, I think the reviews of the Greenbook have shown better success in   forecasting inflation and output I think that’s the academic result  But, and I say this with all   due respect to our colleagues who are doing the very best that anyone can do, neither one is   incredibly successful beyond a few quarters   Anything else?  (No response) Okay Brian, would you like to open the next round?   Thank you, Brian Are there questions for Brian?  (No   response) I understand coffee is ready We could have coffee now so that we don’t break up   the go-round So we’ll take 20 minutes for coffee  Thank you   [Coffee break]   Okay Why don’t we recommence and begin the policy go-  round with President Plosser   Thank you  President Rosengren   Okay The last two minutes will be struck  [Laughter]   Thank you President Lacker        September 22–23, 2009 145 of 212  I just wasn’t quite clear on your last point  What was your   preferred language for the end of that sentence?   I see Okay Thank you President Yellen   Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you  President Bullard   So, President Bullard, you said that you wanted to retain   “up to” Did you have a thought on the next sentence about the tapering that would fit with your   proposal?   “The Committee will gradually”—        September 22–23, 2009 158 of 212  It says it will be completed   President Rosengren and President Yellen suggested saying   “gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets”    Let me just say now that I think that there’s an important interaction between that decision and   the “up to” decision If we’re going to be unclear about our time frame and unclear about the   final amount, those two things together are somewhat concerning  But that’s one possibility   Okay Thank you   Vice Chairman   Thank you President Hoenig   I infer that you want to keep the “up to,” though   Okay That’s what I thought  President Lockhart   Thank you President Fisher   Thank you  President Evans   Thank you very much  President Pianalto   Thank you  First Vice President Lyon   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you I guess I would note that we are proposing to   retain the last sentence; I realize that if you repeat a sentence too many times it begins to lose   meaning   Vice Chairman   Okay Thank you President Plosser   Thank you Well, let me try to summarize  First on the   substance, we’ve all agreed that the intermeeting data were more favorable—that’s a great relief,   and I think to some extent it validates the approach we took back in March  If we had known in   March where we’d be today, I think we would be reasonably relieved about it  So I think that’s   all encouraging That being said, as I mentioned in my go-round comments on the outlook, the   economy does remain quite weak, certainly quite far from meeting our maximum employment   objective And there are costs on the downside—and I’m not talking about an insurance   argument here; I’m talking about the neutral-risk size of the costs  I think the downside risks are   still dangerous, because on the downside lies the possibility of renewed financial crisis, and, of   course, the marginal cost of higher unemployment—or less employment—is greater when you’re   starting from such an adverse position So I don’t think that scaling back stimulus significantly   at this meeting is warranted    Having said that, I see it as a nuanced situation  I think it’s not right to say that we are   going full bore and not in the process of exiting  We have both actively and passively allowed   the rundown of substantial amounts of our liquidity programs, and my own assumption is that, as   the early 2010 deadline comes around, we will, in fact, close many, if not most, of those   programs  Second, we have ended the Treasury program  So I think it’s clear—we’ve talked a   good bit about exit—to the markets and the public that we are in a mode now of thinking about   the exit and have taken some concrete steps in that direction   A second point that’s come up, which I think is an interesting one, is, to put it most   bluntly, the question of whether completing the $1¼ billion of MBS purchases is a further easing   or a staying in place  Because I’ve been focused on the asset side and on the effects on interest   rates, I guess I would conclude that it’s closer to staying in place than it is to a further easing     September 22–23, 2009 176 of 212  First, mortgage rates have been fairly constant throughout this entire program, and I think that   what we’ll be seeing when we stop the program is probably some backup in mortgage rates, so   that measure of ease has been constant over the period of the program  In fact, whether you   believe in a stock effect or a flow effect, either one would suggest that, if you were to cut back   your planned purchases, it would cause rates to rise, and it would be a tightening relative to   expectations   Now, the quantitative easing theory is a little bit more ambiguous  If we’re putting more   reserves into the system, then arguably that is a further easing  But I have two observations    One is that those effects may be small, and the other is, as Governor Duke mentioned, that it’s   uncertain to what extent the effects of that are anticipated in the markets already  So it’s a   complicated question  My own feeling is that if we were to adopt something like alternative C   and actively cut back on our plan today, not only would it be tightening in the sense of pulling   back on the asset-purchase program, but it also would send a very strong signal that we were   very close to exit, and I still don’t think we’re there yet  So I do think that our options really are   to continue with the program, and one of the key decisions that we have is exactly how to   describe how we’re going to go forward with the program at this point   Now, there’s the other side of the question that President Yellen and Governor Tarullo   and others mentioned  If we’re unsatisfied with the situation and we think the federal funds rate   ought to be minus 4 percent, why aren’t we doing even more?  Here again, I don’t think we   should rule that out, but I feel some sympathy to what President Evans said, which is that, given   all the uncertainties we have and the issues about our balance sheet and exit and our uncertainties   about the effects of these programs, it’s not obvious that we do have a lot of ammunition left   even on this unconventional dimension  Having said that, I think we should obviously keep this           September 22–23, 2009 177 of 212  possibility alive if the situation warrants it, but it’s not clear to me at this point we should be   doing more either  So I do support the language in alternative B, but there are a couple of   decisions that we need to make   To get to the most substantive one first, I’m not sure, Governor Tarullo, if I got your vote   on the “up to” language, but, excluding your vote, I think I have five for keeping “up to,” six for   dropping it, and four who were split evenly between slightly favored one or the other Did you   have a preference?   Okay I’m happy to take another straw vote, but personally   I lean slightly towards taking it out on the grounds of market certainty and on the argument that   the Vice Chairman made, namely, that by November we will in any case be already up to $1   trillion, and we won’t have a lot of flexibility to fall short  But frankly, I’m with President   Lockhart—I think it’s a pretty close call, and I don’t think it necessarily is a first-order issue, but   we do need to resolve it So if it’s okay, I think I’d like to take a straw vote of the full   Committee including all participants  President Plosser, is that okay with you?   Okay   All right   Okay So I think if we keep “up to,” again, and we taper, I   think we ought to have an end date at a minimum  If we take away the end date, then there’s just   too much uncertainty involved  So let’s talk for a moment about the end date  Brian, how strong   is the preference of the Desk for the first quarter?  What arguments can you make about first   quarter versus what I think are the two other options we’ve heard  One is end of second quarter   and the other is in the second quarter, the difference being, I guess, that the end of second quarter   theoretically could encompass a much earlier decline   I have the following proposed compromise on that    President Yellen correctly made an interesting suggestion of replacing “completed” with   “executed,” and the reason that matters is that unlike Treasuries, MBS take weeks to clear, so if   we execute by the end of the first quarter, that means the balance sheet effects will probably go   into the second quarter  Is that going to be okay?  All right, so let’s take that as given, if we will,   that we’re going to execute these things by the end of the first quarter  Then conditional on that,   can I have a straw vote on whether to keep “up to”  Those in favor of keeping “up to,” please                 September 22–23, 2009 179 of 212  raise your hand I see one, two, three, four, five Those in favor of dropping “up to”? One, two,   three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten  The preference is to drop “up to”  That has the   advantage of being parallel to the Treasury language and creating some more certainty   That all being said, I think it’s always clear that we have flexibility  We have a last   sentence here that says we’ll be reviewing the timing and purchase of securities, so I don’t think   we have abandoned flexibility I for one certainly would be open to adjusting the program if we   do see significant changes in the outlook in the next few weeks   Yes, President Lacker   Actually, that’s a good question, and I was going to respond   to President Plosser’s point   Yes So I think there are a couple of things going on there    First, it’s my expectation that the SFP program will come back after the debt ceiling issue is   resolved, although, of course, as I said, we shouldn’t count on that definitively  Second, these   programs—the reverse repos, the term deposits, these tools that we want to have in place—I   think we ought to put them into operation on some small scale early, that is, if possible, by the   end of the year or early next year, just so that we can be assured that they work and the market   can see that they work So I would encourage staff to keep that goal in mind  I think that would   give us certainly an additional way—and this actually corresponds to about the time that the SFP        September 22–23, 2009 180 of 212  is going to run down around the end of the year—to fine-tune if reserves were becoming a   concern; of course, we could always sell Treasuries    Yes, President Plosser   What I’m saying is that, in any event, we ought to start   these programs on a small scale to assure ourselves that they work  If the SFP program doesn’t   come back, then I agree that, as you said, we ought to actively decide about how much reserves   we want in the system   I think President Lacker raised the possibility that the high level of reserves was actually   causing some kind of dysfunction or problem  I’ll tell you my bias  $185 billion in reserves   from a macro stimulus point of view is not that big a deal  It might be a bigger deal in terms of   market function or banking function  In that case, there would be a good reason to explain to the   markets why we’re doing this operation without necessarily changing the overall intent or the   thrust of our policy So, yes, we then could use one of several methods if the Committee decided   to offset some of that   We’ll have the tools to manage it  As for market   expectations, because of our communication, for better or worse, I think expectations are mostly   formed around the size of the purchase programs and not the size of the reserves in the banking   system  Because there’s no way to keep the purchase programs and reduce the reserves, we’re   effectively locked into that   There were a couple of other things that I might as well ask about  There was the   question of “wide range” versus not having “wide range,” and I guess the argument is it’s   somewhat less jarring to go to a “wide range,” but again, I don’t think this is a first-order issue   Would anyone like to comment on that before I ask for a straw vote?  President Lockhart   Vice Chairman   Okay Any other comments on “wide”?   All right  [Laughter]  I’m putting an end to this  Let me   ask how many are in favor of putting in “wide” One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,   nine, ten Just for the record, how many are against it?  One, two, three Okay So let’s include   “wide” I think those are the major decisions   I will comment on the first paragraph  We had some views on both sides, that is, whether   it was too cheery or not cheery enough, whether it was certain enough or uncertain enough  I’m   at a little bit of a loss as to where to go with it  I felt the comments were pretty balanced around   where we were, but if anyone else would like to address that  Would you like to address that,   Governor Tarullo?   Yes, I understand I think the “likely to remain weak”   probably conveys a lot of your uncertainty   President Plosser   If we wanted to fine-tune, one other suggestion—and I   promise this is the last thing—in the sentence beginning “businesses are still cutting back,” there   is the part about “slower pace”  We could go back to the August language, which says,   “Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, but they are continuing to   make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales”  So it would be the   same sentence as last time, and we would eliminate one element of cheeriness from the   description Is there any interest in that?   All right I think we, I hope, have executed effective   directive wording   Okay   Sure   We could reverse the order  The way it’s written, President   Plosser, it’s intended to say that these are both necessary conditions, that they’re both part of the   model One version we had earlier started off by saying “longer-term inflation expectations are   stable, and substantial resource slack is likely to continue dampening cost pressures  Therefore,   the Committee   ”  I don’t think that’s any better from your perspective   Yes   What we’ve done, of course, is added inflationary   expectations to the description   Anything else?   All right, Brian, would you like to read the   statement?   President Evans           September 22–23, 2009 185 of 212  I think the market people will figure out the difference,   right?   We’re using the language that’s technically correct  Brian,   is that right? Do you have any problem with this?   All right   Yes   Okay, and let me just remind everybody that we’re   retaining “up to” for the agency debt I think the sense of the Committee, Brian, is that we’ll   continue to slow that down We may well not want to go to the full amount of that category           September 22–23, 2009 186 of 212  All right Any other comments?  Matt, can you call the roll?   Thank you very much  Matt, do you know if the lunch is   ready at 1230?   We will be heading up to lunch for our colleague Gary   Stern As I said yesterday, in December we’ll have a presentation on inflation dynamics  Our   next meeting is November 3 and 4  With nothing else, the meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING      "
8844,2009-11-03,BERNANKE," Good afternoon, everybody  As has been our custom   recently, this is a joint Board–FOMC meeting  Can I get a motion to close the meeting?   Thank you We would like to welcome to the table   President Kocherlakota from Minneapolis  Narayana is a very distinguished scholar  Everyone   who is familiar with modern economics would know his name and his work  He is new to the   FOMC but not to the Fed You have been a staff member and a research consultant in   Minneapolis for more than a decade  So we look very much forward to working with you and   getting the benefit of your insight Welcome   The first item on our agenda is financial developments,   open market operations, and [laughter]—   Let the record show that President Plosser is wearing a   Phillies hat [Laughter] We don’t take sides here in Washington  All right   Okay Let me turn to Brian Sack for a report on financial   developments, open market operations, and System credit facilities  Brian                                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   November 3–4, 2009 4 of 201  Thank you Questions for Brian?  President Fisher   Any other questions?  President Bullard   Governor Tarullo   Other questions? Okay  Seeing none, we have three staff   presentations on our liquidity programs and reserve-management tools, and I will turn to Bill   Nelson to lead off   Thank you We are open for questions from the   Committee  Please hold your comments and input just for a few more minutes, and we will have   a chance for that as well  But any questions for the staff?  President Lacker    Vice Chairman   All right   Vice Chairman, do you want to answer that?   President Lockhart, you were next               November 3–4, 2009 26 of 201  We will make a list of what input is desired, and then we   will ask everyone President Plosser   President Lacker?   President Fisher   Vice Chair   President Bullard   Other questions?  President Lacker                 November 3–4, 2009 32 of 201  Other questions?  Trish   Okay The next item on the agenda is billed as an opportunity   for interaction—[laughter] a way of saying that we don’t necessarily want to have a go-round  We   do have two subsequent go-rounds  Everyone will have a chance to give their views  However, this   is an opportunity both to interact with each other and to give comments and feedback to the staff on   the issues that they’ve raised  So that people know what you would like to hear, let me just go   through that quickly  As I understand it, there are no formal actions proposed for today; is that   right?   Okay But, Mr Burke, you would like to hear some views on   the counterparty issue Anything else that you would like to hear from the Committee?   That would be, I think, implied   Mr Clouse  Anything from you?   Bill, anything?   Okay, and, Nathan, you want comments on the swap proposal   All right  There are too many items here  We are not going to   have a quasi-decision process here  Okay? So we will poll the Committee—can we do that?—and                              November 3–4, 2009 35 of 201  get feedback from everybody  If you haven’t had time to think about these issues, we will get back   to you after the meeting and get feedback on the relevant issues, and we won’t take a decision until   we hear  But I would still like to have an opportunity for people who would like to make arguments   or comments on any of these issues to do so now  President Hoenig   Brian, would that be possible?   All right Nevertheless, we could have any interaction,   discussion, comments, or input anyone would like to have at this point on any of these issues    Anyone?  Governor Kohn   Vice Chairman, you had a two-hander?   Oh, okay  One moment  I just wanted to say on the   counterparties that there’s not any particular reason that this can’t be done in stages  I think it’s   important that we have an open process and criteria and so on, but given the exigencies of trying to   get this up and running in a reasonable amount of time, why can’t we just do the ones that meet   certain criteria in terms of size and capacity and so on first, and then as we did with the TALF, for   example, go on to a broader set of counterparties?  I just raise that possibility  Okay Vice   Chairman   President Fisher, did you have a two-hander?     You will have time to think about the issues  Governor   Warsh   President Lacker              November 3–4, 2009 41 of 201  Well, it seems as though more tools are better than fewer   tools   Vice Chairman     President Plosser   The discount rate is higher than the term deposit rate   Yes We will just have to make sure that all of the pricing   works So, for example, there could be a prepayment penalty or something to take out the   deposits Governor Duke   I’m sorry  Vice Chairman, did you have something?   President Lockhart     November 3–4, 2009 47 of 201  I agree  But I feel reasonably comfortable  We think the   interest on excess reserves could almost probably do the job by itself because, even if there is   some gap, it is hard to imagine that, if you raised the interest rate on reserves high enough, it   wouldn’t bring up money market rates along with it            November 3–4, 2009 49 of 201  The ability to drain reserves, sort of a belt-and-suspenders thing, is a second dimension of   tightening And if you look at Brian’s sequence of exit statements, the first statement of actual   tightening combines an increase in the interest rate on excess reserves with a $200 billion drain   or something like that  And I am actually, I would say, moderately encouraged by what we have   been hearing  The staff has been extremely effective in getting these things up so that they can   operate at large scale by the end of the year or early next year  So I think we are in pretty good   shape   Now, of course, we are in a new world, but I think we are in a pretty good shape  It   would be good to give more clarity to the markets, but my own sense is that what we want to do   is to state policy in terms of our tools  You know, the federal funds rate target is not going to be   particularly informative  What we are probably going to want to do the first time that we tighten   is to say that we have agreed to do this to the interest rate on excess reserves, to do this to the   primary credit rate, and to drain x hundred billion dollars of reserves  And we can see what that   does, and we can fine-tune it I think that, clearly, we have the ability to tighten policy  But   what is not firmly complete is a sharp correspondence between our actions and money market   rates Obviously we know the direction, but we need to get some experience with that  Then, I   think the market is maybe a little overfixated on the question of sequencing and so on  When we   have more control of the timing and more understanding of these tools, it would probably pay us,   in a speech or some other context, to lay out more clearly both what the sequencing would be   and what the regime is going to be  I mean, how are we going to express tightening and so on?   But in terms of the fundamental ability to tighten policy, nothing I am hearing makes me think   that we don’t have that capacity   Thank you  President Rosengren   The North American location is hard to change  [Laughter]   President Yellen, you had a two-hander?   The four big ones clearly have far bigger banking sectors   than any other countries in the world  President Bullard   I have two-handers from Presidents Plosser and Lockhart   President Lockhart   President Lockhart, in one of my  previous comments to you   about our ability to tighten, I should have mentioned this  The backup to all of that is the Lacker   strategy, of course, of selling the assets, which we can always do if necessary  Anyone else?    I’m  just saying in terms of having some assurance that we can   respond if necessary  Okay  Thank you for very useful input  We will try to get something to you   to get more comments shortly We do need to quickly ratify domestic open market operations    Could I have a motion?    Any objection?  Okay Coffee is ready  Why don’t we take   about fifteen minutes for coffee   [Coffee break]   Okay Why don’t we recommence  Next on the agenda is the   economic situation  Let me turn it over to Dave Stockton to begin the presentation   Thank you very much  Questions for our colleagues?  It must   be a very good briefing     I’m detecting a theme here  Okay  Then we’re ready to begin   our go-round President Lockhart, you’re lead-off hitter    Thank you  President Plosser   Hit to the right side  [Laughter]   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you  President Rosengren   Thank you President Fisher        November 3–4, 2009 76 of 201  Thank you President Lacker   Thank you President Evans   Thank you  President Yellen   Yes   Okay Thank you We are halfway through our go-round   It is 545  Maybe this is a good time to adjourn for today  We will start tomorrow at 900 am   There is a reception up in the cafeteria, followed by dinner   [Meeting recessed]           November 3–4, 2009 89 of 201  November 4, 2009—Morning Session   Good morning, everyone  Let me just start with a few   items before we go into the rest of the go-round  Just, first, one data point The ADP   employment number this morning was minus 203,000, which the stock market viewed as a   decent number  We have a small correction from yesterday’s presentation  Brian   With your indulgence, also, as I said yesterday, we want to   inquire to get the views of all members on some of the issues that were raised in the   presentations yesterday But I think there are a few noncontroversial items, and maybe we can   just very quickly see if everybody is okay with them and just simplify the process  So let me just   try to get a little feedback quickly   The most number of issues were raised about the swap lines, and I think we need to have   a full memorandum to you on those issues  Obviously, there were questions both about how to   define the line, how to deal with the North American counterparties, and so on  So we will send   you a memo on this and ask for a thoughtful response  If there is no objection, though, I think   the staff would appreciate it if they could continue their informal nonbinding talks with the four   major central banks  In any case, this is part of the process of winding down the existing lines    If there is no objection Okay  That is the swap lines           November 3–4, 2009 90 of 201  On the material relating to various lending programs, we mentioned that we plan to   consider shortening the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 28 days  That would be   announced soon and presumably be effective after year-end  I didn’t hear any commentary on   that Was anyone concerned about that?  Seeing none—though if you do have any comments, by   all means let us know in the next week or so   The other point that was raised was that the staff wanted input on publishing a Federal   Register notice on the term deposits, which would ask for input on how to structure those term   deposits Of course, again, this is nonbinding It is just for information  I propose that we   would circulate the proposed language to the Committee and ask for any feedback on that  But   we will move ahead with developing a notice and then circulating that for any concerns   Okay Finally, on the other issues relating to the reverse repos and so on—the staff   suggested prioritizing reverse repos and term deposits and putting RCAs, the collateralized   accounts, on hold for the time being  I didn’t hear any objection to that  Are there any concerns   about that?  Let me say for myself that putting it on hold doesn’t mean killing it  I think we   ought to maintain all of our options  The RCAs are meant to address a specific issue that we had   earlier, which was the GSEs and the problems that their excess liquidity might cause for us in   managing the short-term interest rate  But this is just a prioritization for the short term  Any   concerns?     Okay And on the reverse repos, there was some discussion of who would be the   counterparties I think what we heard from this were a couple of things  First, in order to get   this going soon, we should probably prioritize the high-volume counterparties as the first step    But, second, we should plan to include a broader set of counterparties, and we should be   developing criteria for doing that  Governor Warsh mentioned using the private sector as one                 November 3–4, 2009 91 of 201  particular possibility that we should explore Assuming that we are going to go forward with this   today, which I believe we want to, we would want to continue our testing process  I promised   yesterday that we wouldn’t make final decisions, so if anybody is uncomfortable with it or would   just like to have more time, please say so  Are those things okay?   Yes   I think that they would be a high priority  Those are the   major sources of funding  But I guess the question would be, Do we go first to the Fidelitys and   so on?  At some point we should try to make sure that any money market mutual fund with an   interest should have access either directly or indirectly  But in the interest of monetary policy   implementation in the very short run, we would start with the larger ones   Okay   All right  Yes, President Lacker   Absolutely not  This is just making sure we have a working   tool   Is everybody okay? All right  Thank you very much  We   are ready to continue where we left off on the go-round  President Hoenig, I think that you are   next   Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you  President Kocherlakota   Thank you I’m sorry, I don’t want to put you on the spot,   but I was just interested in your view on the relationship of government debt to inflation  Do you   take the fiscal theory of the price level as related here? Monetization? Excess demand?  I was   just curious   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you  Governor Kohn   Thank you Governor Warsh     Thank you  Governor Duke   Governor Tarullo   Thank you very much, and thanks to everybody for their   valuable input  Let me make an effort to summarize the discussions I heard at least, and then I’ll   make a few additional comments   Participants noted the recent, more-positive economic data  After four quarters of decline,   we have seen positive economic growth again, as had been anticipated, and moderate GDP growth   should continue in the fourth quarter  Factors contributing to growth in the near term include the   ongoing slowdown in the pace of inventory decumulation, fiscal actions to support autos and   housing, and some signs of life in consumer spending   However, as many one-off factors affected final demand in the third quarter, it is difficult to   separate the signal from the noise, leaving considerable uncertainty about the strength of the   recovery going forward  Most participants see the economy growing at a moderate pace in 2010, a   pace that would imply a very slow decline in unemployment  Risks to the economic growth outlook   are roughly balanced, with conditions in financial and labor markets posing threats to growth but the   possibility of a stronger consumer and strong productivity growth creating upside risks  Concerns   remain about the dependence of the economy on government support and the ability of the economy   to deliver a self-sustaining recovery without that support  One participant characterized the likely   recovery as “a long slog,” and one thought of it as a checkmark, which we will continue to evaluate    The emerging global recovery, especially in emerging markets, is supportive of economic growth   here   With respect to inflation, the risks seem roughly balanced as well, with some arguing that   slack will lead to declining core inflation and others noting that rising energy prices, policy   expectations, and inflation expectations that may not be as anchored as we would like are upside   risks Some saw slower inflation in the near term but upside risks further out  Consumer spending                       November 3–4, 2009 115 of 201  is modestly stronger, even outside autos  However, weak labor markets, the poor condition of   household balance sheets, declines in net worth, and tight credit are drags on sentiment and the   ability to spend Labor income is flat as hours decline and wage growth slows  How the saving rate   will evolve is difficult to anticipate, but further declines in the saving rate from here do seem   unlikely   Housing activity has improved, and house prices have risen modestly in some areas    Inventories of housing are down, and we may have seen a bottom  However, factors such as the   first-time homebuyer tax credit and Fed MBS purchases may be driving that trend to some extent    Builders, especially smaller builders, remain pessimistic   Business owners generally remain quite cautious and continue to focus on cost savings in   the absence of significant top-line revenue growth  The resulting productivity gains have been   impressive  However, there is substantial reluctance to hire or invest, except possibly abroad, due to   uncertainty about prospective demand and about Washington’s grape-shot approach to policy    Continued strengths in parts of the global economy, notably Asia, have helped to increase exports   supporting manufacturing, though net exports are not likely to be a large net contributor to GDP   growth overall   The labor market remains very weak  As noted, firms continue to look aggressively for cost   savings and see little need to hire even if demand expands  Small businesses, which are normally a   source of employment growth in recoveries, have been hit especially hard by the credit crunch and   weak demand UI claims are falling, and job cuts are moderating, but both are still high  The   employment-to-population ratio is at a long-term low  Firms will be able to increase hours to meet   increases in demand, delaying the need to add to payrolls  We must take account of the possibility   of a jobless recovery                          November 3–4, 2009 116 of 201  Financial markets have shown signs of healing, with asset prices much higher than earlier   this year and credit spreads much narrower  More recently, though, the markets have moved   sideways reflecting uncertainty about recovery, and continued improvement is not guaranteed    Large firms with access to public markets are having little difficulty obtaining credit  They also   hold plenty of cash  Smaller, bank-dependent firms are having a more difficult time, however  The   situation for banks is mixed  Rising nonperforming loans will be a continuing source of stress, but   there is some optimism about future credit losses, and profits and liquidity are both improved    Poorly rated banks, in particular, are not lending but are trying to improve their capital ratios by   shedding assets, and many participants cited commercial real estate as a major concern both for the   banking system and for the broader economy  Banks are also affected by policy uncertainty both   here and abroad   Finally, on inflation, core inflation and median inflation are slowing, but headline inflation   will be increased somewhat by price increases in energy, commodities, and imports  Wages and   unit labor costs have slowed, the latter reflecting sharp gains in productivity  Firms report that they   have no pricing power  Participants continue to disagree on the appropriate weights to place on   resource slack, inflation expectations, and other factors in forecasting inflation  Substantial resource   slack and slow wage growth may tend to push inflation down; on the other hand, inflation   expectations may be less anchored and more disperse than they appear and could be vulnerable to   the public’s concerns about the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions that have been   taken or to disorderly declines in the dollar   Participants discussed the measurement of market expectations of monetary policy; the need   to communicate exit plans and to exit at the appropriate time; the need to allow asset purchases and   other aspects of policy to respond on the margin to changes in economic outlook; and the                                 November 3–4, 2009 117 of 201  determinants of inflation expectations and potential output  That’s my summary  Comments,   reactions?   All right Let me make just a few additional comments here  As everyone has noted, the   intermeeting data were modestly encouraging  We saw third-quarter economic growth, and we   expect the fourth quarter to be positive as well  Markets have become somewhat more uncertain,   though, about the durability of the recovery and also perhaps about how this Committee will   proceed   The issue remains for everyone, I think, what will happen after the end of this year—how   the recovery will look in 2010  At the last meeting I described my outlook as muddled, and I   remain firmly in that position  [Laughter]  If pressed, however, I would acknowledge that I feel   somewhat more concerned about 2010, although I did make my balance of risks balanced  As many   of you have noted, the behavior of the consumer is very important, and I guess the good news, at   least from a cyclical point of view, is that the Greenbook seems right so far that we’re not seeing a   major increase in the household saving rate that would be, at least in the short term, a problem for   the recovery   However, I do think there are some significant downside risks to that scenario, particularly   in the labor market and the banking sector, and let me just talk about those a bit  As Governor Kohn   mentioned, the saving rate actually is quite low, given many of the fundamentals, and it seems very   possible that it may rise if the labor market remains as weak as it appears  I would like to discuss   the labor market briefly because I think we really need to focus on the labor market as one of the   key elements of the recovery   My sense is that, even given the bad headline numbers in terms of unemployment and   payrolls, the labor market may be even weaker than it looks  For example, insured unemployment                           November 3–4, 2009 118 of 201  on regular state programs, the UI claims we check every Thursday morning, have peaked and come   down significantly, and the outstanding stock of people on unemployment insurance is down to   about six million  But when you look at UI claims plus regular UI plus extended and emergency   benefits, the number is ten million and has not peaked  It is still very, very high  Recently the BLS   announced benchmark revisions that will lower the level of employment by another 850,000 jobs    So joblessness, employment-to-population ratios, and so on are extraordinarily high  Moreover, that   joblessness has a very large component of permanent separations and long-term unemployment  As   we’ve seen in the last two recessions—looking at JOLTS data, for example—hiring rates are   particularly weak, particularly contributing to the unemployment rate and the duration of   unemployment, which is not encouraging as we look forward to the possibility of a jobless   recovery   Just note that different demographic groups are reacting differently to the very poor state of   the labor market  Prime age males who have high attachment to the labor force have not dropped   out of the labor force, but their unemployment rate has jumped much more significantly than that   for the labor force as a whole  On the other hand, younger workers under age 24 have been   dropping out of the labor force, and participation rates there are considerably down  So my first   general point is just that the weakness is perhaps even worse and more pervasive than the   unemployment rate may suggest   Second, looking forward, there’s not much indication of increased hiring, at least in the   medium term  You can see that in anecdotes we heard today  You can see that in surveys, and I   think there is the point that others have made, but is worth mentioning again, that, despite all the   cuts, despite the cost savings, firms have quite a bit of capacity to increase labor input without   adding full-time workers, including calling back workers on furlough, adding hours to part-time                    November 3–4, 2009 119 of 201  workers, increasing work weeks and adding overtime, and adding temporary workers, which adds to   the number of people employed but not obviously to longer-term employment   A third point is that jobless recoveries almost by definition involve high productivity growth   rates, and all of the indications so far suggest that, in fact, employers are finding those cost savings,   which of course is good for the long term but again is a negative for future employment   Then the fourth and final point I want to make about the labor market is that we need to   think about the interaction between the labor market and the credit markets  There is a tremendous   contraction going on in bank lending  Nominal C&I bank loans outstanding are down about   12 percent, or $200 billion, over the past three quarters, and although we have seen some   improvement in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, we still have net tightening in that area    As people have noted, for large firms the bank lending contraction may not be such a big problem    They have access to the public markets, and they have lots of cash  But for small firms, I think it is   a serious problem, as many of you have heard from your constituents  Not only are bank lending   and bank credit lines for small firms highly restricted, but in addition, you have the greatly reduced   availability of home equity lines and credit card lines, which are important for very small businesses   as a source of credit  As a result of this, the small business hiring plans as reported by the NFIB are   sharply below the troughs of 1990 and 2001 and have not improved at all from the worst levels of   earlier this year   Now, there is an ongoing debate on the importance of small business in job creation  There   are some exaggerated numbers out there that are often used in political discourse  The net creation   of jobs by small businesses is much less than the gross creation because of the rapid turnover of   small firms, but that’s a steady-state observation  In the growth phase of the business cycle, because   small businesses are so cyclical, they actually contribute substantially, perhaps 40 percent or more,                  November 3–4, 2009 120 of 201  to job additions during a recovery  So the credit problems that they face could be an important   problem directly affecting employment   Let me just say a couple of words about the credit crunch and banks  I was encouraged to   hear Governor Duke’s views on banks  There are some encouraging signs in terms of profitability,   liquidity, and credit quality  Nevertheless, as I mentioned before, the actual lending, the willingness   to lend, and loans outstanding are quite constrained, and we’re seeing again very sharp declines in   outstanding credit  An interesting question is whether or not the declines in credit in the banking   sector are the normal response to a deep recession or whether there is something additional going   on I may have remarked on this before, but to try to test that we’ve done vector auto regression   analysis that includes bank credit, nominal GDP, and terms and conditions of lending, indicators   from the SLOOS  And what you find, interestingly, is that the decline in lending can be explained   by the combination of slow growth and tighter conditions  So in that respect it is normal, but the   tightening of conditions itself is far greater than would be expected historically given the decline in   the economy  So what seems to be happening is that firms are making loans, but they are doing so   under unusually tight terms and conditions, even conditional on the depth of the recession  Now,   there are two possible explanations for that  One is that credit quality is worse than usual even   given the state of the recession  The other is that banks’ own problems, capital and so on, are   restricting credit In either case, that is concerning and suggests that the financial headwinds will be   there as we go forward   Again, I do think that both the labor market and the credit markets are going to be very   formidable issues going forward and make a moderate-to-slow recovery more likely than a rapid   recovery That being said, I just want to say for the record that there are some upside risks to                               November 3–4, 2009 121 of 201  economic growth as well, and they’re a little harder to identify almost by necessity since one never   knows where growth is going to come from, but these are important considerations   I want to talk once more, as I did last time, a bit about implications of low interest rates  I   think most would agree that there is a good policy case from the economy’s point of view for   maintaining low rates But I think we also would all agree that we need to continue to monitor any   possible side effects from low rate policies that might be concerning  One set of issues is   speculative excesses, and I will say that we are trying here at the Board—and I hope you will at the   Reserve Banks as well—to monitor even more closely than usual the state of asset prices as they   evolve  My sense is—and Brian Sack talked about this yesterday—that US asset prices, so far at   least, do not show any strong evidence of mispricing or asset bubbles  In particularly, equity   premiums are still above normal, so stock prices don’t seem unusually high Bond spreads seem   reasonable given expected default rates in the state of the economy, and so on  So in the United   States so far—though as I say, we need to continue to monitor it—I don’t see that as being a near-  term concern, although there is obviously a lot chatter about it, and that is one reason I think we   need to be particularly attentive     There is more concern about what is happening in Asia, where some markets seem to be   overheated  I just would make a point there, which is that the link between those asset prices in   Asia and our monetary policy may be weaker than is sometimes believed  There is a view espoused   in some quarters that, because of the exchange rate management in Asia, Federal Reserve policies   are essentially just imported into the Asian economies and, therefore, are a source of overheating in   those economies  A recent paper here at the Board by Erceg, Guerrieri, and Kamin looks at that   from a number of different perspectives  One of the interesting points that they make is that, if you   look at the monetary policy indicators—short-term interest rates, for example—in Asian countries,                                    November 3–4, 2009 122 of 201  including China, and compare them with the US federal funds rate, you see quite a bit of   divergence because of capital controls and because of imperfect substitutability among assets  Asia   does seem to have some ability to conduct independent monetary policy In that respect they   obviously need to conduct policy that’s appropriate for their region  In addition, they have various   kinds of quantitative controls on credit and on prices, and they also have fiscal policy  So I think we   need to pay attention to the Asian situation, but I would caution us not to overstate the responsibility   of our policy for those excesses   A second area that we need to pay attention to in terms of the side effects from the low   interest rates is the behavior of the dollar  There were some anxious moments in the markets during   the intermeeting period, but if you look at the pattern of the dollar over the last year or so, it seems   to have been a fairly predictable and orderly evolution  What we have seen, of course, is a rise in   the dollar associated with safe haven demand and then an unwinding of that safe haven demand as   the financial markets have improved  Indeed, the current value of the dollar is about the same as it   was before the crisis, the same as in June 2007, and nominal and real broad indexes are either equal   to or higher than what they were in 1995  So we see that there is not a really large secular   movement in the dollar  Moreover, a lower dollar may be necessary—we don’t know for sure—to   address the current account situation  The other relevant fact, I think, is that so far we don’t see any   evidence of a shift away from the dollar in reserve holdings  But all that said, an orderly   depreciation is orderly until it’s not orderly, and then at that point there may be a change, and we   may be concerned  I think an unstable dollar does have costs both for us and for the international   monetary system, and obviously it also has implications for commodity prices, inflation   expectations, and so on, which could force our hand or hamper our policy in ways that we would                 November 3–4, 2009 123 of 201  otherwise not want to go  So, again, I think that this is an area that we need to continue to pay   attention to   I’ve talked about inflation before  I’m not going to reiterate  I think we’re all waiting for   Jeff Fuhrer and the presentation in December to finally resolve all of the differences on the   Committee about the dynamics of inflation  [Laughter]  So I’ll leave my views until that time   I will just once again close by saying that one of the important elements—I think everyone   agrees—is to demonstrate that we can and will exit at the appropriate time from our extraordinary   policies  The presentation yesterday about the progress being made on reverse repos and term   deposits, the winding down of our liquidity programs, and so on shows that we are in fact, more so   than some other countries, moving back toward a more normalized type of policy, which I think,   when we are able to do that, would be very good news  So let me stop there Any questions or   comments?  President Plosser     Yes, that’s a very important point  I guess I would say that,   given that C&I loans have fallen much more sharply than other categories, it would seem unlikely   that write-downs would be the major source of that  It is part of it, certainly  But the other factor   that affects those numbers is the ability of banks to make loans and then to securitize them  And                                                                  3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   November 3–4, 2009 124 of 201  that has actually declined, which means that there is more holding of loans on their balance sheets    So that to some extent goes in the other direction, but your point is well taken  Other questions?   President Lacker   Well, this was just a simple VAR that I asked for, but   certainly we can send it to you   Any other comments, questions?  All right  Brian, let me turn   to you for introducing the policy round     Thank you, Brian I have actually a quick question  In the   final part of the exit, you have a federal funds rate target, which changes, and then you support   that with an increase in interest rate on reserves, and so on  Are we comfortable with that?  The   alternative would be, say, to tighten monetary conditions—“The Federal Reserve is taking the   following actions”—and those would include the interest rate on reserves, sterilization of some      November 3–4, 2009 129 of 201  reserves, and so on You don’t have to answer the question now exactly, but it seems to me that   an alternative, rather than targeting the federal funds rate, might be simply to state the actions   that we would be taking, which we know we can control, and therefore reduce that slippage   Other questions?  President Lockhart   President Plosser        November 3–4, 2009 130 of 201  President Evans   He used the language  I assure you that someone will   notice it President Lacker   This is the Bellman principle, President Lacker  The   Bellman principle is that, if the situation looks the same, you do the same  Right?  If the   economy looks six months from now exactly as it looks today—   I think it conveys a sense also of not being an automatic   mechanical trigger—that there is still going to be judgment involved in looking at all of these   issues   I don’t think it actually means that  Remember what we   said originally We made a forecast of policy that we said economic conditions would likely        November 3–4, 2009 133 of 201  justify It wasn’t an unconditional forecast  It was a conditional forecast that we thought the   economy was going to evolve in such a way that would justify low rates of interest, and this is a   description of some of the things that we would be looking at that we expect to happen and that   would, therefore, tend to keep us at the low rate   We can go back to the old language if you want, but the   purpose of it is to try to provide more explicit information about what we are going to be looking   at   And I think the presumption would be, if there were a sharp   change in inflation expectations, for example, that we would respond to it   I think it would be read as saying that, if these conditions   fail to hold, we would have to respond to it or at least seriously consider responding to it   Other questions for Brian?  President Pianalto         November 3–4, 2009 134 of 201  Any other questions for Brian?  Okay The coffee is ready   And in order not to interrupt the policy go-round, why don’t we take a break and restart at 1100    Thank you   [Coffee break]   Okay Why don’t we recommence with the policy go-  round President Plosser, lead-off hitter   Thank you President Plosser, just a couple of factual   matters  I think we do anticipate that the Treasury will raise its balances again  But if they   don’t, we’ll have to address that  Second, I think a lot of people around the table agree with you   about inflation targets, but if they are to be credible and democratically legitimate, they need to   have at least some political support  And I think this moment is probably not the optimal point    Okay President Rosengren   I understand   Thank you President Lacker   Thank you, President Lacker  President Yellen   Thank you  Governor Kohn                                  November 3–4, 2009 148 of 201  Thank you President Bullard   Thank you  President Hoenig   Thank you  President Lockhart   President Fisher     Thank you  President Evans   Okay Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you President Kocherlakota   Thank you  Just a couple of comments  Saying that reserves   facilitate deposits implies that the banks have to lend the money to the consumers   So they are at the moment not lending, as you know, and if   they were to lend, it would show up in inflation but also show up in aggregate demand  So   presumably both of our objectives would be moving  Thus it would be appropriate for us to tighten   through interest rates and through other mechanisms in that case   Several people have mentioned asset sales, and I thought President Bullard’s point about last   in–first out was an interesting way to think about it  I want to point out just the practical point that   we are committed now to purchasing through the end of the first quarter  So to do that, you’re   essentially putting off any interest rate response until late next year  That may be the right thing to   do, but it may be inconvenient to do it, given that our commitment to purchase goes into next year    Governor Warsh   Thank you  Governor Duke   Thank you Governor Tarullo   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you very much  Well, most people supported the   actions in alternative B That is my preference as well  Let me talk about some of the issues of   language that were raised and see if we have any desire to make changes  I don’t think anybody   at all mentioned the first paragraph, which is a first  So perhaps forget that for now  On the   second paragraph, there were a couple of suggestions to substitute the language in paragraph 2 of     November 3–4, 2009 169 of 201  alternative C I think it would be risky to do that  I would note one logical issue, which is that   the C (2) language suggests a somewhat different conditionality, which is that policy will be   focused on price stability, which it certainly will be, but it would be kind of strange to introduce   conditionality in two places with a somewhat different mix of factors  But I recognize that issue   So now let’s go to the third paragraph, where the main concerns are  To avoid for a   moment the most important sentence, one or two folks had concerns about being explicit about   the $175 billion The Vice Chairman suggested that we have to do it in order to be transparent    Could I maybe ask Brian Madigan and Brian Sack or anyone else if they have any thoughts on   the market impact of this statement?     The concern—we tried to respond to President Yellen’s   suggestion—was to make sure that nobody confused this with an intentional tightening  And I   guess I would like reassurance that we have explained what we are doing here  Right?   Okay Vice Chairman        November 3–4, 2009 170 of 201  All right  So let’s go to the main sentence, which is about   the extended period First, a couple of comments  I do think we need to maintain the “extended   period” for now I think most of the people around the table agreed with that, given the macro   outlook   I am sensitive to President Fisher’s comments about the carry trade  In fact, I tried to   underline those issues when I gave my own remarks  President Fisher, you had asked Nathan   yesterday about this issue, and he pointed out that there is a good carry trade and a bad carry   trade The good carry trade is the appropriate response of asset prices to low interest rates   essentially, and that shows up in exchange rates  It shows up in other asset prices as well  The   bad carry trade is when people behave as if they know for sure that interest rates will be low   forever and exchange rates will be stable, or at least they go in a one-way direction  I have   always had difficulty with the latter because it is not an arbitrage  It is an irrational response    But all I can say is that this is something we really do need to pay attention to  I agree with that,   and I mentioned this in my remarks  So it is a concern, but we also have our macroeconomic   concerns President Fisher              November 3–4, 2009 171 of 201  I think there are various language things that policymakers,   including myself, President Trichet, and others, could use to address this to some extent more   credibly Of course, we don’t want to talk about this here—it is a bad word—but there is always   intervention, which seems to have an effect   Okay So on the sentence—Governor Tarullo, I think, raised the possibility of delaying   the conditionality I thought most people were in favor of taking this step  Are there others who   are concerned?  I recognize that any change is risky, but we can’t avoid the risk  At some point   we have to move in a direction  Maybe this is not the right moment  But is there anyone else   who is concerned?   President Lockhart, that’s right  Yes, sorry        November 3–4, 2009 172 of 201  All right So we have some  I think, though, that the   majority are still—I think there is a bit of risk, but—   That’s right That was part of the way I was thinking about   this   The reason is, essentially, that what we have now is   interpreted as a sort of an unconditional commitment to—even though we say “economic   conditions will warrant”— it seems like an unconditional commitment to hold rates for six   months or more, as the Vice Chairman was saying  I think doing this helps to emphasize the   conditionality of our commitment, so that we would be able to change if economic conditions   changed notably And although there may be some adverse reaction because people think this is   a step to exit—I think that’s a risk—it will also be an increase in clarity and transparency  Yes,   Governor Tarullo   President Evans   Well, I think the risk is that the markets will move forward   the tightening path, which I don’t think is consistent with expectations in most of the Committee   The counterargument is that we can only put this off  All   right, recognizing that there is some risk, we will have to see what happens   The last question I want to ask was raised by President Lacker first, and I think others,   which is the phrase “low rates of resource utilization”  Now, ironically, the reason that I was in   favor of dropping “very” was in deference to President Lacker  [Laughter]  I thought that it   would be a concern that we could measure output gaps, distinguish between the output gaps that   are very large and just ordinarily large  In that spirit, I was concerned that adding “very” would           November 3–4, 2009 174 of 201  then create a cottage industry, figuring out the dividing line between “very” and “not so very”    That was part of my concern  I can be persuaded if the Committee approves that   But the other possibility I would just raise would be that this sentence very much echoes   the terms in paragraph 2  Paragraph 2 already refers to longer-term inflation expectations being   stable and inflation being subdued  And I think it actually elaborates because it talks about   longer-term inflation expectations and about forward-looking inflation projections  So in that   spirit, it wouldn’t be particularly elegant, but we could replace “low rates of resource utilization”   with “substantial resource slack,” if that was preferred  Someone liked that   You like “low rates of utilization”   Okay All right   President Lacker   Right   I think it makes it a stronger statement because it could   mean that, even if inflation is low and expectations of inflation are low, that if unemployment   falls below 8 percent, then we’ll start to move, which might be possible but I wouldn’t want to   commit to that   Well, I think that is how it would be interpreted  Okay I   will try both possible options  If there is not majority support, we will just stay with what we   have So, first, I didn’t see much support for “substantial resource slack”  Was there anybody?   Nobody wants to support that   Groundswell is supported  All right We’ll be democratic    What is the view on “very”?  Who favors “very”? Anyone else?  All right So I think we have   about as much of a consensus as we can get  Well, having gone through this at some length, we   have ended up with the status quo [Laughter]  Any further comments or thoughts on B?   All right  Again, I appreciate the commentary  I think the points that were raised in the   policy round, considering not only today’s statement but also about how we will exit and how we           November 3–4, 2009 176 of 201  will communicate it, are very important  And, of course, the staff will continue to work on both   the policy regime and the communication associated with it   If you will call the roll, please, Matt   Okay Thank you very much  I remind you that the revised   projections, if you want to make revisions based on information known as of today, are due by   500 pm tomorrow  And I remind you that the next meeting is December 15 and 16  After the   meeting is adjourned, there will be lunch available in the Anteroom, and Linda  Robertson will   give us an update on congressional developments  Meeting adjourned   END OF MEETING      "
8871,2009-12-15,BERNANKE," Good afternoon, everybody   PARTICIPANTS Good afternoon   We need a motion to close our meeting   Thank you Our meeting today and tomorrow follows the   basic sequence we’ve been having recently, but with an important addition, which is that we   have a staff presentation on inflation dynamics  We need about two hours for that presentation, I   understand, and we’ve thought about it and decided to put it at the end of the meeting so we   would have plenty of time to complete our policy decision  But I hope that people will pay   attention to the time and make sure we have enough time tomorrow to give appropriate attention   to the presentation   In that spirit, why don’t we start directly?  Mr Sack    Thank you Brian, you’re right that we need to be thinking   as a Committee about the sequencing of how we will remove the policy accommodation  My   thought on this had been that we needed to wait until we had a somewhat clearer idea of what the   timing of the availability of the tools was going to be  I’m asking Brian Sack and Brian           December 15–16, 2009 11 of 247  Madigan, whom I have not warned about this question—do you think that January might be a   time when we could at least begin a discussion on this at the Committee level?  Will we have   enough information about our tools?   Okay So no later than January we will put this on the   agenda for discussion   Yes   The point is well taken  I guess I would say that, given all   of these important decisions, maybe we should all try to minimize excessive speculation in   public about this subject until we as a Committee have come to more clarity on sequencing  But   these are issues we need to address very soon So thank you for that   On the issue of reinvestment, let me just add this one other option I can think of, which is   to reinvest in bills This gives you maximum flexibility if you want to drain quickly   Are you looking for some kind of Committee guidance at this point, or are you going to   come back to us?   Well, again, use of bills could smooth out the path if you   thought the redemptions were too quick, for example   If anyone has concerns about letting things mature as an   interim strategy, you should mention that in our discussion   Before I open the floor for questions for Brian, the Vice Chairman had an introduction he   would like to make   Welcome  Okay Questions or comments for Brian?   Governor Tarullo   President Rosengren   Governor Kohn                 December 15–16, 2009 15 of 247  President Evans   Vice Chairman   President Lockhart   President Fisher   President Plosser   A lot depends on where you think our policy is working  If   it’s working on the asset side and the amount of MBS we buy is what really matters, then the   amount of excess reserves is just kind of a residual, and it’s not doing much independently   But there are a number of different ways to think about it   President Hoenig   Sure I was just responding to the comment myself, but   there are two separate questions  One question is how accommodative policy should be, and that   has to do with the outlook for the economy and inflation and so on  But there are also what you           December 15–16, 2009 23 of 247  might call the technical questions, and, in particular, given that we want to unwind   accommodation, what would be the appropriate sequencing in terms of the tools that we use    Should we, for example, drain reserves first and then raise the interest rate on reserves?  If we   drain reserves first, which particular tools should we use and in what combination?  President   Plosser pointed out that that’s also linked to the question of what our official target is  We may   simply want to announce that we are raising the interest rate on excess reserves and make no   comment whatsoever about the federal funds rate, because the control of the federal funds rate   may be loose and may not be that meaningful an interest rate, given the nature of that market   now   So again, I want to separate the question of when and how quickly we should be   removing accommodation from a more technical set of questions about whether there is a   preferred sequencing or combination that is in some sense independent of the policy decision   itself There may not be  It could be that those two things are so intertwined that we just have to   decide on them jointly, but it is certainly worth the discussion   No I’m sorry I didn’t mean to prohibit discussion, but   what I was saying is that, to the extent that there is a technical question, it would be useful to   have some staff input and a chance to think about it in advance   President Lacker   President Pianalto   President Kocherlakota   We will be hearing about the TDF in just a moment    President Bullard   Other questions?  President Lacker   One would think that clarity about what you’re going to   do—speed or price or whatever—would help        December 15–16, 2009 29 of 247  President Rosengren   President Plosser   My understanding was that tentatively, for the moment, we   were just going to let things run off But we were just introducing this as an issue we need to be   aware of   Okay Vice Chairman                 December 15–16, 2009 30 of 247  Great Okay?  If there are no other questions, let me turn to   Jim Clouse and Bill Nelson for a brief report on some facilities  Jim    Are there questions for Jim or Bill?  President Lacker   We’ll need a recommendation   It’s been a while   President Bullard   Go ahead  We don’t have this unstructured period, so   consider this to be your time to comment    Well, you can’t lend the 30-day money in the overnight   federal funds market   President Lacker   For the reasons that you just described, I think it will be   helpful in managing overnight interest rates  Of course, there’s always the question about the   linkages between that and broad financial conditions, but our typical target is the overnight rate   Other questions?  President Rosengren   President Lacker   We’ll coordinate  And we don’t need recommendations   from all the Banks, of course, but just one  We understand the need to coordinate this in a way   that is not going to create problems  Thank you President Pianalto   Well put  President Plosser   There’s always some primary credit rate spread that’s big   enough that you can slip anything you want to underneath it   This is great monetary economics  [Laughter] You can   have such a great graduate class   Other questions?  President Kocherlakota   I don’t want to interject, but I think there are two ways to   look at it One is just to say the IOER rate, which is an overnight rate, is the basic tool, and we   just have all of these fine-tuning instruments to make sure we don’t have too much slippage   between the market rate—the federal funds rate—and the IOER rate  That’s one approach, and I   think that’s the simplest approach  The other way, though, is to say, well, we really have tools   that can affect things at different parts of the term structure or different types of instruments, and   we can play with that if we want That gets more complicated and it makes policymaking more   complicated  So I don’t know how far we want to go in that direction, but I think there are at   least two ways to look at that   It will   Market operations are swaps of assets for assets  We’re   swapping reserves for deposits President Evans   Yes We left that old regime, of course, when we moved   the discount rate above the funds rate   Any other questions?  [No response]  I could press on just   a bit more  Our friend Dave Stockton is a victim of H1N1 flu virus  David Wilcox has stepped   into the breach, so let me turn it over to David   Thanks Are there questions for our colleagues?

Thank you   [Meeting recessed]                                                                  2 The materials used by Mr Wascher are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 15–16, 2009 92 of 247  December 16, 2009—Morning Session   Meeting attendees greeted Chairman Bernanke with a standing ovation when he entered the   meeting room in recognition of his being named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year 2009   The power of the media [Laughter] Thank you very   much   We want to start today with Bill Wascher, who will give us   some updates on data   Thank you Any questions for Bill?  [No response] Okay   I did have overnight to put together my pithy summary, so let me just try to summarize what I   thought was a good discussion yesterday   Economic indicators since the last meeting were generally a bit more positive than   expected Participants cited the November labor report, retail sales, trade data, housing, and   financial developments as positive  Global economic growth is picking up, more so in emerging   markets than in advanced economies, some of which remain weak  However, although downside   risks to growth may be a bit smaller, most participants were not ready to revise their expectations   substantially for 2010 from previous projections of moderate growth and continued high   unemployment  Anecdotes repeatedly cited uncertainties on the part of business leaders about   both near-term and medium-term prospects, reflecting questions about the economy itself and a   range of government policies, including fiscal, climate, regulatory, and others  These   uncertainties, which are shared by the meeting participants, seem likely to retard new investment   and hiring for some time  Participants also debated whether private final demand will be   sustained as government supports are withdrawn  Housing provides an example  Although there   have been some significant improvements, these may not continue next year as the Fed stops   buying MBS, the GSEs reduce their portfolios and tighten terms, the first-time homebuyer tax   credit ends, and slow progress in mortgage modification fails to prevent another wave of   foreclosures and distressed sales  On the inflation front, price changes seem reasonably well           December 15–16, 2009 94 of 247  controlled, with some expecting further moderation, especially in core inflation, but others citing   possible medium-term risks     Looking at a bit more detail, recent data on consumer spending were encouraging, as   noted Income and saving this year were stronger than initially estimated  Household wealth is   increasing, and sentiment has recently improved some  Evidence on Christmas buying is mixed    Consumers appear to be aggressive in limiting ticket sizes and pursuing discounts  Households   were likely encouraged by somewhat better news about the labor market, but high   unemployment seems likely to cap growth in consumer confidence and spending   In the labor market, elements of good news besides reduced job loss included increased   hours, reduced unemployment claims, and more temporary hires  However, although job losses   have moderated, firms remain quite reluctant to hire, and conditions overall remain very weak    Extended high unemployment, which seems likely if growth is not much above trend, could   leave lasting scars on the labor force   As also noted, CEOs remain cautious  Large firms have good access to credit, but are   holding lots of cash rather than hiring and investing  Smaller bank-dependent firms find credit   much more difficult to obtain, although there was some difference of view as to whether these   constraints would prevent small firms from expanding when demand picks up  Productivity   gains have been significant, as firms have cut costs or looked to meet demand without adding   workers Certain segments are performing better, including some manufacturing businesses,   high tech, and agriculture, and shippers have seen an uptick in their business   Financial markets continue to improve, although the risk of relapse cannot be ignored    Some markets, such as securitization markets, are still not functioning well  Generally, asset   values do not seem out of line with fundamentals, although as investors have become less           December 15–16, 2009 95 of 247  cautious they may have also become less discriminating  Market sentiment has been strong   enough to overcome setbacks, like the Dubai episode, but this episode may be indicative of the   vulnerability of sovereign credits  Banks are raising capital and in some cases paying back the   TARP Bank credit, however, continues to contract, reflecting lack of demand, weak borrower   quality, the risky macro environment, and bank concerns about their own capital positions    Some banks complain about overzealous examiners  Banks are looking for credit losses to top   out in 2010, except in commercial real estate  Large and small banks have different portfolio   mixes, with small banks particularly vulnerable to the worsening CRE problem, and many are   still likely to fail  Small banks are also more likely to be lenders to small businesses   Inflation seems reasonably controlled  Core inflation seems to be moderating, though the   underlying trend is not entirely clear, not only because of some energy pass-through but also   some special factors, including an increase in the prices of nonmarket components  The median   CPI and trimmed mean PCE inflation are flat to down  Anecdotes suggest that firms have   limited ability to raise prices in most cases  Compensation figures were revised up, but wage   growth in general still appears quite moderate, and unit labor costs are further reduced by strong   productivity; that is, in terms of the models, marginal costs do not seem to be rising quickly    Inflation expectations are broadly stable, though inflation risk premiums increase the difficulty   of extracting these expectations from TIPS As has been the case, views around the table   differed on the size of the output gap and its relevance to inflation determination  Energy price   increases and declines in the dollar have recently reversed   Medium-term risks, other than the Fed’s balance sheet, include the US fiscal situation   and import costs  We discussed the structure of the Fed’s policy regime, including exit-  sequencing and the development and communication of a policy rule  That’s my overview of        December 15–16, 2009 96 of 247  what I heard Obviously, there’s diversity among the group  Are there any comments or   questions? [No response]   As always, it’s very difficult to add intelligent new and insightful ideas after all of you   have already spoken, but let me just say a couple things  First, like everybody else, I was   heartened by the intermeeting data, and I think I may have taken just a bit more signal than some   of you from it  In particular, even though the overall economic growth in the second half was   not much changed by the revised data, the contour was changed  The third quarter was weaker,   the fourth quarter looks to be relatively strong, perhaps 4 percent or more, and so there is a sense   of somewhat more momentum going into 2010   At the same time, we saw developments, particularly in the consumer sector, which are a   bit encouraging towards the view that, as inventory adjustments follow through and as other   temporary factors weaken, final demand will be able to pick up and continue the moderate   recovery that we anticipate in 2010 So, like most of you, I haven’t significantly revised my   modal forecast, but I do have somewhat more confidence that the momentum will be sustained   into Looking specifically at the consumer, a number of things were encouraging  I think the   simple fact that there was more demand for housing and autos is actually encouraging, not just in   terms of total spending dollars but also because the willingness of consumers to commit to   longer-term durable goods is in itself an indication of greater confidence in their own income and   the future of the economy  And, more generally, we did see improved attitudes as measured, for   example, with the Michigan survey  Although—let’s be careful—they’re still very low in   historical terms, and though the current conditions index improved considerably, the expected   conditions measure didn’t do very much  So we are seeing some improvement there, but, again,   we should be cautious                  December 15–16, 2009 97 of 247  On consumer fundamentals, we have seen the upgrade of income, which, as some have   noted, helps explain how you can consume more and save more at the same time—[laughter]—   which has been happening  And there are some positive developments, for example, in energy   prices, which will help real income; in inflation expectations, which help expected real income;   and in wealth On the latter, as we saw in the flow of funds data, about a third of the losses have   been reversed so far, so there is some continued improvement on that front  That’s all positive,   and it gives us more sense that the consumer will not fade as the handoff happens   On the labor market, I think we can find a few positive elements  We’ve noted a number   of things from the labor market report  I think, more generally, there are some indications that   the recovery will not be as “jobless” as it was in the last two recessions, given the depth of the   decline; therefore, there’s likely to be a tendency for jobs to come back, given that the   productivity gains we’ve seen are not sustainable and that there’s going to have to be some mean   reversion So, if you put together moderate growth, likely weaker productivity gains, some   strength in a few individual industries—manufacturing and others—the presumption is that we   will see some job creation and some positive payroll numbers pretty soon   That being said, I think I would come back to the theme I echoed in a couple of speeches   over the intermeeting period  I still see the labor market and the credit market and the interaction   between them as being major risks and drags on the expansion  In the labor market, I think it’s   really important for us to keep in mind what a deep hole we’re currently in  To give two   numbers that you don’t always cite, the employment-to-population ratio has fallen from a peak   of 627 percent to 585 in the most recent month—a very substantial decline in the number of   people working The aggregate weekly hours of production workers has fallen more than 8   percent from the peak Compare that with a decline of less than 6 percent in the 1981-1982            December 15–16, 2009 98 of 247  recession—there has been an enormous decline in labor input  And, as a number of people   noted, starting with President Rosengren, that decline in labor input is not simply bodies; it is on   other dimensions as well—hours per week, overtime, and so on  And as was also noted, as labor   input increases, it will happen across a variety of margins and not just on the unemployed  In   fact, given the duration of unemployment and the number of people who will be losing skills and   labor force attachment, there may be some preference, as firms go out and look for workers, to   expand on the intensive margin rather than on hiring people who will not be as attractive from   the employer’s perspective  Just to give you a sense, simple arithmetic says that an increase of   20 minutes in the average workweek is equivalent to one and a half million jobs in terms of labor   input So there is a very substantial substitutability across those dimensions   The second area that I talked about in my remarks over the intermeeting period, of   course, is credit It was noted around the table by a number of people that credit availability for   large firms, including large banks, appears to be quite good, surprisingly good to some extent,   whereas, for small businesses that are bank-dependent, obviously conditions are much more   difficult There was an interesting discussion around the table about how significant the   constraints on small business credit will be  A number of people noted that the NFIB surveys put   small business views about tight credit as being only fourth or fifth on the list of concerns But,   remember, we are now in a period where, in some sense, the binding constraint is demand  The   question is What will happen when there is scope for expansion, and will firms be able to get   the credit they need to expand?  I think it is instructive to recall the post-1990–1991 recession   period, the period of the famous financial headwinds, when banking conditions were much less   severe than now Credit extension was much better; NFIB indicators and the terms of credit   from the survey of senior loan officers—all of those things were less severe than they are today        December 15–16, 2009 99 of 247  in the economy So my best guess is that we will see some concerns about credit as the   expansion begins, and that will be a reason for more moderate economic growth   Contributing to that is that the situation is not like the post-1990–1991 period, where the   problems fairly quickly resolved themselves over the subsequent couple of years  We’re   continuing to look, as a number of people have noted, at still rising NPL rates, commercial real   estate credit, and other issues that will put stress on the banking sector  And, notably, Governor   Duke made some very interesting points about the differences in product mixes between large   and small banks  In particular, small banks are both more vulnerable to the CRE problem and   are a bigger source of credit for small businesses and local economies   Again, to summarize the two parts of my remarks there, the first was that I thought that   the intermeeting data were encouraging, in the sense that the moderate growth scenario looks   more plausible and the risks to it seem less But I don’t see a great deal at this point to suggest   that economic growth will be much greater than the moderate pace scenario  Going back to the   jobless recovery theme, I think it is striking that the staff is projecting 200,000 to 300,000 jobs a   month starting in the second quarter, with even more in 2011, and even so unemployment rates   remain at 96 percent at the end of next year, for example  So given those two things, given the   depth of the hole we’re in, we’re going to need a lot of jobs to get back to more normal   conditions   I think inflation conditions are fairly stable, though obviously not entirely satisfactory in   all dimensions  Over the intermeeting period, we did see oil prices down about $10, although   distant futures prices did not change much, so that doesn’t really change the trajectory very   much I was actually kind of encouraged to see the way the dollar has changed its behavior    We’ve had this funny pattern where, whenever there’s a good day in the stock market, the dollar                                                                    3 Materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   December 15–16, 2009 100 of 247  drops because of this safe-haven effect  Since the November employment report, we’ve gotten a   more normal positive correlation—good news about the US economy is good news for the   dollar I think that’s encouraging, because it means that economic growth will not translate   immediately into those kinds of import inflation pressures  People discussed the difficulties of   interpreting the TIPS spreads  My overall sense is that there’s not a major shift in the inflation   expectations of the financial markets  Likewise, the surveys of forecasters and households are   also fairly benign So all of those things, I think, are moderately encouraging   That being said, I do feel we are, in some sense, walking on eggshells, because there are   so many delicate issues of confidence in financial institutions, in our fiscal position, in the Fed’s   policies and exit strategy, that there just seems to be a greater and pervasive sense of instability   and risk, given what we have been through in the last couple of years  But, again, I think overall   the intermeeting period was good, and although we’re still a long way from where we want to be,   we’re moving at least at some speed in the right direction    So let me stop there  Are there further questions or comments about the economy?  [No   response] In my summary, I took note of our interest in discussing in January the elements of   our policy framework—how we would think about exit and how we would think about   communication and perhaps policy rules as well So we’ll be in touch with you about some of   those issues If there are no further comments, I’ll turn to Brian to start the second round   Thank you Are there questions for Brian?  [No response]   Okay If there are no questions, let’s begin our go-round with President Yellen   Thank you  President Rosengren   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you  President Kocherlakota   Thank you President Fisher   Say it again, please   “Remain reluctant to expand overhead, including payrolls”   Okay Thank you Governor Kohn   Thank you  President Bullard   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you  President Lockhart   Thank you President Lacker   I’m sorry  I’m a little confused about what President   Kocherlakota said Would you repeat your suggestion about holdings?   Okay A number of people have commented that they were   flatfooted by the primary credit rate proposal  That was the warning to give you plenty of time   to think about that in the context of all the other things we are looking at    We will discuss    We will discuss   Having a recommendation available in case the Committee   decides at the next meeting to take a step does not mean that we have to take a step   But I hear your concern  President Evans        December 15–16, 2009 126 of 247  Thank you  President Pianalto   Thank you Governor Warsh   Thank you Governor Duke   Thank you  Governor Tarullo   Thank you Vice Chairman   Thank you very much  As usual, it was a very informative   and diverse discussion   Let’s talk a bit very broadly We’re going to come back in January and talk a lot about   tactics Let me just address for a moment this broad question  Is policy too easy or too tight at   this juncture?  You know, there is a fairly substantial view out there—Paul Krugman and Joe   Gagnon, for example, have expressed it—that by the Taylor Rule we are still several hundred   basis points too tight, that we should, therefore, be doing a lot more asset purchases  President   Yellen, I think, was alluding to that  So I think there is a respectable view which says that we   should be looking to ease further rather than to be tightening  The reason I personally, at least,   am not convinced that that’s the right way to go is that the connection between what actions we   can take at this point and effective easing in the markets is not at all clear  For example, on the   one hand, mortgage rates are already extraordinarily low—it’s not clear that we can lower them   much more  And there are certainly risks associated with substantial further expansion of asset   purchases, including destabilizing inflation expectations, causing commodity prices to rise, or   causing the dollar to start to fall, all of which could lead to a reaction which would be actually a   net negative So while I see merit in the idea that we should, in some sense, be at an easier            December 15–16, 2009 136 of 247  stance than we are, I think we are, in fact, getting to the point where the connection between our   tools and the state of the financial conditions is becoming much less clear   That being said, I have listened to President Bullard now for three or four meetings, and   even I can begin to hear that after a while  [Laughter] I think that we should not rule out   additional purchases We might want to consider a program of modest purchases, which could   be varied, and consider doing that in a way that’s responsive to broad conditions and,   specifically, to something that we’ll learn a lot more about in the next few months, namely, what   happens to the mortgage rate and the housing market after our purchases end  So I think that’s   something we want to keep in mind as we think about our broad strategy   Should we do less, as an alternative? I think it’s good for confidence and good for   predictability for us to begin to normalize policy, to begin to operate in a way that people are   more familiar with  We are coming to the point where we can do that, and I view this closing of   some of these facilities as being an important step  I don’t think that actually tightening policy is   a good idea, for the reasons I just said I think that the economy is still quite weak and that we   should not, at this point, either tighten or strongly signal a tightening at this juncture     The signaling is very important For example, relative to President Lacker’s and others’   suggestion about cutting back slightly on our purchases, the $100 billion here and there is small   change, as far the magnitudes are concerned  President Plosser is holding his forehead    [Laughter] What’s far more important in this context is the signaling  What are we saying?  Are   we saying, therefore, that we have decided to begin a process of tightening?  I worry much more   about the signals than I do about the actual purchases at this point, and so I think we have to be   very, very careful        December 15–16, 2009 137 of 247  I do think that what we are doing has been quite constructive  Regarding these side risks   of the dollar and excess speculation and so on, while we have to monitor those carefully, at the   moment I think those things look, as best we can tell, to be all right  And therefore, again, given   the state of the economy, I don’t think we should be actively signaling a tightening process at   this point I would note—despite the commentary of the dealers about three meetings and so   on—that in the previous forward guidance episode we changed the statement about considerable   period, and two meetings later we raised interest rates  I mean, it was a meeting of intermediate   language, and then the next meeting we raised rates  So I don’t think that we’re constrained to   six months by any means   So my general preference is alternative B, with maintaining, importantly, the “extended   period” language for the time being, trying to minimize changes that would be viewed as   premature signals, either of tightening or ease, and that’s a very important aspect of the language   But, at the same time, I think what we do want to signal is normalization as much as possible,   that we are exiting from extraordinary facilities where we can, and that we hope that it will   inspire confidence that we are moving towards more normal policy   Let me talk a little bit about some of the specifics that were raised in the language  I   think there is a good bit of support for President Fisher’s idea in paragraph 1 about staffing  I   didn’t focus on it today, but, in fact, in last November’s statement, the sentence “Businesses are   still cutting back on fixed investment,” also said “and staffing”  We cut that phrase for this   meeting’s statement  So it does seem appropriate to say that, even though we’re not seeing   further declines in employment, we’re not seeing hiring either  So, how does it go?  “Businesses   are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower place, but remain reluctant to   expand payrolls” Is that what we have?     December 15–16, 2009 138 of 247  “And remain reluctant to expand”  Is that the right word—   was suggested?   “Still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower   pace, and remain reluctant to expand payroll”  Right?   What were your words, Don?   Okay “Add to payrolls”?   All right, that’s a little better   On the inflation sentence, I   think there should be a barrier to make changes  I understand that several people have   preferences for the language in C  I think someplace where we might head at some point would   be to combine those two  For example, if we want to retain the reference to resource slack—this   is just a suggestion for the future, I’m not going to propose this right now—we could say   something like “With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures, and   with longer-term inflation expectations stable,”—then the second part of the C—“the Committee   expects that with appropriate monetary adjustments inflation will remain at levels consistent,”   and so on So that’s a direction we could consider  I’d note that one issue is that making that   change today would constitute a change in our inflation forecast, and I don’t think it really has   changed from inflation being subdued to being consistent with price stability  It seems that that   would be a natural step to take when inflation risks and levels and forecasts seem closer to the           December 15–16, 2009 139 of 247  2 percent target So my recommendation, based on “less change is generally better,” would be   not to make that change today, but to recognize that going forward that reference to monetary   policy actions and price stability would be perhaps a constructive direction   Regarding the third paragraph, I appreciate the thrust of President Kocherlakota’s   suggestion, and I think we do have to think about—again, as President Bullard has suggested—   how we might do additional purchases, and, if so, how we can do that in a way that’s more   responsive to incoming data  That being said, I share the Vice Chairman’s concern that   switching to the word “holdings” at this point is going to be jumping the gun, in the sense of   being too strongly suggestive that we can adjust the portfolio either up or down  And we have   not yet, I think, come to any kind of conclusion or agreement about how we’re going to deal with   asset sales, that is, what priority or what order they would have  So I’m reluctant, for that   reason, to do that But, again, this, like Governor Warsh’s “portfolio” comment, is a suggestion,   a direction, that we’re going to want to go toward as we have greater clarity among ourselves   about how we want to manage our balance sheet   Several people objected to paragraph 4, but I thought the consensus mostly was to   include that—again, as a symbol of our exit  The one question I would put before the group   would be the sentence on the TALF  We could simply drop that sentence, if there is interest in   doing that Brian, would that be a lacuna that would be troubling?  We’re not referring to some   of our other actions or programs   So, for those who are concerned that paragraph 4 is too   strong a signal, or who are concerned specifically about CMBS, that might help in that direction    President Evans    We have announced them   I’m just putting it forward for the group’s consideration    The difference is that the language here, “anticipated expiration dates,” is a somewhat different   sense from the previous announcement, which was that it’s being “extended to”  There is some   information there in terms of the likelihood of a continuation of this program, but, personally,   I’m fine either way   We take the point that the Board needs to think about this   very soon And one can argue that this language does not preclude, obviously, extensions—it   says anticipated expiration date—the last sentence says “prepared to modify,” and so on   President Lacker   All right Under President Fisher’s suggestion, we’ll put   the last sentence in bold [Laughter]  We’re nodding—this is worrisome here  [Laughter] Is   that acceptable?   All right My proposal, then, is to make the change about hiring in the first paragraph,   and to make no additional changes to alternative B, noting for the future that we will want to   consider modification of paragraph 3, the description of our portfolio, and that all of these things   appropriately should be part of our discussion of strategy and tactics, which we have promised   and we now have to deliver for January   President Lockhart   Well, of course, in the November report, even including   temporary hires it was still a negative number   Any other comments?  [No response]  All right Brian, are   you prepared to read the changes?   Okay And we will have further discussion dealing with   redemptions going forward  On that issue, for example, in my July Wall Street Journal editorial   about our exit strategy, I explicitly noted what the redemption expectations were for the next           December 15–16, 2009 143 of 247  couple of years I noted that between $100 and $200 billion a year would roll off, and I included   that as part of my description of how we would exit  So it isn’t an entire surprise in that respect    If there are no other questions, we’re prepared to take a roll   Thank you very much  Why don’t we take a 15-minute   coffee break and come back for the special presentation?   [Coffee break]   Let me call on Jeff Fuhrer who will introduce the special    topic Jeff   First, let me thank the staff for an outstanding effort in   putting this all together and, indeed, coordinating among different Reserve Banks  We now have   an opportunity for questions or comments  Let me start with a question for you, Mike  You talk           December 15–16, 2009 156 of 247  about statistical models of gaps, but I think they look to be mostly constructed from single-   variable analysis, looking only at GDP  Take your example with the productivity shock—if you   also looked at, say, productivity or unemployment and so on, you would get more information,   and you might be able to identify the shock in that case  So wouldn’t a multivariable analysis   reduce some of your concern about statistical models?   President Lacker   I thought the point was if you look at just the path of GDP   and you took a quadratic trend or something out of that and looked at residuals, the gaps you   would construct that way would not be necessarily economically meaningful for reasons we   understand             December 15–16, 2009 157 of 247  But if you believed in their model, then productivity and   unemployment data would help you identify gaps in their model—which is not a bizarre model;   it’s similar to a lot of others   Questions or comments? President Kocherlakota   President Evans   No, you’re next   I guess it was a productivity episode also in the jobless   recovery after 2001 where we saw unemployment high relative to output—somewhat similar   President Lacker   President Lacker, the only thing that puzzles me in what   you said is the implication that we don’t use models  We do use models   And alternative models  The staff uses both large macro   models that try to deal with aggregation and complexity, and they use smaller models  I think, as   you say, there’s only one model in town  I don’t think you can write down a Keynesian model   that doesn’t have a role for gaps in it   Okay   President Evans has a two-hander   President Yellen   Thank you Governor Kohn   A two-hander from President Kocherlakota   Mike was kind enough to mention Bernanke, Gertler, and   Gilchrist earlier [Laughter] I would point out that Mark and other coauthors have updated that   paper to include exactly those kinds of shocks, and they get disinflation and all of those things    And what’s happening is that as there is a shock to the capital of the banking system that   prevents credit from going through to purchasers, or small businesses, or consumers, or   whatever, the drop in their demand is just a decline in the aggregate demand curve, and you get   all the results you would expect from that   A two-hander from President Evans   President Bullard   Thank you  President Plosser   Thank you  President Rosengren   The Ricky Ricardo theory of economics  [Laughter]   President Hoenig    Thank you for reminding us about that     Any other comments?  [No response] If not, let me once again thank the staff for all   your work and for your coordination, and it was a very enjoyable discussion  The next meeting   is another two-day meeting, January 26 and 27  The meeting is adjourned  There is lunch   available in the anteroom for those who can stay Thank you   END OF MEETING      "
8900,2010-01-26,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  This will be an FOMC   meeting for the first six items because it is an organizational meeting, and then at that point, if   Matt reminds me, we will make it a joint meeting with the Board  This is the annual   organizational meeting  Let me first recognize the Presidents rotating into voting status   Presidents Bullard, Hoenig, Pianalto, and Rosengren   Organizational item number 1 is the election of Committee officers  Let me recognize   Governor Kohn    Thank you  Is there a second?    Other nominations?  Without objection  Thank you very   much  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Second?    Without objection  Thank you  Item 1C is staff officers    Would you please read the list, Matt    Thank you  Any questions or comments?  If not, may I   have a second for the motion that we approve these officers?    Thank you  All right  Without objection  Item number 2 is   a proposed revision to the program for security of FOMC information  You received a memo   from Scott and Matt  There is an essentially expositional change to add a summary of the rules   that govern noncitizen access to FOMC information  Are there any questions for Scott or Matt   about this memorandum?  [No response]  Could I have a motion to adopt the revision?    Second?    Without objection  Thank you  Item number 3 is the   selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market   Account  I have been informed that New York is again willing to serve  Do we have a second?    All right  Without objection  Thank you  Number 4; now   we are getting to the controversial items—selection of a Manager of the System Open Market   Account  Brian Sack is the incumbent  Are there other nominations?  If not, any objections to   January 26–27, 2010 5 of 260    naming Brian Sack the Manager?  [No response]  The New York Federal Reserve Bank will   have to find that acceptable  We trust that they will     Next, item 5 is a review of the authorization for domestic open market operations  Let   me turn this over to Brian to present the items  There are four items here  Would you like to   discuss them briefly?      Thank you, Brian  So we will need to vote on the first item,   which allows the use of agency debt and agency MBS in the collateral pool for foreign   counterparties  Let me just comment on the suspension of guidelines  This is the step we took   when we began to purchase the MBS—I guess it was more than a year ago now  I think at this   point we can’t really revisit this as long as our program is continuing, but we won’t wait until   next January to look at this again when the time comes, so let me just commit to that  Are there   any questions or comments for Brian on any of these items?  President Plosser    This authorization has to be reviewed every year  This is   part of the authorization  So at a minimum, we would have to review it next January, but we will   look at it again at the appropriate time      Do I have that right, Brian?  We’d have to look at this again   in any case?    Any other questions or comments?  [No response]  All   right  If not, then we need a vote to allow agency debt and MBS to be used as collateral  Are   there any objections?    Any objections?  [No response]  Okay  Thank you  All   right  Brian, foreign currency operations?    Are there any questions for Brian?  [No response]  Okay  If   not, we need a motion    Without objection  All right  The authorization for foreign   currency operations is approved  I need a motion to close the Board meeting    Thank you  All right  So we now have a joint meeting of   the FOMC and the Federal Reserve Board  We turn to item 7, which is a briefing on financial   developments, and I turn, once again, to our new Manager of the Open Market Desk, Brian Sack     January 26–27, 2010 9 of 260     Thank you  Are there questions for Brian?  President   Fisher    President Bullard     President Lacker    Governor Warsh    President Rosengren    President Lockhart    Okay  Any other questions?  If not, we are going at this   point to have a briefing and discussion on exit strategies  Let me propose an organization for the   next part of the meeting and see if everybody is okay with it   We’ll first have a briefing by Bill Nelson on discount window facilities and the TAF, and   he will make recommendations about how we might proceed on these two areas  After his   briefing we can have Q&A  We will then have a briefing by Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton on   broader issues of removing policy accommodation, sequencing of excess reserves, sequencing of   draining operations, asset sales, use of the interest rate on excess reserves, and so on, followed by   more Q&A  I propose that, at that point, we just do a full go-round because everyone is going to   want to give their views  Is that acceptable to everybody?  On the full go-round we will ask your   views both on the discount rate and on the sequencing and structure of the exit strategy   Let me say, just so I don’t forget, that, first of all, I will, of course, have the semiannual   monetary policy testimony the last week of February, and we just learned yesterday afternoon   that the House Financial Services Committee would like to have a hearing on the Federal   Reserve’s exit strategy on February 10  So we will have at least two opportunities to provide   some communication here  I think we will need to have some sense around the table about what   we are comfortable with my saying and what we are not comfortable with my saying, but I just   want to put that on the table because we will have an opportunity to report to the public some of   what we conclude today   All right  Then without further ado, let me call on Bill Nelson to brief us on the discount   window facilities    Thank you  Do we have questions for Bill?  Governor   Kohn    President Lockhart    President Rosengren    It’s just a question of logistics here  An option would be to   announce, say, for the last auction    I think your point is right that it seems a little incongruous   to have the TAF at a lower rate than the discount window, but it is just logistics that we could   make that work    President Plosser    Other questions?  Governor Duke    Other questions?  Okay  When it comes to the go-round,   we will be interested in your advice on whether to raise the primary credit rate and, if so, when    Do we want to do it intermeeting, for example, along the lines we have discussed, or do we want   to delay that?  How would you like to proceed with that?  Then on the TAF, are you comfortable   with the recommendations to reduce the auction sizes but either keep in reserve what we are   going to do after it goes down to 25 or state now that it is going to zero?  Those are two options,   but we would appreciate your comments on any aspect of that  Let me now call on Jim Clouse to   brief us on tools for removing policy accommodation      Thank you  Questions for Jim or Spence?  President   Lacker   January 26–27, 2010 37 of 260     Pecuniary externalities  Governor Kohn    Vice Chairman    President Plosser, you had a two-hander?    President Fisher    Well, under the traditional approach, the Board set the   discount rate, which was obviously tied closely to the federal funds rate target  So I cannot   conceive that the Board is going to defy the FOMC and set the rate at a different level  We need   January 26–27, 2010 43 of 260    to work collaboratively, obviously, but my anticipation is that we will collectively decide where   monetary policy needs to be and how we should achieve the degree of tightness that we need    Governor Tarullo    President Kocherlakota    President Bullard    Vice Chairman, did you have a comment?    Governor Kohn    Okay  As usual our outstanding conversation is stretching   the limits of our available time  I am getting a little concerned about that  Why don’t we take   15 minutes for coffee?  I hope that everybody will use the 15 minutes to think about how to be as   concise as possible  [Laughter]  In particular, it is not necessary to address every single question   that has been presented  I hope you will focus on the things that you consider most important    Fifteen minutes for coffee  Thank you     [Coffee break]    Thank you for returning promptly  We are ready for a go-  round on comments on sequencing, and also don’t forget to mention the primary credit rate  We   will start with President Yellen    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Plosser     Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Governor Kohn    You have to be on your toes here  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Bullard      Mr Chairman  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lockhart     Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Vice Chairman    All right  Thank you for a very good discussion, and thanks   to the staff again for terrific support  I am going to try to summarize a bit  I think I actually   heard a good bit of agreement around the table, not complete agreement, and so please   understand that I am not trying to represent everybody’s point of view equally  But let me just   try to draw a few conclusions, and we can continue to talk about this   Obviously, whatever we do, I think there was a lot of sense that we need to be as clear as   possible, to communicate in advance what we are going to do as much as we can, and to try to   remove uncertainty where possible  There was a lot of agreement on the primary credit rate and   on the TAF  We have potential statements tomorrow that involve announcing the wind-down of   the TAF, although the statement is not clear about whether we go to zero or hold the last one in   abeyance  We can discuss that tomorrow, but I think there is agreement that we are going to go   down on the TAF  On the primary credit rate there was also agreement  People made the point   that we need to be very clear and careful about our communications, so in particular I need to   January 26–27, 2010 92 of 260    introduce this idea in my testimonies  Another point that was made was that we need to have all   of the Reserve Banks requesting this discount rate increase, which I think is also important   What was not quite so clear in the discussion is whether we should try to do this in   February or at the March meeting  What I would like to do is ask Brian Madigan and the staff to   consult with all of you after this meeting, and you should think about when your board meetings   are scheduled, and just think about logistics, first of all, and what is feasible  And could we get   all of the requests in and then do it all by late February?  Is that feasible?  That’s the first   question  Then, we will poll you and try to find out what the preferences are and, if necessary,   we can have a videoconference  But I hope we can come to some conclusion by just polling the   participants  So that is the primary credit and the TAF, for which we will go ahead and take   those additional steps to continue to close down the liquidity facilities   On the ultimate shape of the balance sheet, there was a great deal of agreement that we   should go to Treasuries only and either shorter-term or at least a greater variety of maturities than   we have now  We need to continue to discuss the ultimate operating regime  A number of   people mentioned a corridor system, but I think there is a sense that we want to go back to short-  term interest rate targeting  Whether it is within a corridor system or the old system we had   before, this can still be discussed, but that’s the direction   On redemptions, I think I heard that everyone wants to redeem all agency securities,   MBS and agency debt  On Treasuries, there are some differences in point of view  I think the   suggestion I would make is that we redeem all of the Treasuries as they come due  I would leave   it to the Desk—and we can discuss this later—to the extent that you want to replace any of the   Treasuries, they should be with very short-term instruments, both to shorten the overall maturity   January 26–27, 2010 93 of 260    of the SOMA and to give us the flexibility to reduce reserves easily in the future if we need to    That would be my take-away from this   There is a lot of agreement that we don’t want to hold MBS indefinitely, although I   would point out that the politics cuts different ways  On the one hand, it is true that we don’t   want to be the third GSE, and I agree with that concern  On the other hand, I think if we take   unnecessary large capital losses, those would also probably be a big problem for us politically    We can take capital losses if we need to, but I don’t think we should go out of our way to take   capital losses if we can avoid it  So I think we ought to consider something along the lines of   what President Kocherlakota described as a reverse taper  Perhaps we should announce at some   point, not immediately, that we are, say, not going to be selling in 2010 or for some fixed period   and after that we will be selling in some baseline trajectory  I don’t think we have to decide this,   obviously, in this meeting  I would like the staff to please look through alternative strategies and   try to figure out what the implications would be for the size of the balance sheet, for reserves, for   capital losses, and other issues that we might be concerned about  So let’s proceed that way   On state-contingency, I liked Governor Warsh’s view of a dimmer switch versus on/off   switch  I think we all agree that we want to be state-contingent, but I don’t think we want to be   varying purchases and sales by small amounts, according to small changes in the outlook  But,   obviously, if there’s a major change in the outlook, either better or worse, then we would have to   be prepared to respond to that  So, again, we would like to go for a baseline that gets us way   down on MBS within a reasonable period, certainly within Betsy’s term    With respect to the draining of reserves, I think there was a   lot of agreement, not universal, that we should try to drain some reserves first  My sense is—and   January 26–27, 2010 94 of 260    this would be my preference also, and I think this is somewhere near the center of gravity—that   we should continue to test our reserve-draining techniques aggressively, to make sure we have a   lot of comfort with them  That would mean at some point ramping them up to some size—again,   because small is not the same as large, and we have to be sure that they can operate at some size    But we should continue to take the posture that these are testing, that we are trying to understand   these tools and make sure they work and demonstrate that they work  When the time comes and   we think we are very close to raising interest rates, we ought to then move aggressively and   announce a meeting or two in advance that we will be draining more rapidly and hope to get at   least a significant decline in reserves at the time that we raise rates, in order to have a more   secure effect on the economy  That said, we all understand this depends on how things evolve    If things change dramatically and we end up raising rates very soon, then we may not have the   luxury of developing this whole process, and we will have to go with what we have  Fortunately,   the IOER rate seems likely to work, but it would be helpful to have some reserve drains   So those are just some observations  Oh, one last thing on the target rate, I don’t think   we are quite in sync on that yet  There is, obviously, a desire to go back to the federal funds rate,   if possible, and it may depend on the tools we use  If we use the reserve collateral accounts, for   example, that might reduce the viability of the federal funds rate  It seems to me right now that   the major alternatives being suggested are either the IOER rate, the IOER rate plus some   monitoring of a set of short-term rates, or the federal funds rate  I think those are the options that   are on the table, and we will have to think about them, and that will be part of our thinking about   the long-term operating procedure and also the tools that we are going to use to drain reserves    So there are some observations  Any questions or comments?  President Kocherlakota   January 26–27, 2010 95 of 260     Buying short-term Treasuries would, of course, add to   reserves  Right?  But if they are very short-term Treasuries, then they can be easily disposed of   as part of the draining process as we get close to the moment when we want to raise rates   We now have a decision to make  We could now go ahead and hear the staff   presentation, perhaps without Q&A, or with Q&A, or we could start tomorrow morning at 830    Is there a general feeling?  Can we go ahead and just hear the presentation?    830?    All right  I hear sort of a general preference  I’m sorry  I   apologize to the staff—you have sat here for four hours    All right, before you walk away, we do have one action we   have to take  Believe it or not, this is a record, four hours into the meeting and we have not yet   ratified the domestic open market operations    Without objection  Thank you  We will continue   tomorrow morning at 830 with the presentation by the staff  Thank you  There is a reception   and a dinner for your convenience available upstairs   [Meeting recessed]   January 26–27, 2010 97 of 260    January 27—Morning Session             Good morning  This is the continuation of our joint   FOMC–Board meeting  We are at item 8, the economic situation, and let me turn to Dan Sichel    And for President Lacker’s benefit, we have Dan Sichel, Mike Palumbo, Dave Stockton, Nathan   Sheets, and Brian Madigan    Thank you  Dan, please    Thank you very much  Are there questions for our   colleagues?  President Bullard    Uncertainty is always rising  [Laughter]    We have been giving this information for only how long—a   couple of years?  It’s kind of a short sample    President Fisher    President Evans    Other questions?  President Kocherlakota    President Bullard    You have to be careful of your intuition because gross   hiring is always reasonably high even in a recession  In some sense, a sufficient decline in   January 26–27, 2010 114 of 260    separations can lead to increased payrolls even if the active hiring process has not accelerated    So there are some intuitive traps here that we have to pay attention to  Other questions?  All   right  Seeing none, let me begin with President Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart      Thank you  President Fisher      Thank you  President Lacker    President Lacker, housing has two other effects, though    One is on wealth effects, as an important component of consumer spending and therefore affects   it  The other is on the quality of mortgage assets and the implications for the banking system and   so on  So there are other channels of effect—do you think those others are not serious as well?    Okay  President Evans     Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Hoenig      Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Vice Chairman      Thank you  Governor Kohn    In evaluating your level of uncertainty, you have a long   experience to draw on  [Laughter]  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you all  Let’s take a coffee break for about   20 minutes   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we recommence?  Dave Stockton, I think   you have some data     Any questions?  Let me try to summarize our discussion  I   had a lot of difficulty in getting it done, so I may not be too effective this time   Economic indicators since our last meeting were somewhat mixed  An earlier-than-  expected stabilization of inventories raised fourth-quarter GDP  Overall, though, the outlook   does not appear much changed from previous meetings  Participants continue to project a   moderate recovery, picking up in 2011, but with high and only slowly improving unemployment   rates  This recovery will depend in part on private demand being sufficiently strong to outweigh   reduced support from the inventory cycle and from policy  Continued weakness in the labor   market is a downside risk to the recovery scenario, as is continued financial restraint  Another                                                     5 The materials used by Mr Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   January 26–27, 2010 162 of 260    minor negative is state and local fiscal conditions  Consumer spending has been growing   modestly with holiday sales mixed, although sentiment remains relatively poor and the bulk of   spending is driven by value  Consumers are still deleveraging and are worried about the labor   market and credit availability   News on the labor market is also mixed  Fewer workers are losing jobs, but hiring is   very limited, and long-duration unemployment is high  Growth in output and the difficulty of   finding further cost cuts might lead to more positive employment growth, but then the possibility   remains that productivity gains will continue leading to slower employment growth  Anecdotes   from firms are mixed, with some being more optimistic than before  Generally, though, firms   remain cautious about both economic and policy uncertainty and are unwilling to hire, build   inventories, or invest until orders pick up and the range of uncertainties moderates  Larger firms   have cash but are reluctant to put it to work without faster top-line growth  They are using more   temporary workers, but on a just-in-time basis  Strength can be seen in some sectors, such as   health care and high tech  Shipping is up somewhat, as is tourism, but generally a tone of   caution still prevails     In the housing sector, we have seen improvement in some real estate markets    Foreclosures are still an issue, although government programs and the restructuring of mortgages   may be helping somewhat going forward  The question was raised about the significance of the   housing sector since it is a very small part of GDP  There are, though, certainly risks to the   sector, including the removal of the MBS purchase support and fiscal supports   Financial conditions remain generally supportive and were, in fact, discussed less than in   previous meetings  Spreads are down  Liquidity is better  Volatility is somewhat up  We are   seeing some riskier practices, but it may be too soon to worry yet about over-exuberance  Bank   January 26–27, 2010 163 of 260    credit problems look to be peaking and are being better managed, but bank lending seems likely   to keep contracting for a while  Commercial real estate loans remain a major risk for many   banks, but again, improved management is helping  Lending is likely to continue to decline, as I   noted   Internationally, foreign growth is helping to support industrial production and recovery in   the United States  However, there are a number of risks associated with the foreign economy,   including questions of fiscal sustainability, as in Greece; the issue of whether China’s recovery   can be sustained at the current pace; the sustainability of current account balances; and the   possibility that growth in emerging markets and abroad will lead to increased commodity prices   with resulting effects on inflation   Turning to inflation, it has been relatively stable  Price discounting is less, but pricing   power remains limited  Core measures of inflation remain moderate with rents flat to down    However, the decline in shelter costs may be exaggerating the extent of underlying disinflation    Wage growth continues tepid  Slack clearly seem high, though measurement is difficult  For   example, on the one hand, emergency unemployment benefits may be increasing the duration of   unemployment and raising the effective NAIRU  On the other hand, the breakdown of Okun’s   law and the associated strong productivity gains might be interpreted as saying that the gap is   even larger than output-based measures suggest  Again, commodity prices associated with   expanding global activity are an inflation risk  There were numerous comments about inflation   expectations  Those measures were mixed over the intermeeting period, with survey measures   fairly stable  But concern was expressed about increases in five-year, five-year forward   breakeven inflation rates as well as indicators of inflation risk premiums, suggesting rising   concerns about medium-term inflation risks  Concerns on the part of the public about the fiscal   January 26–27, 2010 164 of 260    deficit, the Fed’s balance sheet, and political factors surrounding the Fed might be affecting these   medium-term inflation expectations somewhat   So I think the overall picture is one of continued expectation for moderate recovery,   weakness in the labor market, but a great deal of uncertainty associated with that general   prognosis  I apologize to those whose comments were excluded from the summary, but are there   any questions or comments?    Let me add just a few words  I think the discussion today was exceptionally   comprehensive  It’s actually difficult to say something new because in many ways the outlook   looks quite the same as it has for some months now  I think it’s appropriate that we are almost at   Groundhog Day, with its repetition  [Laughter]  When I was making my notes for these remarks,   I was looking at the financial indicators, and I noted that the stock prices and the long-term bond   yields were exactly what they were at the last FOMC meeting  I think that has changed a bit in   the last few days, but there really has not been, in my view, a very significant change in financial   conditions  Perhaps a bit of good news on the bank side  It looks as though the credit risks are   stabilizing somewhat, and we’ve seen a bit of good news from the survey of loan officers  On   the real side, as people have noted, we have a powerful short-term inventory cycle, which is   affecting fourth-quarter GDP  But there isn’t much change around the table in views of where   the most likely outcome will be in terms of growth and employment over the next year   I would just like to build on a comment by President Bullard about the Lake Wobegon   theory of uncertainty [laughter]—that uncertainty is always greater than average  I think   uncertainty actually is greater than average right now  There are a number of areas where it   remains very difficult for us to be highly confident about this forecast, notwithstanding the fact   that it has remained stable for several meetings     January 26–27, 2010 165 of 260    First, on the pace of recovery, I think there are risks in both directions  In order to get the   moderate growth, the 3 to 4 percent growth that people have been talking about, what we need   essentially, and it is not yet demonstrably seen, is a handoff from the inventory cycle, from fiscal   supports to sustainable growth in final demand of about 3 to 4 percent—in particular,   consumption growth around 2½ to 3 percent, which is what the Greenbook is forecasting  Those   are reasonable projections, given the underlying fundamentals, but again, they are projections   and not realizations  We have not yet seen final demand pick up to that higher level, and when I   wake up at night and I’m recovering from the nightmare, I remember the summer of 2008, when   we were quite comfortable about a steady recovery moving forward for the rest of the year  So I   think that, while there are good reasons to think that moderate growth will, in fact, be sustained   in 2010, again, this is still a projection and not a reality  On the other hand, I think that we   should recall that we are talking about the downward phase of the recession  There was a lot of   discussion about state-switching models and the fact that, in a recession, dynamics can become   very powerful and drive you very quickly into a decline  Certainly some of those factors can   work in the upward direction as well  It’s possible that pent-up demand of various kinds,   positive feedback loops, and increasing confidence could lead to a more powerful recovery  We   certainly hope that is the case, and we will want to watch that carefully     The second area of uncertainty that was discussed quite extensively around the table is in   the labor market, the case of job creation  Again, I talked last time about the extraordinary depth   of this employment recession measured not only in terms of unemployment rates but also in   terms of hours, duration of unemployment, and part-time work  I think there is a very real   possibility that, even with a moderate recovery, employment will grow very slowly and   unemployment will climb very slowly  That, in turn, will have obviously negative consequences   January 26–27, 2010 166 of 260    for sustainability of consumer spending and final demand  As President Yellen talked about,   though, one of the real uncertainties here has to do with the meaning of these tremendous   productivity gains we have been seeing  If they do reflect unsustainable, temporary cost-cutting   measures, essentially getting people to work harder for a temporary period, then they should   reverse, and as a result, as the economy recovers, we might see stronger job creation  But if they   can be maintained, as some anecdotes suggest they can be, then that, of course, will be an   additional factor dragging down employment  We do not understand the sources of these   productivity gains  We don’t really understand the interactions between job creation and credit   availability, and so I think there’s a lot of uncertainty still in that area as well     That leads me to the third area of uncertainty, which is the banking system  I think   generally things are better there  It’s very good news that banks have been able to pay back   government capital and raise private capital  There is evidence that credit losses are stabilizing   and that banks, as Governor Duke was discussing, are getting better control over their portfolios    All that being said, the rate of losses that banks are experiencing is still extraordinarily high on a   historical basis, and very important upside risks on losses remain in commercial real estate, in   mortgages, and in other areas  We have already seen to our great regret the power of instability   in the banking system and its ability to amplify weakness in other parts of the economy, and so I   do not consider this to be a rearview mirror situation  I think it is still something we need to   continue to look at   Finally, there was quite a bit of discussion—I thought very interesting discussion—about   the uncertainties regarding inflation  I was also going to talk about the difficulties in measuring   slack, and that has been covered pretty well  But we note that, for example, besides the   unemployment insurance, we have an unusually large number of workers with long-term   January 26–27, 2010 167 of 260    unemployment spells  Are these in some sense less effective in bringing down wages under the   usual kind of Phillips curve interpretation?  An alternative way of looking at this, though, is that   the weakness of the labor market is reflected not only on the extensive margin—the number of   workers, the unemployment rate—but also on the intensive margin—hours of work per week,   permanent versus temporary workers, and so on  Arguably there is even more slack in the labor   market than is suggested by the unemployment rate  I just raise this as saying that there are a lot   of uncertainties about how much slack there is and how much downward pressure that will place   on inflation  I also was going to mention, as a number of people have, the larger medium-term   issues about fiscal sustainability, about the politics surrounding the Federal Reserve, our balance   sheet, all of those issues  They are very difficult ones, and even if we feel comfortable ourselves   that we have those under control, the public may not be as comfortable, and that is itself   something we have to be concerned about   So the bottom line from both my summary and my few additional comments is that I   think we should be encouraged that the path of recovery still seems to be on track; that we look   to be having greater stability in the financial sector and in the housing sector; that we are seeing a   spurt of growth from the inventory cycle, which in turn will feed down the supply chain into   other production  But that said, we are still at a very uncertain phase, and I think that we need to   be appropriately patient to continue to allow events to unfold as we get a better sense of what the   economy is actually going to do  I think we ought to focus, as we’ll talk about policy in just a   minute, on a gradual and steady normalization of our overall policy stance, moving steadily   toward the exit without lurching or shocking the system  Of course, if the situation changes, we   can move more aggressively  But as of right now, again, with the level of uncertainty being what   January 26–27, 2010 168 of 260    it is, I think we should move gingerly and just continue to move in a steady way toward more   normal policy     Comments or questions?  Why don’t we turn now to the policy go-round, and I will turn   to Bill English to introduce that    Thank you  Are there any questions for Bill?  Governor   Warsh    President Plosser    Hold on  Do you have a question?    Not quite yet    Anybody else have a question?  Okay  If not, now you get   to start  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Rosengren      Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Fisher    I think it is contracting    President Fisher, I did not quite understand what you said   about the TAF auction  Did you like the language here, or did you want the change that Bill   made?    Okay  Governor Kohn     Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto      Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  On the facts, Nathan, the commodity prices,   there has been a lot of movement, right?  There was a big run-up from October until December    But I think recently a lot of that has been reversed  It’s not very clear    Not to push this too far, but those are not value weighted, or   those are just sort of equally weighted indexes, right?  And energy in particular I think is sort of   back where it was in October    All right  Thanks  Governor Duke     Governor Tarullo   January 26–27, 2010 197 of 260     Thank you  Vice Chairman     All right  President Plosser    We were doing that last meeting also  His question is,   What are we conveying?    May I comment?    Let me talk about the whole statement, and then I will   address your question    Okay  Let me just make a few comments  Just on the   substance, I think it was pretty striking that in fact there was not a big change in the outlook and   not really that big a change in our degree of certainty since our last meeting  We do see a   recovery, but it appears likely to be moderate  In any case, it’s still somewhat more projection   than actuality  I talked about the level of uncertainty  Labor markets are still deteriorating  I   think the UI claims are moving in the wrong direction, and I am not quite sure what is happening   there  I am not sure it’s entirely spurious  On the inflation side, we had a lot of discussion about   January 26–27, 2010 201 of 260    the five-year, five-year forward breakeven inflation rates, and I think that is an important thing,   but there are technical and other reasons for that  And I think it is striking how much, for   example, the dollar has moved in an anti-inflationary direction recently  And my general sense   is that I didn’t hear from around the table quite as much today as I heard earlier, last fall for   example, about chatter, about the Fed’s balance sheet, inflation expectations, those sorts of   things  So I am not sure which way that’s going   In any case, given that we haven’t changed our outlook much, given that uncertainty   remains very high, and given that between now and the next meeting we’ll have two employment   reports and we’ll have a lot more information, my preference is to maintain a status quo position   in this meeting while continuing on our path toward normalization as best we can   Let me talk about some of the specifics in the statement, and then I will address President   Lacker’s question and others  First of all, just on alternative C, paragraph 2, on inflation, given   the decline in energy prices in recent weeks, I guess that it does seem a little odd to introduce   that sentence in this meeting  I thought I heard a majority in favor of dropping the first sentence   and just starting with “with substantial resource slack”  I have heard from President Plosser now   a couple meetings about C2  There are really two elements to that  One is dropping the resource   slack reference  I am not sure that the Committee as a whole is there  I think most of us think   there is some effect of resource slack  We have considerable disagreement about how important   it is and how to measure it, and so on  The other thing that is in C2 is reference to appropriate   monetary policy  We actually had something like that in the first paragraph, which I guess we   dropped this time  But I take that point, and I think we should consider possibly including   something like that as we go forward   January 26–27, 2010 202 of 260     I think that is a reasonable suggestion, and let’s foreshadow   that for the next meeting  Perhaps you would remind us about that    I think you might  Just one other piece of housekeeping   before getting to the tougher questions  On the TAF, I thought I heard a majority, but maybe   not, for going to zero after March  Bill, what was the language there that you were suggesting?    Okay  Is that all right with everybody?  Are there any who   feel strongly that we should not?  Okay  So let’s make that change   On the other issues, it’s not a question of surprising markets or not surprising markets  It   is a question of communicating accurately, and the question is, Do the markets understand what   we think we are doing and what we are trying to achieve?  So, first of all, with respect to   holdings, I think that the use of “holdings” at this meeting might not change much of anything,   but I think there is a significant risk that it would signal an imminent sales program, which I   didn’t hear us agreeing on yesterday  President Kocherlakota, I think we accepted your basic   premise that we should do a gradual selling process that would get us down to zero MBS much   more quickly than redemptions would do  So it’s a question of what’s the appropriate timing of   January 26–27, 2010 203 of 260    communicating that  We have several ways to communicate that  I can talk about this again in   testimony coming up on two occasions   It is important, I think, for us to see the effects of the end of the MBS purchases at the   end of the quarter  You were talking about empirical studies  In a moment, we are going to have   a very important empirical study  So I don’t disagree with the fact that we should modify this,   but I guess I think it’s better to do it through other mechanisms and just hold off on this just for   another meeting or two  I didn’t hear anyone yesterday say that we should be selling   immediately  I think there was a view that we should be selling gradually over a period of time   but that the beginning of those sales might still be after the tightening process begins, for   example  So I think it would be miscommunication at this point to put that in  I think it would   give the wrong impression   Likewise, with the “extended period” language, I understand the concerns that some folks   have about that, and I don’t always feel entirely comfortable with it myself, to tell you the truth    But there are a couple of aspects about it that I think we should point out  The first is one that   the Vice Chairman mentioned, which is that the signal it’s sending doesn’t seem to be grossly   wrong  The markets are expecting us to move in the second half of this year, and I don’t think   many of us around the table are much more aggressive than that  So it’s not precluding us from   moving at an appropriate time at this point  The other aspect of this statement that is very   important is that it is explicitly conditional  We made a point a couple of meetings ago of   putting in this language about subdued inflation trends and contained inflation expectations    Clearly, if those things start moving adversely, that will invalidate the premise of the “extended   period” language  And, third, although I know people have talked about six months, the similar   language in 2004 was dropped and interest rates were raised only in a couple of meetings I think    January 26–27, 2010 204 of 260    So particularly if the conditions underlying the statement begin to change, I don’t think that we   are so locked in  I’m happy working toward the elimination of that statement or a modification   of that statement  But if we were to do it today, we would be signaling with high likelihood that   we would be moving in the next two or three meetings, and I don’t think any one of us wants to   signal that right now     So it’s not a question of buying flexibility; it is a question of being accurate in what you   are telling the market  And right now the market’s views seem to me to be more or less   appropriately calibrated  President Lacker     Well, I’m saying that we could remove it one or two   meetings ahead, if conditions warranted, because it is a conditional statement    I think it would be important to stress in your elucidations   that this statement, if you read the sentence, says that economic conditions—and we lay out what   those conditions are—are likely to warrant interest rates that are exceptionally low  So I think it   is analogous what the Swedes do, which is to forecast their own interest rates    In a situation like today, where there has been no palpable   change in the outlook, I don’t see the case for that  But if there were a significant change in the   outlook, I think that we certainly could  I’m also fine with working toward a gradual toning-  down of this language, also along the lines that President Hoenig and others have suggested, to   “some time,” et cetera  But I think we are not there yet  Right now the modal expectation   around the table is that we are still some meetings away from it    That confused me  [Laughter]  I’m interested in accurate   communication  Right now, the markets have what I think is a fairly reasonable forward curve    If we were to remove this today, the market expectation would be that we would be moving, say,   by April, I would guess  And I don’t think that is an accurate representation of what the   Committee believes at this moment    The trouble with removing it, without some basis for it, is   that it will miscommunicate our views    Again, the Eurodollar futures curve seems to me to be a   fairly reasonable guess of what we might want to do  Now, there have been some—like Larry   Meyer, for example—who have suggested that we might want to take a first step up and then   plateau at 1 percent or something like that  That’s possible, but that is a pretty subtle alteration    I think we would have to communicate what we were trying to do there in advance pretty clearly   So, again, I am hopeful that, besides the language, we do have other tools, including the   ramping-up of our reserves-draining capacity and those sorts of things  But I just want to assure   everybody that we are not locking ourselves into an iron-clad six-month period with this   language  In fact, we discussed this at Jackson Hole  Carl Walsh asked us about this, and we   said explicitly that we were not playing a Woodford game where we were trying to commit to   keeping rates low longer than we otherwise would  That’s not what the intent is  President   Kocherlakota    Testimony, speeches, minutes, and ultimately the statement    So I think we can communicate that  Now, I also think, as I said yesterday, that we don’t want to   say more than we know  In particular, I think we ought to get some staff input  You have   suggested a pattern of sales that may or may not be the best one  We want to look at that—it is   very important  So we may not want to communicate anything very precise about that yet  But I   think it is reasonable for me to begin to introduce the idea that, perhaps not immediately or the   near term but at some point, we will want to have a pattern of slow sales in order to normalize   our balance sheet  So that would be, I think, the best way to do it    What?    Well, to answer that question, we would like to have some   staff analysis of what would be a good pattern that would achieve these objectives, and I hope   without too much capital risk  President Bullard    I think we need to do something at the next meeting, given   that we are at that point  I think we are very close to the end of the actual purchases  But it is   still possible that we might want—I think you have spoken in favor of contingent policies—to   reevaluate the end of our program    That sounds reasonable  I am concerned only about   accurate communication  I want the public to understand what it is we have actually decided   around the table  Any other questions?  Matt, do you have notes on the changes that we have   made?    Okay  Thank you very much  A few items  First of all,   your projections can be updated if submitted by 500 pm tomorrow  Second, on redemptions,   the Desk needs a bit of guidance  My sense of our meeting yesterday was that we were happy   for the Desk to run off all agency-related securities starting immediately but that, for the time   being, they would like to roll over Treasuries  Is that acceptable to everybody?     Yes, roll them into what?  Into shorter maturities generally    Is that okay?    So what you want to do for right now is roll it over, but   let’s not wait until the next meeting to get clarity on this    All right  We will check with everybody by phone    I think there is a preference around the table to go to shorter   maturities for Treasuries, if possible  Let’s see  The next meeting is Tuesday, March 16  It is a   one-day meeting  We will start at 500 in the morning  [Laughter]  We may have to start at 800   in the morning  Let me just ask everyone, when you plan your remarks for next time, please   keep in mind that it is a one-day meeting, and we will have a very tight agenda  President   Lacker    Well, I would think that we would not have an extended   staff presentation other than the economic presentation  That would be my assumption    Anything else?  Okay  The meeting is adjourned  The members of the Committee and the staff   have been asked to remain  You can stay and have lunch  We will have our discussion of   January 26–27, 2010 211 of 260    legislative matters  Other staff members, thank you, and if you would like, there is lunch   available in B-4001 for those who would like to take part in that  Thank you   END OF MEETING   January 26–27, 2010 212 of 260     "
8928,2010-03-16,BERNANKE,"  I need a motion to close the Board meeting    Thank you  Well, today is kind of an important day  This   is the first one-day meeting we have had in—[laughter]—some time  So let me just remind   everybody to please be concise and to the point, so we can get done in time for the   announcement   Let’s start this morning with Brian Sack’s report on financial developments and system   facilities  Brian     Are we going to take questions now or go on to the next   report?    Jamie, do you want to make your report?    Thank you  Before we continue, Vice Chairman, you had   an introduction to make?   March 16, 2010 11 of 146     Thank you  The staff circulated some questions for   discussion before the meeting  Before we go into Q&A and any views that people want to offer,   I just want to make sure we understand what is being asked today  First, on the portfolio, I   assume that we want to know if there are any objections to continuing with the redemptions of   the agency securities  That’s the current policy    On Treasury redemptions, my understanding is that you do   not need an answer today and that you would like to hear any feedback, but that this would be a   decision to be taken in April or at a subsequent meeting  What is the staff’s preference on that   decision?    Okay  And then, thirdly, on the RCAs, I think you’re   looking for some approval today to continue with those preparatory steps that you mentioned    With that understanding, let me open for the floor for any   questions  President Lockhart    President Lacker    So if the difference between the IOER rate and the market   rate doesn’t matter, then we should just raise the IOER rate and ignore all of these reserve-  draining issues  Yes?     President Evans    That’s the problem  I think it is allocative, because IOER is   restricted—there’s a barrier, in that IOER is essentially restricted to banks  Banks are not doing   the arbitrage of relating that IOER rate to other money market rates  This reduces the barrier,   essentially allowing other money markets to be tied more closely to IOER  It should transmit the   effects of IOER more strongly through other money markets  That’s the intention    President Fisher    President Fisher, let me interject, because that’s something   we discussed  Brian was talking just about redemption strategy  Now, at the last meeting,   President Kocherlakota presented what he called a “reverse taper strategy,” which involved a   program of sales, not a huge program in the short term, but over time, a gradual and pre-  announced program  And I thought there was a good bit of comfort around the table with that   general approach  The advantage of that approach is that it does bring us down, not   immediately, but over a reasonable period of time, to an all-Treasury portfolio, and I think that’s   where we all want to be  But this is only about redemptions   If I may say one more thing—I don’t want to be using the clock as a defense, but I do   think there’s no hope that we’re going to resolve these exit issues completely today, and I think   that we ought to make sure at the two-day meeting in April that we completely review all of   these issues  If there’s not comfort with going ahead with RCAs, I think there’s already some   question about whether or not we want to make a decision today  It looks like we do not want to   March 16, 2010 23 of 146    make a decision today on the Treasury redemptions  That’s fine  So we can put these things off    But I don’t think we’re going to come to a final conclusion  Regarding Brian’s presentation, it   was about looking strictly at a redemption strategy  I thought there was a lot of agreement   around the table that we do want to have sales, but that the proposal was to do them in a gradual,   pre-announced way    Governor Warsh    President Hoenig    That’s correct    President Kocherlakota    President Plosser    Okay  President Yellen    Thank you  Governor Kohn    I’m trying to avoid it, but I’m not being successful    [Laughter]  Let me make a proposal, if I might, just to condition the rest of the comments that   people might make  I haven’t heard any objections to continuing our interim policy of   redeeming MBS and agency securities  I’m seeing nodding around the table   March 16, 2010 29 of 146    It’s clear we need to have an overall discussion  Several people have made the point that   we need to look at this in a general equilibrium way, that we need to put together all of the   different components  I think that’s right, and I was going to propose—I have proposed—that   we revisit the entire strategy in April, including both the short-term reserve-draining issues and   also the long-term strategy for returning to a Treasury-only portfolio  So let’s do that  Given   that, my proposal would be that we put off making any decision on Treasury redemptions until   we have that full discussion and, for the time being, continue to roll over Treasuries   On the RCAs, clearly, there is some reluctance there  Let me ask Jamie—I don’t know   the answer to this—is it possible to do some additional thinking about this tool, to be prepared to   present to the Committee some further considerations both of the practicalities and of the   economics, as well as of what goals we are trying to achieve, but not to make it public between   now and April that we are looking at this  I guess the minutes will say we’re looking at   alternative tools, but in the next meeting this would be part of the overall discussion of how we   were going to go back to achieve both our short-term and our long-term goals  Is that a   satisfactory way forward?  [Nodded assent]   Okay  So given that, which means that everybody will indeed have an opportunity to   express their full views on all of these issues, I’m happy still to entertain any additional questions   that remain  Are there any other questions?  President Bullard    President Fisher raised implicitly a question about my   testimony on exit strategy  I brought a copy just in case we wanted to talk about it  I did try to   March 16, 2010 30 of 146    make it a contingent discussion  My understanding—again, maybe I over-read the sense of the   Committee—of the discussion following President Kocherlakota’s proposal at the last meeting   was, on the one hand, that the majority, though not unanimous, view was that we did not want to   use MBS sales as a principal means of short-term reserve reduction, that we are going to look at   RRPs and term deposits as the more immediate short-term method of reducing reserves, because   of the concerns that even one MBS sale would trigger unknown revisions of expectations in the   market, which could lead to very sharp changes in longer-term rates and in mortgage rates   That was my sense on the one hand  On the other hand, I think there was also a very   broad acceptance of the proposal that redemptions alone were not going to be sufficient to get us   back to a Treasury-only portfolio  And I was very clear in my testimony that sales were going to   be part of this process, but that they would be well-communicated and deliberate, etc   Now, if I have overstepped the consensus, I apologize  I have to warn you that the   testimony which was postponed because of snow has now been rescheduled for next week, and I   don’t see any alternative to just resubmitting the same testimony  I don’t see any way to change   that  I think there is some flexibility there  I think it’s fine to hedge a bit and just say we’re still   discussing exactly how this will work    Well, the thing which I think is already known in markets is   that we’re looking at reverse RPs for GSEs  So I think that’s sufficient Okay?     President Fisher    March 16, 2010 31 of 146     No  RCAs are not going to be made public until the next   meeting    Well, I will be quite frank  My own strong preference is   that we do not sell MBS until we have a longer-term plan    We’re going to have to withdraw hundreds of billions of   dollars of reserves at the time we begin to raise the short-term rate  I don’t see any way to sell   hundreds of billions of dollars of MBS without having very sharp implications for longer-term   rates and for mortgage rates  I think it is much safer to use the reserve-draining mechanism in   the short run and to have a path, an announced path, for selling MBS over the medium term    That would be my personal preference, and I’ve stated it as my preference  If you disagree with   that, of course, you are free to say so  Maybe the best thing is for all of us to make sure that we   emphasize that there is still discussion going on in the Committee about the issue    We are discussing it, and we will discuss it further in April   March 16, 2010 32 of 146     President Lacker    Again, part of this is my own view, obviously, but President   Kocherlakota’s proposal was to sell very, very small amounts in 2010, $5 billion a month or   something—very small amounts—so that the fundamental observation I took from that was that   whenever this path of pre-announced gradual sales were to begin, clearly we would not be   relying on it as a major tool for draining reserves  I think that was implicit in the discussion,   because he was talking about relatively small amounts of sales  So we will just have to continue   to discuss this and try to get further clarity  President Kocherlakota, do you want to defend your   own—[laughter]    I will read you the sentence, if you’d like, but there’s a clear   statement of that in my testimony  Anyone else?  [No response]  Okay  Now that that’s all   clearly resolved, [laughter] we need a vote to ratify the Domestic Open Market operations     Okay  Without objection  Let’s turn now to Item 2, the   economic situation, and Dave Stockton    Thank you  Are there questions for our colleagues?  [No   response]  A very thorough report  Thank you  Why don’t we turn, then, to our go-round, and   we’ll begin with President Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Plosser   March 16, 2010 43 of 146     Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  There’s a South Carolina version of your   aphorism, which is, “If you should ever have an opportunity to keep your mouth shut, be sure to   take advantage of it”  [Laughter]  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Well, it’s about 1030  Why don’t we take a   20 minute coffee break?  See you at 1050    [Coffee break]    Are we ready to recommence?  All right, why don’t we turn   to the Vice Chairman?    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you, and thank you all not only for insightful   comments, but concise ones as well   Let me try to summarize and then I’ll just add a few observations  Intermeeting data   were perhaps slightly weaker than expected, and some bouts of bad weather further muddled the   picture  The economy was characterized as flat, fragile, lethargic, choppy, and improving    Generally, moderate growth is projected for 2010, with slow improvement in the labor market   and low near-term inflation risks  Private demand needs to pick up where the inventory cycle   and fiscal policy are leaving off to create a sustainable expansion  Outside of Europe, foreign   growth continues reasonably strong, especially in China and other EMEs, although there are   various risks abroad ranging from an overheated China to a fiscally strapped Greece  Financial   markets generally continued to be supportive of recovery  Inflation risks appear low in the short   run, but may be higher in the medium run, and uncertainty about the forecast remains quite high   Recent data suggest that retail sales and household spending are growing at a moderate   rate, though consumers remain pessimistic about income growth in the labor market, and income   and the saving rate have been revised down   The most recent labor market report was mildly encouraging, and job growth might have   been positive except for weather disruptions  Temporary jobs have increased considerably    However, labor market conditions overall remain very weak  Unemployment is high, especially   among men, and long-term unemployed are losing skills  The decline in UI claims has stalled,   suggesting that layoffs have not entirely stopped, and, while there are signs of hiring, they are   still somewhat limited  Firms are quite reluctant to add to payrolls, given the level of uncertainty   March 16, 2010 80 of 146    about the sustainability of the recovery and about government policy  Nevertheless, some job   creation is expected in coming months, as very lean firms are forced to respond to higher   demand   Housing sales and starts have been stalling in most regions, despite various forms of   government support  Foreclosures are likely to remain quite high and may depress both housing   prices and mortgage quality further  Construction generally is contracting as commercial and   industrial sectors struggle   Some glimmers of optimism were detected among firms, perhaps especially the largest   firms, although caution remains the watchword as firms worry about regulatory roulette    Investment in equipment and software is largely for maintenance or updating of technology, and   investment in structures continues very weak  Manufacturing looks to be expanding in part   because of growing export demand  Other sectors showing signs of life include energy and   petrochemicals, agriculture, shipping, and advertising  Construction remains very weak State   and local employment and investment remain tightly constrained by lower revenues   Public equity and credit markets continue to perform well, but bank lending remains   constrained  Mortgage quality is a risk for banks, and housing finance remains troubled, but   banks are able to sell their REO  Markets have expressed some concerns about sovereign risk,   notably in Greece and other European countries, which may pose risks to the banking system and   to the broader economy  Bank capital and liquidity requirements could dampen the easing of   credit conditions, which we are beginning to see   Finally, on inflation, shelter costs continue to account for part of the decline in overall   inflation, but core or trimmed measures suggest that underlying inflation trends are moving   downward in a broad-based way  Inflation expectations moderated slightly over the intermeeting   March 16, 2010 81 of 146    period, as seen, for example, in TIPS spreads  Growth in wages and unit labor costs remains low   or negative, labor market slack remains high, inflation expectations stable, and productivity   growth accelerated  The dollar has also strengthened  Near-term inflation risks appear low and   even to the downside, although expansionary monetary and fiscal policies imply some medium-  term risks   Fiscal imbalances both here and abroad could restrain growth if they push up rates, and   on the monetary side, a long period of low rates may lead to increased leverage or financial   imbalances even if they don’t cause inflation   That’s my summary  Any comments?  [No response]   Well, usually the summary is the most useful part of my presentation  I’ll say a couple of   additional things here  First of all, I think we might as well take note of the fact that this is the   one-year anniversary of the March 2009 meeting where we took some very strong measures to   add something on the order of about $1 trillion in additional asset purchases  Since then, we   have maintained our low interest rate policy  We have conducted the stress test of the banks    We have managed and closed our liquidity facilities, and the economy obviously is doing a lot   better  I don’t think that’s entirely accidental  Economic growth is where we were a year ago,   and relative to the challenges we faced a year ago, I think we should be a little bit pleased at   least   That being said, of course, the economy is still quite weak  I listen to the comments   around the table about “optimistic projections” of 3 percent growth, and I ask myself where is   that going to take us in terms of labor markets and financial conditions  So this is still quite an   unsatisfactory situation, but certainly one that we should feel we have made an important   contribution towards stabilizing   March 16, 2010 82 of 146    Looking forward, my concern basically is, again, where strong economic growth is going   to come from  I think the 3 percent scenario is plausible, but even in that case, there are   downside risks  Notably, as people have mentioned, after the big inventory correction, we’re   going to need private final demand growth to take up the slack from inventories  In order to get   its 3 percent plus growth for 2010, the Greenbook is looking for average growth in private final   demand at an annual rate of 37 percent for the rest of the year  That would be a considerable   pickup—more than 2 percent over each of the last three quarters—so there really needs to be   some pickup of final demand from where we are  It seems unlikely to come from housing, given   what’s developing there  In the household sector, I was very pleased to see, as all of us were, the   recent consumption spending numbers, which suggest we might have 3 percent growth in   consumer spending in the first quarter  But, again, will this be sustainable?  Will we see stronger   household spending?  I note one serious weakness is the lack of income growth  Real disposable   income in January of 2010 was essentially identical to what it was in January of 2009, and,   indeed, it would not have been that high except for the fact that transfer payments were up 12   percent over the year  So we’re looking at a situation where growth in income is not yet   transpiring and, therefore, we’re relying very heavily on continued confidence in the household   sector and the expected rebound in the labor market  Again, we’re looking at a situation where   we’re going to need some pickup in income and final demand to get 3 percent growth, and I   think that does pose a risk   I do think the labor market is looking a bit better  We saw some positive signs in terms   of hiring indicators, such as help wanted, workweek, diffusion indexes, and temporary work  At   the same time, of course, UI claims have remained quite sticky, and the number of people on   March 16, 2010 83 of 146    temporary and emergency unemployment is extraordinarily high, and it has not begun to come   down   A point that no one mentioned—and it’s rare at this point for me to find something that   nobody really mentioned; maybe somebody did and I missed it—is that a big uncertainty about   labor market going forward is what’s going to happen to productivity growth  The Greenbook is   projecting that, after 6 percent productivity growth in 2009, productivity will grow ¾ percent in   2010, and that provides a reasonable growth in employment  Obviously, if we get stronger   productivity growth and demand is not more robust, then we could have a worse outcome  So   there are a lot of uncertainties in the labor market   Financial conditions, as people have noted, are generally better  There certainly are some   risks  I took note of an interesting financial conditions index that was constructed by a number   of people, including our ex-colleague Governor Mishkin and others, which gave a very broad-   based look at financial conditions  The interesting result was that, although there was a big   improvement in financial conditions through most of 2009, once you hold constant the   improvement in the economy, financial conditions had become something more of a drag in the   latter part of 2009 and 2010  That’s mostly due to quantities rather than prices, for example, the   lack of rebound in securitization and the lack of rebound in lending  So I think there is, again,   still a headwind coming from the financial side   I want to restate a theme that President Hoenig has raised a couple of times and Governor   Tarullo mentioned, which is the question of financial imbalances  As inflation looks a little less   worrisome, that’s clearly something we want to pay attention to  I think you can break it down   into more than one category  I think we need to worry about valuation, that is, bubbles, asset   prices  We need to worry about leverage  And we need to worry about underwriting quality    March 16, 2010 84 of 146    Those are three separate dimensions, all of which deteriorated during the crisis  As Governor   Tarullo mentioned, Board and New York Fed staff have been looking at some of these things,   and we have various indicators for stock prices and bond spreads  We have various measures of   leverage  We are, after all, bank supervisors, and we’re telling the world we need to be bank   supervisors so that we can follow this stuff  So I would suggest that we all do it and that we   increase our focus on these things  It is possible to try to make an assessment of those risks, and   it is very important that we continue to look at them   Finally, a word on inflation  I have a small thing to add here as well on the debate about   OER  There is another important component of the inflation rate which is the nonmarket-based   component, and interestingly that turns out to be almost exactly the same weight as OER in the   PCE index, and it has been running at 26 percent, which is above the rest of the basket  So   maybe we want to put those all together in one big element and decide that it’s not making that   much difference at this point  I also looked at the various trimmed means, and we want to thank   the Dallas and Cleveland Banks for maintaining those useful numbers  As the Vice Chairman   pointed out, there does seem to be a broad-based slowing, although I think we can’t be too   complacent, certainly, and among other things, we’re still seeing some increase in energy and   commodity prices, and that is, of course, something we have to worry about   So again, I think we should be grateful for what has happened in the last year and the   stabilization we’ve seen  We do look to be in a recovery  I wish it were stronger  I wish the   labor market were improving more quickly, and we need to pay very close attention to the real   side of the economy  Regarding inflation, we must always pay attention to it  At the moment it   seems not particularly worrisome, but certainly we are in a very difficult world in which a   variety of issues, including financial imbalances, need our attention as well as the conventional   March 16, 2010 85 of 146    inflation measures  So let me stop there, and let’s turn to the policy go-around, and I’ll call on   Brian    Thank you  Are there questions for Brian?  President   Kocherlakota    We should have alternative scenarios to discuss in the next   meeting  Any other questions for Brian?  [No response]    Okay  President Plosser    Thank you  President Rosengren    In the interest of time, we will be discussing the issues of   balance sheet adjustment in April    Let’s not all give those views now  Everybody will have a   chance to discuss it  President Yellen    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  You know there are some who hold that 2010   is the last year of the previous decade  [Laughter]  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Bullard    You’re in favor of B?  If I can summarize your statement, it   is you’re in favor of B  I’m just joking  [Laughter]  Again, we will be discussing all of these   issues  Just one comment on the train wreck is that, if we wait a couple of years, we’ll be a lot   more advanced in terms of stuff running off as well  So the calculus will change over time    Who’s next?  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Lacker    For your future intellectual reputation, President Lacker, I’d   like it to be noted that you were smiling when you made that point about the accounting    [Laughter]    Yes  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo      Thank you  Vice Chairman    Okay  Thank you very much  Well, we have been, of   course, continuing the exit from nonstandard policy, for example, closing facilities We’ll be   ending MBS purchases at the end of this month  We raised the discount rate  We have been   developing and explaining exit tools  Obviously, there’s more to do, but clearly we have been   working towards normalization  On the other hand, as people have pointed out, the outlook is   one that is disappointing to all of us, I’m sure, and it’s fairly evident that we need to continue to   support the economy  Therefore, you won’t be shocked to know that I would propose that we   take alternative B, including the “extended period” language   Let me talk about that language, because I’m a little puzzled by the way some people are   characterizing it  There are two important things to say about this  Let me start off by saying   that, whether it was a good idea or not initially, it’s a sunk cost now  We have it  There is no   way that I can see that we can somehow magically get rid of it without any consequences  So it   is there, we have to manage it, and we have to deal with it   Now, having said that, let me make two comments  One is that this is clearly not a fixed   time commitment  It is a conditional statement, and we made a big point of putting in these   conditionalities when we changed the language and added them  So if there were to be, for   example, a very adverse movement in inflation expectations, then all bets are off  We have a   conditional statement here, and that would allow us to move immediately, and that provides us   with at least one safety valve  Also, I would just ask is that everybody emphasize in talking   about this publicly that it is conditional and that we are tying our policy to the state of the   economy  I think this will turn out to be important, because if, God willing, the next three   March 16, 2010 119 of 146    employment reports are 400,000, then the conditionality will be causing markets to say, “Well,   they’ve got to change now”  And our change will be, in fact, a smooth change as we do it,   because the markets will be reading from the data that policy needs to change, and, therefore, it   will, in fact, be surprising if we don’t make language changes  So I think the conditionality is   very important, and it will help us when the economy becomes clearly ready for tightened policy   The second comment I want to make is that there’s this perception somehow that because   of this language we now have to figure out six months in advance when we have to tighten   policy  That’s not true  The day that we change this language we have tightened policy  So, if   in April, for example, we were to change to C′, put in “some time,” and put in the exit tools,   those would be a more powerful impact than a normal increase in the funds rate  We would   actually begin to raise the funds rate, say in August, but the policy would clearly be much tighter   from the moment we make that statement  So it’s not the case that we are stuck at a maximally   accommodative situation until six months from the time we finally decide to move  In fact, the   day that we make the statement it will respond   I recognize, you know, that there are pros and cons to this kind of language  I do think it   was helpful, at least for some time  But it doesn’t box us in, I don’t think, quite as seriously as   some of the discussion has suggested  That being said, we need to be very careful with it,   because we don’t really want to remove it until such time as we are ready essentially to tighten   financial conditions   To use that to think about the statement, several people talked about adding the   alternative C language on exit  I think that’s not the right thing to do today  We haven’t had the   discussion  We’re going to have it in April  I agree with President Lacker, by the way, that,   when we do add it, if it’s appropriate, then having the extended period language to kind of   March 16, 2010 120 of 146    protect against the misinterpretation would probably be a good idea, but we’ll discuss that when   the time comes  Like Governor Tarullo, I’m not completely persuaded that the statement is the   right place to put this  It’s conceivable that speeches and minutes, and so on, might be a better   place to provide a more extensive explanation, but that’s something, also, that we should discuss   in April as we come back to this   I want to come back to financial conditions just one more time I do realize—and   President Hoenig has been very eloquent on this issue—that it’s very difficult to know  We want   to do our best  I think we should try to monitor it  It can’t hurt to monitor and to try to identify   problems  I realize that that’s imperfect, but we should clearly make this one of the things that   we continue to look at, and I would urge research staff, and so on, to increase their attention of   this  But there are dangers both ways  An example I would raise would be the case of the   Japanese  If you think that our policy has been static—of course, they had interest rates at zero   for seven years—and on two occasions—I believe, this is just my recollection, I haven’t checked   it—they were concerned about the financial implications of their low interest rate policy  It was   causing the money market not to operate, and they were concerned that it was supporting zombie   lending, because, with zero interest rates, there was no trigger for bankruptcy  On two occasions   they raised interest rates to 25 basis points, and both times it was considered ex post to have been   a very serious error, and they retracted, because it had negative consequences for the economy   We do have all of these concerns, and we do have to balance them off  There is a big   picture  It’s a very, very difficult situation  It’s not because of our actions  I think it’s just   because it is inherently going to be a difficult set of tradeoffs that we have to face as we go   forward   March 16, 2010 121 of 146    With respect to the language, in terms of people who expressed an opinion, the majority   were not in favor of adding the second sentence in paragraph 2  If anyone who didn’t speak   would like to support it, I’ll give you a chance to do that in a minute  But I got a pretty strong   sense of concern, not about the language per se, but about its interpretation in the context of our   statement   President Bullard suggested changing paragraph B1 by adding the “however” statement   from A1  I think the reason that that was not done initially is because there are already two   references to the labor market—“the labor market stabilizing” and “household spending is   constrained by high unemployment”  So that would be a third statement about the labor market   in that one paragraph  I don’t think it’s an incorrect statement  If there are people who would   like to make that change, I think that’s fine, and I’ll open the floor for that in a minute     Again, I don’t think I would like to add the sequencing language today, and I do think   that, putting aside even the short-run implications, the “extended period” language is not as   restrictive as some have suggested  I realize it is to some extent restrictive, but I think there are   some ways to deal with that situation   Let me stop here  If there’s anyone who did not speak on the B2 language and would like   to support it, we can hear that  And does anyone have any views on President Bullard’s   suggestion about replacing the “however” sentence in B1 with the “however” sentence in A1?    So let me just raise those two questions  Would anyone like to comment?  Brian?    Okay  Should we make the change, then?  I guess that   would amount to going back to the January language   March 16, 2010 122 of 146     The proposal is to replace “However, investment in   nonresidential structures is declining, and housing starts have been flat at a depressed level,”   with, “However, investment in nonresidential structures is still contracting, housing activity   continues to be sluggish, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls”  Now, that actually   changes some of the adjectives as well    All right  So let’s add a third clause that employers remain   reluctant to add to payrolls  Is that something that people are comfortable with?  [No response]    I’m not getting a whole lot of reaction  Are you okay?      Everyone okay?     All right  So the changes in Statement B, paragraph 1, take   out the “and” before “housing starts,” comma, and then add the clause “and employers remain   reluctant to add to payrolls”  Would anyone else like to comment on my comments or on the   statement?  [No response]   All right  Hearing none, does anyone want to hear that paragraph read again?  [No   response]  Okay  If not, perhaps we can vote on this    Thank you  The next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday,   April 27th and 28th  We will, of course, be discussing more on the exit strategy as well as the   policy decision   Lunch is available  Meeting is adjourned  Thank you   END OF MEETING   March 16, 2010 124 of 146     "
8951,2010-04-27,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  First Vice President Holcomb   will be sitting in for President Fisher today—welcome, Helen   Before I begin the formal part of the meeting, I think we ought to acknowledge an   epochal event in the history of the Federal Reserve  Today is Don Kohn’s last FOMC meeting,   assuming, of course, that he retires as he plans  [Laughter]  That’s always a risk    I think it should be noted that since 1981 Don has attended   221 FOMC meetings, in a range of capacities, and missed only eight meetings in the past   30 years  So I wonder about those eight meetings  [Laughter and applause]  We will have an   informal opportunity to say good-bye to Don and to thank him and honor him for all of his   enormous contributions  But I just wanted to take say how much we appreciate what you’ve   done and, personally, how much I owe you and the institution owes you for your contributions   over many years, and particularly over the last couple of years    I need a motion to close the Board meeting    Well done    Governor Kohn is a little punchy today, I think   All right  Our first item of business is our briefing on financial developments, open   market operations, and system facilities  Let me turn first to Brian Sack   April 27–28, 2010 4 of 206                    Before we go to Q&A, I just want to reiterate what Brian   said about governance  The Board and the FOMC have been working very closely and   cooperatively together on these monetary policy issues, as evidenced by the fact that this is a   joint Board–FOMC meeting  So even though the reverse repurchase agreements are technically   an FOMC responsibility and the TDF is technically a Board responsibility, we should work   together to make sure that they operate together in a seamless fashion, and I give you my   assurances that that will be the case   April 27–28, 2010 11 of 206                   Starting with questions, I’d like to kick things off quickly  Brian, if Greece defaults or   restructures, have you thought about potential contagion effects on the US financial system or   economy?    Thanks  Any questions for our colleagues?  President   Lockhart    President Kocherlakota   April 27–28, 2010 13 of 206                    President Rosengren    Other questions?  [No response]  All right, seeing no   questions, we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations    Without objection  The other piece of business is the swaps   for Canada and Mexico  As you remember, we have discussed the possibility of a broader swaps   program, including a range of central bank counterparties, but we agreed to put that off for some   time, until we get a clearer sense of where financial regulatory reform is, and so on  But we have   been renewing these relatively small North American swaps for some time  Does anyone want   to discuss or raise questions about this proposal?  [No response]  If not, we need a vote    Is there anyone who would like to vote against it?  [No   response]  All right, seeing none, we’ll accept that proposal   The next item is a briefing on asset sales and redemptions  I want to congratulate the   staff on a really very, very helpful and thorough set of memoranda  It was an awful lot of work   and extremely informative, so thank you for that  Let me now turn to Brian Madigan to lead that   briefing    Thank you  Are there questions for the staff?  [No   response]  If no questions, I’d like to take comments from participants on this broad set of   April 27–28, 2010 19 of 206                   issues—Treasuries, agencies, and the exit strategy overall  Let me briefly try to frame the   discussion and lay out some of the issues I think we need to resolve   First of all, even though the staff simulations, except for the first, all assume Treasury   redemptions, I just want to make sure we all agree or understand that this is in fact a quite   consequential decision  There are some obvious advantages to Treasury redemptions  It would   be an easy way, relatively speaking, to shed duration and begin to shrink the balance sheet and   reduce excess reserves  To give you an idea of the magnitude here, if we began doing   redemptions on May 3, we would be able to shed about $60 billion from the balance sheet in the   rest of 2010, about $70 billion in 2011, and about $140 billion in 2012  So, by the end of 2012,   we would be able to lower our Treasury holdings by about $270 billion, which is obviously   consequential   At the same time, while that has its advantages, of course, it would be a tightening of   policy, and one that’s not widely anticipated at this point  I think one of the contributions of the   staff analysis was to make us think about the general equilibrium implications of these decisions    In particular, if we were to tighten policy via Treasury redemptions, then the envelope theorem   (or something) would tell you that you have to adjust appropriately on other dimensions    Another issue to consider with doing Treasury redemptions is that it may or may not complicate   the path from where we are now to the ultimate desired composition of our balance sheet,   including not just all-Treasuries but also the maturity structure that we hope to have   There are a number of issues involved, and I would like your considered views on   Treasury redemptions  If we decide to do Treasury redemptions—and the same is true with the   other issues, for example agency sales—we don’t necessarily have to do it at this meeting  We   April 27–28, 2010 20 of 206                   can, obviously, communicate in various ways and make a decision at the next meeting  But this   is, I think, a very important issue   Another issue, most obviously, is when and how to sell some of our agency securities    My sense from previous discussions is that most people would like to sell at some point, because   the implication otherwise is that we would be holding MBS for a very long time  Nevertheless,   there are important questions of timing  Should it be done after rates rise or at a fixed time?    How far in the future?  How quickly?  How conditional on the economy?  And how should we   communicate that?  I think, broadly speaking, that the issues related to agency MBS tie very   closely to the general question of what our appropriate sequencing should be  I also do think it’s   important to keep in mind that we could, of course, make provisional decisions at any point, or   decide how we’re going to proceed to a certain point, and then leave flexibility at a later point    Again, in the spirit of what Brian said, there are a lot of different degrees of freedom here   There is one thing I want to achieve today  I don’t by any means think we need to come   to a full and final set of decisions, particularly quantitative decisions, today about the exit   strategy or the sales strategy  But it would be very helpful if we could refine our strategy   sufficiently that we collectively, in the minutes and so on, can begin to reduce to some extent the   uncertainty in the market about how we’re going to be proceeding  So if we set that not-too-  ambitious objective, meeting it would be a very useful accomplishment for this meeting  Let me   stop there and begin a discussion  I had first on the list President Lacker    Thank you, President Lacker  President Bullard    I think Milton Friedman was concerned about the reduction   in excess reserves in 1937 and 1938, so I don’t want you to take his name in vain    I think so  But I actually have a substantive question for   you  I was listening very carefully, and I didn’t hear anything that clarified for me whether you   thought the Treasury redemptions issue was something that should be delayed or part of the   broader strategy     Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Kocherlakota   April 27–28, 2010 31 of 206                    Okay  Governor Kohn    Thank you  First Vice President Holcomb    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  Can I take from your remarks that you are okay   on redemptions?    President Plosser    I think I can assure you this will be in the minutes, we’re in   good shape on that score  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    Well, it will be in the minutes, obviously    We can discuss that tomorrow    Well, the minutes will reflect the variety and the depth of   the discussion  President Pianalto    Thanks  We have a few more speakers, but it’s four   o’clock, and maybe it’s time for a 15-minute, 20-minute break  Say 415  There’s coffee   outside  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we recommence?  Governor Warsh, you’re next   April 27–28, 2010 50 of 206                    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  As always, thank you for a very informative   discussion  I don’t want to make the staff blush again, but their work, I think, really helped us to   shape the discussion very, very well   April 27–28, 2010 58 of 206                   We don’t have to come to final decisions today, obviously  But let me just try to   summarize what I heard, with the understanding that the minutes, in particular, will convey the   richness of the discussion  First, as a number of people commented, our first objective is to meet   the dual mandate  Other considerations should be subject to that requirement  One implication   of that is that we should consider the implications of the policy decisions we take for financial   market conditions, and changes in the setting of one particular tool need to be appropriately   adjusted against other tools  So, first, our dual mandate is the ultimate objective   Second, subject to the constraint that we want to meet the dual mandate, I think it’s fair to   say that most of the Committee thinks it is important to move toward normalizing both the size   and the composition of the balance sheet  There were some disagreements about how quickly,   how slowly, how flexibly to do that, but many at least thought that a reasonable target was about   five years after the commencement of an asset sales program  So that gives an order of   magnitude I think, which seemed to be a center of gravity, but, obviously, people can differ on   that   Third, if we’re going to normalize the balance sheet, and, in particular, improve monetary   control, that naturally implies that at some point we will begin to sell MBS and agency debt  In   describing that, I’d like to quote a sentence that was in my own testimony, which was released   on February 10 on prospective sales  I said, “Any such sales would be at a gradual pace, would   be clearly communicated to market participants, and would entail appropriate consideration of   economic conditions”  What I was trying to convey there is consistent with several points that I   heard in the discussion  One is that, again, most people wanted to do it on a relatively gradual   and steady schedule; another is that communication in advance is going to be very important;   April 27–28, 2010 59 of 206                   and, another is that there’s going to be at least some degree of conditionality, in that we will   consider economic and financial conditions as we move forward and maintain that flexibility   Fourth, with respect to sequencing, there were several views, including the LIFO   approach that focuses first on asset sales, or mixed approaches that combine interest rate moves,   reserve draining, and asset sales  I do think it’s fair to say that a plurality or perhaps a majority   did prefer using interest rate policy as the first tool  And my basis for that inference is that an   absolute majority of the people speaking did prefer option 2, which does have the IOER rate   moving first  I think there are good arguments for using interest rate policy  It is very familiar   and, clearly, is something that people will understand—communication, I think, would be   simpler  That being said, I think there is one possible compromise that we might consider as we   go along  At some point, if we have not already begun the process of moving interest rates—it   may not be very far in the future—we might, in the interests of market certainty, want to lay out   a schedule for sales  And then depending on when we raise interest rates, either could come first    It could happen that the announcement came first  I think that would be fine  But in terms of—I   hate to use the term “fine-tuning”—in terms of the active monetary policy action, interest rates   obviously need to be an important part of that   A number of people put a lot of weight on communication, although I heard most people   talking more about general strategies as opposed to specific parameters, which we’re not quite   ready to put out  Minutes, testimony, and speeches are obviously good mechanisms for that, and   I would hope that over the next intermeeting period we will be conveying these broad points to   the public to allow them to begin to digest that  A few participants favored the use of the   statement  I’m open to the use of the statement, but I think we ought to wait to do that until we   April 27–28, 2010 60 of 206                   have an explicit schedule to announce—we don’t want to say in the statement that at some point   we plan to sell MBS   Those are just some observations  Again, the minutes will convey the richness of the   discussion  But I think that was very helpful   On redemptions, we’ll discuss this more tomorrow, because it’s on the table for   tomorrow’s policy decision  My sense of the discussion was that most people around the table   were at least willing to accept the idea of moving forward with redemptions  There were a   number of people who pointed out that it would constitute a tightening and on that basis they   were more ambivalent   Without presupposing our outcome tomorrow, I’d just like to point out that we do have a   number of options  One option would be to decide tomorrow that we want to announce that   we’re going to begin to redeem all Treasuries  A second option, which might make some of   those who are concerned about tightening more comfortable, would be to continue to discuss   variants of this option, not put it in the statement tomorrow, but note that this will appear in the   minutes and will be signaled and will, therefore, begin to acclimatize the market to this   possibility  There’s President Lacker’s variant as well, but I would just bring to your attention   two other variants  One is that several people mentioned that we could roll over Treasuries into   bills  Governor Duke, there were some issues associated with that, but I think that, by   purchasing bills separately, we could largely address those, although there would be some   technical issues  Another variant that we might want to think about would be as follows  If our   goal is to reduce the duration of our balance sheet, or to take an intermediate type of step, we   might redeem only the securities that had a long initial maturity and keep the three-year   securities, which are going to be part of our longer-term portfolio anyway  That creates fewer   April 27–28, 2010 61 of 206                   transactions to get to where we ultimately want to be  So there are a number of options  We’ll   come back to this tomorrow for, I hope, a fuller discussion  But, again, thank you for your   thoughts  Any reactions or comments?    Yes    If we were to redeem only securities with original   maturities longer than three, five, or seven years, what would the total redemptions be?    Do you think you can get numbers for tomorrow?    Terrific  Anything else?  [No response]  All right, we can   now turn to the second agenda item, the economic situation, and turn to Dave Stockton and   Nathan Sheets to give us the overview    Thank you very much  Questions for the staff?  Anyone?    President Lacker    President Lacker, another possible measurement issue is tax   refunds, which are not counted as current income but are probably higher this quarter than they   have been on average  That also could explain part of the change    Sorry to pursue this, but you’ve got me interested now    It would be a wealth effect mostly, and that has got to   balance out  Any write-down on liabilities would have to balance out on the asset side,   obviously  But are you referring to the flow of payments, the interest payments?    Right    An interjection by Governor Kohn    Governor Duke, did you have something on this?   April 27–28, 2010 73 of 206                    I am really impressed by the perspicacity of the group here    [Laughter]  President Lockhart, do you have a question?  No?    Any other questions?  President Bullard    They’ve been very clear that they’re concerned that a   restructuring would just create contagion and lead to a run on other countries  At the same time,   they have another serious issue  There’s a very severe doubt that this coalition could come   together to do the same thing for Portugal or another country   Vice Chairman, you had an interjection?    Any other questions?  President Hoenig    Questions?  President Evans    Any other questions?  President Kocherlakota    Other questions?   [No response]   April 27–28, 2010 78 of 206                    Well, we need to start the go-round, but I guess I would be   happy to leave that till tomorrow morning if that’s your preference  Yes?  All right, I believe   that the reception is available on the terrace to be followed by an informal dinner with no   business  Thank you and I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 900 am   [Meeting recessed]   April 27–28, 2010 79 of 206                4 The chart is appended to this transcript (appendix 4)      April 28—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody  We had a number of phone   calls from Europe this morning  Markets are fairly stressed  For example, some of the banks are   having difficulty getting dollars at this point, so there is a great deal of concern  The markets   have apparently fully priced in default by Greece, so there’s a lot of discussion going on about   how to address that concern, and, in particular, whether other countries that are similarly situated   should take preemptive steps to forestall concerns about their fiscal situation  We’ll have   additional calls later today and tomorrow   The Vice Chairman was on a call this morning  We’ll let you go first in the go-round,   and you can report additionally on that   I understand Nathan has distributed a chart to answer a question that was raised yesterday   about the residual maturity of outstanding debt4  Does anyone have any questions about that?    Are you trying to cheer us all up?   On a different topic, after hearing our discussion yesterday, I consulted with a few   people, and I thought it might be worthwhile to have the staff give us a bit more information on                                                      April 27–28, 2010 80 of 206                                     5 The material used by Mr Sack is appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   the redemption options, and they, as usual, have come through with useful information  Let me   turn it over, if I may, to Brian Sack, to run through this information    Thanks  Any questions for Brian?  [No response]  I think I   owe you a bit of an apology  I think the Treasury redemptions idea was a little half-baked  My   sense is that we’re not quite ready to work through this  I think the question is  What is our   objective?  Are we trying to get to a specific maturity structure as we normalize our portfolio?    How quickly?  What are the implications for the balance sheet in general, and for things like   capital gains and losses?  I want to hear everybody’s views on this—perhaps in the policy round   might be the best time  But I want at least to raise the option that we might want to instruct staff   to give us a fuller description of the issues, including issues relating to Treasury issuance, and so   on, before we take this action  But if there is a strong view to move ahead, we certainly can   discuss that  Any questions or comments?  [No response]  If not, let’s go ahead with the go-  round, and let the Vice Chairman move up so he can talk about Greece    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  Of course, the alternative scenarios, to some   extent, look at those    That point is very well taken    Yes    Good  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Lockhart   April 27–28, 2010 97 of 206                    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  First Vice President Holcomb    Thank you  President Evans, how’s the optimism in   Chicago?   April 27–28, 2010 103 of 206                    Thank you  President Yellen   April 27–28, 2010 106 of 206                    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig      Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Governor Kohn    You’ll be free soon, right?    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo   April 27–28, 2010 127 of 206                    Thank you very much  I understand that coffee is ready    Why don’t we take 20 minutes and come back after that?  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Okay, we’re ready to recommence  Let me thank you again   for your useful input and discussion in the go-round  Let me try, as usual, to summarize a lot of   information in a short space   Intermeeting data tended to support the view that a moderate and sustainable recovery is   under way, albeit from a low base, with final demand replacing the inventory cycle and fiscal   stimulus as the principal sources of impetus  There are risks to the economic growth outlook in   both directions, but overall they have shifted somewhat to the upside  Inflation has generally   been slowing and is expected to stay low, though medium-term risks continue in both directions   Retail sales, and household spending more generally, have recently picked up, despite   sluggish income and wage growth and a still low savings rate  Pent-up demand may be in   evidence, and consumers are still looking for value and focusing on necessities  The   sustainability of consumption spending is a key issue  Considerable slack remains in the labor   market, including among the most-educated workers, as well as those usually hit by cyclical   downturns  Longer-term unemployment may have longer-term consequences  Wage pressures   remain low  Despite these negatives, there are some early and modest signs of stabilization  I   will return to that point  Housing activity is mixed, with some positive indicators such as those   April 27–28, 2010 131 of 206                   from furniture producers—that was in Richmond  Delinquencies and foreclosures, which could   be inadvertently extended by restructuring programs, will put downward pressure on house   prices and consumer wealth  Nonresidential construction continues to be moribund   Financial markets generally continue to improve, supportive of recovery, with stock   prices up and bond spreads down  Large firms have little difficulty accessing credit  Financial   conditions overall are close to neutral, though, despite very low policy rates  The Greek situation   has revived concerns about sovereign debt and worsened prospects for Europe— and potentially,   for the United States as well  In the banking sector, banks are somewhat more optimistic than   they have been recently, as profits have returned and the economy has looked a bit better  Banks   view credit as being constrained primarily by a lack of credit demand and creditworthy   borrowers, but, on the other hand, the Senior Loan Officers Survey and other anecdotes suggest   that credit remains quite tight for bank-dependent borrowers such as small firms and consumers    Commercial real estate remains an important concern for smaller banks, especially community   banks   Firms continue to worry about economic and regulatory uncertainty, but there are more   expressions of optimism  Investment in equipment and software, notably IT, has picked up    Sectors that were cited as showing strength include manufacturing, energy excluding natural gas,   temporary help, transportation, and agriculture  Firms continue to pursue productivity   enhancements and offshoring  Employment plans are somewhat muted, though there were   reports of employee callbacks  State and local government finances remain strained, with some   small signs of improvement   On the inflation front, energy and commodity prices have risen further, reflecting global   demand  However, overall inflation continues to decelerate and is expected to remain low in the   April 27–28, 2010 132 of 206                6 The handout used by Chairman Bernanke is appended to this transcript (appendix 6)      near term  This decline is broad-based, as reflected in the median CPI, although distortions in   the housing market and rents may be masking inflation trends to some extent   Inflation expectations are generally well anchored, though forward breakevens have risen   some recently  The ability of firms to pass through higher costs seems limited, given slack in   product markets, but some diffusion indexes show a modest increase in expected prices received    There are a number of risks, including the risk of further disinflation, though that is constrained   by stable expectations  Risks to the upside include more rapid economic growth than expected,   threats to Fed independence, the size of the balance sheet, and the fiscal situation   Any reactions?  [No response]  Seeing none, I have a handout for my remarks6  I   thought I’d add some color to the discussion here  Very briefly, I share the view that we have   increased confidence at this point that a recovery has begun  At the risk of sounding like I’m   looking at a half-empty glass, though, I think we shouldn’t put this one in the books yet   Notably, we’re putting a lot of weight on consumer spending, and, for reasons discussed   today, the strength we’ve seen in consumer spending recently is not necessarily sustainable  One   indicator of that is the very low saving rate, 33 percent, which suggests that there’s little scope   for further strength and that there may be some need for consumers to raise saving rates and to   build wealth  The other related risk, of course, is the labor market, where, as I’ll discuss in more   detail in a moment, the actual net job gains at this point are very limited, and that, of course,   interacts with consumer spending  So overall, again, I share the view that we have more   confidence now about the recovery under way  It still appears to be moderate, which means that   it will have a relatively slow impact on the unemployment rate, but I think there remain some   uncertainties about the sustainability of final demand and improvements in the labor market                                                      April 27–28, 2010 133 of 206                   I thought I would just take a minute or two to try to talk about how to gauge our policy   stance, recognizing that there are many considerations, including nonstandard policies, which   need to be taken into account  In the handout, the part that says “Comparison of Taylor Rule   Prescriptions” is just a simple attempt to look at basic Taylor rules to see where we are relative to   the tightening cycle  Instead of using the sophisticated estimated Taylor rules and the Taylor   rules using lagged interest rates, etc, I have just used the most basic Taylor rules here  The   Taylor 1993 rules, which are shown as dashed lines, are just the basic Taylor rule with a real   interest rate of 2, a weight on inflation 1½, and a weight on the output gap of 05  The only   differences are which inflation rate is used to measure inflation  The solid lines show the Taylor   rule, but with the coefficient on the output gap changed from 05 to 10, which is a somewhat   more activist rule that Taylor himself supported in his discussion of papers in a 1999 volume on   Taylor rule prescriptions   Looking at this, I’d like to make some observations  Only one inflation measure puts the   optimal inflation rate at this point, on this metric, above zero, and that measure is the overall CPI   using the 1993 rule—the dashed red line in the top diagram  However, I think it’s important to   note, for what it’s worth, that that particular version of the rule doesn’t describe our own   historical behavior very well  There is, of course, the period from 2003 to 2006, where the black   line, which is the actual funds rate, was below this prescription; of course, Taylor views that as a   mistake  But another example is mid-2008; this rule would have suggested that we should have   raised interest rates substantially then because of the high oil prices; obviously we did not do   that, and I think we agree that was the right decision  All the other inflation measures, however,   suggest that we are still below zero in terms of where policy ought to be  The original Taylor   rule of 1993—the dashed blue line in the top diagram—uses his original price measure, the GDP   April 27–28, 2010 134 of 206                   deflator, which shows the optimal interest rate still at about minus 2 percent  Alternatively, if   you use core measures, as shown in the bottom diagram, note how much better that fits our   actual behavior  I think that reflects our tendency to focus more on forecasts—whether or not   those are good forecasts, as President Bullard has commented—and that, in turn, has reflected   our tendency to treat oil price increases as transitory, for better or worse  So I hope this is some   comfort to those of you who are concerned that we are behind the curve  Based on this very   simple indicator, at least, we’re not, evidently, too easy at this point   I also have some comments on the rest of the handout  The table at the very bottom   shows the recent evolution of consumer prices and M2  The Taylor rules that I already showed   you use four-quarter moving inflation rates  If you used current-quarter inflation rates, the   results would be much more dramatic According to this table, any reasonable measure of   inflation—including the CPI excluding owners’ equivalent rent—has showed substantial   deceleration from the twelve-month to the three-month horizon  And that is associated, in   addition, with a slowdown in monetary growth—M2 over the last three months was -15 percent    Related to that, nominal GDP growth in 2009 was, I believe, 07 percent, which is very slow   I also made an attempt to look at the timing of the initial tightening of policy relative to   what’s going on in the labor market  In the figure, the blue line is the real-time Greenbook   estimate of the unemployment gap, and the red line plots a retrospective  Let’s focus on the blue   line, because we are living in real time, of course  It gives some indication of where policy   began to tighten after the peak in unemployment  Looking strictly at the unemployment rate,   some of these results suggest that we may be getting close to the point of tightening; for   example, in 2003–2004, we tightened a year after the peak, and, at 7/10 of a decline from the   April 27–28, 2010 135 of 206                   peak in unemployment; that would suggest something like late this year as the tightening point,   which is certainly a possibility   But another perspective is given by the table in the middle of the page that shows the net   changes in nonfarm payrolls from the peak in unemployment to the first move in policy for each   of the four episodes  It’s measured both in millions of workers and in percent of employment    You can see that, in both the 1982 and the 2003 episodes, more than a million jobs were created   before the first move in policy  In the 1992 episode, four million jobs were created before the   first move in policy  At this point, net job increases since the peak in the unemployment rate in   October are about 120,000  So we’re clearly not very far along in the job-creation process in   terms of the timing of our policy response   I don’t want to take this as at all definitive  There are lots of things happening  I myself   have argued against using oversimplified Taylor rules, because we want to look at the full   outlook and look at all of the considerations  But I hoped these charts and tables would be   useful   One issue, of course, which Tom and others have cited, is whether we’re creating asset   price imbalances  I also agree very much with President Rosengren’s suggestion earlier that we   incorporate more explicitly financial stability issues into our meetings and into our analysis  A   certain amount of that has been going on  A number of Board staff, and staff in New York, and   some others have done some analysis  Although, admittedly, it’s very difficult analysis to do, it   appears that financial conditions are not excessively easy at this point, that risk premiums and   spreads are not excessively thin, and that measures of leverage do not yet show any significant   move in a worrisome direction  That being said, these are very difficult matters to measure, and   April 27–28, 2010 136 of 206                   we will have to continue paying attention to them  Let me stop there, and turn to Bill English,   who will introduce the policy go-round    Thank you  Are there questions for Bill?  [No response]   If not, let me say first, as I noted this morning—and with apologies for the head fake—my   recommendation to the Committee is that we let the staff have one more intermeeting period to   evaluate the implications of various redemption strategies for the evolution of the maturity   structure of our balance sheet—for the size of the balance sheet and its composition—and to   make sure that there are no unexpected problems with Treasury auctions and similar   considerations  If you disagree with that, and you would like to reconsider, please feel free to   say so in your commentary  Or, if you have suggestions or recommendations to the staff for   their analysis, please make them as well   Let’s begin the go-round, and I’ll start with President   Plosser    Thank you, we will certainly continue those discussions    President Rosengren    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    You were a bit ambiguous  Did you say you favored   redemptions or not?    Thank you  First Vice President Holcomb    Thank you  Governor Kohn    What are the odds?  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig   April 27–28, 2010 153 of 206                    Thank you  That’s very thought-provoking  President   Lockhart    Thank you  President Lacker     Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    I’ll double-cross you and put them in blue next time    [Laughter]  Governor Tarullo     Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you very much  I would like to recommend   alternative B, which I think most people were comfortable with  We would exclude entirely   paragraph 4  There’s no reason to make reference to it if we’re not undertaking redemptions at   this time   I’d like to make a few comments and a general observation, and then I’ll come back to a   language question  First of all, on the “extended period” language, I do really feel, as was   mentioned by Governor Warsh, that this is not much of a constraint at this point  We have done   a good job of expressing the conditionality associated with our policy  In addition, I think that at   this point the language has kind of flipped—at one point it was pushing out our ease further than   the data might otherwise imply, but at this point, I think we’re in a situation where the removal   of the language will bring the expected tightening up even more than the data would imply  So,   to some extent, it’s an historical accident that we’re at this point  Now that we are at this point,   I’d say that we need to think very carefully about the steps that we take as we come to the point   where we change the language, because, when we do change the language, it will be de facto a   tightening of policy  There is a piece of evidence in favor of what I’m saying  If you look at   dealers’ expectations, on the one hand they do not expect any change in this language at this   meeting; on the other hand, a very substantial number of them expect a tightening before the end   of the year  So those two things are not inconsistent, and, again, we need to think carefully   before we take that step since, it will have a lot of information in it   Second, on communications about sales, let me say to President Kocherlakota that I   appreciated your comments, and you’ve been very constructive on this whole topic  I do think   that, although we have a broad consensus, we have not yet identified a specific plan, so we will   be better off putting this in the minutes and allowing some socialization in the markets and in the   April 27–28, 2010 168 of 206                   public  Then, when the time comes for us to lay out a specific plan, this will not be a total   shock—we will have done our job of communicating and warning the public in advance  I   remind you that, when we began the purchases, the first reference we made to it was when we   stated how much we were going to buy and over what time period  So I would advocate that   strategy, while agreeing that there was a substantial consensus around the table that sales are   needed in order both to normalize policy and to normalize our balance sheet   Now let me make a general comment  I recognize that it might appear to some of you   that I’m someone who has a weight of zero on inflation and a weight of one on employment    That’s certainly not the case  I believe I have a balanced view of both sides of our dual mandate    But I think there’s kind of a psychological problem  We have eight meetings a year, and   therefore we have to do eight things every year—it’s very hard psychologically to be patient    But right now I do believe that we are in a situation where we have real threats of weakness and   of failure of the recovery and disinflation  While there are certainly real concerns on the other   side of this—and I understand the concerns that those of you who would like to move more   quickly have raised—they’re still more prospective than real  Financial imbalances and inflation   are risks, and we need to pay attention to them, but I don’t think that at this point they quite   outweigh the real and present danger that we face in the economy  So that’s why I would like to   maintain the low policy rate for now  When the appropriate time comes, of course, we will   move   I’d also like to point out that, as President Hoenig mentioned, we have been in a gradual   process of normalization and tightening  This goes back to last year, and I think it has been very   successful  I would just encourage everyone to think of it in those terms, namely, that we will   continue to move forward as economic conditions warrant, conditionally, in a process of   April 27–28, 2010 169 of 206                   normalization  If there is no large, discrete jump in market prices— I think that will be a sign of   good communication, good preparation, and good management  So I’m very much in agreement   that we need to normalize  I think that we need to be patient in terms of looking at the relative   risks that we face, but, of course, we will move at the appropriate time and will continue to move   toward a more normal level of the policy rate  So, again, my recommendation is to hold off on   any significant change in the policy statement  We will have two job reports between now and   June, and it’s entirely possible that we’re going to have a different perspective at that time, but   right now I think, again, we are still very early in the recovery process   With respect to language, the most creativity was exhibited by President Bullard  Again,   I’m not in favor of dropping “extended period”  However, President Bullard did suggest   replacing the second paragraph of alternative B with the inflation paragraph from alternative C  I   believe we actually discussed this last time and decided not to make the change  But I personally   do not have any credible objection to the second paragraph of C  If anyone else wants to speak   in favor or against, I’d be happy to put that on the table   President Plosser    Anyone else interested?    Vice Chair   April 27–28, 2010 170 of 206                    All right  Anyone else?    All right  Well, again, the basic point of alternative C   paragraph 2 is entirely valid, and I don’t object to our making that point frequently, but, once   again, there’s a little hysteresis, I think, in this process  Any comments?  [No response]  All   right, let me then propose that we adopt alternative B, excluding paragraph 4  Matt    Thank you very much The next meeting is June 22 and   23—a two-day meeting  It will be another opportunity to discuss important topics  President   Hoenig    Do people agree that we will be ready at least to discuss   plans on that issue?  Although there is some constraint in terms of the amount of time that the   staff has, I think that’s a very, very useful suggestion  Anyone else?   April 27–28, 2010 171 of 206                    Yes    Thank you for your extraordinary service  Everyone is   going to miss you very much, and you played a very important role in this Committee for many,   many years, and we’re all very grateful   Again, lunch will be available, and Linda Robertson, I believe, is prepared to talk about   current legislative developments  Thank you   END OF MEETING   April 27–28, 2010 172 of 206     "
8976,2010-05-09,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  I’m sorry to interrupt your   Mother’s Day  I hope this won’t be too lengthy a meeting  The topic for today is the request that   we now have to activate the foreign currency swaps—when we spoke on Friday, we had not   received any formal request  Yesterday Jean-Claude Trichet called me and made what I would   characterize as a personal appeal to reopen the swaps that we had before  This morning I have   gotten, again, personal calls from Mervyn King, of the Bank of England, and Masaaki   Shirakawa, of the Bank of Japan, also asking us to reopen the swaps  I’m also informed—and   later we can ask Nathan Sheets to talk about this—that the Bank of Canada and the Swiss   National Bank are also interested in joining a multilateral swaps arrangement among the G-7   plus Switzerland   Let me give you general background on the discussions that I have been having, and then   we can have a couple of comments from staff  After that, we’ll want to have a go-round or an   open discussion session, so that I can hear your views on how we should proceed with this   First of all, as you know, there has been a lot of activity over the weekend in Europe    There’s a great deal of concern there about what’s going to happen tomorrow and this week in   financial markets  Friday evening, Ecofin, which is the leadership of the EU for economic   matters, met and, as you probably read in the paper, announced some plans to set up a financing   mechanism in Europe that would ultimately be used to guarantee the debt of sovereign nations in   the euro zone  Ecofin is meeting today, beginning around 900 am our time, and they expect to   be done around noon or 1230 pm our time  They will be prepared to announce additional   measures  I have a call with the G-7 ministers and governors at 200 pm our time, where we   will hear in detail what Ecofin is planning  Again, I think the basic proposals will be some kind   May 9, 2010 3 of 42             of guarantee mechanism for euro debt, plus, we hope—although we’re not certain—that there   will be new austerity measures from Portugal and Spain, and additional mechanisms or steps   may be taken as well  We know that things are being discussed, but nothing concrete has been   agreed upon   Very importantly, the European Central Bank this morning had a meeting of its Executive   Board and came to some very significant decisions  Jean-Claude Trichet shared them with me   this morning on a highly confidential basis  Of course, I want to tell you about them, but this is   extremely confidential, so please take that into account  The ECB is very concerned about the   situation, and you will be able to see that in terms of the actions that they have decided to take   First, they will be restoring their three-month and six-month fixed-rate tenders, which   essentially provide an unlimited supply of funding to their banking system at fixed rates over   three and six months; from their perspective, this amounts to reopening the unusual liquidity   measures that they had shut down before  That is important, but it’s not the most important   thing  The novel intervention, and one that will be highly controversial in Europe, and probably   here as well, is that the ECB is preparing to have an open-ended intervention policy in any   market that they deem dysfunctional or illiquid  That means that they will stand ready to buy   any public or private security, denominated in euros, that’s traded in a market in which there is   dysfunction or disorderly movement  There will be no limit to the amount that they are going to   be prepared to buy   The philosophy underlying this is, I think, analogous to foreign exchange rate   intervention; that is, they’re not setting up a fixed amount that they are going to buy, as we did   with our securities purchases, and they are not setting up a facility that will buy bonds as offered   at a fixed rate  Rather, they are going to enter markets tactically and randomly in ways that will   May 9, 2010 4 of 42             try to make it expensive for speculators to bet against European bonds or even against private   securities like the debt of European banks  They intend to sterilize their purchases, so that the   net effect of these purchases on the monetary base will be nil or small  By doing so, they hope to   protect the euro and to avoid any spillover into inflation expectations  So, to summarize, this   will be a market-oriented intervention, with the goal of stabilizing markets and preventing   momentum-driven speculation from creating problems beyond the fundamental problems  It’s   worth asking whether or not this will be effective  It’s certainly an interesting approach, and I   suspect it will have at least some short-term effects  But it cannot solve the longer-term problem   without fiscal support and fiscal action   The ECB is waiting to hear the outcome of the Ecofin meeting  The ECB has not yet   taken legal steps, and it will not announce anything until tonight—Jean-Claude assures me that   they will not take these actions unless they are persuaded that there is real help coming on the   fiscal side  They view themselves as kind of “holding the fort” for a short period until the   fiscal/political side can take the necessary action  So we will see—as I said, I have a call at   200 pm, and I’m sure I will get all of the Ecofin news at that time   I just want to emphasize—and I think it’s obvious to everybody—what an extraordinary   step this is, particularly for the ECB, which has been relatively conservative on market   interventions  It shows that they are very, very concerned about the situation  As I said, I would   also characterize Trichet’s call to me as being a personal appeal  He feels it is very important for   us to support him, and he understands our concerns, which, I will, of course, discuss  I got very   much some of the same tone from Mervyn King, and, to a lesser extent, even from Shirakawa,   who says that Japan is also facing pressure, and they are very concerned about contagion   May 9, 2010 5 of 42             Turning to the swaps, in a moment, I’m going to give Brian Sack a chance to comment in   more detail on interbank markets and on the foreign exchange markets, and give us some more   analysis of the market implications of this, so that we can all make our own assessments  My   own view is that the swaps would be substantively helpful in addressing some of the interbank   flows and certain other problems there  Moreover, everybody I’ve talked to about this in the   central banking world thinks that at least as important as the direct effect on the dollar funding   problems would be the psychological effects of an international coordinated effort in size that   supplements the main actions, which have to be in Europe  I think we all agree that this is not   going to work unless the Europeans are taking the lead and are taking strong steps towards   addressing the fiscal actions  My own view is that, absent any political considerations, this   would be a pretty easy call, in that it would support financial markets, both globally and in   Europe, and would be an important indicator of solidarity  I noted this morning that Vice   President Biden is in Europe and said that the United States would do everything possible to   assist the Europeans; I think that that symbolism is also very important   That being said, as you know, we can’t ignore the politics of this by any means  I think   the Sanders amendment is now in a good place in terms of providing independence to monetary   policy and to other activities, including the discount window and international transactions  The   vote on that is currently planned for Tuesday  Clearly, there’s some risk that action of the sort   that we’re contemplating would be portrayed as a bailout or another Federal Reserve unilateral   action  I think that, to be responsible, we really do have to take into account those kinds of risks,   because they could affect the integrity of the Federal Reserve going forward  So I think it is an   appropriate consideration as we discuss the substance of this issue   May 9, 2010 6 of 42             Let me talk about that a bit, and I’ll also give Linda Robertson a chance to make her   comments  I have had discussions primarily with the Administration—not only the Secretary,   but also with Rahm Emanuel  The Administration’s position is as follows  The Federal Reserve   needs to make this decision based on its economic merits; the Federal Reserve should do what it   thinks is right for the world economy; and, whatever that decision may be, the Administration   will support us 100 percent  “Support” means  first, that the President will support the action;   second, that the President will make clear that he will not accept—that is, perhaps, if necessary,   he will veto—any bill that circumscribes the Federal Reserve’s independence or its ability to   function as lender of last resort; and, third, that the Administration will do all that it can to   communicate these views to the Congress and the congressional leadership, including not just   folks like Senator Reid and Congresswoman Pelosi, but also people like Senator Sanders and   others, because we need to make sure they understand what we’re doing and why we’re doing it    For what it’s worth, Emanuel’s view was that this was a manageable situation; that, while it was   not without risks, the Congress would appreciate the severity of the financial risks; that, in any   case, we should do what’s right from an economic point of view; and that at least the   Administration would be fully behind us in dealing with any ramifications in the Congress   Now, whether to proceed is, of course, going to be a judgment call  Certainly, if we   decide to go ahead with this, I will be talking to some Republicans, because I assume the   Administration will talk to Democrats, and we’ll just try to make sure, within the bounds of   keeping this quiet—and, obviously, that’s a potential issue—that we get a broad understanding   of what we’re doing, namely, that it’s part of a US and international effort to stabilize global   financial markets and not just European financial markets  But I think we all recognize that this   May 9, 2010 7 of 42             is a concern  Given the importance of maintaining an independent Federal Reserve, I don’t think   it is inappropriate that that be part of our discussion   I’d like to hear your views  My inclination would be to ask you to consider giving me   approval to proceed with swap arrangements with all of these other central banks, to be   announced either this evening or tomorrow morning, in time for market openings, contingent on   two things  The primary one is that the Europeans, the Ecofin and the ECB, come through with   strong and effective measures, at least as strong as those that have already been described to me    The second one is that there not be any pushback from the political side that leads us to become   particularly concerned; if that were to happen, I think it would be important to come back to you   and let you understand what risks there are  So that would be where I am, but I would very much   like to have your advice and counsel  Before I turn to a go-round, let me just check in with a few   staff  Brian Sack, you’re in Basel, correct?  Are you on the line?    I have not discussed this with you over the weekend  Could   you just comment on what you see now and on anything you want to report on your discussions   in Basel about the state of financial markets in general or swaps markets and the interbank   market in particular?    Thanks  Are there any questions for Brian, or does   anybody else want to add any color?  [No response]  I see no questions  Let me turn then to   Nathan Sheets  Are you there?    Nathan, could you just comment on the technicalities of   getting this together?  I assume that we would not be able actually to implement anything for a   few days and that we would just want to go with a statement today  Is that your understanding?    Thanks  I didn’t warn you about this, Nathan, but do you   have commentary from what you have picked up in Basel about the state of the economy or the   state of the markets in Europe or anything about sentiment?   May 9, 2010 11 of 42              Nathan, I have a technical question  If there’s risk that the   euro might depreciate further, will that affect our security in our swaps?  How can we be sure   that we have a secure position?     Trish, did you have something to add to that?      Okay  Questions?  I see President Plosser    What was the maturity distribution last time, Bill?  Do you   remember?     Thank you  Other questions for Nathan?  President Lacker    No, we have not been asked to do it  Go ahead, Nathan    That’s a very good question  Go ahead, Brian    I think that’s a very important question for us to discuss, but   I don’t think we have to decide that today, fortunately  We may want to discuss it, particularly in   the context of our reserve-draining tools  President Lockhart     I’ll let Nathan respond to that  But let me say—just going   back to our previous discussions—that they saw value and we saw value in segregating the   reserves, which could be used for exchange rate intervention, and the swaps, which were   designated and dedicated to providing bank liquidity  The other aspect of it is that confidence   May 9, 2010 15 of 42             and symbolism are important parts of the benefits of this, I think  Nathan, do you have anything   to add to that?    Two-hander from President Lacker    It’s creating a monetary base  President Fisher, do you   have a question?    We haven’t heard from anybody other than the G-7  I think   that there’s a whole new level of political risk if we go to emerging markets  I would never say   “never”—it depends on how market conditions evolve, and so on  But my strong inclination   would not be to go beyond the G-7   In terms of what we do next, I’m not sure there’s a whole lot more that the Federal   Reserve can do  The fundamental issues have to do with fiscal stability in Europe, and that’s   something only they themselves can solve  I think our additional actions would be along the   lines of making sure that our banks are stable  If we had to do some kind of—I’m extrapolating   wildly here—new SCAP or something in the future, we could consider it  But, quite honestly, I   can’t see what else we could do, other than, as I mentioned on Friday, respond to the   macroeconomic conditions of the United States, as necessary  But that’s all I can think of    President Plosser    You have to understand that our buying US Treasuries and   the ECB’s buying Greek bonds are very different matters  They’re taking very significant risks   with their credibility, with their political standing, and with the value of the euro  I think what   they’re trying to do with the sterilization is to ensure that this decision doesn’t bleed over into a   major run on the euro  I think that’s why they’re doing what they’re doing  I don’t think we   have quite the same risks  Having said that—and I take Brian Sack’s point that, in terms of   market conditions, given where we are, we’re probably talking about only a few basis points in   market conditions—I’m embarrassed that I haven’t brought a proposal on sterilization  I think   we do need to talk about it   But from the ECB’s point of view, particularly given their relatively more conservative   approach to this point, they’re the ones who are crossing an important line by expressing a   willingness to buy any asset, including Greek bank debt or whatever it might be that they deem   to be part of a disorderly market   I don’t think the dollar is going to suffer vis-à-vis the euro on these announcements  But,   again, your point about sterilization is important  We should continue to think about that    President Hoenig    Michelle, do you want to comment?    Are there contracts with the other central banks, or   agreements, or something similar that we could release?  Nathan?  Brian?    Nathan, and maybe Scott, as well, assuming we proceed   with this, it would help if we could look at those agreements and ask if there’s anything there   that would prevent a release  If there is, is it possible to rewrite new agreements that would be   publicly disclosable?  I can’t see fundamentally why there would be any problem with that    So all we would have to say today would be that we will be   releasing those contracts  President Bullard    Well, we can ask them  They are, in this case, the ones who   are asking for the swap lines—they want them very badly  I think they would let us let us   characterize the situation—for example, who asked for the swap, or whatever—any way that we   May 9, 2010 22 of 42             think is beneficial from a communications point of view  But your point is correct  President   Fisher    Thank you  I was looking at my watch because I have a   200 pm G-7 call, but that leaves us plenty of time, so there’s no concern about that   President Hoenig   May 9, 2010 23 of 42              President Bullard    That’s a good point  Linda, do you want to add anything?    Oh, I’m sorry  Narayana?   May 9, 2010 24 of 42              Yes, that’s my understanding   If you have nothing further, I’ll give Linda a chance to comment on the politics  I guess   she’s comfortable with what we’ve described up to now    Oh, sorry  President Hoenig    Well, it is collateralized with euros    Oh, I see    Nathan, maybe you can jump in here  I think we have done   that in the past, but we have given the major central banks the courtesy of taking their signature    Particularly if we were not releasing the contract    The answer is that we have both the euros and the ECB’s   commitment, and the ECB will be effectively backed up by Ecofin and the European Union  If   the continent of Europe is bankrupt, we all have problems  But it seems relatively unlikely, to   put it mildly    We still have a chance for a go-round  Let me just make   sure everyone is getting a chance to speak  Is there anyone else who has a question for any staff   member or for me?  I’m happy to respond if you have questions  President Lacker    That’s a good question      Governor Tarullo    Thanks  Any other questions?  President Evans    I’ll go to Nathan in just a second, but let me comment that,   in all of these calls, the Germans keep saying what a great example they’re going to set by   consolidating their own fiscal position  And we keep trying to point out to them that it may not   necessarily be in the overall interest of the continent—it’s a strange mind-set   Nathan, or anyone, do you have a view on the outlook for Europe?     Thank you  Any other questions?  [No response]  Let’s   have a quick go-round  A lot of the issues have already been discussed, but I certainly want   everybody to have a chance to give a view  Governor Tarullo had a few comments on banking,   so let’s start with you, Dan    Thank you  I’m now going to go around the Reserve Banks   by order of District, so I will start with President Rosengren    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  President Plosser   May 9, 2010 30 of 42              Thank you  Again, I take your point on sterilization  It   interacts with our tools one way or another—we’d have to do something specific to sterilize, and   we need to talk very soon about the availability of the reserve-draining tools as well as what   we’re going to do about potential asset sales  I understand that   Again, Michelle, Nathan, and Scott, we want to be sure to work towards as much   transparency as possible  President Pianalto    Thank you  Don Kohn wanted to come in   May 9, 2010 31 of 42              I’m sure I will be  Sorry—back to the go-around order     President Lacker   May 9, 2010 32 of 42              Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    We didn’t specify a maximum  My proposal, at this point,   would be uncapped  But we’ll certainly monitor that very carefully    That’s the amount of reserves that the ECB has  President   Bullard    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Just to be clear, you’re right  It’s the G-7, plus   Switzerland—the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the   Swiss National Bank  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Yellen   May 9, 2010 37 of 42              Thank you  Governor Warsh    Your forecasting has been good on that so far    Governor Duke    Thank you very much  We will have a formal vote in a   second  Brian, are you going to read this?  Before we take the vote, I’ll ask if there are any final   questions or comments  Brian   May 9, 2010 40 of 42              Any comments on the statement?  President Bullard    We doubled up before, right, Nathan?    Anything else?    I’m sorry?  No, Mexico is not on this list    No  I don’t think so    Michelle says we’ll answer that question if we get it    Maybe that is a better way to handle it  Anything else?  [No response]  All right  Matt, could   you call the roll?    Did you get Governor Duke?  Yes—okay  Thank you very   much  This was an extremely helpful conversation with many good ideas  I will proceed as   directed, and we will keep in close communication as the day and the weekend progress    Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your Mother’s Day   END OF MEETING   May 9, 2010 42 of 42     "
8999,2010-06-22,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  Let me update you on our   Board nominees  With some luck, we expect to have hearings before the Senate Banking   Committee in the next three weeks or so  And with some skill and luck, we might have our   additional members here for the August meeting  However, because we remain without   reinforcements—[laughter]—I took the liberty of asking Governor Kohn to hang around for   another meeting, and he very kindly agreed  That will not stop us from honoring you tomorrow   at lunch, but we appreciate your willingness to stay on for a bit longer   As usual, this is a joint Board–FOMC meeting, so I need a motion to close the meeting     Thank you  The first item is our briefing on financial   developments, open market operations, and System facilities  Brian, you have a lot of work to   do today  Let me turn to you first for open market developments    Thank you  Are there questions for Brian, either on market   developments or on these two operational issues—the coupon swap or the draining tools?  Any   questions for Brian?  President Hoenig    Okay  Vice Chairman    Okay  President Fisher    President Fisher, your conditional clause there was very   important, that we would have to do this in a way that didn’t signal broader monetary tightening,   and our ability to do that is at least debatable    We can certainly debate it  After the next round, where   Brian is going to talk about redemptions, we have an open discussion period, and at that time we   could talk about the broader policy issue, if you would like  Let me suggest that, at this point,   we consider the Desk’s proposals—assuming for the moment that we don’t go into a broader   June 22–23, 2010 14 of 213             selling regime—with the understanding that, if we were to begin to sell, that would then   dominate these kinds of strategies  So let’s assume for the purpose of this discussion that we’re   not going to be selling, but then we can discuss that broader policy issue—it’s really not a   technical issue; it is a broader policy issue—in the discussion period in just a few minutes    Okay?    Absolutely not    Okay  Any other questions for Brian?  President Lacker    It’s important to understand that fails can occur for two   reasons  One is a shortage of security  The other is because the interest rate is so low and there’s   no penalty for not delivering  In the Treasury market, of course, there are penalties for not   delivering, and there are essentially no fails in that market  There is under way, I understand—  June 22–23, 2010 17 of 213             Brian, you can correct me—a process now to have an analogous penalty in the MBS market    Presumably, at least for the 45s, that must be the principal source of the fails    Other questions?  President Lockhart    President Plosser    Is there a way to cancel the transaction without loss, as   opposed to having to go out and actually sell to a third party?      Governor Tarullo    President Lockhart    I can see that this question is not as separable from the   broader ones, as I had hoped  We will have an opportunity discuss the broader issues in just a   minute, if that’s okay  Does anyone else have any questions for Brian on either this issue or the   broader market concerns?  President Fisher    President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Anyone else?  [No response]  As I said, we’ll   come back to this issue  We now turn to Brian Sack for a briefing on the Treasury redemption   issue  This was—like the first issue—also supported by a memo last week  Brian   June 22–23, 2010 21 of 213              Thank you  I think we’re going to end up having a go-  round, so everyone is going to get a chance to give their views  For the moment, let’s just   restrict ourselves to questions for Brian  Does anyone have questions?  President Kocherlakota    President Rosengren, a question?    President Plosser    President Evans    Other questions for Brian?  [No response]  I think the most   efficient thing is to have a go-round and to have some discussion of both the sales issue and the   redemptions issue  I assume that, once we determine what we’re doing on those two, the   question about the MBS swaps will kind of fall out of that  We went through this at great length   in the last meeting  To try to minimize the repetition, I happen to have with me, by coincidence,   June 22–23, 2010 27 of 213             the minutes, and I thought I could just remind you of what we agreed to when we voted on the   minutes and what the public has heard from us   First of all, there were four principles on which we had essentially uniform agreement    First, whatever strategy we adopt, we should be consistent with our objectives of maximum   employment and price stability; in other words, we have to take into account the financial and   economic conditions when we think about this  Second, we are looking to normalize the balance   sheet, both its size and composition, over time  Third, doing number two would eventually entail   sales of agency debt and MBS; in other words, we’re in agreement that we’re not going to go   strictly through a redemptions strategy  And, fourth, any sales would be communicated in   advance, conducted at a gradual pace, and potentially adjusted in response to changes in   economic and financial conditions  So those are the four principles that I think we all agree on    macro objectives, normalize the balance sheet, sell at some point, but do it in a way that’s   gradual and well-communicated   The next portion of the minutes talked about areas where there was diversity of views    I’ll quote “Most participants favored deferring asset sales for some time”  So, at this point, the   market does not expect a near-term sale  It doesn’t mean we can’t do it  We also communicated   that a majority preferred beginning asset sales some time after the first increase in the FOMC’s   target for short-term interest rates  That was option 2, you recall, when we looked at the various   issues  Again, it was a majority, not everyone  The rationale given was that such an approach   would postpone any asset sales until the economic recovery was well established and would   maintain short-term interest rates as the Committee’s key monetary policy tool   Given the four conditions on which we agree, I think the question at hand is whether we   should reverse the communication we’ve already made, namely, that assets sales would be   June 22–23, 2010 28 of 213             deferred for some time and that asset sales would come after interest rate moves, and   communicate a different strategy that would involve at least announcing very soon what our   schedule of asset sales would be   Let me make two additional points, if I could  First, while I think it is important to   discuss issues of market functioning and so on, I think we all should recognize that the key issue   here is the signal that we give in terms of policy  What is the market going to infer from the   announcement that we make?  In particular, when we talked about sales in the scenarios that the   staff did in the last meeting, we talked about situations, for example, where sales would be   combined with a more extended period of low interest rates rather than a less extended period    Can we do that communication?  I think that’s a very important issue   The second and final comment I’d like to make is sort of a request  As we’ll discuss later   on, it seems to me, at least, that the economic and financial outlook is somewhat weaker today   than it was in April  Therefore, if the Committee instructs me to undertake either a significant   redemptions policy or a sales policy, I would ask you to allow me to use the Humphrey-Hawkins   testimony to provide additional warning and preparation for such a change, given what we’ve   communicated—if, in fact, that’s what we decide to do  But, of course, again, that’s your option    With those background comments in the hope of trying to make this an efficient and   effective discussion, why don’t we begin a go-round?  Before we do that, Matt reminds me that   we need to vote to approve domestic open market operations  If there are no objections to doing   that—[no response] I see no objection  Okay  Who would like to go first?  President Plosser    Thank you  President Rosengren   June 22–23, 2010 30 of 213              Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Lockhart    Yes    Certainly    Two hundred twenty-two FOMC meetings—it had better be   respectful  Go ahead    Where are we?  President Lockhart    President Plosser    Okay    You are absolutely right  If you swap for long-duration   Treasuries, you increase the duration  President Rosengren, you had a comment?    President Evans    And on the asset sales, the MBS sales?    Okay  Governor Warsh    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Who’s next?  President Yellen    President Kocherlakota, would you like to comment?    Thank you  President Fisher, would you like to comment?    Indemnified?    No    The third week in July   June 22–23, 2010 45 of 213              Thank you  President Bullard, would you like to comment?    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Duke   June 22–23, 2010 50 of 213              What about the asset sales, the MBS sales?    Okay  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  I think everyone has spoken  I recognize that   we have not been completely efficient in our discussions, but I found this very useful, and I think   positions are at least gelling  [Laughter]    Let me try to make a couple of points, which I took from   this discussion, and then we’ll be able to enjoy a cup of coffee   First of all, Brian, I think that most people think that the coupon swaps idea is worth   doing, and we’ll put that into the directive tomorrow   On the Treasury redemptions—it was a very interesting discussion  We’ll discuss these   issues further in the policy go-round tomorrow  I think that many people were motivated today   by concerns about not rocking the boat or conveying any change in policy at this juncture and,   therefore, the preference was clearly for no change, for option 1, for this meeting  However,   there was a lot of interesting discussion not so much about the size of the balance sheet, but   about the composition of the balance sheet; in particular, the change that got the most attention   June 22–23, 2010 53 of 213             was shortening the Treasury maturities, option 2  I heard quite a bit of interest in the possibility   that, if conditions warrant, if the outlook strengthens, we might prepare the ground for a   shortening of maturities in that way—I thought there was considerable interest in that  We may   try to clarify a bit tomorrow exactly what conditions would warrant it, but I think it’s entirely   possible that something about the composition of the balance sheet could be in my testimony, for   example   The other issue of composition involves MBS versus Treasuries, and President Lacker   was, I guess, the strongest advocate  I think that’s certainly worth considering  Not too many   people picked it up at this juncture, but it certainly is true that, if communicated adequately, we   could change the composition of our balance sheet without changing the overall thrust of the   duration, at least  As President Rosengren pointed out, there would be some implications for   mortgage markets versus other markets, but I think that that is an interesting alternative   I didn’t hear much support at this juncture for reducing the size of the balance sheet at   this time  I think it should be noted, and the minutes should continue to note, that the absolute   majority of people who spoke still prefer the notion of sales after increased interest rates  But   what I took from that is that we shouldn’t be selling until we believe that we are close to the   point where policy needs to be tightened, that is, where macroeconomic and financial conditions   are such that tightening looks to be in the offing  I could imagine, for example that, at a point at   which tightening is beginning to look necessary, we might start with an announcement that in six   months we will begin sales, and then be able to observe that effect, and then make an   announcement on interest rates subsequently  Then, temporally, the interest rate would still be in   front of the sales, but the announcement might come first  So I think there are variants that we   could talk about, but, for the time being, I did hear very little interest in immediate sales, and, in   June 22–23, 2010 54 of 213             particular, I heard a preference for holding sales as a part of the tightening process once we are   convinced that financial and economic conditions warrant it   Are there any comments?  [No response]  Well, again, I thank you for a very frank and   very useful discussion  Why don’t we take 20 minutes for coffee?  We’ll come back for the   chart show   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we reconvene?  Item 2  We’ll have the   presentation on the economic and financial situation by Bill Wascher, Chris Erceg, and Nellie   Liang  Bill    Let me thank the staff for a very comprehensive   presentation  I want to take special note of the section on financial stability, which reflects   requests that we had at the last meeting  Besides the presentation, of course, some memos were   also circulated  If you have additional requests for future presentations, or you have metrics or   data that you’d like to submit for inclusion in a presentation, please don’t hesitate to do so  Also,   I think it would also be remiss of me not to take note of the Tealbook [laughter], which, of   course, is a perfect combination of blue and green, which I found very convenient  Again, if   anyone has any suggestions, I’m sure the staff would be happy to hear them  Are there questions   for our colleagues?  President Rosengren    President Fisher    President Lockhart    Other questions for our colleagues?  [No response]  Seeing   none, I think it would behoove us to get started on the go-around, if that’s okay  We won’t take   too long because we have, of course, our June dinner at the embassy this evening  President   Lockhart, would you like to kick it off?    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Pianalto     Thank you  President Fisher   June 22–23, 2010 83 of 213              Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  It’s 600 pm  Why don’t we adjourn for   today?  Of course, we have dinner at 730, I believe, at the British Embassy, and we’ll begin   tomorrow morning at 900 am  Thank you very much   [Meeting recessed]   June 22–23, 2010 92 of 213             June 23—Morning Session     Good morning  Why don’t we resume our economic go-  around?  President Bullard, are you ready?    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Kocherlakota   June 22–23, 2010 95 of 213              Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Ironically, if we’re serious about too-big-to-fail, at some   point we hope that some institutions do get downgraded, right?  So that shows that it’s a   market—    Yes, I understand that  Okay  Governor Kohn    Thank you  Governor Warsh   June 22–23, 2010 105 of 213              Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you, and thanks to everyone  Let me make a stab at   trying to summarize the conversation around the table  Intermeeting data were generally mixed,   and financial conditions became less supportive, largely as a result of uncertainties about   European sovereign debt and the ramifications of a possible default on the European periphery    Most participants, however, continued to expect a moderate recovery into next year, although   downside risks to growth have increased somewhat  The labor market is recovering, but   painfully slowly, reflecting the moderate pace of output growth  The inventory correction is no   longer providing significant support to the recovery, and, although private final demands seems   to have picked up the baton, the strength and certain components of final demand may prove   transitory  Inflation remains low and trending down  Inflation expectations appear stable, and   June 22–23, 2010 117 of 213             commodity prices are moderating  Medium-term risks to inflation, to both the upside and the   downside, remain, although, on net, economic developments and incoming data led inflation risk   to shift toward the downside over the intermeeting period   Household spending has been moderately strong, supported by income growth and a   modest improvement in confidence  However, recent reports are mixed, and continued labor   market weakness could weigh on confidence, income, and spending going forward  Declines in   equity and housing wealth are another potential drag on consumption growth   In the labor market, data on new hires and UI claims were disappointing, except for the   temporary boost provided by Census hiring  Employers thus far have added hours more through   increases in workweeks and overtime than by adding employees  Possibly these increases in   hours may lead to more hiring in the near future, as suggested by increases in temp hiring  But   employer pensiveness about the economic and policy environment is also likely playing a role in   the slow hiring pace  The staff predicts low productivity growth from here, but productivity   growth more in line with recent expansions, though good in the long run, could translate into   weaker, short-term employment gains  Long-term unemployment represents a serious problem   with potential longer-term implications for skills, social networks, and labor market attachment   Housing demand has been up in some areas but looks to be weaker in the near term, with   starts and sales down, in part reflecting a withdrawal of federal tax credits for homebuyers as   well as tight credit  Home prices are flat to down with the overhang of available supply a drag   on prices in many localities  Mortgage modification programs have not had as much success as   hoped  Nonresidential construction remains at low levels, and banks’ commercial real estate   problems may worsen with the large volume of loans coming due in the near term  However,   there have been indications of stabilization in commercial real estate fundamentals in prices   June 22–23, 2010 118 of 213             Moreover, funding is available for stronger CRE deals on conservative terms, and some grounds   for optimism on CRE performance exist   In financial markets, concerns about Europe and perhaps about financial regulatory   reform, new capital standards, and accounting changes have increased jitteriness and reduced   investors’ appetite for risk  Correlations across asset classes are high  Lower stock prices, the   stronger dollar, and somewhat tighter corporate credit are negatives for US economic growth,   although lower oil prices and lower Treasury yields are a partial offset  The European bank   stress test may help the situation  However, the European situation remains a tail risk, albeit a   low probability one  Conditions have improved recently, as confidence that Europe will muddle   through has increased  Credit losses and delinquencies at banks may have peaked, and many   banks are looking to make loans again, though, from their perspective, the supply of   creditworthy borrowers appears very limited  Bank profits have been better recently but could   well slow and face a number of downside risks, including the effects of the financial reform   package   In the nonfinancial sector, industrial production has continued to expand  The prospects   for foreign demand weakened over the intermeeting period because of a weaker Europe and a   weaker euro, and net exports are not expected to provide much of an impetus to US economic   growth  Firms’ investments are focused on replacement and maintenance  With considerable   uncertainty, they have limited interest in investing for expansion  Equipment and software   investment, though recently strong, seems likely to slow  Firms are cautious, concerned about   random refereeing by policymakers, and consequently are focusing on blocking and tackling    Bronko Nagurski makes an appearance in the remarks   June 22–23, 2010 119 of 213             Caution is reflected in the large cash hoards held by corporations, which, in turn, are   being devoted more to dividends and share buybacks than to expansion   The Gulf oil spill, which so far has had relatively minor direct economic effects, is also   weighing on household and business attitudes  However, several sectors show strength, such as   manufacturing, including autos and steel, energy, temporary help, transportation, including   shipping and airline business travel, tourism, and agriculture  Firms continue to pursue   productivity gains and cost savings  Small businesses face credit constraints arising from the   weaker economy and declines in collateral values, which have the potential to constrain their   expansion and hiring   In the area of fiscal policy, ongoing support from federal stimulus is being partially offset   by constrained budgets at the state and local level, and fiscal austerity abroad may dampen global   growth   Core inflation has slowed, and overall inflation has also been tame, as the prices of   globally traded commodities have moderated  Inflation as measured by median or trimmed mean   indicators has also slowed  Inflation expectations appear well anchored, at least for now,   although that cannot be assumed indefinitely  Firms have seen reduced cost pressures as slack   remains high, and, with few exceptions they are not able to pass on cost increases  Expectations   about future prices received have generally declined  The stronger dollar also will have some   disinflationary effect, and labor cost pressures remain largely absent  Generally, concerns about   disinflation, or even deflation, have increased somewhat in the Committee, though medium-term   risks to inflation remain, depending in part on the nimbleness of monetary policy, fiscal   developments, and the pace of economic growth   June 22–23, 2010 120 of 213             Those are some summary comments  Any reactions?  [No response]  Seeing none, let   me just add a few thoughts on a number of different topics  I’m going to range a bit more widely   than usual today   On the economy, I agree with the overall tone that we’ve heard around the table  The   intermeeting data were somewhat mixed or slightly negative, and combining that with the   European situation leads to both a somewhat worse modal forecast as well as greater downside   risks  Examples of the mixed data include employment, where we saw, on the one hand, low job   creation and high UI claims, and, on the other hand, increases in hours and labor income  So the   general view that the labor market is recovering only very slowly obviously remains intact    Some other mixed reports included retail sales, housing starts, and foreign trade  Each of these   areas suggests potential problems going forward   In the consumption area, despite the retail sales numbers, the data have been reasonably   strong  Again, there are some mixed reports  One interesting development is that there does   seem to be progress in deleveraging by households  The flip side of that is that much of this   deleveraging is occurring through default and delinquency, which is not a good sign for future   credit availability, though it does free up some income for spending  One of the major factors   cited by the staff, of course, is the wealth effect associated with the stock market and housing   prices  So I think consumption remains an open question  It has been fairly strong  Clearly,   continued moderate expansion is going to require that consumers remain sufficiently confident   I do have a concern that some of the other components of final demand that have recently   been strong may not remain strong  I’ll give you three examples  The first is housing  Housing   was a positive support for economic growth in the second quarter, but, with the withdrawal of the   tax credit, it seems very likely that we are going to see very weak housing results over the next   June 22–23, 2010 121 of 213             few quarters  Moreover, a lot of the residential investment we saw in the second quarter was   either real estate commissions driven by the tax credit, which is not going to be repeated, or   home improvements, also driven by tax favoritism, which also has been withdrawn  So I think   housing is going to continue to be a drag both on real activity and on financial conditions   The second is equipment and software investment, which has also been fairly strong   recently  Once again, I don’t think it’s going to persist at the recent pace  There’s too much   uncertainty  In addition, a lot of the equipment and software investment has been focused on   maintenance and replacement, and, clearly, at some point those needs will be met   Third, the fiscal components obviously are also going to be a drag on economic growth   going forward, as federal support is withdrawn, as state and local fiscal conditions continue to be   constraining, and as global fiscal austerity looms   So, to sum up, I think the net effect both of the data and of the European developments,   as many people have already discussed, is to reduce the mode and to increase the downside risks,   unfortunately   On the inflation front, there has been considerable discussion  I do think that upside risks   to inflation are now very, very low  Certainly, we will always have to keep watching that   situation, but there seems to be very little momentum in inflation  I had one small observation    In past meetings, we’ve discussed various components of the inflation indexes, understanding, of   course, that overall inflation is what matters  But it struck me that the few areas where we were   actually seeing price increases in the last couple of months were in public services, such as   public transportation and education, where fiscal problems at the state and local level are causing   increases in fees  This is not exactly the inflation that you would normally think of, but that does   seem to be contributing a bit to the observed data  Similarly, it’s the way excise taxes affected   June 22–23, 2010 122 of 213             tobacco prices earlier this year  So, again, my overall outlook on inflation is I think very   consistent with what I heard around the table     I did want to talk about a couple of other issues  First, very briefly, I want to say   something about the labor market and the risk of hysteresis, that is, continued high   unemployment associated with a permanent increase in the NAIRU, as opposed to a return to the   NAIRU that existed before the recession  I think there are a lot of reasons to worry about a very   slow recovery in the labor market, as many people have discussed  The sheer depth of the   recession, obviously, takes us far away from full employment  Many people have noted the high   rate of permanent job loss and the reduced reliance on temporary layoffs  Unemployment   insurance, while understandable and socially necessary, clearly tends to extend unemployment    We have seen the uncertainties and the credit constraints which have led firms to focus on the   intensive margin of hours and overtime rather than on new hires to meet their labor needs    We’ve noted some changes in job-finding rates, as reflected, for example, in the Beveridge   curve, which has shifted somewhat adversely, as the staff discussed  There are issues associated   with immigration, which was also discussed by the staff, related to underwater mortgages and   perhaps just changes in behavior  And a number of people have noted that banking crises are   often associated with very slow recovery  So I think there are a lot of reasons to be worried   about a very slow recovery in employment  That being said, my view at this point—although   I’m certainly open to new evidence and discussion—is that I am still sympathetic to the staff   view that the NAIRU—or the natural rate, or however you want to describe it—has probably not   permanently increased at this point  There will be a long period of recovery, but I think   ultimately we will find ourselves back to something closer to the 5 to 5½ percent range   June 22–23, 2010 123 of 213             The staff talked about some of the evidence for that yesterday, notably that there doesn’t   seem to be any greater dispersion geographically or by industry in terms of the flows of   employees from one sector to another  The variability of growth across the geographic and   industrial sectors is not unusual  And, indeed, if you think about some of the badly hit sectors,   like construction, clearly they’re well below their long-run sustainable levels, and we would   expect to see considerable reemployment in those sectors, even if we don’t get back to the levels   that we had before the crisis  There are also some demographic factors  For example, a study   from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago showed that the duration of unemployment increases   with the age of the worker; nevertheless, the worker ultimately tends to find work   I think the most interesting evidence—and it was not discussed by the staff—about the   issue has to do with outflow patterns of unemployment, that is, people who move from   unemployment either out of the labor force altogether or, obviously, into employment  I would   recommend to you a paper by Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin—the latter two are from the San   Francisco and New York Federal Reserve Banks, respectively  Their paper looked in some   detail at rates of outflows from unemployment as a function of starting conditions  They confirm   that the rate of outflow from unemployment declines with duration; that is, people who are   unemployed for a long time obviously have a lower probability of leaving unemployment and   going into employment  However, that slope is very similar to past recessions, so there doesn’t   seem to be any structural shift in those reemployment probabilities conditional on the depth of   the recession and on the extent of the period of unemployment  I also thought it was particular   interesting that they showed that the pace at which you leave unemployment does not depend on   the industry from which you come; that is, unemployed construction workers are finding jobs at   June 22–23, 2010 124 of 213             the same rate as others in the overall economy, which I think is another piece of evidence against   this permanent structural mismatch   Finally, I’ll mention one other piece of evidence that I found quite interesting  Although   monthly outflow rates from unemployment, both at shorter-term and longer-term durations, are   at record lows for the United States, the monthly outflow rate from unemployment in general is   currently about triple the outflow rate of what Europe experienced in the 1980s, and, for the   long-term unemployed, it’s four times the rate in Europe in the 1980s  So even though it’s very   slow, it does appear that people are moving back into employment much more quickly than was   the case in the classic European hysteresis episode of the 1980s   I could make other points on this issue, and I think it’s something we need to continue to   watch  At this point, though, my own feeling about the labor market is that, while we’re facing   what could be a very slow and painful recovery, I think there’s reason to hope that at the end of   this process we’ll be back to something closer to where we were when we began  Obviously,   that has implications for our policy discussions, and we can revisit that as we go forward   Taking advantage of your patience, I’d like to talk about one other issue, which the Vice   Chairman raised, namely, the question of the symmetry of more versus less stimulus at this point    Now, clearly, we have been focusing over the last year or so on exit  I think that continues to be   appropriate  But you have to concede that, if you look at the projections that we have all put   together for this meeting, they pretty clearly show that almost everyone thinks that   unemployment will be above our target and inflation below our target for a number of years  So   I think there’s a reasonable question about why we aren’t looking to try to expand from here    Why aren’t we trying to become more supportive of the economy rather than less?  Indeed, if   you look at almost any kind of model-based analysis—take a standard Taylor rule, an optimal   June 22–23, 2010 125 of 213             control exercise, or a micro-founded model, and I would cite the paper by Justiniano and   Primiceri from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago—they suggest that our policy right now   should be a negative nominal interest rate of about 3 or 4 percent  Former Fed staffer Joe   Gagnon has also raised these questions; why aren’t we at least symmetrically talking about   further expansion, why are we still only talking about the exit?   My own view is that, while further expansion is certainly a possible option and one that   we need to keep alive, the bar for doing so should be reasonably high  Let me try to explain why   I think that’s so  The point of my raising this is not so much to persuade you about anything in   particular, but rather to put this on the table, because we haven’t talked about it  And I would be   interested in hearing, at this meeting or in subsequent meetings, your views on this issue   One line of argument against further expansion is that the output gap might be smaller   than we think or that we can’t measure the output gap—those are reasonable points based on   Orphanides’s work, and so on  But I would note that everyone seems to think that inflation is not   going to be rising, so implicitly in your forecast is the view—again—that economic growth is not   in some sense too fast over the next two to three years  Putting that aside, then we have to ask   what the effects of additional stimulus would be In thinking about this issue, it might be useful   to start with a more familiar type of policy, which is fiscal policy, where we’re seeing the same   phenomenon I think we understand fiscal policy better in this particular set of circumstances   than we do monetary policy  So the question is  Why isn’t the United States, for example,   engaging in another large fiscal stimulus package, as some people would advocate?  Again,   that’s something that should be open for discussion, but I think an appropriate characterization   would be that there are unknown benefits and, perhaps, diminishing marginal returns to such an   action, and there are large and very hard to anticipate risks associated with such an action   June 22–23, 2010 126 of 213             Ideally, theoretically, a fiscal expansion would involve a very sharp increase in spending   today, accompanied by a credible exit and a credible rebalancing of our fiscal position in the   medium term  In fact, I have advocated something like that in my testimony, as the approach   that we should be trying to take  But I think anybody seriously thinking about this has to   recognize that that’s very hard to execute, because the increase in spending is today, while the   decline in spending, or rebalancing of fiscal policy, is a future promise  So, on the one hand, you   have a situation in which increased fiscal stimulus may have diminishing marginal returns—for   example, you may have fewer shovel-ready projects available—but, on the other hand, you have   quite a bit of uncertainty about what a large program would do to market expectations  For   example, would it cause interest rates to jump?  Would it cause inflation expectations to jump?    Would it lead to financial instability?  I don’t know the answers to those questions, but I think   that, as we try to balance the costs and benefits of a major fiscal expansion, we have to take into   account that the risks of doing it are significant, and we don’t have as much information as we   would like about the implications for markets and expectations of such an action   I raise this because the same kind of tradeoff applies to monetary expansion  Certainly,   we could go back into large-scale asset purchases and purchase another trillion dollars of assets   And I don’t think we should rule that out—I think there are circumstances in which we should   consider additional expansion of our balance sheet  But the same kinds of tradeoffs apply at this   point  On the benefits side, we already have interest rates extremely low, including longer-term   interest rates and mortgage rates that are at record lows  So the question is  How much   additional benefit will we get in terms of financial conditions from such a program?  Then, on   the side of the risks, of course, there’s the risk of a sharp increase in inflation expectations, which   June 22–23, 2010 127 of 213             could raise nominal interest rates, which could cause capital losses for banks and other holders of   securities, which could lead to financial instability, etc, etc   I’m not raising all of these issues to provide a final conclusion  I just want to point out   two things  One is that the logic of our projections suggests we should at least be keeping on the   table not just exit but also additional stimulus  Second is an acknowledgement that there is an   awful lot of uncertainty associated with either fiscal or monetary stimulus from this point  We’ll   need to continue to think about those risks and how we might manage them should we come to   the point of having to take further steps   Again, I thought it was worthwhile to put this on the table, because we haven’t discussed   it before  At least some people around the table have raised scenarios in which it might be   necessary to take further actions, so I would invite research staffs around the System to give this   issue more thought  Let me stop there  It’s past 1000, which means that I can ask Dave   Stockton if he’d like to report on the housing data that came out this morning    Okay  Thank you  Before we take a break, perhaps Brian   would go ahead and give us the introduction to the policy go-round    Thank you, Brian  Let me call attention to that last point    As written, the directive would authorize the Desk to undertake the coupon swaps we discussed   yesterday, and the current plan would be for those to take place before release of the minutes for   this meeting  So it would be treated as a technical change that is announced by the Desk  An   alternative would be to ask the Desk to delay until after the minutes are released  If you have a   view on that and would like to say something about it, then you can just include that in your   policy go-round    Okay  Questions for Brian?  President Fisher    Are we talking about the first two sentences of the   directive?    When is the directive released?   June 22–23, 2010 133 of 213              The question is whether the Desk should issue a press   release explaining the action they’re going to take, not the directive    No problem  Further questions for Brian?  Anyone?  [No   response]  Okay  If not, since it is 1030, let’s take a break for 20 minutes, and we’ll come back   and do the policy go-round  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Let’s recommence, and we’ll begin with the policy go-  round  President Rosengren, you’re first on the list    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Lacker    I’d just make the observation, without knowing exactly   which way it cuts, that conversations with foreign holders of US securities suggest that for   some reason, which I don’t understand, they believe Treasury purchases to be much more   inflationary than MBS purchases  I understand there’s no theoretical basis for this distinction,   but somehow it’s a very strongly held view—just for what it’s worth  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you for that clarification  President Plosser    Thank you  President Evans   June 22–23, 2010 151 of 213              Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke   June 22–23, 2010 156 of 213              Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you, and thank you all for your comments  Let me   just give a few thoughts, and then we can discuss some of the language suggestions   On the substance of the policy, as I said in my earlier remarks, most quantitative analyses   would put us at the zero bound, I think, at this point, including Taylor rules, optimal control   exercises, and some micro-founded analyses  It is true, as President Bullard pointed out when I   made this point at the last meeting, that, in addition to our interest rate policy, we have language,   and we have some QE  On the other hand, we also have some financial headwinds, which aren’t   incorporated in the typical Taylor rule type of analysis  So on the substance, I think there’s   considerable agreement that we should remain at the zero bound at least for now   What are the risks to that?  First, of course, is inflation  The inflation data look very   moderate, and inflation expectations seem to be flat to down  I didn’t hear much concern around   the table, at least for the near term, about inflation risk  The risk that has gotten more attention—  and President Hoenig has been particularly strong in advocating it—is the potential risk to   financial stability from low interest rates over a long period of time   I’d like to make a few comments about that  First, I remain at least somewhat skeptical   of what I understand is the conventional view, namely, that too low for too long was an   important contributor to the financial crisis that we recently experienced  I gave a speech about   this in Atlanta at the beginning of the year, which was backed up by staff research  That   June 22–23, 2010 160 of 213             research, for example, showed that cross-national comparisons of monetary policy bore no   relationship to housing price increases  It also showed that Taylor rule calculations of the type   that John has done are extremely fragile and that alternative Taylor rules don’t show any   particular problem with monetary policy in the early part of this decade  In particular, I would   add that I think it’s a mistake to appeal to Taylor rules to talk about asset price bubbles, because   Taylor rules are not designed to talk about that issue at all  There’s no reference to them in the   Taylor rule, which is entirely about the traditional employment and inflation objectives  So I   would just appeal to you to think more about the premise that, I understand, is widely accepted,   but that, I think, at best is uncertain  Moreover, I also think that, regardless of the source of the   overheated financial conditions, a stronger regulatory and supervisory response could have   avoided much of the bad outcomes that we had   In regard to President Hoenig’s concern, I think it’s important to respond to it because,   even if we’re uncertain about whether low interest rates lead to imbalances, there certainly is the   possibility that they do  Any fair-minded person would have to admit that, and therefore, it’s   important for us to take that into account  Again, I want to reiterate, as a number of people have   done, the praise for the staff’s work at looking at various measures of imbalances  I thought it   was very helpful  I think we need to expand those types of evaluations, and, as Governor Warsh   did, I invite research staffs around the System to try to add their own cites  But I’m not sure   what else we can do besides do our every best to analyze and assess whether imbalances are   developing  I note that if we had applied the tools we use today in the late 1990s or in the early   2000s, we would have detected imbalances in stock prices and in housing prices  Moreover, I   think it’s very important that we continue to strengthen our supervisory tools and regulatory   tools  That process is already under way, and I see that financial regulatory reform is near   June 22–23, 2010 161 of 213             completion  I hope very much that we will have an additional set of surveillance and response   tools available to address these concerns without distorting monetary policy to address them   alone   In summary, I commend President Hoenig for bringing that issue to our attention  I   understand the concern  I think even with the uncertainty about it, it is important for us to   monitor that issue  We are, indeed, monitoring it, and I think we should continue to do that  I   would also add that whatever early indicators there were of excess in financial markets, the   European developments over the intermeeting period have offset a good number of them and   have reduced risk preferences and have indicated less interest, for example, in carry trades    Again, I think we have to balance all of these concerns, but I hope we all agree that we’re not   neglecting this issue as we discuss it   I have just a final point on this issue  There’s an awful lot of talk about how our policy is   extraordinary and the zero interest rate is unprecedented, and so on and so on  That is true in one   sense  But I think most of us around the table would agree that real interest rates are more   important than nominal interest rates, and real interest rates currently are about minus   09 percent, using the 12-month core inflation rate as the inflation measure  That is 50 basis   points tighter than it was eight months ago and less negative than it was during the 2003–2004   episode, while, of course, unemployment was about 3½ percentage points lower  So it’s true that   nominal interest rates are very low, but I hope that we can understand that real interest rates   should at least be given equal attention  Again, I believe that the substance should be that, for   now, we should stay where we are and have a pretty much status quo policy and policy   statement   June 22–23, 2010 162 of 213             I listened yesterday with great interest to the discussions about the balance sheet  I will   be checking back with you, depending on developments, about what I should or could say in the   hearings in about a month  I think those are all valid points, and, personally, I found it very   illuminating to hear the discussion yesterday, so I appreciate that   In terms of the statement and the preferences, virtually everybody agreed with alternative   B  There were a number of suggestions  Let me try to talk about a few of them and see if there’s   any interest in making changes  Both President Bullard and President Evans pointed out   correctly that we don’t have any explicit reference to quantitative easing in this statement  I   looked back, of course, in the last statement and we had no reference to it there, either, so there’s   no change from our previous statement in that respect  We’ve only referred to our balance sheet   when we’ve made some kind of change, but I think your point is a good one, and, in going   forward, I think we ought to try to look for a way to emphasize that we have, as Governor Warsh   said, two different tools, not just one   While I’m addressing President Bullard, let me refer to his discussion of the issue of   slack and inflation, and I understand there are mixed views about that  I would venture the   opinion that the last few months have been fairly kind to the slack theory  At least core measures   seem to be responding to slack, although, admittedly, in a short period of time, you can’t make a   definitive judgment  One thing we have proposed in this statement is to add a sentence about   other factors—as you mentioned, energy and commodity prices—and to state that underlying   inflation has trended lower  The latter, of course, is simply a statement of fact and moves in the   direction of saying “here’s something that we observe,” and it doesn’t say that underlying   inflation has trended lower because of slack or any particular factor   June 22–23, 2010 163 of 213             President Lockhart, Governor Tarullo and Governor Warsh all raised concerns about the   first paragraph, and I understand those concerns  I guess my reaction to Governor Tarullo’s   suggestion is that I think the last sentence still qualitatively describes the modal discussion   around the table  I’m happy to be corrected on that, but I’m a little reluctant to change what is a   fairly strong signal about the broad outline of the outlook at this point  Perhaps an alternative   would be to address a couple of the other descriptive sentences  Let me suggest two possibilities   and then see what the reaction is  First, in the second line it says, “Economic activity has   continued to strengthen,” and I’m not sure that that’s actually wrong, President Lockhart,   because that’s a level statement  Activity is a measure of the level of GDP, and of course, it has   continued to grow, but we could say “the economic recovery is proceeding,” which I think might   be a somewhat less strong statement  Second, Governor Warsh referred to business spending on   equipment and software “rising at a robust pace”  A very simple fix to that would be to go back   to the statement from the last meeting, which just said, “Business spending on equipment and   software has risen significantly,” which is a fact about recent events and which would not be a   change   Let me get a sense of everyone’s reactions  What about returning to the language from   the previous meeting on business spending on equipment and software?  I’m seeing nodding    Are there any who are opposed to that change?  [No response]  All right  Why don’t we do that?   The other more significant change would be to change, “Economic activity has continued to   strengthen,” to say, “Economic recovery is proceeding”  Could I have responses, views?      Well, it takes out the word “strong” and just says   “proceeding”   June 22–23, 2010 164 of 213              But that’s the judgment I’m asking for    Okay  Does anyone take a view or any other suggestion?    Staggering along    President Lockhart, let me ask you what you—    How many people favor saying that the economic recovery   is proceeding and that the labor market is improving gradually?  Charles, Charlie Evans,   Lockhart, Rosengren  Jeff, did you—?  I see about four  President Yellen  Any others?  Who is   in favor of keeping it?    All right  We’re going to wrap this up quickly  Let’s do   this again  Please raise your hand if you’re in favor of changing “economic activity has   continued to strengthen” to “the economic recovery is proceeding”?  How many are in favor of   June 22–23, 2010 165 of 213             that change?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight  That’s a pretty high number  How   many are in favor of the status quo?  Two, three, four, five Well, it looks like the bears have it    [Laughter] We’re saying “The economic recovery is proceeding,” and we’re also changing the   business spending back to the April language  Is that okay?  Helpful?   PARTICIPANTS Yes    President Bullard?    I think that raises other issues that we’ve discussed before   about what we want to signal about our balance sheet, but your point is noted    Well, because it suggests, as we have discussed before, that   we are looking potentially to near-term sales or purchases    Well, that’s true  That’s because it was including purchases    All right  I think I’m a little worried about that    Yes, I’m a little worried about that one for now  All right    Michelle, do you have everything you need?   June 22–23, 2010 166 of 213              Any other thoughts?  President Fisher    I think referring to political uncertainty would be crossing   the line  Putting in general uncertainty might be acceptable, but I’m not quite sure I see where to   do that  Do you have a suggestion?    All right  If there are no further comments, we’ll take the   roll, please    Thank you  A couple of quick other items  Brian Madigan   will be stepping down before the next meeting, effective July 23, as the FOMC Secretary and   Economist  We would like to propose Bill English to succeed him as the head of the Monetary   Affairs Division to fill that position for the rest of this year until next January when we will have   our annual election  If we move Bill to that position, that would leave open an Associate   Economist position  Bill and Jim Clouse have been alternating in that Associate Economist   position  So it would be natural to make Jim Clouse the Associate Economist for the Committee,   and I’d like to propose that  Any comments, questions?    Yes    Thank you    Thank you, Brian, for very good work, well done  I need a   motion on this    Governor Kohn   PARTICIPANT  Second    Without objection?  Seeing none, the last piece of business   is to note that the next meeting is Tuesday, August 10  I am about to adjourn the meeting  The   lunch for Governor Kohn will start at 100 pm in the dining room upstairs  We will now   adjourn the meeting  For those of you are interested, Brian Gross is prepared to give us a little   bit of legislative update  President Lacker?    Thank you  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   June 22–23, 2010 169 of 213     "
9026,2010-08-10,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  As usual, this is a joint FOMC–  Board meeting  I need a motion to close the Board meeting    Thank you  I’m sure most of you know that we tried very   hard to get our additional Board members confirmed in time for this meeting  Unfortunately, it   was not to be  We hope that, when the Senate returns in September, we will have action; but, for   today, I have once again asked Governor Kohn to lend us his wisdom  This is absolutely,   positively [laughter] Don’s last meeting, and we thank you, Don, for once again helping us out    Don will, in fact, without any contingency, be leaving on September 1  And we thank you again   for your service and for helping us make these difficult decisions   September 1 is also a sad day, because it will be the last day for our colleague, Brian   Madigan  Brian is very modest about being recognized, so it took a direct order from the   Chairman to get him even to come to the beginning of this meeting  [Laughter]  Brian has   attended 145 scheduled FOMC meetings, and he became both the FOMC Secretary and the head   of the Monetary Affairs Division in August of 2007—I’m not ascribing any causality there    Brian has made enormous contributions, as you all recognize  He has given us about six or   seven years’ worth of work in the last three years, and his dedication and his insight have been   extraordinarily helpful  To honor his service, we have put together a little gift for Brian, signed   dollar bills  No one has ever explained to me why signing these bills is legal, by the way   [Laughter]  Brian, thank you for all you have done for the Federal Reserve  [Extended   applause]  Do you want to say something, Brian?   August 10, 2010 4 of 160              Thank you, Brian  [Applause]  Well, on that sad note, let   me just remind everybody that today is a one-day meeting, so we’ll need to be especially   efficient to accomplish everything on our agenda   Before I turn to the financial briefing, Vice Chairman Dudley wants to introduce   someone    Welcome  Let’s begin, then, with our first item, which is a   briefing on financial developments, and I’ll turn to Brian Sack    Thank you, Brian  Brian referred to two memos on   financial stability, which are a regular input to this meeting, as are additional quarterly memos  I   propose that we continue to expand and integrate financial stability analysis into these meetings;   that will be a natural concomitant of the expansion of our responsibilities under the financial   regulatory reform bill, which we’ll discuss in September  I urge everyone to think about this   issue and make any suggestions you’d like about how we can better monitor financial conditions    Are there questions for Brian?  President Fisher    Thank you  President Kocherlakota     Other questions for Brian?  [No response]  Seeing no other   questions, we need to vote to ratify our open market operations since June  Can I have a motion?    It’s ratified, without objection  Thank you  All right, let’s   go on to Item 2, which is the economic situation, and I will turn to Larry Slifman   Is that a Sarbanes-Oxley requirement? [Laughter]    Thank you very much  Are there questions for our   colleagues?  President Lacker    President Fisher     President Lockhart    President Lacker    Did you draw any distinction between the effects of   earnings information and broad macroeconomic information?    Okay  Are there other questions for our colleagues?  [No   response]  Seeing none, let’s turn to our go-round, and we’ll start with President Plosser    President Plosser, B2 is still effectively there in the sense   that paragraph 4 can be excluded   August 10, 2010 26 of 160              Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Earlier we had concerns that our policy was insufficiently   conditional  I guess what this shows is that the markets are appropriately understanding that our   expectations are conditional on developments  So I take that as a good sign, namely, that a   weakening in the economy would lead markets to expect more accommodative policy    Could I inquire further about the peanut indicator?    [Laughter]  What was the implication of the cocktail versus the—    I see    President Yellen    Thank you  President Lockhart     Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Evans     Thank you  It’s a little after 1015 am  I understand   coffee is ready  Let’s take a 20 minute break    [Coffee break]     Let’s recommence with the Vice Chairman    Oh, I’m sorry  I thought we were going to keep drifting    [Laughter]  Governor Kohn    Thank you, Governor Kohn  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo  2  Thank you very much  Thank all of you for very   constructive comments, and thank you also for respecting the time limits, which was very   efficient  Let me try to maintain that, perhaps not quite as successfully, by giving a short   summary, and then I’ll make a few additional comments   The economy lost momentum during the intermeeting period, reflecting disappointing   incoming data on the labor market, consumer spending, and other areas, although it was noted   that month-to-month data can be noisy  NIPA revisions showed that the recession was deeper   than previously thought  Most participants expect the recovery to continue at a moderate pace,   picking up steam over time, but there is a question about whether economic growth will be   sufficient to achieve meaningful reductions in unemployment in coming quarters  Some   statistical models show growth well below potential going forward, and uncertainty may be   unusually high   Negative factors to the outlook include economic and policy uncertainty, weak business   and consumer confidence, the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, including a housing tax credit, the   waning of the inventory cycle, low rates of residential and nonresidential construction, and   continued tightness in credit for some but not all borrowers  It’s not yet clear that final demand   has picked up the baton from fiscal policy in the inventory cycle                                                     2 The materials used by Chairman Bernanke are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 10, 2010 76 of 160             On the other hand, positive factors include reduced investor concern about Europe, which   has supported improvement in financial markets, and stronger financial positions of households   and larger firms  Longer-term trends are consistent with recovery, but also show that per capita   output remains well below pre-recession peaks  Overall, downside risks to economic growth and   employment still appear to predominate   By contrast, the inflation outlook is little changed, with participants still expecting low   inflation but not, in most cases, deflation over the next couple of years   Household spending has recently been weaker than expected, in part reflecting the repair   of balance sheets  NIPA revisions showed that household saving was higher than previously   thought   Private sector job creation has been anemic since the spring, weighing on confidence and   spending, although wealth and income effects have been more supportive  The unemployment   rate has come down largely because of reduced participation and a low ratio of employment to   population rather than because of net job creation, and long-term unemployment remains a   concern  Multiple measures of underutilization of labor have been stagnant  Employers are   evidently reluctant to add permanent employees, given economic weakness and a range of   uncertainties  However, hours and labor income have increased  It is uncertain how much of the   higher unemployment rate reflects structural factors, mismatch and reallocation, and the effects   of unemployment insurance   Housing has remained depressed, despite rising affordability  Home prices are basically   flat, with increases in a few areas  Loan modification programs have been disappointing    Nonresidential construction remains generally weak   August 10, 2010 77 of 160             Equity prices have risen, reflecting the bank stress test in Europe and other policy actions   to increase investor confidence, as well as strong corporate earnings reports  Declining Treasury   yields and a weaker dollar have further eased financial conditions  Larger corporations have   easy access to credit  Venture capital activity is up, and there’s more life in the CMBS and   leveraged loan markets  Bank earnings have also improved, reflecting in part the stabilization or   decline in credit losses, and there may be some increase in their willingness to lend  CRE credit   remains a problem, but its extent is difficult to judge  The Senior Loan Officer Survey shows   some easing in terms and conditions  Small business credit conditions are hard to read  At least   some portions of small businesses applying for bank credit are receiving it   In the nonfinancial sector, industrial production has continued to expand fairly strongly;   profits have also been strong  Nevertheless, caution remains the prevailing sentiment, as has   been the case since early in the crisis, and there’s little appetite for expansion  Firms are holding   high levels of cash and prefer temporary workers, hours increases, and cost reductions to   permanent hires  Capital investment is mostly confined to replacements and upgrades  Some   sectors are showing strength, including manufacturing, autos, energy, temporary help, and   shipping  State and local government budgets are a drag on activity, and federal fiscal support is   diminishing  However, economic growth abroad remains solid, with Europe stronger and China   apparently heading to a soft landing   Underlying inflation trends, whether measured by core inflation or other indicators,   remain subdued  Wage growth and growth in unit labor costs remain moderate, and firms are not   complaining about input costs  Deflation risks exist, but a deflation is a relatively remote   scenario  Inflation expectations as measured by surveys, forecasts, and bond markets are stable   or down slightly  Firms do not generally expect to be able to raise prices significantly   August 10, 2010 78 of 160             Policy faces difficult challenges  The effectiveness of policy is uncertain in the current   environment, and, to the extent it is effective, it is important not to do long-run harm in   addressing short-run problems  However, the Committee is missing both its employment and   inflation objectives  Some argue that we need at least to prepare for negative shocks or deflation   scenarios  It may also be the case that the cost of further declines in output and inflation are   greater than the cost of missing in the other direction  Any comments or reactions?  [No   response]  Seeing none, let me just add a few thoughts   To begin, notwithstanding the fact that data are noisy, I do think there’s clear evidence   that the recovery is weaker than we thought  First, we had a substantial revision of history   showing that the recession was deeper than we previously thought  Second, the second-quarter   figures came in much lower than was anticipated as recently as the April Greenbook  Third, the   forecasts for the second half have come down quite substantially; for example, the Tealbook has   reduced its second-half forecast from 37 percent to 25 percent for GDP, and from 28 percent to   18 percent for consumption  So there has been a fairly significant movement in the outlook, and   it shows up in a variety of data, including labor markets, retail sales, housing, and several other   areas   In addition, although I understand that credit is improving generally, I think credit   constraints do remain a problem  One illustration of that is the fact that we’re seeing very little   mortgage refinancing despite very, very low mortgage rates that must be indicative, as the   Tealbook suggested, of some constraints on credit availability  I’m also concerned about   equipment and software spending  It has been pretty strong and has been a source of support for   recovery  But, to the extent, as many people have noted, that it reflects one-time replacements or   making up of deferrals, it will not be a leading category going forward   August 10, 2010 79 of 160             So, my first observation is that I do believe that there has been a loss of momentum and   that the outlook has deteriorated  It’s true that there are factors going in the other direction  A   number of people have noted the improvements in financial markets and credit extension and the   reduction of tail risk associated with improvements in the European situation  I think it is also   interesting, as Larry Slifman did, to contemplate the implications of the NIPA revisions on the   saving rate—it does have multiple possible implications  On the one hand, it could be that   households are making more progress than we expected in deleveraging  On the other hand, it   may be that they’re just more pessimistic, and they have lower longer-run income expectations   than we thought they did   It is true that the Tealbook expects an acceleration of economic growth in 2011, and I   think that’s possible  But I would summarize my concern by referring to some comments that I   made a couple of years ago when we were focusing on whether or not the economy was going   into recession  The issue then was whether or not a recession represents a separate state of the   economy; that is, whether there are nonlinearities that cause the economy to shift from one state   to another  My own view is that there are important nonlinearities, and they arise from a number   of possible underlying factors  An additional factor today is the zero lower bound of monetary   policy, which prohibits symmetric responses of policy to negative shocks  I’m not disputing the   modal projection of increased economic growth in 2011, but instead I’m arguing that, with an   economy that seems to continue to slow, it’s conceivable we might reach a tipping point that   would shift us into a much weaker situation   A particularly worrisome indication is the behavior of the unemployment rate  The   Tealbook currently projects that unemployment at the end of this year will be 97 percent, that is,   no lower than at the beginning of the year  With no progress being made on unemployment, it’s   August 10, 2010 80 of 160             understandable that consumer confidence would be low and that, in fact, we might be doing very   serious longer-term damage to the economy because of the longer-term unemployment effects on   skills and labor force attachment  In summary for this part of my remarks, I do think that the   outlook has weakened considerably, and I worry about that because I think there are important   nonlinearities in the dynamic process   My second comment is about inflation and, more generally, about nominal variables    The inflation projections, unlike the real projections, have remained stable in the Tealbook, and   they remain, save for core PCE, somewhere around 1 percent or slightly lower  Inflation   expectations have been reasonably stable, with, perhaps, a slight trend downward, as was   suggested, I think, by President Bullard   There are also, though, other nominal variables that are of interest  One that I’ve been   paying attention to is nominal GDP growth  I think it’s interesting to note that, between the   fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2009, the level of nominal GDP in the United   States declined; that is, we had no change or a slight decline in nominal GDP over that two-year   period  In the first half of this year, we had nominal GDP increased at an annual rate of   4½ percent  The Tealbook forecasts remain around a rate of 4 to 4½ percent  So we are   somewhere at this point 10 to 12 percent below where the trend line would have shown us to be   for nominal GDP   I mention this because of the discussion about monetary policy versus other tools  I think   even a worldview in which monetary policy’s effect on the real economy is quite limited would   argue that there’s something wrong if we are missing our two objectives on the same side, that is,   if we have employment that is too weak and inflation or nominal variables that are too low  I   think that’s a pretty strong indication that we are underperforming in terms of policy  So I think   August 10, 2010 81 of 160             there’s a case there for some additional stimulus, even if you are somewhat skeptical about the   effects on the economy of our policy   Let me quickly address a couple of other themes that have been raised today  First, let’s   talk a little bit about uncertainty and its effect on investment and hiring  As President Yellen   mentioned, this was, in fact, in my PhD dissertation  I’m glad to see that, after 31 years, it’s   finally getting a little attention  [Laughter]  There’s no doubt that uncertainty is affecting the   willingness of firms and consumers to make commitments to take on long-term investment or   hiring, and I think there has been some empirical evidence for this  I would note the Reserve   Bank survey on capital spending plans, which was circulated ahead of the meeting to everyone—  I think it showed some evidence for this view  In particular, that survey showed that about 60   percent of the firms surveyed in January and July were not planning to increase capital   expenditures, and of that 60 percent, 15½ percent in January and 19½ percent in July said that   increased or high economic or financial uncertainty was the main reason—that’s not trivial  At   the same time, similar percentages cited expected sales growth or low capacity utilization as   reasons   A couple of other indicators are given in the handout that was put out just for interest    The first picture in the handout shows essentially the mean and the variance of earnings   expectations for S&P 500 firms  Let’s focus on the bottom picture  That picture shows the   following variable  For each firm in the S&P 500, the variance of analysts’ forecast for year-  ahead earnings was constructed, and then that number was averaged across the 500 firms   weighting by assets  This is a pretty legitimate measure, I think, of uncertainty about earnings a   year ahead, which surely must be the most fundamental thing that firms are concerned about  If   you look at the right-hand side of the bottom chart, you see that uncertainty did soar in 2009, but,   August 10, 2010 82 of 160             currently, that particular measure of uncertainty about, at least, the year-ahead earnings is pretty   normal—it’s not particularly high even relative to the long-term trends  So that’s one indication,   for what it’s worth   The second indication is on the second page, which is drawn from the NFIB survey   which came out this morning  The top chart shows the results when firms were asked about the   most important problem, and, clearly, as Governor Tarullo noted and has been noted by others,   by far the biggest problem is weak demand  So I think aggregate demand has got to be a part of   the reason that firms are not hiring and not investing  In the bottom chart, you see some   additional variables, including government regulation, which is shown in the dark black  The   chart shows that 15 percent of the small firms now view uncertainty about government regulation   as their most important problem  But it doesn’t seem to have moved very much in the last   couple of years, and it’s certainly much lower than it was in the early 1990s  I don’t want to   draw too strong a conclusion from that, but I would say that I don’t think uncertainty by itself   explains the depths of the recession, nor, for that matter, do I think it makes monetary policy   impotent, because the cost of capital is still relevant on the margin, although it’s clear that it   might weaken the effect of that in some circumstances   As long as I’m talking about the real side here, I’ll just say one word about mismatches,   which also came up today  There’s certainly some of that  The staff looked at this in some   detail, and they have not found much evidence of reallocation across industries  That’s an   unusual feature of this recession, and I would just point out that employment in many so-called   standard or conventional industries is way below not just the bubble years, but even below 1990s   levels  For example, it’s true that we may never see the home construction rates we did in 2007,   but, surely, there is scope for expanding home construction relative to the current level, given   August 10, 2010 83 of 160             population trends and so on  The same thing would apply to parts of manufacturing, to retailing,   to health, and so on  So, even though there will be reallocation and mismatch, it seems to me   clear that there’s a lot of scope for increasing demand within existing industries and skill   categories   I want to make one other comment briefly  For the sake of time, I don’t want to go into   detail on President Bullard’s very interesting paper on inflation and expectations in Japan, but I   want to make a couple of quick points, and I’ll refer to the third page in the handout  The top   chart shows inflation expectations with different horizons in Japan as measured by Consensus   Economics, which is a well-known international firm  The black line shows one-year-ahead   inflation expectations, and the blue and the red lines show longer-horizon inflation expectations   for Japan  In the bottom chart, the black line shows actual headline inflation in Japan  I think   there are a couple of interesting things to observe from these charts  One is that the literal story   of a deflation trap does not seem consistent with them, because, at horizons longer than one year,   the expectation was for inflation, not for deflation  That still is the case today   But the more interesting thing is that there seems to be a pretty close correlation between   expectations, particularly at the one-year-ahead horizon, and actual inflation  Just from a visual   inspection, a comparison of the black lines in the top and bottom figures suggests to me that   inflation expectations, consistent with President Bullard’s work, have learning components, that   is, they are partially adaptive and partially reverting to the anticipated central bank inflation   objective  If that’s the case, it’s useful information for us  In particular, it suggests that the best   way to avoid a deflation trap is to avoid actual deflation, because it’s only if you observe   deflation or see something near deflation that deflation expectations are likely to emerge   August 10, 2010 84 of 160             Therefore, I would like essentially to endorse President Bullard’s perspective, which is   that deflation can be a trap, and, indeed, while I won’t discuss the analysis here, I think that in   that model you can generate adverse deflationary spirals  I think the best way to avoid   deflationary traps is to be preemptive and to use strong actions and words to avoid getting into a   deflation trap in the first place, and that would underlie the argument, I think, for a more   preemptive approach to policy  I will close there, and at this point we can go to the policy go-  around  Let me turn it over to Bill English    Thank you  As noted by the footnote on alternative B, in   the event that we decide to reinvest our agency securities into either Treasuries or agencies,   Brian Sack and his team have prepared a technical note that will be released at the same time as   the statement, and we will circulate it so that you have plenty of time to look at it  I thought I’d   give Brian just two minutes to say something about the technicalities of reinvestment for either   of those two asset classes   August 10, 2010 89 of 160              Thanks  I have one additional point  In the August 3 re-  funding announcement by the Treasury, it was asked how it would change its issuance if the   Federal Reserve decided to change its purchase pattern  The Treasury essentially said it would   offset whatever the Fed did  This means that if, at some point, we decided to acquire more   longer-term securities, we should not feel trapped  For example, suppose that in the future we   decided to adopt option 2 from the last meeting, which is rolling over medium-term securities   into bills or other short-term securities  We could do that with the knowledge that the Treasury   was going to offset that action, so the net effect on monetary policy would be nil, and we could   present it that way  That gives us a bit more flexibility if we get to that point  I wouldn’t   recommend that we try to do it today because there are too many moving parts  Any questions   for anyone?  President Lacker    Sure    Vice Chairman, did you have a comment?    But there’s going to be a simultaneous issuance of the press   release which says basically what our target is going to be and the process    And I recognize my error in introducing this topic  I’ll turn   to President Kocherlakota   August 10, 2010 94 of 160              Yes  That was the idea  But that’s not with respect to this   action    It can obviously only affect the Treasuries  It’s not the   MBS part    Currently we are rolling over Treasury securities into   Treasury securities of essentially the same maturity  If in the future we decide to roll over our   longer-term securities into shorter-term securities—bills and other short-term securities—the   Treasury has announced its intention, although I think we don’t want to be completely reliant on   it, to change its issuance so that the private sector’s holdings are unaffected by our action   Governor Duke    Governor Tarullo   MR TARULLO  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Governor Duke, were you not finished?  I’m sorry    Governor Tarullo   August 10, 2010 96 of 160              President Fisher, did you have a question?    Let’s go to the policy round and start with President   Rosengren    Thank you  President Yellen    Let me reiterate the thanks to the staff  I think we all   appreciated that input  President Lacker    Just for clarity, we’re talking about keeping the current   level of reserves constant, not adding to the current level    President Evans    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Warsh   August 10, 2010 125 of 160              Thank you  Governor Duke      Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  I will try to pull myself together here  Thank   you for the comments  Despite the reservations and concerns I’ve heard around the table, I   believe that the right step is alternative B, to reinvest in Treasuries  Let me try to explain why   First of all, as I said, I don’t think we’re looking at monthly noise  I think there has been   a weakening in the outlook, which might be acceptable, if everything were linear in the world,   but my own belief is that there are nonlinearities, including the nonlinearity of policy, and I think   that raises the risk of a truly unacceptable outcome, one that would have long-term consequences   August 10, 2010 134 of 160             for our labor force and for our economy  I think that it’s quite a serious concern and that we   need to pay attention to it   Second, and this is what very much puzzles me about the discussion around the table, is   that, even if you are a pure inflation targeter and don’t give a damn about unemployment, we are   too tight  All of our nominal variables are coming in below target—we are forecasting inflation   that is too low  Again, I don’t understand President Plosser’s concern about fine-tuning—I think   that any inflation targeting central bank, given the forecast we have, would try to find a way to   ease policy  So that seems to me to be right from that perspective For me, the difficulty has   been rationalizing having both parts of our mandate falling short of the target on the same side    So, again, I don’t understand that argument   Regarding the argument that President Bullard has raised, which is to try to be proactive   and to try to indicate our strong commitment, I think that will be helpful for confidence and for   expectations  Let me add that I do believe that the effects of this policy will work through   mechanisms over and above the 20 basis points—the estimate that keeps getting referred to  I   think there are other financial channels  There are risk preference and term premium channels,   potentially credit availability channels, confidence, expectations, and a variety of other things    This action may not be very effective, but I suspect that it will have some effect—we’ll have to   see   Some people argue that we shouldn’t do the reinvestment because it won’t be effective,   and some seem to be arguing that we shouldn’t do it because it will be too effective  So I   honestly am a little puzzled on that  It seems to me, as I said, that we are on the wrong side of   our objectives, that we are to blame if we don’t make whatever effort we can  Now, it may not   work, but, if the economy is in near deflation six months from now, I would rather say that the   August 10, 2010 135 of 160             Fed did what it could to prevent it rather than saying the Fed stood around and let things happen    So there are errors in both directions and concerns in both directions, but I think we ought to try   to do what we can do even if it isn’t necessarily going to be fully effective or solve the problem   That ties to the other question about the Fed not being in some sense the optimal agency   to solve the problem  Clearly, we’d like to have better fiscal policy  Clearly, we’d like to have   better regulatory policy  There are many things that we would like to see done better  Sure, the   Fed cannot solve the problem  But it is, I think, incumbent upon us to do what we can do and, in   particular, we are responsible for the inflation rate, and the inflation rate is evidently too low   In sum, I guess I’m still not persuaded by the arguments I’ve heard, although I recognize   that this is not without its risks, and, in particular, how it would be interpreted  I think Governor   Warsh and President Fisher were correct that there were some expectational issues related to our   earlier purchases of Treasuries  I think there are some risks there  On the other hand, to some   extent we want to increase inflation expectations, so it’s a tricky act, I have to admit  Therefore,   having heard what people around the table said, again, my preference would be alternative B   with Treasuries   There was a lot of discussion about what this signals  I am becoming a Bullard acolyte in   the following sense  The next time we do anything, I don’t think we should go out and say,   “Well, we’re going $400 billion of Treasuries”  I think we ought to have a framework that says,   “Here’s our objective”  And then we say that we’re trying to achieve an inflation rate, or a price   level target or a nominal GDP target or something, and that we are going to calibrate our   purchases or sales in a way that tries to reach that target  That would create some structure, and   that would take away this perception that periodically we’re going to go out and do a shock-and-   awe action  Having said that, I think that we really need to see how this works and what benefit   August 10, 2010 136 of 160             it has, if any  So barring some major change in the outlook—and I do want us to think about our   tools, I do want us to think about our framework—I don’t anticipate bringing another large step   back to the Committee   On the language in the statement, President Lockhart made a couple of suggestions,   although, President Lockhart, you didn’t really have specific language suggestions    The second language issue that got a lot of attention was   Governor Kohn’s phrase at the end of paragraph 2  I have to admit that, given all that is   happening, and given the concerns people have, I’m just a tad nervous about it, because it might   signal more concern about deflation than we currently have  But I did hear a number of   supporters  Governor, do you have any thoughts about that possibility?     So you’re in favor of not doing it?    That’s fine  I guess that’s my concern   August 10, 2010 137 of 160              Okay  If Governor Kohn will withdraw his suggestion,   we’ll drop that    Otherwise, the only other change for Michelle’s benefit is   to make sure to take out the “alternatively” phrase in paragraph 4    Yes  Sorry    Sure    I think we need some motivation    How about “To maintain its current level of monetary   policy accommodation, the Committee will hold the Federal Reserve”—no  “The Committee   will”—    To keep?    To keep constant the Federal Reserve’s level of monetary   policy accommodation?  Is that better?    How about something a little bit more balanced between   recovery and price stability?    That’s okay, but you would drop the initial phrase?    Okay    All right    “To help support the economic recovery in a context of   price stability, the Committee will keep constant the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities”?    Is that okay?    Did you get that Michelle?    Any other suggestions?  [No response]    All right, recognizing that I don’t have the full support of   the Committee, I’m nevertheless going to propose alternative B with the emendations already   made  Would you call the roll, please, Matt?    Okay  Thank you  The next meeting is Tuesday,   September 21—it’s another one-day meeting  It will be followed by our conference on financial   regulatory reform that President Lacker and Governor Tarullo have been working on  The   FOMC meeting is now concluded  The Board meeting will reconvene once we have our lunch to   discuss the centennial  Thank you   END OF MEETING   August 10, 2010 141 of 160     "
9051,2010-09-21,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  I need a motion to close the   Board meeting    The five at the table are stretching out pretty well here    We’re thinking of leasing out a few offices  [Laughter]   I think there is potentially some good news, in that we have some prospect of getting two   people appointed before the Congress goes back on break  Peter Diamond will have to have   another hearing—he needs to convince Senator Shelby that he’s a qualified economist    [Laughter]  Is Linda Robertson here?  Any comments?    We’re making progress, and we hope to come to a   resolution at some point   Before we get started, I wanted to address an issue that came up during the intermeeting   period relating to the preparation of the minutes  One of our colleagues raised a concern that the   first draft of the minutes this time didn’t fully reflect the discussion at the meeting, and I wanted   to explain what happened and what we did about it  The background is that, based on   longstanding tradition and reflecting the Federal Reserve Act’s requirement that we explain why   the Committee took the action it did, we have always had a so-called “policy paragraph,” which   explains the action taken by the Committee and gives the specific reasons cited by the members,   that is, the voters, for their support of that decision  Normally, there’s no issue, because   September 21, 2010 3 of 151             generally there’s a substantial overlap of views between the voting members and nonvoting   members, and we’re able to represent the full range of the discussion  But in the first round of   the review of the minutes from the last meeting, it was felt that that was not the case   I’ve had some discussions with Scott and with the Secretariat  This matter was actually   raised at the December 2004 FOMC meeting, when we discussed the more rapid turnaround of   the minutes  There’s a very longstanding tradition of restricting that paragraph to the views of   the members   That being said, I certainly believe, and I’m sure that we all agree, that the minutes ought   to reflect the full range of discussion at the table and not just the views of those who happen to   be in the voting cycle  We were able to do that this time by looking for overlaps between views   expressed by participants and members, by including additional material, and so on  So let me   just assure everybody that we will continue to maintain the principle that the full range of views   should be reflected in the minutes, and we will find ways to do that   I think changing the current structure of the minutes is something we would not do   lightly  It’s a very longstanding tradition, and if we want to change it, I think we need to have a   fuller discussion  President Plosser, do you want to comment?  If anyone wants to comment, I   can take one or two comments, but if we want to go into this in greater detail, we probably need   to put it on the agenda for a future meeting   Do you want to make a comment?    Bill, did you have a comment?    I agree with what you said, President Plosser  On the one   hand you need to have this correspondence of the members because, for one thing, we report   their votes    That being said, I think that there are plenty of ways to   make sure that there is substantial description of the discussion so that everybody’s views are   represented  President Lacker    Well, I just point out this hasn’t been a significant problem   in the past    This is the first time this has come up in quite a while  So   the principle is that, while the minutes wouldn’t cover every single minor point that anyone   makes, all of the important views ought to be reflected in the minutes  I think we can do that   September 21, 2010 6 of 151             without changing the structure of the members’ policy paragraphs  First, we can continue to   exploit overlaps when they do occur, allowing for a member to express a view that was more   widely held  Second, there’s obviously no reason why we can’t expand the discussion  The   structure of the minutes is that first are reports and staff views, and then finally the general   discussion of the participants on a variety of topics, including the outlook and policy approaches   and so on  I think we ought to work to make sure that that part reflects all the views  The   Secretariat has heard from me that that’s what we need to do, and the one thing I would suggest   to all of you is that you get back your comments on the first draft as quickly as possible to make   sure that there’s not any kind of logistical issue involved  Okay?    The objective is to make sure that everybody’s views are   represented  We’ll find a way to do that  If that involves expanded content prior to the critical   paragraph, we will do that    Good  Thank you    President Evans    Okay  Thanks, and if it’s not, I’m completely open  Again,   I think we share the objective of representing the full range of views  If this continues to be a   problem, we will address it somehow, and we’ll put it on the agenda if necessary    Moving on to the business of the meeting, the first item is   the return of Debbie Danker  We’d like to propose her as Deputy Secretary for the rest of the   year until the January 2011 organizational meeting  Debbie served as FOMC Deputy Secretary   from November 2004 through August 2009, and she has just recently returned to the Board after   spending a year at the Treasury as a Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary for Domestic   Finance    Any objections?  (No response)  All right  Thank you    Our next item, as usual, is our briefing on financial developments and System facilities  Let me   turn to Brian Sack    Thank you, Brian  Questions for Brian?  President Fisher    Thank you  President Rosengren    Governor Warsh    President Bullard    Okay  Any other questions for Brian?  [No response]  If   not, I need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations   September 21, 2010 17 of 151              Okay, it is ratified without objection     Let me just note that, as usual, the staff circulated several memos on financial stability,   including memos on asset valuations, leverage, and risks facing the banking sector  In addition,   the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on dealer financing terms made its debut in the   Tealbook  Again, we are continuing our efforts to make sure that financial stability issues are   integrated into our discussion  Of course, in our meeting this afternoon and tomorrow, we will   be talking about very substantial expansion of the Federal Reserve’s capacity to monitor   financial stability issues, which, again, we will want to integrate, obviously, not only into our   oversight and supervision, but also into our monetary policymaking  So I just take note of that,   which, I think, is very important  And a number of you, of course, have expressed those   concerns as well   Our next item is the economic situation  Let me turn to Dave Stockton     If a country goes from advanced status to emerging market,   is that a submerging market?  [Laughter]    Questions for our colleagues?  President Plosser   September 21, 2010 24 of 151              When you say “part of the model,” how do you treat   residuals?  Aren’t residuals going to be assumed to decay over time?    Okay    Other questions?  President Kocherlakota    President Fisher    Okay  Seeing no other questions, we are ready for our   economic go-round  We want the full benefit of everyone’s wisdom, but please remember this is   a one-day meeting, so please try to keep that wisdom as tightly expressed as possible  President   Plosser    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Hoenig   September 21, 2010 49 of 151              Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Warsh   September 21, 2010 60 of 151              Thank you  Governor Duke     Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you, and thanks both for very good contributions and   for very efficient contributions  Why don’t we take about a 20 minute break?  We’ll continue   from there   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we recommence?  Again, thank you for   very useful insights  The go-round today was a little more abstract and academic, and I found it   pretty hard to summarize  I’ve got all of these footnotes now  [Laughter]  Let me try to   summarize what I heard, and then I would like to weigh in a little bit, although a lot of what I   wanted to say has been said in some context or another   Economic growth has slowed moderately further, indicating some additional loss of   momentum over the summer  At this pace of growth, progress in reducing the unemployment   rate is likely to be quite slow  A range of factors, including economic and policy uncertainty,   risk aversion, low levels of confidence, and the weak financial conditions of some households   and firms, continue to be drags on economic growth  Recoveries after financial crises often tend   to be quite slow  During this weak phase, the economy may be more susceptible to shocks,   including financial shocks  However, despite all that, the economy is still expanding, with   moderate increases in consumer spending and modest job creation  The recovery is expected to   continue into 2011, accelerating thereafter  A double dip is a possibility, but most do not   consider it likely  Inflation is expected to remain low, reflecting inflation expectations that are   stable to down and continuing economic slack   September 21, 2010 68 of 151             Retail sales were a little stronger than expected recently and are generally seen as mixed,   although shoppers remain very price-sensitive  Retailers are increasing inventories for the   Christmas season  Households are improving their balance sheets by saving, paying down debt,   refinancing, and in some cases defaulting   The labor market remains weak, having started from a deep hole  Employment in many   sectors has fallen significantly  Firms have increased temporary hiring, but net permanent hires   remain limited  Some companies prefer to hire abroad  Long-term unemployment, along with   structural factors, such as skills mismatch and labor force participation, as well as extended UI,   may account for some of the increase in unemployment, but how much is due to these factors   and how much is due to final demand is difficult to assess  Firms are generally not finding it   difficult to find workers with specialized skills  Wage gains remain very limited   Housing has continued to be very weak, in part because of the end of the housing tax   credit  Government programs have had only a limited impact on the rate of foreclosures    Foreclosures are adding to supply, putting downward pressure on prices and construction   Financial conditions have been mixed, generally improving, but responding sensitively to   economic news  Banks have been hurt somewhat by worse earnings, concerns about financial   regulation, weak loan demand, and problems with the economy  However, credit problems have   mostly peaked, except in CRE, and banks are looking for qualified borrowers  There’s   confidence that banks can meet new capital standards  In the nonfinancial sector, credit   conditions are good for larger firms, and cash holdings remain plentiful  Uncertainty about the   economy and policy remain important for investment and hiring, although there’s always the   question of whether firms’ self-reported concerns can be taken at face value  Final demand is   certainly an issue for many firms  Firms with Asian connections are doing well  As usual, some   September 21, 2010 69 of 151             sectors are stronger, including agriculture, business travel, and shipping  Small business   confidence has been weak, and concerns about both final demand and access to credit for these   firms continue   Inflation remains low, with measures of underlying inflation having fallen since the start   of the recession  Analysis of components suggests that disinflation may be abating  Pricing   power is perceived as very limited by most firms, although price pressures on some commodities   and imported goods may be rising  Inflation expectations seem reasonably stable, though TIPs   breakevens have fallen over the year, and the far-forward term structure of breakevens is quite   low  Deflation risks are still considered low but should not be ignored   Monetary policy is quite accommodative, and policy must take into account the costs and   benefits of further actions  Policy cannot address all the real-side issues that we see, in part   because of damage to the transmission mechanism  On the other hand, the Committee is far   from meeting its mandated objectives  It’s missing both in the same direction, and risks may be   asymmetric, as a liquidity or deflation trap is a possible risk  We look forward to further   discussion about the appropriate framework for communicating and executing policy     That was my attempt, but there were a lot of subtleties that I’m sure I missed  Any   comments?  President Lacker    I heard that around the table, yes    Someone commented that the transmission mechanism   might not be as effective as it had been in the past   September 21, 2010 70 of 151              Somebody acknowledge saying it?    President Fisher  There you go  [Laughter]  I can always   count on President Fisher to make a statement    All right, let me try to add a little bit  As I said, a lot of   what I would say otherwise has already been very well expressed   I think it’s important to note that we’ve had significant markdowns in the outlook since   April  Just using the Greenbook as a baseline, in April we expected about 35 to 37 percent   GDP growth for 2010 and 44 percent for 2011  Today it’s closer to 2 percent for 2010 and   33 percent for 2011  So this is very significant  I think even more significant is the implication   of this markdown for the path of unemployment  In April, we said that the Greenbook predicted   that the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter would be 93 percent, and in the fourth quarter   of 2011 it would be 82 percent  Those numbers are now 97 and 91  In other words, we are   approaching a pace of economic growth at which unemployment will no longer be improving    We’re coming very close to that singularity, if you will   I also want to point out that a lot of folks around the table said that they were not   surprised, more or less, by the current weaker outlook  But I don’t recall that there was much   disagreement in April about the outlook at that time; therefore, surely, we’ve almost all been   surprised by the weaker incoming data  In addition, as someone noted, the changes in the   outlook for the pace of the recovery are somewhat reliant on the equilibrating properties of our   September 21, 2010 71 of 151             models, and a particular business plan that would rely on this recovery might not be thought to   be immune to the potential risks   To recap, the economy has slowed considerably, the outlook is weaker, and we are   approaching the point where unemployment is likely to stay very high for a very long time   We had quite an interesting discussion around the table about how much of this is   unavoidable, how much is cyclical, how much is structural  I think these are important   questions, and let me just give a bit of advance notice that the staff is going to present an analysis   of these issues at the January meeting, so we’re going to have a chance to get into this issue in   some detail   A number of people around the table talked about the Beveridge curve  I’m not going to   be able to add too much to what was already said, but, just for your reference, I circulated some   charts3  They show Beveridge curves for every recession back to 1973–1975 based on quarterly   data using help-wanted indexes, because that’s the only measure of vacancies which is available   all the way back  I would point out a couple of things  The first is that every recession has this   big loop, as you can see from the pictures  For example, compare the earlier dynamics with what   you see on the very last page, which shows the current recession  Given this, I don’t think the   fact that we’ve risen above the curve in the last couple of quarters is particular informative    Rather, it looks to me as if we’re just in the normal recovery dynamics in that respect, although,   obviously we have a very long way to go, given how far the unemployment rate has increased in   this episode   The other interesting thing—and this is a point a number of people made—has to do with   both the location and the slope of the Beveridge curve in the most recent episode  First, if you   compare the initial vacancy rates—help-wanted indexes as a percentage of employment—they’re                                                     3 The material used by Chairman Bernanke is appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   September 21, 2010 72 of 151             typically around 100, 110; in this recession, they started out at 70  There seem to be some things   going on here—some change, perhaps, in the way that help-wanted indexes are constructed or in   the way that vacancy practices are conducted—which are probably not fundamental to the labor   market  The other thing that is very striking about the last picture is how flat the Beveridge   curve is  That could be interpreted as consistent with the structural unemployment view, in that   vacancies haven’t fallen nearly as much as you would expect, given how much unemployment   has increased  I think there are also other interpretations, including, first, how the help-wanted   indexes and these vacancies are measured  But there’s a kind of zero- bound issue, which I think   might be worth taking into account  Presumably there’s always a certain amount of frictional   vacancies, a certain amount of frictional turnover  As a result, it may simply be that the curve is   asymptoting to the horizontal axis, and that’s one reason that it’s flatter  I don’t mean to   conclude anything from this; I just give you this information for your reference, and, as I said,   we’ll have a more detailed discussion in January  I would just say that, at this point, the question   is quite open on how much slack there still is  One piece of evidence in favor of there being   significant slack, of course, is that wages and compensation have been very soft   Again, my first observation, essentially, is that the outlook really has deteriorated fairly   significantly, and I am concerned about the fact that we are potentially approaching, as I said, the   level where unemployment may not come down significantly or, as Dave Stockton mentioned,   we might be approaching a stall speed that might cause the economy to fail to make further   progress   Now, we had a good bit of discussion around the table about how much monetary policy   can do about the real side of the economy  I think I am more optimistic than some others are  I   do think that there is still some scope to create more aggregate demand and to cause the economy   September 21, 2010 73 of 151             to strengthen  But there is, of course, the other side of the mandate, which is nominal quantities,   and, whatever one might think about the ability of monetary policy to affect unemployment and   economic growth, I think almost all economists would agree that we can affect nominal   quantities  The simple fact is that almost all nominal measures in our economy are at very low   levels and are expected to remain at low levels  I talked last time about nominal GDP, which   was completely flat from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009 and is growing   now at a rate of about less than 4 percent, hardly consistent with a strong recovery   We’ve talked about inflation measures  There’s a wide variety of inflation measures,   including some that the Cleveland Fed puts out, and some exclude OER, and some are core   measures, headline measures, chain-weighted measures, market-based measures, etc  Based on   all of these, I think there’s a very strong presumption that inflation is quite low  I would have to   argue that, certainly relative to the business cycle peak, there’s been a distinct disinflation over   the last couple of years, which would be consistent with the paper that Stock and Watson gave in   Jackson Hole, which suggested that disinflation is very common in deep recessions  Associated   with that, of course, is the decline in breakevens, which is about 50 basis points since the   beginning of the year on almost all horizons  Also, there are wages, M2 growth—all of these   nominal variables are very weak   President Bullard preemptively and very astutely pointed out that optimal policy doesn’t   mean that inflation and employment are on opposite sides of the mandate, and you can see that   by looking at any Tealbook simulation of optimal policy, which will show that inflation and   unemployment typically approach their targets from the same direction  So that’s certainly true   But I’d just make two comments about that  One is that not only is current inflation low,   but also the Tealbook is projecting inflation to be very low for a number of years  As someone   September 21, 2010 74 of 151             pointed out, if we were 1 percentage point above our inflation target for two to three years into   the future, we think we would be a little bit more concerned  So I think it’s an important issue   that the projection of inflation remains low  Another point is that, if you look at the optimal   policy analyses in the Tealbook, of course, they show optimal interest rates of minus 4 percent;   in other words, there’s not enough stimulus, based on conventional analysis of the economy   So, bottom line, the economy has slowed  I think we can do something about it    Whether we can or not, however, I think we do have a responsibility to make sure that nominal   quantities are, over time, approaching the appropriate levels, and, at this point, our forecasts do   not say that  I note also that, as others, including President Bullard, have mentioned, there is a   bit of an asymmetry, in that, if inflation gets a little higher, we know how to address that, but if   inflation gets too low, there is a certain black hole, a kind of trap, that we might get into, and we   certainly don’t want to do that  My view, then, is that we need to consider seriously taking   measures that will move inflation up from 1 percent or a little lower to something closer to what   I think the majority of the Committee would view as a more appropriate longer-term inflation   rate, something closer to 2 percent or a little bit below that   Based on what I’ve said so far, you could make an argument for taking action today, but   there are a number of reasons not to do that  One is that there still is genuine uncertainty about   the most recent economic data  Do they, in fact, signal a more persistent decline in the outlook,   or are the last few weeks more indicative, and will we see strengthening over the next couple of   months?  We may have legitimate differences about whether we think at this point the data are   sufficiently clear about the outlook   Beyond that, however, I think there are two other reasons not to take action today  One is   that our communication has not prepared the public or the markets for significant action today,   September 21, 2010 75 of 151             for better or worse  As a result, if we were to take action today, it might be bad for confidence   rather than good for confidence; we saw some of that in the effects of our statement from the last   meeting  The other reason I think we shouldn’t take any explicit action today is that—and I   think everyone agrees, even if we don’t take action, we should be preparing for the possibility of   action—if we’re going to be considering going back into additional monetary stimulus, we really   need to get more agreement of some kind on what our framework is going to be  President   Bullard, once again, has made important arguments about a more continuous reaction function  I   think that’s an important issue to look at  I think it’s important to ask whether or not we might   want to give an explicit number for our inflation objective; those two things could be combined,   or they could be separate  President Evans has submitted an interesting paper on price level   targeting  All of these things have, I think, important advantages   Given this, I have a recommendation—obviously, I am anticipating a bit, and I’m also   hoping to get reactions from you in the next round  My recommendation would be that in this   next round we talk a bit about frameworks and think about whether or not we would like to set a   process in place, so that, by the next meeting, if we decided that adding further stimulus was   necessary, we would be able to do so in the context of a framework that we feel comfortable   staying with for a period of time   Again, I think a new framework is potentially very useful  First, there’s a lot of historical   experience which suggests that something that looks like a regime break can be very positive for   expectations  Examples would be the 1934 Roosevelt change in monetary policy, the 1979   Volcker change in monetary policy  If we were to change our approach, it could very well signal   a change in regime that would have a beneficial effect on expectations and confidence  Second,   we do need to give more clarity about our reaction function if we’re going to come back into this   September 21, 2010 76 of 151             type of activity, and, certainly, having a more explicit framework that could be communicated   not only through the statement but also through other mechanisms could be very helpful there   The alternative statements we circulated, A1 and A2, were just for illustration and   discussion  They showed how one could introduce a numerical inflation target and how one   could introduce a continuous adjustment process that responds to changes in economic   conditions  Again, they are meant for discussion  Obviously, if we decide we want to proceed   with further development of an approach, we have six or seven weeks until the next meeting    Therefore, we have time to get staff input, and we can have an interim discussion, if necessary    But I do think we need to make progress on a framework, irrespective of your views on further   stimulus   To tip my hand, as I already have, I think that we are getting very close to the point,   barring relatively good data coming in in the next six, seven weeks, where we should make good   our obligation to ensure that nominal quantities, like inflation and nominal GDP, are at levels   consistent with a healthy recovery   Let me stop there and turn to Bill English to introduce the policy round, and then, of   course, folks can reply to those comments as they wish    Thank you, Bill  Are there any questions?  [No response]    Okay, seeing none, I’ll turn to President Evans    Thank you  President Yellen    Thank you  President Lacker   September 21, 2010 88 of 151              Thank you  I’ll add a small point, which is that we already   have in B1 the statement, “The Committee anticipates a gradual return”  So there already is   some language personalizing the Committee    I understand your point as well  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  I did actually think about the LTROs, the long-  term refinancing operations that the Europeans used  They basically give longer-term loans at   September 21, 2010 104 of 151             low interest rates to banks  That approach isn’t very popular  But, in principle, you could   restrict the kind of collateral you’ll accept—to do credit, for example  There are practical   problems with that  And I’m sure a few of our colleagues would worry about credit applications,   so I’m not sure we’d want to jump right into that  But let me just say, in general, that we should   think about whether there are other tools besides purchases of assets  We’re up to President   Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you very much  President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  President Fisher    I can go one better  We used not to issue any statement at   all [Laughter]    Vice Chairman    Thank you very much  Thanks, everyone, for your input    This is very, very difficult  We don’t have good options  It feels safer not to do anything, but   then, on the other side, we have an economy which is underperforming very severely—we have   very high unemployment  So there’s no safe option  Whatever we do, we’re going to have to   make our best judgment and hope for the best   September 21, 2010 121 of 151             I certainly appreciate the comments that President Hoenig and Governor Warsh and   others have made about the risks and uncertainties associated with these monetary policies that   we’re using  At the same time, as I said, I’m concerned about the state of the economy, and I   don’t think that these policies are necessarily marginal in their impact  There’s more to the   effects than just the portfolio-balance effects, for example  Inflation expectation effects, for   example, could be very powerful if they took us back up to, say, 2 percent  I do think we should   be moving in this direction, and I’m glad to hear that there’s broad support for trying to develop   a framework that will give more certainty and more clarity to the public about what we’re doing    With respect to that, I’m certainly open to a longer meeting next time, and I also was going to   suggest the possibility of a video meeting sometime in between, if the staff were ready to go over   some preliminary discussion points—we certainly can consider that   I have one final comment on the substance  I just disagree with the view that we should   not do anything until deflation is upon us  First of all, zero is only a number  Low inflation is   also costly, because it creates low inflation expectations, higher real interest rates, higher debt   burdens, and has, therefore, negative effects on the real economy as well as being not at the level   of inflation that I think most of us consider consistent with our mandate  Moreover, of course,   these things have a lot of momentum, and, if you wait too long, then you may find yourself   seriously behind the curve  So I feel comfortable with moving in this direction  I think, broadly   speaking, it’s the right direction   Sorry, I have a couple of additional things  There were a lot of interesting specific points   on the framework, and I think the main thing is that we need to keep working at it  President   Bullard suggested we undertake a few things today  I understand his point, but I take his   comments as being input to the discussion we need to have during the intermeeting period and at   September 21, 2010 122 of 151             the next meeting  Some of the issues were about whether or not the appropriate measure is the   flow of new purchases or the stock size of the balance sheet; I think those are good questions that   we need to think through   The statement is also a little risky, because it changes quite a bit  The reaction to our last   statement wasn’t very good  I, obviously, have to take some responsibility for that  I think   partly it was bad luck, but partly it was that we didn’t convey exactly the appropriate tone in   terms of our outlook for the economy  I think a risk in this statement is that, by talking about   inflation below our preferred levels, we may convey a greater fear of deflation than we want  I   thought about a very small change in paragraph B2 where it says “Measures of underlying   inflation have declined” Maybe we could change that to “have come down over time”—  something like that that’s a bit less dramatic?  “Decline” sounds as if it happened since the last   meeting  So it would read, “Measures of underlying inflation have come down over time and are   currently at levels…”  My hope, therefore, is to mitigate that risk  As we communicate, we   should be clear that we are looking at an inflation level that is not yet deflation, of course, and   that we don’t necessarily anticipate it to be deflation, but, nevertheless, it is too low for the best   performance that we can achieve   By the way, on this issue of what rate the Committee judges to be appropriate, I realize   that we haven’t discussed it for a few years, but this Committee has discussed these issues three   or four times in the last decade, I think, and the conclusions have been pretty much the same in   each case  PCE inflation is the right measure, and the level is something around 2 percent, or a   little less than 2 percent  Certainly this is something we want to clarify at the next meeting if we   decide to go in this direction  But it’s also true that the current inflation rates are below virtually   September 21, 2010 123 of 151             everybody’s estimate of what the appropriate longer-run inflation rate is in your projections, so I   don’t think we are going, really, too far from what’s appropriate   Finally, I heard the comments on the last paragraph, B4  It’s a very delicate calculation    Like the Vice Chairman, I’d like to be sure to leave some optionality  Since we circulated the   first version of this a week ago, we have tried to tone it down twice  The Tealbook was   substantially moderated, and then we made changes yesterday that were intended to make the   future action less certain  I guess I’m open to a groundswell, but my recommendation would be   to stay with the language we currently have  Vice Chairman?    Okay  So, after all that discussion, my recommendation is   to stick with alternative B as written, with the change I suggested  “Measures of underlying   inflation have come down over time”  Do you have any concern about deflation fear, Michelle,   Bill, Brian, anyone?   September 21, 2010 124 of 151              President Fisher    Right  But the purpose of introducing it there is to say that   that’s one of our policy objectives    You could put a period after “subdued for some time”    Okay   September 21, 2010 125 of 151              I appreciate it  In the spirit of President Bullard, “as   needed” suggests that we will calibrate our response to the need of the economy    Other comments?  President Yellen, do you have a   comment?  Are you okay?   September 21, 2010 126 of 151              President Lacker    Vice Chairman, are you okay with it?     Okay  The two changes are “if needed” and “come down   over time”  If no one else has any comments, President Lockhart    I like that “Measures of underlying inflation are currently   at levels somewhat below”  By the way, putting the word “levels” in the plural is meant to   capture the notion that people may have somewhat different estimates   Okay, I think we are going to run into hard constraints  Anything else?  [No response]    All right  Matt, would you please read where we are now?    Okay  Would you call the roll?    Thank you very much  The next meeting is November 2   and 3  We will be in touch with you about appropriate scheduling  Lunch is available  At   300 pm we will reconvene for the System conference on implementation of financial reform in   Dining Rooms E and F  Is that right, President Lacker?    Okay, thank you very much   END OF MEETING   September 21, 2010 128 of 151     "
9073,2010-10-15,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, everybody, for joining us on a Friday afternoon    This was a hard meeting to schedule, and this seemed to be the only time that worked, so I   apologize for any inconvenience  We’ve told everyone we are going to try to finish by 530, and,   depending on how things go, perhaps we can do better than that  Is President Plosser on the line?    President Plosser is on vacation  He’ll be listening in  As you   know, he submitted a memo expressing his views, which I hope you’ve seen   A theme of our meeting in September was the possibility that we might want to modify our   policy and communication framework to help provide clarity in the current situation, which is one   where interest rates are essentially at the zero lower bound  A number of you suggested starting the   next FOMC meeting earlier on the first day in order to discuss this possibility further  But it seemed   to me that the topic was big enough that we might have questions and want the staff to go back and   look at various issues  So I thought it made sense to meet in advance of the regular meeting, which   would give the staff and the Committee time to consider whatever comes out of this discussion    Depending on how things go today, I’m prepared to schedule additional time in November as well,   but I’d like to see what kind of progress we can make today  Again, our focus today is our   monetary policy framework and the associated communication issues  The staff has also done some   work on tools, which is a somewhat separable issue, though not entirely   As Debbie’s memo indicated, my hope is that we can leave discussions of the current   economic outlook and policy situation to the regular meeting in November and focus as much as   possible today on the framework issues  I’m sure people won’t be shy about talking about these   October 15, 2010 3 of 62             issues, but I want to reassure you that anything you say does not commit you to any particular   policy position in November   I’d like to structure the meeting as follows  In a moment, we’ll start with a presentation by   Board staff, followed by Q&A  Then we’ll have a go-round of participants to get your feedback on   those presentations as well as on the material you received that was prepared both by the Board and   by a few Reserve Banks  I don’t anticipate having any votes or final decisions today—this meeting   is really just for information-gathering and getting initial impressions  That being said, as Debbie   properly indicated, this is a meeting, not a briefing, in that we would expect you to make comments   relevant to policy  I’m not going to ask for presentations from the authors of the two Reserve Bank   memos, but, certainly, if you have questions for them, or if you would like to refer to their work in   your own discussion, that’s obviously appropriate   Before we get into the main content of our meeting, I did want to ask your assent to add   another item to the agenda of the November 2 and 3 meeting on the subject of external   communications by both participants and staff of the FOMC  Just to give you a bit of advance   notice, let me tell you a couple of things I’m concerned about and would like to talk about at more   length  First, I was very disappointed, as I know many of you were, to see a few months ago some   stories in the press that showed access to considerable inside information, including quotes of what   people said at FOMC meetings, staff materials, and the like  I did circulate a memo on this   problem, but we never discussed it as a group  I think it might be worthwhile to have some   discussion of those kinds of issues collectively  Second, I think many of you also saw a Reuters   article that suggested—and I don’t know if this is true or not—that there may be leaks to non-media   outsiders, including market participants, former officials, consultants, and others, some of whom   stand to make money by their inside access either to participants or to staff  If this is in fact true, it’s   October 15, 2010 4 of 62             obviously a serious problem and one that could even have legal consequences  So I think we need   to discuss that issue as well at the November 2 meeting   A third and final issue that I’d like to include in that item on the agenda for November is not   really a security issue, but it does concern me, in any case  I perceive an increasing tendency of   FOMC participants to stake out strong policy positions in advance of our meetings  Now, it’s   perfectly fine for people to give their own views, and that has been a long-standing tradition; but I   think that it has also been our tradition that when participants express their individual views, they do   so in a way that emphasizes the collegiality of our process, the consensus nature of our process, and   the fact that our decisions are made collectively in the FOMC  If everybody has already made up   their mind before the meeting, why don’t we just phone in the votes and save ourselves the travel?    This idea of trying to maintain at least some plausible deniability and some reference to the   Committee’s prerogative to make decisions is in the memorandum that Michelle put together and   that all participants receive when they join  You can review that for your reference, if you’d like    Now, we may decide that this implicit contract, if there is one, has become outdated  In any event,   it does strike me that, although it’s good for people to know what our views are and for us to air   differences and so on, the public may perceive the Committee to be more fractured than it, in fact,   is, and that clarity and communication may suffer as a result   This issue is really a subjective one, and it may or may not warrant any further action  The   other two issues, though, obviously raise security issues, and we need to make sure we’re   comfortable with how things are going  I will want to raise with you on November 2 the possibility   that we might, for example, appoint a small subcommittee to look into strengthening our rules or   strengthening our procedures to make sure that we have adequate confidentiality  I don’t want to   discuss these issues now, but I wanted to get your assent to put this on the agenda for, say,   October 15, 2010 5 of 62             45 minutes—not too much time, I hope—at the beginning of our next meeting  Will that be   acceptable to the Committee?  I’m seeing nods  Okay, we will begin our discussion next time with   some of these communication issues  Thank you for that   I will now turn back to the main subject of our meeting, which is the policy framework,   communication, and tools  To repeat, you received two memos from the Board, one on the   framework, one on policy tools  Let me turn first to Michael Kiley, who will give a short   presentation  Mike Leahy will then present material on tools, and then we’ll have Q&A from the   Committee  Michael    Thank you very much for those summaries  Are there any   questions for presenters?  [No response]  Everybody has fully assimilated the material?  [No   response]  All right, seeing no questions, we can turn to a go-round  Again, you were given some   suggested questions to address, but, of course, you are free to talk about whatever you’d like  One   point I would like to make is that the decisions we make at the coming meeting or subsequently   about our framework will probably be with us for a while, so we need to think about how they will   work not only immediately but also at other stages of our policy cycle  Let me begin with President   Rosengren    Go ahead, Eric, sorry    Yes, we can hear you now    Thank you  Charlie, if that feedback happens again, you   might have to go off  Okay  It’s quiet, anyway  President Bullard   October 15, 2010 12 of 62              Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you very much  President Evans    Thank you very much, and my apologies to you and Eric for   taking you away from the conference in Boston  President Lacker    “Rates up”—under 140 characters  [Laughter]  President   Pianalto    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you, President Lockhart  First Vice President Moore   from San Francisco    Thank you very much, and very good temporary work there    [Laughter]  President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen   October 15, 2010 45 of 62              Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you, Governor Duke  I was a little confused about   your view on the explicit numerical inflation target  You said first that you liked it, but then you   went on to—    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    October 15, 2010 55 of 62              Thank you  Governor Raskin    Okay  Thank you very much  I’m not going to attempt a   summary  I do thank everyone quite sincerely for taking this very seriously  The comments were   extremely helpful  There are obviously a lot of differences among the participants on the   Committee, and one thing I can predict with 100 percent certainty is that whatever we end up doing   will not satisfy everybody—I think that’s a fair guess  Nevertheless, there were a number of themes   throughout the discussion, and it was very, very helpful  We’ll try to go back to the drawing board   and see how we can modify what has been done to try to find as much of a center of gravity as   possible  I think that’s the best I can offer—a center of gravity  I don’t think I can offer something   that everybody will find 100 percent acceptable   October 15, 2010 59 of 62             We’ve had a number of these broad metaphysical discussions since I became Chairman  I   think that is one of the taxes that I impose on participants, and I appreciate your patience and   willingness to participate in such an active and thoughtful way  We will take all of this into   account—I’ve got pages of notes here—and try to figure out a way forward  Unless someone else   would like to make a comment or raise a question, I will adjourn the meeting  Are there any   additional comments?  [No response]  Okay  Well, again, thanks very much  Enjoy your weekend    The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   October 15, 2010 60 of 62     "
9093,2010-11-02,BERNANKE,"  Good afternoon, everybody  Governor Raskin attended the   videoconference, but this is her first in-person, live, face-to-face FOMC meeting, so I’d like to   welcome her  Also, Janet has been to a few meetings [laughter] but not in her current capacity as   Vice Chair of the Board  Congratulations, Janet  And thanks, also, to First Vice President John   Moore, who will be representing San Francisco today   We have no new information on the nomination of Peter Diamond to be a member of the   Board of Governors  As you’ll recall, his qualifications to serve had been questioned  He has   since taken steps to remedy that  [Laughter]  It’s good work, but whether it will be sufficient I   don’t know  Still, we’re hopeful that he will be reviewed and confirmed  I have spoken to him,   and he remains as committed to joining the Board as he was prior to the announcement of his   Nobel Prize   The first item today is an unusual one  I hope to talk a bit about our external   communications, and I would like to limit this discussion to 45 minutes or so  I mentioned at the   videoconference three issues that had been of concern, not just to me but also to a number of   people around the table who had spoken to me about it  The first was leaks to the press, and   particularly some leaks that involved characterizations of other people’s views at the meeting,   confidential materials, and the like  We circulated the Program for Security of FOMC   Information to remind folks about the rules  The second issue, which arose a bit later, was   prompted by a wire story that raised concerns about inappropriate access to information by   outsiders other than the media, including consultants, market people, and so on  We obviously   have important reasons to talk to people like that, and, certainly, there’s some basis for   November 2–3, 2010 3 of 238             exchanging ideas  But, clearly, there’s also the possibility that some of these folks could profit   from information gained in talking to Federal Reserve principals or staff, and I think there’s   considerable risk to us if it turns out that someone improperly used that information  I think we   would all agree that it’s important to manage these two matters appropriately, and I’d like to   propose that we create a small subcommittee, consisting of Presidents and Governors, to look at   these issues, to talk to people, and to try to come up with some guidelines to help us address   them  Janet Yellen has agreed to chair the subcommittee   The third issue I mentioned at the videoconference is a little more squishy—it may be   more a matter of preference and operating procedure than security per se  It’s the tendency for   people to take very strong, very inflexible positions on policy matters prior to the meetings at   which those decisions will be made  It’s a longstanding tradition at the FOMC to try to maintain   at least some plausible deniability in order to have a reason for a meeting—otherwise, we could   just do notation votes and save all the travel expenses  Now, this may or may not be a fixable   issue  It may be a function of the difficult circumstances that we are currently involved in  But I   wanted to put that on the table as well  We circulated Michelle’s memo describing the protocol   for public statements, which is given to all new members of the FOMC  I’d be interested in your   views on the substance as well as on whether it would make sense to have Janet’s subcommittee   look at this issue as well, perhaps as a project that’s separate from the first two  Again, it’s   possible that nothing much can be done about it, but maybe we could come together and find   some basis for a more cooperative solution than what we currently have   As I said, I don’t want to spend too much of the Committee’s time on these issues—no   more than 45 minutes or so—and I don’t want to do a full go-round, as there’s no need for that    But I certainly would be happy to have some comments on the issues, on the subcommittee, on   November 2–3, 2010 4 of 238             the charge of the subcommittee, or anything else people would like to talk about  Janet, did you   want to introduce that?    President Fisher    Thank you  President Hoenig    Anybody else?   November 2–3, 2010 9 of 238              Vice Chairman    Yes, it runs till Friday of the same week    Anyone else?  President Kocherlakota, I saw you first    I think we all agree that diversity of opinion is very   important and that the public needs to know what arguments are being made  I think the issue   really is a question of style and tone and those sorts of things  Governor Duke    Thanks  Anyone else?  President Evans    It’s Governor Yellen    “Your Highness” will be fine  [Laughter]    Thanks  What I’d like to propose, Janet, is that you choose   some people for your subcommittee—and those who are interested in serving should let Janet   November 2–3, 2010 12 of 238             know  Then I’d like to propose that your subcommittee look at the first two items for sure and   think about what additional steps or guidelines we might want so that we make sure that we are   not inappropriately releasing information to anybody who is not entitled to it   On the third matter, I’ll be happy to listen if anyone has further thoughts  Janet, perhaps   you and the subcommittee could have some conversations with people around the table on the   general issue of our collective communication—whether there should be guidelines of some sort,   for example  Again, I want to be very careful to say that this is not about content—this is about   timing and style and those sorts of things  If there seems to be some kind of consensus, then   maybe we can formalize that into a memo  If there clearly is not, then perhaps you could just   report that, and we will just leave it at that  Thank you   On the matter of communication, let me just say a word about the issue that Governor   Yellen raised about my communication  At the videoconference, some interest was expressed in   my giving more on-the-record interviews, press conferences, and so on, and I have been   interested in doing that for some time  I think I mentioned to a few of you that we entertained   very seriously the possibility of doing a briefing for attribution tomorrow afternoon after the   meeting  We’ve had some qualms about that  Michelle Smith has been advising me on this    We’re a bit concerned that what will amount to an unannounced press conference on a day that is   already somewhat fraught would contribute to market volatility  At worst, I could end up   unintentionally distorting the message of the Committee, which, of course, is summarized by the   statement  So, if I may, for tomorrow I’m going to stay in the mode of staying off the record  I   do have tentative plans to put out an op-ed in a day or two that will describe in very general   terms what we are doing and what our strategy is, and I’ll be attending President Lockhart’s   meeting at Jekyll Island this weekend, which will be also an opportunity to comment   November 2–3, 2010 13 of 238             But more substantively, I do think that I need to give press conferences that are on the   record, on camera, periodically, and I propose to start doing that with the release of the   projections from this meeting, which will be in three weeks  Many other central banks do   something similar  It would provide an opportunity to describe a piece of news—the outlook of   the Committee—and relate that to our policy actions and other issues   So that’s our current thinking  If everyone’s okay with that strategy, there’s one other   matter that relates to it  We already have to release the minutes a day early because of the   Thanksgiving holiday, and I think I would like to do this press conference before the minutes   come out so that I wouldn’t have to be interpreting the minutes  That means that the Survey of   Economic Projections would have to be released two days before the normal time  I don’t know   if this would require any formalities, but what I’d like to do is break up those two components   and approve them separately, so that the SEP can go out, say, on Monday, and then the minutes   can go out as planned on Tuesday, and on Monday or on Tuesday morning I could have this   press conference  That would be my proposal  I see people nodding  Is there any concern?    SEP on the 22nd, press conference with its release    With the release of the SEP, and then minutes the next day    Okay?    So the only thing that requires from the Committee is that   we approve the SEP a day earlier, but the schedule for the minutes would be the same as usual   November 2–3, 2010 14 of 238              No, at the moment I think we’re committing only to twice a   year  In other words, it’s only twice a year that the projections come out and I don’t have a   Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  So then, maybe based on what happens in three weeks, we   might want to have a further discussion around the table about whether additional press   conferences would be appropriate    Well, maybe only twice a year on those times when I don’t   have congressional testimony associated with it    One thing I will not do without further consultation with the   Committee is hold a press conference right after an FOMC meeting  I think that will require   some discussion, because we would have to figure out how comfortable we are and how we   would structure it and so on    Michelle, would you like to say something?    That’s all we have planned so far, but I think the first time   will be a big step, and we’ll see where it goes from there  Thank you very much for this   conversation  I’m glad we can have a frank discussion of what are somewhat delicate matters   Let’s now turn to the business of the meeting and go to the briefing on financial   developments, and I’ll call on Brian Sack    Thank you, Brian  Are there questions for Brian?    Governor Warsh    President Lockhart    Other questions?  President Kocherlakota   November 2–3, 2010 22 of 238              Other questions for Brian?  President Plosser    Other questions?  President Bullard   November 2–3, 2010 24 of 238              Other questions?  [No response]  If not, I need a motion to   ratify domestic open market operations    Thank you  They are ratified without objection   Let me just note again that you received memoranda on financial stability  We’re   continuing to ramp up our activities in keeping the FOMC well apprised of developments in   financial stability  In particular, an important step is that the Board has now set up its new Office   of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which will help to coordinate financial stability   research and monitoring around the System  I’ve spoken to President Rosengren and others   about coordination among Reserve Banks and the Board in developing our monitoring capacity    I think we all agree that this is very important and that we want to have a very broad-based   ability to see what’s going on in the financial sector, not only in those areas where we have direct   responsibility, but even beyond that  I’d also like to note that Nellie Liang has agreed to be the   November 2–3, 2010 26 of 238             first Director of this office  I’m sure she’ll do a great job, and we have a great deal of confidence   in her in that position   Let me turn next to the economic situation and call on David Wilcox    Thank you very much  The floor is open for questions    President Fisher   November 2–3, 2010 34 of 238              President Evans    President Lacker    Okay  President Bullard    President Fisher    Any other questions?  President Lacker    Okay  President Kocherlakota    It’s difficult because the disinflation effects are the   strongest in deep recessions, which, of course, are the situations when you have the most   long-term unemployed, so there are a lot of corollary things going on—discouraged workers,   part-time employment, and so on    Any other questions?  Governor Yellen    That’s true    Any other questions?    All right, I think we are hitting diminishing marginal   returns  [Laughter]  Are we ready for the economic go-round?  Seeing no objection, let’s start   with President Hoenig    Thank you  President Rosengren   November 2–3, 2010 44 of 238              Thank you  President Lockhart   November 2–3, 2010 46 of 238              Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto   November 2–3, 2010 52 of 238              Yes    President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Fisher    I notice you’re discussing golf and not baseball  [Laughter]    President Bullard    Thank you  It is 330  Coffee’s ready  Debbie, is that   right?    Let’s take 20 minutes for a break   [Coffee break]    I guess we’ll get going  President Evans    Thank you  First Vice President Moore    President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you, and thank you all, as always, for interesting   comments  Let me try to summarize very briefly, with the caveat that views seem somewhat   more dispersed this time, and, therefore, I may not be able to capture everybody’s nuances   Generally speaking, the contours of the outlook look pretty similar to what people were   seeing in September, although obviously the views represent a downgrade from the June   projections  The recovery is continuing, but it was characterized by a variety of unappetizing   November 2–3, 2010 92 of 238             adjectives, including “lackluster,” “disappointing,” “slow,” and “moderate”  An increased rate   of economic growth in 2011 is generally expected, but there are significant headwinds, including   credit restrictions, especially to SMEs; the need for deleveraging by households; continued   severe weakness in housing and commercial real estate; the end of the inventory cycle; fiscal   drag; and the drain of some demand growth overseas, among others  There were hints of   optimism, but some also cited downside risk with respect to the economic growth outlook    Uncertainty is high, and it seems to be a pervasive issue for both the economy and for the   Committee   An important consequence of slow economic growth is that unemployment is likely to   decline, at best, very slowly—it may even increase in the near term  There may have been a   structural break in terms of the pace of the recovery of employment following recessions, and   there is disagreement about the extent to which unemployment is amenable to countercyclical   policies—some thought not very amenable, but others cited the lack of aggregate demand as a   key source of slow employment gains and worried about hysteresis  Ongoing declines in house   prices, tight credit, the need for deleveraging, and weakness in the labor market have contributed   to the weak tone of consumer confidence and spending   Financial conditions have improved somewhat in the past few months in anticipation of   further easing of monetary policy  Stock prices are up  Credit spreads have tightened, and the   dollar is down  Banks see better credit quality but are being hampered by new concerns about   foreclosure documentation and possible put-backs of defective mortgages, as well as by new   financial regulations  Small banks also cite the regulatory burden  The problems with   foreclosure documentation could, in turn, delay foreclosures and necessary adjustments in the   housing and mortgage markets  Large firms continue to be liquid, with good access to credit—  November 2–3, 2010 93 of 238             banks are actively seeking their business—but they are disinclined to hire US workers  Many   small and medium-sized enterprises still see credit as a problem, if not the principal one  Some   capital investment is taking place to improve productivity or increase market share, but top-line   demand is not growing much  Some industries are doing relatively well, including energy,   agriculture, IT, and some parts of manufacturing   Internationally, Asia is growing quickly and is an attractive place for investment    Conditions in Japan and Europe are more mixed, and sovereign debt risks remain an issue in   Europe   Inflation has drifted down some this year, especially as reflected in core measures  Wage   growth has also fallen, perhaps reflecting the extent of resource slack  Near-term headline   inflation may be lifted by energy and import prices  Inflation breakevens are up but are within   recent ranges  Private-sector forecasts and surveys suggest reasonable underlying stability in   inflation expectations  Inflation forecasts around the table are diverse, with some seeing further   disinflation arising from resource slack, and others seeing the rate of price increases picking up   over the next few years  Pricing power still seems very limited, but some firms expect to   increase prices somewhat in the future  Some nominal variables like M2 and nominal GDP are   growing more quickly   Participants see both upside and downside risks to inflation in the medium term    Disinflation raises real interest rates and thus serves to tighten monetary policy implicitly, a   particular problem in a liquidity trap  However, real yields are very low on an absolute basis and   may be indicative of risk aversion   It’s a bit of a potted summary  Are there any comments?  Anything important?  [No   response]   November 2–3, 2010 94 of 238             I won’t give a close reading of the economy, because that’s already been done  Rather,   because I know everyone is going to want to be talking about LSAPs and the policy options in   the next go-round, which we’ll leave until tomorrow, I think the most useful thing for me to do is   to try to lay out the issues and the concerns, and I hope that will focus tomorrow’s discussion   somewhat   My very first important comment is that you should use the term LSAP and not QE    [Laughter]  This is not quantitative easing—this is not about the monetary base  That’s the most   important thing I’m going to say   Let’s look at the issues  The first question I want to address is whether there is a need   now for additional monetary stimulus  I think there is  There has been considerable markdown   in the outlook  I’ve looked at this for the last few meetings, and I’ve cited the numbers, but I’ll   look at them one more time  In April, the staff was predicting real GDP growth of about   36 percent in 2010 and 44 percent in 2011  Now that’s down to something closer to a little over   2 percent in 2010 and 33 percent in 2011, excluding the financial market effects  Meanwhile,   unemployment is now projected next year to be about a percentage point higher than it was in   April  Roughly speaking, since April the predicted level of GDP at the end of 2011 has been   marked down by about 2½ percentage points  So, roughly speaking again, we’ve lost a year of   economic growth just in the markdown since April, and, by Okun’s law, that’s about a   percentage point in unemployment  Thus, the recovery has been pushed out about a year, and   the outlook, therefore, as many people have noted, remains fairly drab   Now, in April and May, we were initially thinking that this was potentially a soft patch   associated with the European sovereign debt crisis, and it may be that the debt crisis created   some additional risk aversion in financial markets  But I think at this point we would agree that   November 2–3, 2010 95 of 238             those factors are behind us and that we’re now facing a recovery that has slowed and does not   seem to have the momentum that we were hoping for earlier in the year   Given this very slow growth outlook, I think there are several grounds on which we   might consider additional stimulus at this juncture  I would call the first argument the “optimal   policy” argument  We are at the zero lower bound, we are in a liquidity trap, and, therefore,   analyzing policy is more difficult than usual  However, with the staff’s help, we have got some   useful linkages between the conventional interest rate policies we’re used to and the   nonconventional LSAPs that we are currently contemplating  In particular, Michael Kiley and   some of his colleagues have done calculations showing the correspondences between cuts in the   federal funds rate and changes in the amount of assets that we hold   One way to think about our policy options, then, is to begin with thinking about what we   would be doing with the federal funds rate if we weren’t at the zero bound  I must say, right up   front, the answer differs considerably according to the rule or model that you’re using  For   example, the Taylor 1993 rule suggests that we should be at about minus 75 basis points, and,   translating LSAPs into funds rate cuts, we’re already there, so the Taylor 1993 rule would not   suggest we do much more  The Taylor 1999 rule, by contrast would have us at minus 400 basis   points at this point in order to be at the appropriate spot   One useful intermediate case is the optimal control analysis, which is done in the   Tealbook, Book B  It starts from the current level and requires rates to adjust only gradually  It   implies that, taking into account all of the factors that the staff considers for the forecast, we   should be somewhere around minus 360 basis points by the middle of 2011  If you assume a   correspondence between LSAPs and the federal funds rate, as given by the staff’s analysis,   where $150 to $200 billion of LSAPs equals a 25 basis point move in the funds rate, the optimal   November 2–3, 2010 96 of 238             control analysis suggests we need about $15 trillion more of securities purchases to meet the   requirements of the rule  Of course, that would not restore the economy in any short period of   time, but it would put us on the right path  This is, admittedly, a difficult and rough calculation,   but clearly we have to think beyond the fact that we’re at the zero lower bound and consider   what kind of metrics we can use to think about additional policy action  So, one baseline   consideration, the optimal control analysis, would suggest that we need to do about $15 trillion   more   Having said that, one point that I’ve made consistently and that all of you have made is   that, in fact, we are not in a federal funds rate world—we’re using nonconventional instruments,   which are uncertain in their use and have potential side effects  Therefore, going back to the golf   analogy that President Fisher reminded me of, the usual principles would suggest that one would   be more conservative than otherwise  I’m obviously not going to be proposing $15 trillion   either now or necessarily at any time in the future  So, argument number one is that we’re still   too tight, given some standard metrics    Yes    Right, the expected stock  I’m talking about the size of the   balance sheet that we would ultimately want to have, and that doesn’t preclude any kind of   adjustment process or whatever that might be   The second argument is also in some sense an implication of the zero lower bound, and it   is that we face asymmetric risks  I’ll cite two in particular that I think are important  The first   November 2–3, 2010 97 of 238             has to do with the behavior of unemployment and the possibility that the recovery will stall    We’re currently at a rate of economic growth of about 2 percent, which, as you know, would   actually result in unemployment tending to rise, according to Okun’s law  So we’re not   expecting any improvement in unemployment in the next quarter or two  In fact, I think there’s a   reasonable risk that we’ll see unemployment go up somewhat  And that raises the risk—which   could be somewhat greater than some might think—that the recovery could actually stall  There   is this concept of a two-state model of expansions and recessions  It has also been expressed   more informally in terms of escape velocity, and there’s something called the 03 percentage   point rule, which says that if the unemployment rate rises by 03, you’ll have a recession, which   always seems to work  The point here is only that, if the economy slows considerably more, the   possibility that we’ll get into a bad spiral of declining confidence, spending, and income is   something to be worried about; and, given the lack of tools that we do have, our ability to   address that situation would be limited  The second and related asymmetric downside risk is a   deflationary trap, which Presidents Bullard and Kocherlakota, for example, have talked about  In   a deflationary trap, you get a vicious circle of declining prices, higher real interest rates because   of the zero lower bound, and then a weaker economy  The point I want to make is that, although   I think actual deflation is not that likely, this adverse spiral can happen even if you have just   disinflation, because disinflation, of course, raises real interest rates  So, again, the risks are   somewhat asymmetric in that it’s difficult to address those downside risks, whereas the upside   risks of too rapid growth or too high inflation within limits can be addressed by raising interest   rates  That being said, I want to acknowledge and state very clearly that I think we ought to be   extremely sensitive to inflation expectations  It’s possible that they could move discontinuously,   and that would be a counterargument to this point of view   November 2–3, 2010 98 of 238             A third argument for additional support is what I would call the “long-run effects”   argument  There’s a classic paper by Lucas where he essentially argues that business cycles are   not all that important in the end, because they’re only temporary fluctuations in consumption and   income  Therefore, the case for addressing a business cycle more aggressively depends at least   in part on the extent to which the recession has permanent effects on the economy  Governor   Tarullo raised this point  One way that the current slow economic growth or a double-dip   recession could have permanent effects would be, of course, if it led to a permanently higher   NAIRU or created hysteresis in the labor market  That would transform what we hope is a   relatively short-term business cycle into a long-term loss of growth and employment  A   deflationary trap also could be very long-term, as Japan’s “lost decade” suggests   Summing up, there are a number of reasons to think that the economy is too weak and   needs additional help  I think the bottom line for me is something I’ve said at a number of   meetings before  It strikes me that it’s very hard to rationalize the fact that we are going to be   missing on both sides of our mandate in the same direction for the foreseeable future  Even if   you were satisfied with 1 percent or 1½ percent inflation, you might want to consider whether a   somewhat higher rate of inflation—still a reasonable one, say, 2 percent—might be the right   thing to do if it were possible to use that to improve economic growth and employment   That’s a very long disquisition on the question of whether we need to provide additional   help  I think we do, and I think we’re missing the mandate in the same direction on both sides,   and that’s really very hard to defend   Now, all of that is very interesting, but it doesn’t do much for us if we don’t have tools   that will work  If LSAPs are not going to affect the economy, then there’s not much benefit to   worrying about it  I think they will work, and let me talk about the two stages of the operation    November 2–3, 2010 99 of 238             The first stage has to do with easing financial conditions  And, again, this is part of my reaction   to the term QE—you hear people say sometimes, “Well, the economy is flooded with liquidity,   so putting in more liquidity is not going to help”  That’s not how this is supposed to work  The   way this is supposed to work is by affecting asset prices—changing relative rates of return—and   through the changes in asset prices affecting financial conditions and, therefore, affecting the   economy  While you could argue in theory about whether asset purchases are neutral or not, the   practical experience of the last month or two shows pretty definitively that our discussion of   potential asset purchases has, without the possibility of denial, I think, affected asset prices   relatively significantly  You also can question how much movement has occurred in response to   our discussions of potential asset purchases  The staff has actually been quite conservative in its   analysis of how much of the movement to attribute to that, and I’ll discuss that in more detail   shortly  In any case, in just the last couple of months, we’ve seen, for example, a 13 percent   increase in the S&P 500, we’ve seen real 10-year yields down 45 basis points, as President   Kocherlakota pointed out, we’ve seen spreads narrowing in credit markets, and we’ve even seen   declines in nominal Treasury yields  If all of these effects are coming from good news about the   economy, then the movements in the equity prices and the real interest rates seem somewhat   inconsistent with each other  As I said, the staff is fairly conservative in how much of this they   attribute to the potential policy action, but I think there’s pretty strong evidence that we are   affecting financial prices and financial conditions   But that’s not enough, and President Fisher and others have been eloquent in arguing that   we can change asset prices and we can provide liquidity, but, like the proverbial horse that we’ve   brought to water, we can’t “make the economy drink”  What about the transmission mechanism?    Is the transmission mechanism broken?   November 2–3, 2010 100 of 238             A very useful way to approach this might be to start with the staff analysis on page 4 of   the Tealbook, Book A, which is the box comparing the policies  In particular, it compares the   announcement of zero LSAPs with an announcement tomorrow of $600 billion, which was the   baseline, and no further purchases beyond that  I think it will be useful to discuss that   comparison as well as areas where we think the analysis is either too optimistic or insufficiently   optimistic   Again, the staff’s analysis of the effects of the changes in asset prices on the economy is   pretty careful and conservative  First, as I mentioned, they’ve been pretty careful not to over-  attribute the recent asset price movements to policy expectations; for example, they attribute only   about a 2½ percent decline in the dollar to these policy expectations, which seems like a fairly   modest effect  They’re also conservative in some other ways  For example, they’re very   careful—and I think this is admirable—to assume that the markets are anticipating $1 trillion, so   that, when we do only $600 billion, the disappointment will set in, and that will lead to less   stimulus than you might think based on recent asset price movements  They also are careful to   take into account terminal conditions; that is, they require that the purchases be reversed over a   time period similar to what we are currently planning, so the effects of the LSAPs are limited by   the fact that our holdings of them are time-limited   I would also argue that the staff analysis ignores some potential transmission   mechanisms  For example, it assumes that longer-term inflation expectations are simply given,   which, then, ignores changes in inflation expectations as a possible mechanism for this policy    Yet, as I mentioned, 10-year yields have fallen 45 basis points in real terms, and almost all of   that is the change in the break-even rate, not in the level of the nominal rate  I think it’s an open   question as to whether the real interest rate is better measured using the real rate in the TIPS   November 2–3, 2010 101 of 238             market or better measured using a constant inflation expectation  So, to the extent that there’s   any change in inflation expectations, the analysis in the Tealbook is understating the potential   effects  The Tealbook also ignores what I believe you would call balance sheet effects  Higher   collateral values, such as higher prices of commercial real estate and the like, can reduce   borrowing constraints and can reduce financial stress  It’s not clear how big an effect that is, but   it is certainly one effect that could occur because of lower interest rates and, perhaps, slightly   higher inflation expectations  A third factor that the analysis ignores is any nonlinearities or any   tipping point phenomena  Everything in the analysis is linear—you can figure out the effects of   a $1trillion purchase just by extrapolating from $600 billion  But if you have tail risks, like   deflation risks or a double-dip recession risk, then the potential benefits of avoiding a tipping   point are understated by this kind of analysis   Now, it’s certainly possible that there are ways in which the staff analysis is overstating   the effects  For example, it has been argued that firms have so much cash that they’re essentially   going to be indifferent to changes in interest rates  I’m not so sure about that  Remember that   the opportunity cost of cash does not depend on whether you’re holding cash or not  If interest   rates go down and you have a lot of cash, another way of thinking about it is that you need to   find some way to invest it, some way to use it  Lower rates ought to have some effect on   spending decisions, and, indeed, around the table we heard discussion about how firms are using   investment to increase productivity and increase share, even if they’re not seeing much aggregate   demand  Of course, this would increase aggregate demand through, for example, consumption,   wealth effects, and the dollar  So the combination of a lower cost of funding and more final   demand, I think, would have some effect on investment  That being said, as was pointed out in   November 2–3, 2010 102 of 238             the earlier discussion, the real interest rate effects are only about 15 or 20 percent of the total   effect that the staff is assuming in its transmission mechanism   There are also some other negatives to take into account  One that Governor Warsh   pointed out was higher commodity prices  It’s theoretically possible that commodity prices   could rise so much in response to a purchase program that the effects on disposable income   would negate the benefits of the program  Of course, the staff’s analysis takes into account the   implications of the dollar and lower interest rates on commodity prices  I’ve discussed this with   the staff, and, while I won’t go into detail, the bottom line is that you need to see an   extraordinary increase in commodity prices—I don’t mean $30 or $40 on a barrel of oil, I mean   much, much more than that—to offset the beneficial effects on real output of the weaker dollar   and the other changes in financial conditions   The last point I want to make is to turn to the question of whether this is worth the candle    President Lacker raised this issue of why bother if the effect is going to be so small  According   to the staff analysis, the $600 billion purchase with no follow-up leads to an increase of real GDP   at the end of 2012 of 07 percent, and $1 trillion would raise output by 11 percent  Is this   significant or not significant?  Well, another way to look at this is to consider that the   $600 billion program, according to the staff, would reduce the unemployment rate by   03 percentage point by the end of 2012  In addition, remember that Okun’s law means that there   are a lot of employment effects other than just the unemployment rate, so a 03 percentage point   improvement in the unemployment rate translates into a 07 percent gain in private hours, or   about 750,000 jobs  That’s the implication of the analysis, and of course, it would be more than   a million jobs if you did the bigger program  Meanwhile, the staff’s estimates of the effects on   November 2–3, 2010 103 of 238             inflation are very small, and, starting from where we are today, that’s actually a benefit, not a   cost   To summarize, we’re missing both parts of the mandate on the same side  The asset   purchases appear to be stimulative, and, therefore, they move us in the appropriate direction   Relative to standard policy, though, there are a number of risks and costs, and, at the risk   of testing your patience, let me just discuss a few of those, and then I’ll bring this to a close    What are the risks that we might face if we undertake this program?  I’m going to focus on the   dollar, but I’ll mention a few of the others as I go along  The decline in the dollar is part of the   LSAP transmission mechanism, and, certainly, it would be a very serious concern if we thought   that this was going to create a disorderly or an excessive decline in the dollar  Nobody knows   exactly how this will work, of course, but based on what we’ve already seen, I think the odds of   anything extraordinary happening are pretty low   First of all, the absolute effects don’t seem to be that large—the staff estimates the effect   of even $1 trillion of purchases on the dollar to be about 2½ percent, which is much smaller than   the movement in the dollar over the summer, when we saw the reversal of the safe-haven flows   associated with the European debt crisis  The dollar is not particularly weak—it is about where   it was in the mid-1990s in real terms  Indeed, arguably, a depreciation would be stabilizing in   terms of our trade balance  According to the IMF, the dollar is now overvalued from between   zero to 15 percent  So the dollar is not excessively weak, and it doesn’t seem likely that it would   be driven down very much by LSAPs   In addition, as Brian pointed out, even though markets are fully aware of these possible   actions, there are absolutely no indications in markets that there is stress in terms of the dollar    Implied volatility on the dollar is way off earlier peaks and is comparable to the decade before   November 2–3, 2010 104 of 238             the crisis  Risk reversals show that markets anticipate dollar appreciation, not dollar   depreciation  Market functioning is normal  Bid-asked spreads are very low  So there just   really isn’t much evidence at this point that the dollar is under any particular stress, even though   markets anticipate this action   A related point, which was part of the discussion that Nathan had earlier on, is the   potential for a so-called spillover effect of a weaker dollar on emerging markets  Of course, I   understand those issues, and I am sympathetic to them as well, but there are two responses to the   concern that LSAPs amount to an aggressive or adverse act with respect to emerging markets    The first is that, of course, emerging markets need a strong US economy  I had substantial   discussions about this with a number of my counterparts at the G-20 in Korea, as well as in the   open meeting, and certainly everyone agrees that a strong and recovering US economy is very   important to all of these countries and to the global economy  The second is that these so-called   spillover effects are more a function of deficiencies in the international monetary system than   they are a function of US policy  In particular, there is a group of emerging market economies   that are trying to play by the rules, trying to let their currencies appreciate appropriately, and they   are caught between easy policies in the advanced economies and the propensity of some other   emerging market economies to undervalue their currencies or to peg their currencies  That puts   those countries in a terrible bind—on the one hand, they have to deal with the capital inflows,   but, on the other hand, if they let their currencies appreciate, then they’re not competitive with   the countries that are undervaluing their currencies  The answer there, really, is that we need to   continue to work with China and with other emerging market economies to get a better system   and, in particular, to allow more flexibility in the renminbi  The question then arises whether we   should allow these deficiencies in the international monetary system to prevent us from doing   November 2–3, 2010 105 of 238             what we need to do for the US economy, and I would argue that the answer is “no,” and that,   indeed, putting some pressure on the system might actually be useful in getting better solutions   in the international monetary system   There are a number of other risks with which you’re all familiar—inflation expectations,   financial instability, and the like  I won’t go into them in any detail at all, but I would point out   that, in terms of effects on inflation expectations, for example, policy using LSAPs is not   discontinuously different from policies using short-term interest rates  What we’re trying to do   is to make financial conditions more accommodative, and that essentially means lowering   interest rates in the economy  We’re using a different tool, but it’s a continuous process from   ease via the standard method to ease through the use of LSAPs  In other words, there’s nothing   discontinuous happening when we switch from one policy to another in terms of the effects, for   example, on financial instability  And let me just repeat now what I’ve said many times before,   namely, that I think we have to be very aggressive in monitoring financial stability and inflation   expectations  I don’t anticipate problems, but those issues are relevant to our policy of a low fed   funds rate as well, so, as I say, we need to monitor them carefully   Another issue is risks of capital losses and gains in our portfolio, and I’ll just say a few   words on that  The staff has analyzed this alternative relative to our status quo, and, essentially,   the capital loss risks are not much different  One reason for that is the analysis assumes that we   will sell the MBS first  So, if we buy additional Treasuries, we’ll be holding them for a   substantial period and, therefore, the income is essentially predictable, and we will very likely   not be subject to significant capital losses  On that topic, we already have quite a cushion, of   course, in terms of the unrealized gains on our balance sheet and the income that we’ve already   remitted to the Treasury  So I think that we’re fairly well hedged against that risk  My final   November 2–3, 2010 106 of 238             point, and it’s one that the Vice Chairman has made, is that the one scenario in which we might   have some capital losses would be one in which the economy does very well and rates rise; in   that case, I think that from a political perspective our position will be pretty good   As I said, I’ve taken a lot of your time—there are a lot of issues here  Let me end by   trying to reassure those who are nervous about this, and I think we’re all nervous about it to   some extent  I agree with President Bullard that we need to be very careful  I think there are   theoretical advantages to “shock and awe,” such as regime change and that kind of thing, but, for   the purposes of trying to regularize policy and trying to improve understanding of what we’re   doing and trying to make sure that we take appropriate safeguards, I believe we ought to   undertake this in a very careful way  We need to have regular reviews—that means we need a   discussion at every meeting on what our program is and what the implications are for the   outlook  We need to have ongoing discussions regarding any developing costs or risks that we   see arising, as well as any potential benefits, including assessments of those costs and benefits  I   think that we ought to be very modest in our claims  Clearly, this is not going to solve the   problem—at best, it’s going to be supportive  However, by under-promising and over-  delivering, I hope we would be better off than otherwise  I would note that the proposed   program has an eight-month horizon, which gives us quite a bit of time to learn more about   what’s happening and what’s going on in the economy, and to make adjustments, if necessary   The last point I would make refers to some theoretical arguments you’re all familiar with,   namely, that, in order to beat a liquidity trap, you have to raise inflation expectations above your   normal level  In Jackson Hole, I explicitly rejected any steps of that sort, at least for the   foreseeable future  I am very committed to not raising inflation above the level that we all   consider consistent with price stability, and if we begin to see that happening, I would be entirely   November 2–3, 2010 107 of 238             open to reining the program in  I do make that assurance that this is not about driving inflation   high  This is about driving inflation up to where it’s consistent with price stability and consistent   with economic growth     Again, I apologize for the length of this  I’m sure we’ll have a lot more discussion   tomorrow  So let’s just bring today’s session to an end at this point  At 530, there’s a reception   upstairs  We’ll begin tomorrow morning at 900 with a presentation from Bill on the policy   options, and then we’ll have a much more in-depth discussion of these issues  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]   November 2–3, 2010 108 of 238             November 3—Morning Session    Good morning, everybody  We made an awful lot of   progress yesterday—FOMC productivity is up  [Laughter]  We’re ready to begin the policy   round  Bill English will lead it off    Thank you  Any questions for either Bill or Brian?    Governor Warsh    The first paragraph says $600 billion    They’re taken together, the two parts    Okay  President Fisher    Not anymore  [Laughter]    President Lacker    President Evans    Go ahead    I think the general theory of the liquidity trap is that, once   you get to a certain point, essentially the demand is interest-inelastic, and there’s no further   effect on short-term rates by increasing the supply of money  That’s what liquidity traps are   about, that’s what the zero lower bound is about    Let me go on to President Evans    The word “levels” actually creates some ambiguity    Governor Duke    President Lockhart    President Rosengren   November 2–3, 2010 134 of 238              President Kocherlakota    Did you have another question?    Okay  This is a livelier Q&A than usual in this round    We’re about ready for the policy round  Before we start, let me make one observation  As   President Lacker mentioned, yesterday I spoke quite a bit about the asset purchases, and this,   obviously, is an issue that most people are focused on  There is an alternative or complementary   measure on the table, which is the language in alternative A, paragraph 4, giving additional   commitments about our policy rate  Personally, I am open-minded about that and about whether   November 2–3, 2010 135 of 238             to do something soon or in the future  I just wanted to say that, if anyone wants to add comments   on that issue or that approach as an alternative or a complement to other approaches, that is, of   course, welcome in this round  Let me start with President Rosengren    President Lacker    I have a comment and a question  Obviously, we’re not   saying that, if at any point in time, we’re not at the mandate, then the policy is wrong—clearly,   we don’t want to say that  The last sentence in the paragraph is intended to capture that point  It   says that we anticipate a gradual return to appropriate levels of unemployment and inflation, but   we judge that progress has been unacceptably slow    Right  That tries to capture the notion you have  Let me   raise another point, and maybe others would want to comment  One additional way also to   address your concern would be to revise the second sentence  In that sentence, we struck out the   phrase “over the longer run”  We could instead say, “The unemployment rate is elevated, and   measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low relative to levels that the Committee judges   November 2–3, 2010 140 of 238             to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate”  In other words, this is the long-run   target in some sense, but not the instantaneous  Does that help at all?    That’s why we struck all this language we had in the   videoconference, because we couldn’t come to agreement on how to characterize it    President Evans, did you have a question?    President Bullard   November 2–3, 2010 141 of 238              President Plosser    Yes, those are included    Yes, it does  The calculations that were done in that memo   already take into account the purchases we have made in making that assessment  In the Leahy   memo that was circulated at the videoconference    Sorry, the Kiley memo    Thank you, and I apologize for interrupting you  Next is   President Pianalto    Thank you  President Fisher    May I just make sure I understand your suggestion on   inflation?  You said “To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery while maintaining   inflation within levels consistent with its mandate”    Okay  President Hoenig    Thank you  It’s 1100  I understand that coffee is ready    Why don’t we take 20 minutes for refreshments?   [Coffee break]    Let’s recommence  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  First Vice President Moore    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Warsh   November 2–3, 2010 175 of 238              Thank you, and it is “regularly review” in the current   statement  Governor Duke   November 2–3, 2010 183 of 238              Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  I’d like to extend my sincere thanks to the   members of the Open Market Committee  Obviously, we don’t agree on all the aspects we’ve   been discussing—although I think that, to some extent, the disagreement is less fundamental and   more a sense of weights that are placed on different benefits and costs or risks  In any case, the   views expressed around the table are evidently very sincerely held, very well expressed, and very   useful  We began this meeting by talking about the benefits of collegial interaction, which, as I   said, are enormous  I also can say, quite frankly, that my own views have been influenced by the   very careful and thoughtful statements that we have heard yesterday and today  So I very much   appreciate your thoughtful contributions, and I hope everybody understands that I do find this   debate very constructive   Let me try to frame this at three different levels to help us think about the nature of the   action we’re taking  In some sense, the most basic level is the one I focused on yesterday, which   essentially takes off from the staff forecast and then tries to assess the quantitative impact of   these actions, which operate through various channels  I said that my guess would be that the   actions would be somewhat stronger than the staff predicted  Monetary policy can be   surprisingly powerful—I think there’s a tendency to underestimate that  In any case, at that level   November 2–3, 2010 196 of 238             the case seems pretty clear, because we are missing the two objectives under our mandate in the   same direction, and not just now but for what we expect is a long period of time  So, at that first   level, the analysis says that we should be doing what we can to move in the direction of our   mandate   A second level, maybe one step up, says basically, “Well, there are likely to be relatively   small benefits coming from these actions and a whole bunch of undefined risks”  A number of   people around the table took that approach, particularly those who are most concerned about it    That has clearly been the line that a lot of the external critics have taken  “The benefits are   small, and we don’t know what’s going to happen, and my personal view is that risk X is really   the most serious one”  I think it’s important that we look at those risks, as we have, including   discussing them at some length  Of course, that way of framing the problem makes it a much   more uncertain decision   I’d like to ask you to think about this at yet one higher level—and we all alluded to this—  which is that there’s an implication that taking no action is a relatively safe thing to do  There is   no safe thing to do—any action we take or don’t take is going to expose us to the judgment of   history if we make the wrong decision  In particular, taking no action has risks  It may be true   that deflation isn’t one of those risks, although that could happen down the road—currently, I   think, the odds of that are relatively small  But another risk with greater odds of materializing is   that the recovery could falter, and we could begin to see unemployment rising, and we could get   into a more serious downward spiral  Therefore, not taking action is a risky step, just as taking   action is a risky step  We’re caught between action and inaction—each has implications, and we   need to make an appropriate decision   November 2–3, 2010 197 of 238             I’d like to frame our decision today as a very conservative, middle-road approach,   namely, we recognize that doing nothing carries serious risks of further disinflation and of a   failure of the recovery to meet escape velocity, and, therefore, we’re going to take some actions   to try to move us closer to our mandate and to take out some insurance against those bad   downside risks  Furthermore, in doing so, we’re not going to do “shock and awe”—we’re not   going to do something extraordinarily large and dramatic  Instead, we’re going to undertake an   asset-purchase program that will play out over a period of eight months, with the purchases   equaling $75 billion a month  This is a substantial period of time—indeed, in some sense, the   program has already been in place for two months, since we’ve already seen a lot of the effect on   financial markets  Having such a substantial period of time means that we can be very vigilant   about monitoring whether the program is having the effects that we hope it will have and   whether other considerations are arising  I do appreciate Governor Warsh’s comments, and I   want to reassure him, and others, that I take very seriously the need to review regularly not only   the evolution of the economy, but also the emergence of risks  So, in undertaking this program,   we will review, we will be conditional, we will continue to monitor the risks that do exist  We   will do all of this over a substantial period of time, and, in particular, we will be very careful   about inflation  I want to reiterate that, again, there is no hidden agenda here to drive inflation to   a high level  That will be a very important consideration as we look forward   To summarize, I think that this is the right step  In the broad context, I think it is a   reasonably cautious step  It hedges us against risks in both directions, and it gives us a   substantial amount of time when we can be relatively more passive and observe developments    Although I don’t anticipate, for example, fine-tuning or small jiggering of the amounts from   meeting to meeting, I do think we should be prepared to make significant changes if either the   November 2–3, 2010 198 of 238             benefits or the costs prove different from what we anticipate  Again, recognizing all of the   concerns that people have, as well as the issues about impact and the like, I do think this is a   conservative action, which, perhaps, seems a bit ironic, given the conversation  It is one that   attempts to take an appropriate step in the right direction, but in a careful and measured way, and   it is one that will be reviewed as we go through the next eight months  My recommendation,   therefore, is to go ahead with this program   There were a lot of very good statement suggestions, and, although it always makes me   nervous to edit these things on the fly in the meeting, I will propose adopting some of them, and   I’d like to just go through and see how they work  The first thing I would suggest, and I will   check with all of you on each of these, is in paragraph 2  I don’t think this really brought   President Lacker along, but are you negative, President Lacker on “over the longer run?”  I   thought the benefit of adding “over the longer run,” consistent with what President Bullard said,   was that it emphasizes the fact that just because we are not at our targets today doesn’t mean that   we are not doing optimal policy    Well, we will be calculating that over time, but I think most   of us would put high odds that our longer-run natural rate of unemployment is below 96    The natural rate    96?    Okay  So this doesn’t help you at all  Does it help you,   President Bullard?    I’m proposing to reinstate the phrase “over the longer run”   in the fourth line of paragraph 2, in order to say that these two things are inconsistent over the   longer run with the dual mandate  Is that good?    Others?  Do others have comments?  [No response]  All   right, I see a few nods, and President Lacker’s objection is noted  So we’ll add “over the longer   run”   The second one that got some support was from President Kocherlakota and it referred to   the phrase “unacceptably slow”  I would propose getting rid of the phrase “it judges that,”   because we wouldn’t judge disappointment, so that the last phrase would be “progress towards   its objectives has been disappointingly slow”  All right?  [No response]  Okay   There are a couple of other suggestions  One was motivated by President Fisher’s   comment—I’m talking now about his comment about inflation and price stability  There’s a bit   of anxiety, I think, about phrases that involve intentional increases in inflation, admittedly  So   here’s a proposal  In the two places where we have the phrase “to return inflation, over time, to   levels consistent with its mandate,” how about changing it to “to help ensure that inflation, over   time, is at levels consistent with its mandate?”  The revision doesn’t have the sense of having to   push it up, and it also finesses the differences among us about what the inflation target is    All right  So that’s in two places  at the end of the first   sentence in paragraph 5 and in the middle of the first sentence in paragraph 3    Is that an improvement for you?  Okay  If I’m going too   fast, you let me know    Lunch has been ready for an hour, I would like to point out,   and we started at the second round today  There was also a small suggestion for the very last   sentence—again, from President Kocherlakota  In the clause that starts “in light of incoming   information,” we could insert, “concerning progress towards its objectives”  Is that what you   suggested?    Okay  How about “concerning the rate of progress   towards?”    Well, now it’s getting confusing     Yes  The Committee will review the pace of its purchases   and the overall size of its program “in light of incoming information concerning the rate of   progress towards its objectives”   November 2–3, 2010 201 of 238              Would you like to comment?    Well, we care about the level of risk    Okay  I’m now concerned that we’re leaving out an   important set of criteria, namely, emerging risks, side effects, and so on  So I guess I would   propose to leave it as it is, unless you have an alternative    “Including” what?   November 2–3, 2010 202 of 238              But we could care about things that don’t directly bear on   inflation and economic growth    I don’t know what to do    Yes    I take the general concern that, through various   communication media, we need to have better explanations of what our criteria are  President   Lacker    All right  I think we’re going to stick with the status quo, if   that’s okay   On the insertion of “up to,” I agree with the majority of people who spoke about it, in that   it seems inconsistent with the notion that we’re going to be reviewing this program—we could   conceivably increase it, and we could conceivably decrease it  So I don’t think that captures the   spirit of the program   Kevin, I’m hoping that you would be satisfied if we took the very last sentence, “The   Committee will regularly review,” and put it up to the end of paragraph 3—this is something that   President Bullard also suggested  Between that and the language about price stability, we have, I   think, qualified that and made it more conditional    The problem has to do with the fact that the flow rate is not   equivalent to the level of the funds rate  The way we connect these things is by thinking about   the total stock of holdings and what the relationship is to the level of the interest rate  I don’t   think, therefore, that an emphasis on the flow primarily—and I know President Bullard disagrees   with me—is enough information  There needs to be some kind of marker about what our   expectation is in terms of the total purchases  And I’d like to add that, just as it was easy to stop   the $300 billion Treasury program you mentioned because we had given a number, so it will be   easier to stop this if we have given a number  If we just have it open-ended, at every meeting it   will be harder and harder to make that decision    But that’s why I am suggesting putting this last sentence up   into paragraph 3, to make it directly follow    “The Committee will regularly review”—    Again, I propose to leave it  I think we need to have the   marker as the broad expectation, which is the equivalent of the policy move that we’re doing   today  I think that’s an important marker  I do think, though, that it would be useful—and I   hope it helps you some, at least—to put the last sentence up into paragraph 3    I think it conveys too little conviction  Although I think we   all agree we need to monitor the program, I don’t think there is a very strong bias, among those   who want to go ahead at least, that the expected amount is going to be significantly less  That’s   an expectation of where we are going to be    Well, if there’s no difference in meaning, then why the   concern?    President Lockhart   November 2–3, 2010 206 of 238              It’s a conceptual issue  The flow rate is not the choice   variable, it’s the expected amount that is, in some sense, the choice variable    I understand that, you know, multiplication is commutative   and everything  [Laughter]  I understand that    Yes “To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery,   and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the   Committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities  The Committee will maintain its   existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings”  The next sentence   is unchanged  Then, get rid of “in particular,” “The Committee will regularly review the pace of   its security purchases and the overall size”—and then that sentence goes on just as it is    I got rid of “in particular”  That’s my proposal  Are there   any further comments?  [No response]  Okay  Debbie?   November 2–3, 2010 207 of 238              And get rid of the “judges that”    And the last sentence has been moved up to paragraph 3    Thank you  As I discussed yesterday, I’m not going to do   any kind of attribution briefing or anything like that today  I am going to do a very generic   800-word op-ed tomorrow morning, which will basically say that the Fed thinks that progress is   too slow, and we’ve taken this action  I take the Committee’s discussion at the videoconference   November 2–3, 2010 208 of 238             as allowing me to break the blackout period in that way  I’ll also have opportunities on Jekyll   Island, if comments come up, and, of course, I know many of you have speeches, and so on,   coming up   We also agree tentatively—and I just want to make sure it’s okay—that we’re going to   vote on the minutes and the SEP separately, so that the projections can be released a day early   and I can give a press conference related to the projections  Any problem?  [No response]  And   the Desk is going to release its statement  Brian, do you have any comment on your statement—  are you still working on it?     Vice Chair    President Fisher    President Kocherlakota    Okay  You have the spirit of the comments    You have until 500 tomorrow, if you want to make any   changes in your forecast  There is lunch available—there’s no presentation  Our next meeting is   December 14  Thank you again for a very productive meeting    The Washington Post  The meeting is adjourned  Thank   you   END OF MEETING   November 2–3, 2010 210 of 238     "
9119,2010-12-14,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  We welcome back First Vice   President John Moore, who will again represent the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco    We’ll have a lunchtime briefing by Linda Robertson on legislative updates, and we’ll get more   information there about our Board nominations   Let’s turn to the first item, a briefing on financial developments and open market   operations  Mr Sack    Thank you Let me suggest that we divide the question   period into two parts  Let’s first take any questions on financial conditions, and then, if the   Committee is agreeable, we can vote on ratifying domestic open market operations; after that, we   can take any questions for either Brian or Nathan on the swap agreement proposal, and then take   a vote on that  Okay?  The floor is open for questions on financial conditions  President Fisher    President Lockhart    President Lacker    Okay  Other questions on the financial situation?    President Fisher    No, of course it’s not  Brian was just making a positive   statement about his analysis of why the rates changed  It could be a bad thing; it could be a good   thing    President Bullard    Other questions?  [No response]  Okay, may I have a   motion to ratify the domestic open market operations?    Okay  Without objection  Let’s turn now to the proposed   extension of the swap agreements  Just for your information, I have received calls directly from   the heads of several of the relevant central banks asking us to do this, so there is certainly interest   on the part of our counterparties  But let me open the floor for any questions either to Brian or to   Nathan Sheets on the proposal  Are there any questions?  President Rosengren    Governor Raskin   December 14, 2010 15 of 127              I have a two-hander from President Lockhart    I have no objection personally to making it nine months if   that’s the Committee’s preference  We can have a short discussion of that—I don’t want to take   too much time on this, but we could do that  President Bullard    A two-hander from the Vice Chairman    President Fisher    Do you see any problem with our counterparties if we do   nine months today?  Nathan    Is there any objection to a nine-month arrangement?    President Lacker    Are there others?    All right  Other comments?  [No response]  Okay  Well,   we could do parliamentary procedure here, but I think there is a sense, at least around the table,   that we are open to renewal if conditions continue to be stressed in European markets  Okay,   any further comments or questions?  [No response]  Perhaps we could have a vote  Can I have a   motion?    All in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Any objections?  [No   response]    Correct, the resolution that was in the memorandum    Would anyone like to hear it read?  [No response]   Okay, thank you  Let’s go on, then, to item 2, the economic situation  Dave    Thank you very much  Questions?  President Lockhart    President Rosengren    Any other questions?  [No response]  Okay  If not, we’re   ready for our go-round  And I have President Kocherlakota first    Thank you very much  President Plosser    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Rosengren   December 14, 2010 35 of 127              Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Evans    A total freeze on coal compensation  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  First Vice President Moore    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  I understand coffee is ready  Why don’t we   take 20 minutes?   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we reconvene?  I will turn to the Vice Chairman     Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much  And thanks, again, to everyone for   your thoughtful comments  Let me try to give, as I often do, a quick summary, and then I’ll add   just a few extra thoughts  Relative to November, the data suggest some improvement in the   near-term outlook  A moderate and apparently more sustainable recovery is continuing and may   accelerate in 2011 and 2012  Indicators of household spending and production have   strengthened  The tone of the labor market is somewhat better, notwithstanding the weak   employment report for November  However, the news on housing has been disappointing  The   fiscal compromise, if enacted, should add to policy stimulus in 2011   In the household sector, consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary   spending, have been stronger, and expectations for holiday sales are reasonably upbeat  A   disproportionate amount of the strength in spending may be occurring among high-end   households  Purchases of durable goods are up  The labor market is improving  Still, the pace   December 14, 2010 70 of 127             of hiring remains slow, and there is considerable reliance on part-time and temporary workers,   and quits remain low  Deleveraging in the household sector is continuing, but lower house   prices are reducing household wealth and could be a negative for spending as well as for bank   balance sheets and credit extension  Nearly 25 percent of households are underwater on their   mortgages, increasing the risk of defaults and foreclosures, and, consequently, further declines in   house prices   Employers are more optimistic about sales and growth but still remain, on the whole,   somewhat cautious about hiring and investment, although some around the table reported   improvements on that dimension as well  Uncertainty about the durability of the recovery and   about policy, including health care policy, remains an issue  Manufacturing output is expanding,   and exports are stronger  As usual, some industries are doing relatively well, including energy,   agriculture, and transportation excluding rail  Construction remains very weak, but high-tech is   showing signs of recovery   Financial conditions during the intermeeting period have been mixed and include some   simmering risks  Importantly, there has been a significant backup in longer-term rates arising   from a number of factors  However, this development is not inconsistent with our asset   purchases having been effective in the August–November period  European sovereign banking   problems have created significant uncertainties, and these problems could be transmitted to the   United States via money market funds, domestic banks, or changes in risk aversion  Burden-  sharing remains the persistent issue in Europe, which argues against early resolution of the issue    Bank lending and loan demand, especially by small businesses, generally remain weak, though   there are some exceptions, including nonrevolving consumer credit  Mortgage refinancing has   been limited by tight terms and conditions  Merger and acquisition activity is up, deposit growth   December 14, 2010 71 of 127             is strong, but many banks remain low-rated and face challenges in commercial real estate and   elsewhere  Rising agricultural land prices may indicate broader concerns about asset valuations    The fiscal situation, at the federal and the state and local levels, may ultimately pose significant   financial risks, including near-term issues with municipal bonds   Finally, core inflation measures continue to drift down with the slowdown in price   increases quite well spread across categories of goods and services and across different inflation   measures  Firms do not perceive much pricing power  Increased energy and commodity costs   are substantially offset by lower labor costs  Inflation breakeven rates have risen in recent   months, but private sector forecasts and surveys suggest reasonable underlying stability and   inflation expectations at levels close to the Committee’s objectives  Participants’ views on the   outlook for inflation and inflation risks for the medium term remain somewhat diverse  Some   expect inflation to pick up gradually as the economy strengthens, while others still see downside   risks  Difficulties in measuring slack and in beating the random walk forecast make inflation   predictions difficult  Overall, though, deflation risk seems to have receded somewhat since the   summer   Comments?  [No response]  Again, thank you for the very useful discussion, which I   think was very balanced and very appropriate  Let me add just a few thoughts  As the Vice   Chairman pointed out, on a headline basis we are a little further from our objectives, in the sense   that unemployment is higher and core inflation, at least, is lower  That being said, I agree with   the thrust of the comments around the table that the intermeeting data were moderately positive   for the near-term outlook  For example, in the labor market, even though we saw a weak job   growth number for November, we’ve also seen declines in UI claims, increases in vacancies and   hiring plans, reductions in layoffs and discharges, increased work weeks, some decline in long-  December 14, 2010 72 of 127             term unemployment, better surveys, and so on  So there are a number and range of indicators   suggesting a somewhat stronger and more upbeat situation in labor markets  In sum, then, we’ve   had some improvement in the near-term outlook   As we take comfort from that and feel more comfortable with our forecast, we should at   the same time keep in mind what a deep hole we’re in  The unemployment rate is, after all,   98 percent, which is 03 percentage point higher than it was in June 2009 when the recession   officially ended  A remarkable statistic, which I’ve mentioned in these meetings before, is the   magnitude of the decline in total hours worked, which is a measure that many business cycle   theorists rely on  From peak to trough, total hours worked in this recession dropped 73 percent,   which is about two and a half times the decline in the 1981–1982 recession  That number shows   that labor input contracted at more and more margins than in previous recessions  We have so   far recovered less than a quarter of that loss   Another indicator of the tremendous decline in labor input is the employment-to-  population ratio, which has fallen from 63 percent to 58 percent of the relevant population, about   a 7 percent decline—not percentage points but percent  And that low point was in October of   2010  We have not made any progress in that particular statistic  Participation rates, in   particular, and employment-to-population ratios are particularly discouraging among younger   and more disadvantaged groups  For example, young people between the ages of 16 and 24,   during the strong growth of the late 1990s, had about a 60 percent employment-to-population   ratio, and now it’s 45 percent; the employment-to-population ratio for teenagers is now   27 percent, a very significant decline from earlier numbers   So, there are encouraging signs for which we should be grateful  That gives me more   confidence that the recovery is proceeding, notwithstanding some of the downside risks,   December 14, 2010 73 of 127             particularly financial, that have been noted  But, again, we are starting from a very deep hole,   and no one around the table that I heard is suggesting that we’ll be seeing rapid declines in   unemployment  Rather, our hope is that economic growth will be sufficient to begin, at least, to   set unemployment in the right direction   All that being said, I think that we still have risks in both directions on the economic   growth front  I’m sure many of you around the table were here in the middle of 2003 when, after   nearly two years of almost no progress from the 2001 recession, practically out of the blue in the   third quarter of 2003 we had a 7 percent real growth rate followed by almost a 4 percent growth   rate in the fourth quarter  The factors leading up to that were increasing confidence, sustained   monetary policy support, and a sense among producers that they were running out of room to   increase productivity gains  Suddenly, that all came together, and we began to see some   significant progress, although hiring did lag economic growth by several quarters  Therefore, it’s   entirely possible that we will see some stronger quarters going forward  However, we still   remain close to the break-even rate, which I think of as the escape velocity of 2½ to 3 percent or   so  Given the risks that still exist in the banking sector in Europe and so on, we can’t rule out the   possibility that we’ll fall back and suffer a further slowdown in growth   On the inflation side, I don’t have much to add  I think inflation remains quite well   contained, and, indeed, if anything, the risks are still to the downside  Our LSAP program has   been successful in raising inflation expectations and moderating the fear of deflation, which is a   good thing  I think that’s one of the reasons that confidence is better  The one issue that we had   been concerned about when we discussed LSAPs last time was commodity prices, and   commodity prices are up somewhat  But I have two observations on that  The first is that high   commodity prices have not been associated with a dollar decline—they mostly reflect relative   December 14, 2010 74 of 127             price changes and changes in real conditions  Evidence for that, the second observation, is that   futures prices for oil and many other commodities have gone into backwardation, meaning that   the expectation is that prices will be flat or down in the next year or so   To summarize, then, the broad contours of the outlook have not changed very much    Although I think we have somewhat more confidence in near-term growth, we are starting from a   very deep hole, and we remain far from our objectives in terms of policy   I’d like to add a couple of comments about the assessment of the LSAPs so far  I agree   with Governor Warsh that judgments at this point are very premature, and it will be quite a bit of   time before we can say anything very definitive  Nonetheless, I agree with President Bullard that   the best assessment of the evolution of financial conditions between the end of August and our   last meeting has to involve a certain amount of monetary stimulus, and that includes the behavior   of real rates, the dollar, the stock market, yields, spreads, etc  Again, I think it’s reasonable to   attribute some of that to the markets’ anticipation of our actions, and, in turn, to their anticipation   of some improvement in the outlook due to those changes in policy support   That being said, I would disagree with those who might suggest that we are in an   excessively accommodative position  There are many different ways to measure policy   accommodation, and, as Milton Friedman taught us, low nominal interest rates are only one   indicator of policy accommodation  We have, of course, tried to do policy simulations, using   policy rules, and the like  As President Kocherlakota pointed out, those depend on measured   gaps, which are difficult to measure, so they have to be taken with a grain of salt  However, our   optimal policy simulation still suggests that we’re considerably above where optimal policy   would be in the absence of the zero bound  A simpler indicator—the real short rate—has risen   by about a point and a half since December 2008, as we’ve been pinned at zero and as inflation   December 14, 2010 75 of 127             has come down by about a point and a half  An indicator that I take to be important is nominal   GDP growth—it was less than 1 percent in 2009 and is about 4 percent this year, and the   Tealbook predicts it to be 47 percent next year  It is very hard for me to imagine that we can   have both a strong recovery and an inflation risk at the same time that nominal GDP growth is so   constrained  I put less weight on monetary aggregates  I think they are somewhat unreliable,   given the changes in velocity  Still, M2 growth in 2010 is predicted to be about 3 percent, and   for next year about 1½ percent according to the Tealbook  And then, of course, again, we see   what is happening to inflation and inflation expectations   Therefore, broadly speaking, given the depth of the recession and given how far we have   to go, I think the evidence at least moderately favors the view that policy is not too   accommodative, but that, to the extent it is accommodative, it has been somewhat successful in   advancing our objectives   When we discussed this policy last time, I promised we would continue to monitor the   side effects—I know that has been a particular concern of President Hoenig  I think we need to   keep doing that  I didn’t mention that, as usual, we circulated the financial stability memos prior   to the meeting, and we have been having regular meetings and discussions of financial stability    Notwithstanding the point about land prices, there do not seem to be, in my judgment, any large   growing imbalances on the financial stability side, but that’s obviously something we have to   keep looking at  Inflation expectations remain about where they should be, and the dollar has not   shown any indication of sharp decline  Again, I feel reasonably comfortable with the action that   we took  Notwithstanding the improvement in the outlook, I think that it was the right decision   and that it remains appropriate given the depth of the decline in output and hours and the   uncertainties that we still face going forward   December 14, 2010 76 of 127             Let me stop there and turn to Bill English, who will introduce the policy go-round    Thank you  Are there questions for Bill?  President   Lockhart    Other questions?  [No response]  Seeing none, we’ll start   the second go-round  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Lockhart   December 14, 2010 80 of 127              President Lockhart, by “framework” are you thinking about   the broader issues we talked about in the teleconference, like an inflation target?  Or do you have   a more narrow idea?     I understand  Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you for the comment  I think I’m being only partly   facetious if I reply to you and President Plosser that if our goal is to curry political favor, we’re   not doing a very damned good job of it  [Laughter]  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  First Vice President Moore    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Governor Yellen   December 14, 2010 97 of 127              Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Going to play possum  [Laughter]  Thank you  Governor   Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you, and thanks to everyone for your comments    Substantively, of course, I am supportive of staying the course and alternative B—I gave my   reasons earlier  Notwithstanding the very welcome improvement in the tone of the data, the   general contours of the recovery remain similar to what they were in the last couple of meetings    We are still missing our objectives by a wide margin, in expectation, not just currently  I agree   with President Kocherlakota that measuring the stance of policy is quite difficult and can be   quite humbling, but I think it’s not at all clear that our policy is excessively easy given the state   of the economy  So I think we should stay where we are  We should take more time to assess   developments in the economy  For those who mentioned it, I remain serious that we should   continue to review the policy on three grounds  What’s happening to the outlook, what’s   happening to the efficacy of the policy, and what’s happening in terms of any side effects  I   think a responsible approach would involve all three of those aspects  For today, I counsel   watching and waiting to see how the outlook evolves  It could change sharply—it has done so in   the past, and in that case we would need to be willing to respond to that   I have two comments on communication  Several of you have already spoken about it    The first is that we have multiple objectives in communication  One, of course, is to give our   views, which is very important, but we also want to convey the fundamental collegiality, comity,   and mutual respect in this Committee, which I think we need to make clear to everyone  Another   is that we need to do everything we can to maintain the independence of this institution to make   policy  We should be free to make mistakes, and we need to convey clearly that that’s   December 14, 2010 108 of 127             something we all share  The main thing we can do that would be constructive, as far as I’m   concerned, is to pull down the heat a little bit  You know, I’m not asking for any real changes    Let’s just keep the heat down and give this policy some chance to work or not to work and give   ourselves some time to make a better assessment, and I think that will work fine   The other aspect of communication was, I think, raised a bit by President Lockhart and   President Evans  It’s a little ironic that this Committee has spent years and years talking about   inflation targets and similar kinds of structures, and one of the main issues has been whether we   could succeed politically in creating an inflation target or whether there would be pushback from   the Congress, etc  I think we’re at a moment that if we wanted to do something like that, it   would actually be welcomed by the political world  I see absolutely no problem whatsoever   from a political perspective if we want to go ahead and put some more structure, whether it’s an   inflation target or some other kind of structure, on our policymaking  Yet, in our video   conference discussion of this, we just kind of talked ourselves out of it somehow, I think possibly   because we couldn’t come to agreement on some appropriate way to talk about the other part of   the mandate  It seems to me that was kind of a shame  I’m not suggesting anything specific, but   maybe we can continue to talk about this informally, because I do think there would be very little   resistance at this point  In fact, a number of people would probably welcome it if we were to be   more explicit about our inflation objective, and it might help with the communication issue going   forward  But that’s something for the intermeeting discussions and for future meetings   Turning back to the business of this meeting, I’d like to propose alternative B as it stands,   and thank you again for a thoughtful discussion  Debbie    Thank you very much  The next meeting is Tuesday and   Wednesday, January 25 and 26  We will have a special topic at that meeting on structural   unemployment, obviously a topic of great interest to all of us  A number of the Reserve Banks   are working very hard on this, and we thank you for your contribution  The Board is also   involved in this project  So I look forward to that discussion  There will be a lunch as soon as   the meeting is adjourned, and Linda Robertson will provide us with a legislative update  Thank   you all very much, and have a safe trip home  Meeting adjourned   END OF MEETING      December 14, 2010 110 of 127     "
9143,2011-01-25,BERNANKE,"  We will come to order  The new members of the   Committee this year are Presidents Evans, Fisher, Kocherlakota, and Plosser  First Vice   President Moore is once again serving for San Francisco  Is First Vice President Pat Barron   here?    This is Pat’s last meeting, because he’s retiring  Let me   congratulate you and thank you for your service in Atlanta  [Applause]    This is our organizational meeting, so we have our usual   items  The first item is electing Committee officers  Governor Yellen, do you have a motion?    And I would like it to be known that I meet the residency   requirement  [Laughter]  Are there other nominations?  [No response]  In favor?  [Chorus of   ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you  Governor Yellen    Comments?  Other nominations?  All in favor?  [Chorus of   ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you   All right, we now turn to the nominated staff officers of the Committee  Debbie will read   the list    Other nominations?  [No response]  It’s a very good group    All in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you   Next we have to select a Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the Open Market   Account  New York once again is willing to serve  Any other nominations?  [No response]  All   in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you   The manager of the System Open Market Account, Brian Sack, is once again willing to   serve  The New York Bank will have to ratify that if he is elected  Other nominations?  [No   response]  In favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed?  [No response]  Thank you   The next item is the proposed revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC   Information  This is the memorandum that was circulated to you from Scott and Debbie  It   makes two changes to the current Program for Security  The most important change sets out a   process for investigating breaches of FOMC security that involves an evaluation by the General   Counsel and the Secretary in the first round, and then, if a second round is necessary, the   Inspector General of the Board has agreed to investigate  Just for clarity, my sense is that we are   trying to address breaches related to the discussion of materials prepared for the meeting, such as   the agenda, memos, briefings, and other sorts of things that are part of the background for the   meeting, as well as descriptions of what happened at the meeting, characterizations of other   people’s comments, and so on  What we do not intend to address here is the expression of your   January 25–26, 2011 5 of 282              own views, your own policy assessments, and so on  So we’re trying to keep the meeting itself   separate and not disclose the items I mentioned   Regarding the second change, the Chairman already has authority to make special   exceptions for disclosure of information, and, obviously, there are legitimate reasons for this    The change now specifies that, in doing so, the Chairman should inform the Committee when   those exceptions are made  I would like to note that there are some routine, minor,   administrative cases, such as allowing a noncitizen staff member to participate in producing the   minutes or assigning the work to a transcriber who works with the tapes  Of course, I will   inform you of things like that if you so desire, but I hope that such minor administrative matters   of that sort will be excepted   This memorandum was circulated, and there were no comments  I’d like to open the   floor for some brief comments now, and I hope that we can vote on it as part of the   organizational section of this meeting  However, if the Committee feels that a more lengthy   discussion is necessary, we do have a longer period of time tomorrow on communications, so, if   necessary, we can defer it until then  Would anyone like to comment on the memorandum?    Yes, Governor Tarullo    I think that would be proscribed because it represents an   official view of the staff  However, if the staff member said, “here are some factors that suggest   January 25–26, 2011 7 of 282              that house prices may decline,” without attributing it to the staff or to the Tealbook or to the   FOMC, then I think that’s acceptable    Yes  As you know, the Chairman has some special   responsibilities, for example, to report to the Congress twice a year and so on  In such   testimony, I have talked, for example, about the projections, which, of course, typically come out   at about the same time as the testimony, and I described the objectives and the rationale of the   Committee  I would argue that that’s an appropriate thing to do   I think it’s also fine—and, in fact, desirable—for a member of the Committee to speak   publicly along the following lines after, say, a decision made by the Committee  “Here’s what   we, the Committee, decided  Here’s the logic behind this decision  Here’s what we think this   action may do”  I think that is all fine  Again, the things we’re trying to avoid are, first of all,   the leakage of confidential materials, which are, obviously, not materials that could easily be   replicated by any outsider using, for example, FRED from the St Louis Fed, and, second, the   leakage of characterizations of discussions taking place within the meeting, such as who said   what  In contrast, discussing the sense of the Committee and the goals of the Committee or the   individuals’ outlooks and policy views is entirely appropriate    President Hoenig    There are news stories that say that the FOMC is   considering options for what to do with their LSAP program, for example  Now, that is   something that a reporter could pull together from speeches and interviews that are entirely   legitimate  And I don’t think that that’s necessarily a problem  However, a verbatim or nearly   verbatim report of the debate at the FOMC with some of the specific arguments or numbers   would clearly be a violation    That’s correct  President Lacker    Yes  President Fisher    Other comments?  [No response]  Are we okay voting on   this now?  In favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed?  [No response]  Okay, thank you   We turn to the next item, authorization for Desk operations  This is the annual   authorization, right, Brian?    Let me turn it over to you to introduce it    Thank you  Questions for Brian?  President Lacker    Other questions?  Vice Chairman    Welcome  Other questions for Brian?  [No response]   Seeing no further questions, are we prepared to vote on these two authorizations?  All in favor?    [Chorus of ayes]  All opposed?  [No response]  Thank you   Now for the entertainment portion of our program, [laughter] the staffs of the Board and   the Reserve Banks have prepared a special topic on structural unemployment  I was very   impressed with the amount of work and the range of research that’s being done on this topic, so   January 25–26, 2011 12 of 282              I’m looking forward very much to hearing their overview  Let me turn to Dave Stockton to start   it off    Thank you very much again for very thorough,   comprehensive work  Beth Anne, you’re available for questions, too, is that right?  Yes  Beth   January 25–26, 2011 26 of 282              Anne will take international questions Are there any questions for our colleagues?  President   Fisher    Okay  Questions, comments?  President Lacker   January 25–26, 2011 27 of 282               President Evans   January 25–26, 2011 33 of 282               President Kocherlakota     President Bullard     Thank you  President Evans, do you have a comment?    President Kocherlakota    President Fisher, did you have a comment?    Anyone else?     Well, you have identified a concept economists have talked   about called efficiency wages, which is that people’s effort may depend on the wage they   receive, so cutting wages may not be a good strategy  Anyone else have a question or comment?   January 25–26, 2011 45 of 282              I’d just like to say a few words—and I’m going to regret this  [Laughter]  What President   Bullard, as well as, I believe, President Kocherlakota and President Lacker, described was a   much more complicated machine with all of the pieces—that includes monetary policy, it   includes the real side, it includes labor supply, and so on—which recognizes that if there’s a big   shock, then everything is going to move to some extent, including what we would think of as the   natural rate of unemployment  But I think that, even though the terminology is different, the   concepts are not unrelated  In particular, the point that you’re making is that what FRB/US calls   U* depends on lots of things, and it can move around  And these studies were trying the best   they could to get an empirical grip on how much it has moved  Knowing how much it has   moved is important, because, as Charlie was saying, it helps us estimate how much space we   have in terms of monetary policy expansion, what the unemployment rate will likely be five or   ten years from now, and what the determinants of inflation and other things will be  But, as you   point out, there are a lot of factors affecting U*, so all the presenters can say is that they have   tried to identify some of the important ones and tried to give quantitative estimates of how big   they are  But, clearly, as in all of the problems we face, everything is moving, and that makes it   more complicated, certainly  President Kocherlakota    President Lacker    You can also define “structural” and “cyclical” in a   statistical sense  Whatever model you can write down, unemployment in the real world tends to   come back to more or less the same level after a business cycle is over  There’s a very sharp   pattern of rise and slow decline back to a normal level    Well, there are the relationships with that to inflation, for   example  Any other comments?  Yes    Thank you    If the Senate had had the good sense to confirm Peter   Diamond, we could have wrapped this up in 10 minutes  [Laughter]  All right, I understand that   coffee is ready, so let’s take 20 minutes for a break   [Coffee break]    For the next item on our agenda, let me turn to Brian Sack   for an update on financial conditions    Thank you, Brian  Are there questions?  President Plosser     It raises only the reserves    Governor Warsh     President Fisher, did you have a question?    President Fisher, I know we have had memos like this   before    The Vice Chairman has a two-hander    President Lockhart    President Lacker    Governor Warsh     President Plosser    Governor Duke    President Kocherlakota    Let me comment on both issues  On the first issue, you’re   right, there are going to be communication challenges  In most scenarios, the projections strictly   dominate our non-quantitative easing income stream  Even in these worst-case scenarios,   though, over a five-year average, we’re still doing about the same  So I think we can manage   that, except in the most extreme scenarios   On the second issue, Brian and some of his staff raised the question of whether we would   want to release publicly the questionnaire that we give to the dealers  The idea would be to do it   before the meeting—at the same time that we circulate it to the dealers—which has the   advantage of putting everybody on the same footing  My own thought was that we should wait   and see, partly because I was concerned that circulating it would just create more speculation  It   seemed to me the better thing, if that really was becoming a problem, would be just to stop   circulating the questionnaire at all  You have identified a problem that Brian and his staff have   looked at, and it may be something we need to discuss as a Committee    Why don’t we agree to think about that?   January 25–26, 2011 64 of 282               Anyone else?  Any further questions?  President Lacker    Well, if we determine that it was creating problems or   distorting our policy, we certainly could talk about sterilizing some of the differences  Certainly   we’re technically able to deal with that  Any other questions?  [No response]  If there are no   further questions, then we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations    Any objections?  [No response]  Thank you  The next item   is the economic situation  I’ll call on Dave Reifschneider to lead off    Thank you  Brian Sack, you had a comment?    Thank you  Are there questions for our colleagues?    President Lockhart    Vice Chairman    Governor Tarullo, did you have a comment?    President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Governor Raskin    President Fisher    Other questions?  [No response]  If not, I understand that   there are drinks available followed by dinner, and there will be no business, just for your   convenience  Tomorrow let’s start at 900 am sharp with the economic go-round  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]   January 25–26, 2011 91 of 282              January 26—Morning Session    Good morning  Why don’t we get right to work and begin   our economic go-round?  President Lockhart is up first    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Hoenig    President Hoenig, have you brought these issues to the   supervisory group?    Governor Duke    But the particular emphasis ought to be on the exposure of   the financial institutions    President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    President Kocherlakota, I was a bit confused on one point    Stock and Watson in their paper actually projected inflation, and they suggested there was   significant deflation risk  Did you get a different result?    Okay  Thank you  First Vice President Moore   January 25–26, 2011 112 of 282               And maybe the wage will move over time  [Laughter]    President Lacker    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen      Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much  Thank you for a very good go-  round  It’s 1055  I understand coffee is ready  Why don’t we take 20 minutes?   [Coffee break]    David, did you have any report to make on data?    Thank you, David  I’d like to thank the Committee again   for the useful go-round  Let me try, as usual, to summarize and then I’ll make a few comments   The tenor of the incoming data has increased most participants’ confidence that a   moderate recovery is under way and will continue through 2011  Consumption spending has   been relatively robust recently, and investment in equipment and software and exports have also   been relatively strong  Payrolls are expanding only slowly, but other indicators in the labor   market, including UI claims and surveys of employers, are more positive  Regional and national   surveys of producers remain encouraging  However, overall the economy’s adjustment   continues to be uneven and slow  Residential construction is a particular weak point  The fiscal   compromise enacted in December will provide some additional stimulus, but state and local   governments remain a source of fiscal drag  Commodity prices have risen, but measures of core   or trend inflation remain low  Risks to both growth and inflation appear more balanced than in   the past   As noted, household spending has picked up recently with a surge in auto spending, more   luxury spending, and good holiday sales  There are still some questions about the strength of the   supports for consumer spending, for example, employment, income, and wealth  In particular,   the inventory of unsold homes, high rates of foreclosures, and tight credit continue to push down   house prices, hurting household wealth as well as bank balance sheets, and unemployment seems   likely to come down only very slowly  Nevertheless, household confidence has improved   slightly   January 25–26, 2011 146 of 282              Many businesses are expressing cautious optimism about the durability and strength of   the recovery and are laying the groundwork to expand production when the time comes  Much   investment is aimed at productivity enhancement rather than expanding employment, however    Some participants reported that they had heard that skill requirements are being upgraded and   that some of the unemployed are underqualified, while other participants suggested that workers   at all skill levels still remain easily available  Much hiring is focused on temporary workers    Uncertainty about domestic regulations and taxes may have declined somewhat  Global demand   is strong, but the divergent pace of recoveries around the world, building inflation in emerging   markets, and sovereign debt costs pose risks to the global recovery  Among key sectors,   manufacturing, services, and agriculture are showing strength  Construction remains weak,   though commercial construction is showing signs of bottoming out  Larger firms face no   shortage of credit or liquidity, but credit remains tight for smaller firms   Financial conditions remain supportive  European sovereign and banking problems have   been more quiescent of late but remain unresolved and pose risks to the US through money   market funds and peripheral banks, among other channels  US banks have had better asset   quality and are making more loans, but they face problems, including servicing and mortgage   documentation issues, loss of fee income, tight interest margins, and weak loan demand  There   may be some frothiness in the leveraged loan market  State and local finances do not appear to   pose major short-term risks, but these risks could increase in the long run  Rising farmland   values are another risk to financial stability   Core and other trend inflation measures remain quite subdued, although indicators such   as the median CPI suggest that the ongoing decline in inflation may have stopped  Higher prices   for commodities and for imported goods, especially from emerging market producers, have   January 25–26, 2011 147 of 282              raised input costs for most firms, although unit labor costs remain very low and profit margins   are high  Firms will try to pass through some of these higher costs in some areas, but it is not yet   clear whether they can make price increases stick  Inflation breakevens have risen in recent   months  Overall inflation expectations seem to have normalized close to the mandate-consistent   level  Participants debated the value of resource slack as a predictor of inflation and suggested   other measures, including the rate rather than the level of output growth, as well as a suite of   statistical models  There was agreement, however, that inflation risks have moderated and that   inflation trends should be closely monitored  Any comments?  [No response]  Okay   I would like to add just a few things  Like all of you, I was pleased with the intermeeting   data, and I think the economy is certainly making progress towards a sustainable recovery with   fading downside risks, and that’s very encouraging  In particular, I think the real news was the   strength in household spending in the fourth quarter, which was about 4 percent growth  Of   course, it depends on how you look at it  Under some theories, consumption spending is a   perfect predictor of future income, and in that context that would be very encouraging  But I   think that I wouldn’t go that far, so the question remains, as Governor Yellen mentioned and as   the Tealbook mentioned, about the extent to which we should carry through the innovation from   the fourth quarter into 2011  I think we should do so a little bit, but we also should be somewhat   cautious  First, consumption spending in the fourth quarter was heavily concentrated on autos,   which could be a very positive sign, on the one hand, since durables are, of course, pro-cyclical,   but, on the other hand, there could be some quirky elements to that, and it will be important to   see if that strength persists  The other point is that, as Governor Yellen mentioned, consumption   fundamentals still remain somewhat weak  In particular, labor income has been quite anemic    Real disposable income increased at only about a 1 percent annual rate in the second half of   January 25–26, 2011 148 of 282              2010, reflecting very slow increases in hours, low labor participation, and slow growth in wages    Of course, we also see that—even though deleveraging has been going on—with declining house   prices, wealth-to-income ratios have not really improved very significantly  Higher gas prices   also are a minor negative  So I do expect households to be stronger in 2011, but I think it’s a bit   premature to fully extrapolate forward the strength of their spending in the fourth quarter  It will   be somewhat more difficult at the next meeting or two to evaluate the underlying path of   household spending because of the payroll tax cut that will cause a big surge in disposable   income in the first quarter  So that will be a challenge for us as we try to ascertain the durability   of the recovery   I think what most of us are waiting for, and what I’m certainly waiting for, is to see a   couple of strong employment reports  That would do a lot to increase my confidence that firms   are back in an expansion mode, and that they have increased their confidence about the recovery,   and, in particular, that labor income will be forthcoming to support household spending as well    It has been disappointing to this point that, despite many straws in the wind, the job gains have   still remained fairly limited  So we’ll have to continue to watch for that   That being said, I think we should continue to remember, as I mentioned last time, that   we are starting from a very deep hole  The employment-to-population ratio, which is now less   than 58 percent, is at the business cycle low and is as low as it has been in many years  I noted   in a newspaper column the other day the interesting fact that, for the first time in 30 years, the   employment-to-population ratio of prime-age, that is 25 to 54 years old, workers in the United   States is lower than in Western Europe  This is a striking turnaround, given our image of   Western Europe as having very low employment-to-population ratios  Again, I look forward to   January 25–26, 2011 149 of 282              one or two strong job market reports as an important indicator, recognizing that the situation is   not going to turn around overnight   We had an interesting discussion around the table on inflation  I think it’s pretty fair to   say that there is essentially no domestically generated inflation  All the inflation we’re getting is   from abroad, that is, from commodity prices and from import prices  And that, in turn, is arising   from what I would characterize as deep problems in the international monetary system and in the   global economic system  In particular, the export-led strategies of emerging markets—  particularly China, but others as well—has led them to overheat  They are, indeed, facing   inflation risks, as Governor Warsh mentioned, and, as President Fisher has reminded us on many   occasions, they can export those inflation risks to us via commodity prices and import costs   I’m not quite sure what to do about that  The Federal Reserve Act says we should be   making policy for the United States, not for the world  So how are we supposed to respond to a   situation where many countries are, in the old language, not playing by the rules of the game?  I   think this is an area where we need a broader détente, quite frankly, and during discussions of the   international monetary system in the G-20 under France’s leadership, I hope that we can make   some progress  In the meantime, we’re just going to have to figure out the appropriate tradeoffs,   and, in particular, make sure that commodity prices and import prices do not begin to infect the   domestic inflation rate  I take that, of course, very seriously   As a bit of encouragement, I would note that some fundamental correlates of inflation in   the United States remain very well controlled  Nominal GDP growth, for example, which I’ve   mentioned before, was less than 4 percent in 2010 and in the fourth quarter of 2010  The   Tealbook forecasts nominal GDP growth to be 48 percent for 2011  It’s pretty hard to get 3½ to   4 percent growth and high inflation and still have nominal GDP growth of less than 5 percent    January 25–26, 2011 150 of 282              So I think that’s an indicator we can continue to pay attention to  Unit labor costs are another   indicator—they declined for the entire year of 2010, and they’re projected to grow at a   04 percent rate for 2011 and 2012, so that, too, will be an anchor on inflation  Of course, I think   we all agree that vigilance on inflation will be necessary, and one thing that would certainly   make me seriously rethink our policy stance would be an upsurge in inflation expectations or a   serious upsurge in commodity prices  We would have to take those very seriously if, indeed,   they occurred  That being said, given the unique nature of where inflation is coming from, I   think a bit of patience is probably a good idea   We had differing views on whether or not our current asset purchase policy is working    You may not be shocked to hear that I lean more towards President Bullard’s view on this   subject  [Laughter]  Of course, it’s always very difficult to know (as Barney Frank has said, you   can’t put a counterfactual on a bumper sticker), but the evidence suggests, first, that, as President   Bullard noted, the response of a wide range of financial indicators has been consistent with what   you would expect in a monetary easing or in a situation where risk aversion had declined, both of   which are outcomes of LSAPs  In particular, I mentioned last time that the increase in equity   markets, the decline in equity volatility, the pattern of interest rates declining first and then   increasing as expectations for economic growth broadened, the rise in inflation breakevens, the   decline in credit spreads, the decline in the dollar, the rise in commodity prices, and so forth, are   all consistent with a monetary ease  Then, since August or September, when I think this policy   should really be treated as beginning, we’ve seen an improvement in the outlook  So I think   that’s all consistent with believing that there is at least some benefit emanating from the LSAPs   Of course, that’s one observation, so, to double my sample size, I asked the staff to   calculate the same statistics for the months following March 2009, which was our previous   January 25–26, 2011 151 of 282              attempt  Without going through the details on all seven of those financial indicators, the patterns   were exactly the same, and the lag between the action and the response of the economy was   about the same  So there is, I think, some evidence that this has been helpful, recognizing,   though, that there are important costs  President Fisher has been particularly assiduous in   pointing out the balance sheet costs and expectational costs, and we’ll need to take those into   serious consideration as we reevaluate this policy going forward   To wrap this up, I think the news basically has been encouraging  The economy looks   stronger  This is still more prospective than actual  We should continue to watch very carefully   what develops in the labor market, and we need to keep a close eye on commodity prices and   inflation expectations as possible indicators that the inflation situation is becoming more   worrisome  I’ll stop there unless there are any questions or comments  Yes, President   Kocherlakota    I’ll check it for you, but my recollection was all prime-age   workers    If there are no other questions or comments, let’s go ahead   to the policy discussion, and I’ll ask Bill English to introduce this round    Thank you  Are there any questions for Bill?  [No   response]  Before we start the go-round, let me make a somewhat orthogonal comment  In   alternative C paragraph 5 there’s a reference in brackets to a numerical inflation target, which we   put there as sort of a placeholder  You may recall that we’ve been discussing off and on the   issue of improving our communication and credibility by using a numerical target—we discussed   January 25–26, 2011 155 of 282              it at the videoconference in October  We have not yet come to any conclusion on that issue,   despite the fact that there is quite a bit of interest in that approach around the table and that this   may be a particularly good time from a political receptivity perspective  So, as I mentioned last   time, this might be something we want to keep alive as we go forward   After the last meeting, President Plosser came up to me and asked if he could be of any   assistance on this, and I suggested that he might want to talk informally to a few people across   the spectrum of the Committee to get a sense about whether there was any way forward on this    He said he’d be glad to do that, and he spoke to a few people during the intermeeting period  I   wanted to mention this to everybody so that you’d know that some informal discussion has been   going on, and I hope that’s okay  It seems we’ve had plenty of formal processes on this in the   past, and maybe just a few informal conversations could be useful  Everybody is, of course,   entitled to have his or her own conversations or to contact Charlie, as you wish  If we make   some progress in terms of a proposal or an approach, then perhaps we could turn it over to a   more formal process and bring it forward to the Committee once again  In any event, we surely   would not make any change to our communications strategy without a full formal review and   Committee decision  Any concerns, questions?  [No response]  Okay, then let’s turn now to the   policy go-round, and I have President Lacker first    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you    President Kocherlakota    Thank you  I think that in 2004 there was an occasion   where the language changed at one meeting and then there was an increase at the subsequent   meeting  So there was only a one-meeting delay between the language change and the action    Obviously we can work that through  President Evans   January 25–26, 2011 162 of 282               Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Bullard   January 25–26, 2011 171 of 282               Thank you  First Vice President Moore    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Trying to make yourself redundant, Governor?  [Laughter]    Governor Raskin    Vice Chair    Thank you very much  Again, a good discussion   The economy is kind of like an ocean liner, which does take a while to move, and I think   we have to be patient  We are seeing signs of sustainable recovery, but they are still somewhat   nascent; in particular, we haven’t seen any strong employment reports yet  So I would advocate   maintaining the status quo  I do believe the policy has been helpful  We can differ on exactly   how much and in what way, but I do think it has been supportive of the recovery  So I   recommend alternative B   There was some discussion about strengthening paragraph 1 in B to make it like   paragraph 1 in C  I can make a quick proposal  There are two differences between these two   paragraphs  One is that the paragraph in C strikes out the things that are constraining   consumption growth, and the other is that the paragraph in C basically says business investment   is rising and drops out the nonresidential part  One proposal is the following, given that I think   all the things that are affecting household spending are still relevant  Where it says “business   spending on equipment and software is rising,” insert a comma and then say, “though employers   remain reluctant to add to payrolls”  That drops a negative sentence, and that’s pretty consistent   with the suggestion from President Fisher, for example, about firms investing in order to improve   productivity rather than to improve employment   January 25–26, 2011 189 of 282               Yes    Well, C says, “business investment is rising”  Do you think   that’s more accurate?    Well, we had some indication that it was bottoming out    We do change the emphasis periodically  Does anyone have a view on this?  Governor Tarullo    Well, do we believe business investment is rising?   PARTICIPANTS  Yes    Are we okay with that?  How about “business investment is   rising, though employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls”?  We look to the Research and   Statistics staff   January 25–26, 2011 190 of 282               Right    Okay  I’m willing to do that  The only objection I had was   that it would say “the economic recovery has strengthened, though at a rate…”  We’re confusing   derivatives here  It’s as if it’s strengthening but not strengthening fast enough    Okay    All right    Okay  Are we okay with “has strengthened”?    “…has strengthened, though the rate of economic growth   has been insufficient to bring down…”   January 25–26, 2011 191 of 282               All right  May I ask indulgence to leave paragraph 1 in B   as it is for now and to save changes in our text for next time?  I’d like to leave that paragraph as   it is, if that’s okay, with the understanding that we will overcompensate in March    Yes   MRPLOSSER  One way to address this is to make sure that the discussion in the   minutes gives a little more positive sense   January 25–26, 2011 192 of 282               My summary of the discussion begins, “The tenor of the   incoming data has increased most participants’ confidence that a moderate recovery is under way   and will continue”    All right     I gave it a try  I did consider the “strengthening” phrase at   the end of paragraph 2  But, if you’ll notice, that creates a zigzag sentence where we’re happy,   but we’re sad, but we’re happy  [Laughter]  In paragraph 3, I’ve heard very different advice on   the $80 billion  I’m hearing from New York, though, that you think this is worse for markets   rather than better for markets    The advantage of putting it in is that this is a parameter that   we can move at some point if we were to change the pace while keeping the total     President Bullard    Take it as read  [Laughter]  All right, I take full   responsibility for leaving it in  I realize there’s a slight risk there, but there’s also a risk to   dropping it  It’s something that we could, in fact, vary if we taper or if we change the pace    Let’s leave the next sentence as it was last time, and let’s drop the other change  The only   January 25–26, 2011 193 of 282              change in the statement, therefore, is to add the phrase about the pace of $80 billion  Everything   else is as written  Okay?  Any other comments?    Yes    The $80 billion?    All right, explain why    Did she convince you, President Bullard?    No, I agree  President Fisher    All right  I am going to take a straw vote, so I can share the   responsibility  [Laughter]    Her advice was to drop the $80 billion    Yes  All in favor of not having the $80 billion?  I count ten    All in favor of including the $80 billion?  Okay, we’ll drop it  President Bullard, your concern is   noted, and we’ll take measures to try to make sure that all of the dimensions of our policy are   reflected in our discussions  Brian    We should have figured that out    Okay  Debbie   January 25–26, 2011 195 of 282               Thank you very much  We have one more item, which is   the communications issue  We can try to do that now, or we can have a 20-minute lunch break    Is there a preference?  People have flights?    We can do it during lunch, I suppose  It’s only a question   of speaking loudly, okay?   January 25–26, 2011 196 of 282               —the food away from the microphones  All right, why   don’t we break for lunch?  We’ll return here, and we’ll immediately go into this last item of   discussion   [Break]    Let’s recommence the meeting, please  Thank you  I see   Charlie coming, so we will just go ahead and get started  The last item is on communication, and   I want to thank the communications subcommittee for the work they have done and the ongoing   discussions they have had  So let me turn it over now to Janet     President Kocherlakota    President Hoenig    President Rosengren   January 25–26, 2011 200 of 282               Governor Tarullo    President Bullard    Sure    Okay  President Lockhart, would you like to enter into the   conversation?    President Plosser    Thank you  First Vice President Moore    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans    President Lacker    President Fisher    Thank you  Have a good flight  Vice Chairman    Governor Warsh    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Governor Raskin   January 25–26, 2011 227 of 282               Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Would you like to sum up?    Thank you all very much  The next meeting is March 15    The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   January 25–26, 2011 230 of 282     "
9174,2011-03-15,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  I would like to begin by   welcoming John Williams to the table  John has been at 18 previous meetings, so it is not a new   experience for him, but this is a new position  We welcome you, and wish you the best of luck    Governor Warsh is not with us today, as you can see  He’ll   be leaving at the end of the month, so this would have been his last meeting  We will, of course,   miss Kevin very much  We will have an opportunity at the April meeting to honor him and say   good-bye   Our ever-alert staff has informed me that today is the 75th anniversary of the FOMC    The first meeting was in March of 1936  This is meeting number 725  If we keep going, we will   eventually get it right  [Laughter]  We would like to celebrate, but somebody has taken away the   punchbowl  [Laughter]  However, there will be a “Happy 75th Anniversary” cake at lunch   today, so you’ll understand where that is coming from  Without further folderol, item 1 is   financial developments and open market operations  Let me turn it over to Brian Sack    Thank you  Are there questions for Brian?  President   Kocherlakota   March 15, 2011 8 of 165               Vice Chair    Governor Tarullo    President Fisher    After the fact     President Fisher, are you talking about getting the   questionnaire in advance or the results?   March 15, 2011 11 of 165               Oh, getting the questionnaire in advance  Why don’t we   investigate to see if there are any legal or security issues regarding that possibility?  I think, in   general, more transparency within the Committee is better, but I can think of one issue, which is   that we don’t want the dealers inferring too much about policy intentions from the questions on   the questionnaire    We’ll look into that     President Bullard    Other questions for Brian?  President Lacker    Other questions for Brian?  [No response]  Okay  Seeing   none, we need to vote to ratify domestic open market operations since January  May I have a   motion?    Without objection  Thank you  We turn now to item 2, the   economic situation, and I will turn to Dave Stockton    Thank you very much  Are there questions for our   colleagues?  President Fisher    President Evans    President Bullard    Governor Tarullo    President Bullard, were you done?    President Trichet has been making this argument—and I   would just inject that I don’t find it completely plausible—Germany is 2½ percentage points   below the pre-crisis level in terms of unemployment  Spain is 12 percentage points above the   pre-crisis level  They don’t have a common fiscal authority  They don’t have common   unemployment or retirement funds  I think the problems that they face in terms of heterogeneity   seem to me to be much deeper than ours, although we certainly do have some    President Lacker    President Lockhart had a two-hander    President Plosser    Vice Chairman    Other questions?  President Bullard    Anyone else?  [No response]  All right, thank you very   much  We’re ready now for the economic go-round, and we’ll start with President Lockhart    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you very much  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Plosser    I just want to comment that we will be talking about the exit   strategy at the next meeting  Bill, is that correct?    President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  President Lacker   March 15, 2011 52 of 165               Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you very much  It’s 11 o’clock  I understand coffee   is ready  Why don’t we take 20 minutes?   [Coffee break]    All right  Thanks very much  Let’s continue the go-round   with Vice Chairman Dudley    Thank you  Governor Yellen   March 15, 2011 69 of 165               Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo   March 15, 2011 75 of 165               Thank you  Governor Raskin   March 15, 2011 78 of 165               Thank you, Governor Raskin, and thank you all  As usual,   I’m going to attempt a summary of the discussion  Bear with me, and then I’ll make a few   additional comments   Indicators continue to point to a strengthening though moderate recovery in 2011    Private-sector demand may be leading to self-sustaining growth  Labor market conditions have   improved as unemployment fell significantly, though payroll growth has been somewhat less   strong overall  Housing remains a drag on the recovery, as do fiscal policy, both at the federal   and state and local levels  In addition, the effects of the Japanese situation remain unclear  With   respect to inflation, the most important developments were, again, higher prices for oil and other   commodities, which have increased headline inflation and contributed to some increase in   indicators of inflation expectations  On net, risks to economic growth appear relatively balanced,   while risks to inflation have shifted somewhat to the upside   Consumer behavior reflects mixed influences, though auto sales remain strong  On the   one hand, tax cuts are showing up in paychecks, and as noted, labor market conditions are   improving  Unemployment is down, although in part this improvement reflects fewer layoffs   and exits from the labor force rather than new hiring  The decline in the labor force may be   either cyclical, reflecting the expiration of unemployment insurance, or structural  On the other   hand, higher gas prices have drained spending power, reducing confidence and expectations for   recovery while increasing expectations of inflation  Special concerns might arise with $4 per   gallon gas, along the lines of the Hamilton theory of oil price effects  Home equity declines have   reduced household wealth  Credit availability for most households—for example, in areas such   as auto loans—has improved, however   March 15, 2011 81 of 165              In the business sector, cautious confidence in the durability and momentum of the   recovery is growing  Capital budgets have expanded in some cases to replace lost capacity,   although at least some firms remain cautious about hiring  (I had a hard time trying to   characterize firms’ attitudes toward employment)  Wage pressures are low except possibly in a   few narrow fields  That pattern is evident in recent union developments  Strong demand abroad   is also stimulating production and exports, including agricultural exports  Higher commodity   prices are leading to intensified cost pressures, some of which firms will attempt to pass through   to consumers  Higher energy prices are also seen as a threat to demand by some firms  Among   key sectors, manufacturing, energy, capital goods, air travel, and agriculture were reported as   strong  Processed food, apparel, and steel are among the industries looking to raise prices    Construction and construction lending remain generally depressed   Financial conditions were mixed over the intermeeting period  It remains to be seen   whether recent European proposals will calm the sovereign debt crisis there  The dollar showed   less flight-to-quality behavior during the recent MENA disruptions  US banks see improving   credit quality and weak loan demand (and we’re not allowed to talk about anything else)    [Laughter]  However, credit conditions have improved in some areas, including autos, student   loans, and C&I, although small businesses are doing relatively worse in that respect  Some risks   to financial stability have been noted, including greater leverage and risk-taking by private equity   funds, increased speculation in commodities, reduced covenants on bonds and leveraged loans,   banks’ exposures to Europe, and high farmland values   Finally, on inflation, core inflation and other measures of inflation trends appear to have   bottomed out but remain low  Some noted that ongoing slack in labor markets, limited pass-  through of commodity prices, and stable inflation expectations should keep inflation trends low,   March 15, 2011 82 of 165              but others saw core inflation rising as economic growth proceeds  Near-term headline inflation   is showing the effects of significant increases in gas prices and, to a lesser extent, in food prices    As noted, increased commodity prices have raised costs for many producers, which they will try   to pass on to final users where conditions permit  Import prices are also up  Business surveys   show higher prices paid and received  That said, wage costs are low and mark-ups are high,   providing an offset for raw material costs  Higher near-term inflation has shown up in some   increase in inflation expectations—for example, in consumer surveys—and public attention to   inflation has increased  Inflation breakevens in the TIPS market have increased to levels in the   upper part of recent ranges, though much of the effect is front loaded  The enlarged Fed balance   sheet may have influenced inflation expectations  The increase in headline inflation may well be   temporary  However, close monitoring of inflation and inflation expectations is essential, and   communication will present difficult challenges   Any comments?  [No response]  Well, let me just add a few thoughts, and some of them   will build on comments that some of the folks around the table have made   There were some negative developments over the intermeeting period  Obviously, we’ve   talked a lot about geopolitical disruptions, which have led to oil price spikes, and the Japanese   situation, the implications of which are not yet known  We saw some fiscal tightening, although   depending on how that plays through, if we get a longer-term budget deal, it could end up being   a positive  Ongoing concerns with housing and the banking system should be noted, particularly   recent developments on the foreclosure problems and the servicing issues  Finally, some of the   downward revisions we saw in Q4 and in consumption in Q1 suggest a bit less vigorous   expansion in some dimensions than we thought in January   March 15, 2011 83 of 165              That said, on the whole, like most of you, I am cautiously confident  The labor market   report for February was encouraging; we’re beginning to see, I think, what may be a sequence of   stronger payroll gains  The drop in unemployment has been noted, as well as the fact that the   Beveridge curve has shifted somewhat back toward where it began  The strength in the labor   market is supported by surveys, like ISM surveys, for example  There have been other strong   indicators, such as equipment and software investment, factory output, auto sales, and the like    So overall, the recovery does appear to be continuing—perhaps not as powerfully as we would   like, but the longer it goes on, and the fewer times the Tealbook has to be revised between   meetings, the more encouraging that is  So I do agree with people around the table that we are   beginning to see more evidence that the recovery is self-sustaining   There was a lot of discussion about inflation around the table, which, of course, is up in   the near term  I’d like to address that from a number of dimensions  First, I think it is worth   noting—just a bit of perspective—that the commodity price increases we’ve seen so far are not   going to take headline inflation very high  According to the Tealbook analysis, the maximal   12-month PCE headline inflation will be 23 percent in June, and it will move down from there   to 18 percent in December  That’s, of course, under the usual assumptions about flat   commodity prices and the like  But I would note that in 2008, this Committee was facing an   inflation rate that was 36 percent in January and hit 45 percent in July before falling to   4 percent in September  So we have dealt with these commodity price increases before, and we   have not necessarily seen any catastrophic movement in inflation expectations  That being said,   as I will make clear, I don’t take any of this lightly   I do think as we talk about inflation—and a lot of the focus has been on whether   commodity prices are being passed on or not—we need to keep in mind the basic economics of   March 15, 2011 84 of 165              how monetary policy should respond to commodity price increases  The theory is very well   established, but it is worth saying once again  There are essentially two cases  The first case is   one in which it’s a supply shock, that is, the increase in commodity prices is being driven by   some set of factors outside of monetary policy or in which it’s otherwise exogenous to the   domestic economy  In that case, what the economy is trying to do is propagate a relative price   shift, trying to say that the relative price of this commodity versus other goods and services has   changed, and somehow the system has to accommodate that  Now, if we believe that nominal   wages, in particular, are slow to adjust for whatever reason, then the only way that the   commodity price relative change can emerge in the system is through a temporary increase in   headline inflation  The alternative case, which would be to tighten monetary policy enough to   avoid the increase in headline inflation, would require that we force down wages, which, in turn,   would require presumably a significant negative impact on the economy  So in these cases, for   whatever reason, we think the commodity price increases are largely independent of monetary   policy—and I’ll come back to whether that’s the case currently or not—there is a very clear   implication that so long, obviously importantly, as inflation expectations remain stable—and   that’s something many of you addressed—then we should be relatively willing to look through   temporary movements in commodity prices rather than reacting strongly with monetary policy   Now, I note that Vice Chairman Dudley laughed at himself on the communication issue   that he has  There is a communication issue  Because monetary policy should not address these   things doesn’t mean they’re not painful  It doesn’t mean they’re not affecting people’s lives   And we clearly, in talking about it, should in no way downplay the effect of high gas prices and   high food prices on people’s standards of living  So we must do that, but that doesn’t necessarily   mean that in all cases monetary policy has to respond vigorously to commodity price increases   March 15, 2011 85 of 165              So what is the situation?  How much of an argument can we make for the exogeneity or   partial exogeneity of the commodity price increases that we’ve seen recently?  I think the case is   moderately good, although obviously not complete  Clearly, in the oil area, geopolitical factors   have been very important; they’ve driven up oil prices quite significantly  On food, there has   been a rather severe concatenation of bad weather conditions  The USDA has confirmed that,   for a wide variety of staple crops, weather conditions in the past year have been exceptionally   bad  This, in fact, shows up, as Nathan mentioned, in the futures market  For example, the   cotton futures for a year from now are about half of what they are in the spot market, suggesting   that there is a strong presumption that normalization of crops in the year to come will bring   prices down or at least stabilize them  So I think there is some case for paying attention to the   futures market in this case And, of course, there’s an interaction between energy prices and food   prices  Higher energy prices tend to raise food prices as well   Now, of course, there’s also a global demand element to the increase in commodity   prices, and there the linkage to US monetary policy is more complex  When I’m trying to make   a simple argument, I talk about the relationship between US monetary policy and, say, oil   prices  I point out, first, that the United States is consuming less oil and producing more today   than it did five years ago or three years ago, and so overheating of the US economy is not   directly influencing net supplies of oil demand in the global economy  It’s also the case that the   decline in the dollar is not remotely enough to explain the movement in commodity prices  In   particular, commodity prices are much higher in all currencies, not just in the dollar  So if   there’s a relationship between US monetary policy and global commodity prices, it’s more   indirect  The story that I think is most plausible is one where you have a world in which some   emerging market economies are intentionally keeping down their exchange rates in order to   March 15, 2011 86 of 165              expand their export markets  They are, therefore, importing, to some extent, US monetary   policy, which is inappropriate for their economies   We have a situation in the world today where industrial production in the advanced   industrial economies is still below the level at the beginning of the crisis, while in the emerging   markets it is between 20 and 25 percent above the level before the crisis  So we have very much   a two-speed recovery, and in a well-functioning international monetary system, those countries   that are growing quickly and, in fact, are overheating would allow their exchange rates to   appreciate and would tighten, raise interest rates, and reduce the inflationary effect of their   growth  They are doing that to some extent, but obviously not completely, so the question   remains  What is our responsibility?  I think it’s a hard question  On the one hand, our mandate   is to address the US economy, and so in some sense we have to worry about the feedback  On   the other hand, it seems rather unfair that the emerging markets can essentially force us to   maintain a suboptimal economy so that they can keep their exchange rates at a comfortable level   and maintain undervaluation and trade surpluses  So it’s a difficult question  But clearly, I think   everyone would agree that this effect is being mediated not just from US monetary policy   decisions, but also through the decisions being made by policymakers in emerging markets, and   in that respect, it’s a difficult question   The main counterargument to the view that we should not be responding too aggressively   to commodity price increases is, of course, the one that people around the table have made,   which is that even exogenous price increases in commodities could, in principle, unhinge   inflation expectations for whatever reason  And in that respect I am in full agreement with   everyone around the table that we need to watch that very carefully  My feeling is that so far that   that has not happened  The movement in all of our various indicators remains still well within   March 15, 2011 87 of 165              historical ranges, particularly in the TIPS market  Almost all of the changes, as Brian Sacks   showed, have been in the near-term expectations  The longer-term inflation compensation is not   much changed, even though one would presume that inflation risk premiums are a little bit   higher than they were  Forecasts from the SPF and elsewhere are, in fact, below where they’ve   been in recent years  There’s as of yet not much evidence of pass-through, et cetera  So I don’t   think that that mechanism is as yet a reason for alarm  That being said, that is the mechanism by   which even exogenous commodity price increases can be translated into inflation domestically,   and that is something to which we have to pay very close attention going forward   Let me say a word about the comparison of US monetary policy with other countries    There were a number of people who mentioned the ECB, for example, and there’s a meme in the   international press, you know, that the ECB is so hawkish and the Fed is so dovish, and that’s a   difference in our constitutions or something  In fact, if you condition on economic conditions,   it’s not at all evident that the ECB is more hawkish than the Federal Reserve  Just to give you a   little exercise that I did, and I recognize it’s an imperfect exercise, if you take the Taylor (1993)   rule, which puts a relatively low weight on output gaps, then you can compare the conditional   tightness of any two countries by just taking the difference between the Taylor-rule implications   for the two countries  In particular, if you ask what is the difference in the policy rate that is   warranted by the Taylor rule in a given country, the answer is it should be 15 times the   difference between the inflation rate in that country and the US inflation rate minus half of the   gap in that country minus the US gap  That essentially tells you what the difference in policy   rates should be  When you do this exercise, you find, for example, that while the actual euro-   area rate is 60 basis points higher than the US federal funds rate, the difference implied by the   Taylor rule is 215 basis points  The reason is that the output gap there is much lower and the   March 15, 2011 88 of 165              inflation rate is higher  For the United Kingdom, they’re 40 basis points tighter than we are; the   implied difference from the Taylor rule is 405 basis points  For Canada, it is 310 basis points    The only country that is easier than the United States is Japan, which of course is also   constrained by the zero lower bound  So in that respect, I think if you condition on economic   conditions, the difference is much less evident than some of the superficial discussion would   suggest   In particular, though, I realize that the output gaps are a question  Although the ECB’s   output gap for its own area is apparently lower than our estimate, putting that aside, there really   is a major difference in what’s happened to unemployment here and in other countries  For   example, our unemployment rate is 43 percentage points above the two-year average before the   crisis, whereas the EU’s increase in unemployment is 20 percentage points  So there’s been a   much bigger increase in unemployment here than in other countries  The same is true in the   other countries for which I compared, and in particular, imagine being at the ECB in Frankfurt   and taking into account the fact that the German unemployment rate is now 26 percentage points   below what it was before the crisis  So it’s not all that shocking that the ECB is talking about   tightening, and it’s not evident from that that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve  So I   thought that was worth mentioning    I think we’re still constrained by the zero lower bound, notwithstanding the   considerations I discussed today  I think further that—and again, anticipating the policy   discussion—given all that has happened in the world, now is not the time to be shocking markets   with our policy decision  That being said, once again, I’ve heard what you’ve said around the   table about inflation risk; I’ve heard what Presidents Fisher and Hoenig said about financial   instability risks  I do think we need to become more and more attentive, and I think that by the   March 15, 2011 89 of 165                                                              2 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)      April meeting, we should be providing fairly definitive guidance to the markets about what we’re   going to do with our purchase program and possibly with additional measures  But, again, I   don’t think that today is necessarily the day to do that   Let me stop there and turn now to Bill English to introduce the policy round    Thank you, Bill  Any questions for Bill?  [No response]    Seeing none, we can turn to the policy go-round, and we’ll start with President Rosengren    We are, in fact, as I understand it, talking to banks about the   farmland situation, and Kansas City is playing an important role in that  President Lacker    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Read the two sentences that you changed    I think, actually, that’s very good  Is there a feeling around   the table?   PARTICIPANTS  Yes, I agree  Very good    All right    President Fisher    So the idea is  “…these effects to be transient, but it will   pay”—  Yes    All right  I think that’s very constructive, thank you    Who’s next here?    I’m sorry  You’ve contributed so much already    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    With great reluctance, I think I’d point out it’s getting a   little bit latish  [Laughter]  Let’s try to minimize the research program component today    President Plosser   March 15, 2011 100 of 165               Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Bullard    Adaptive learning  [Laughter]    Yes    President Fisher    Well, because it involved a change from the previous   $75 billion, and the concern was that there would be confusion  I think now the question that   Bill English mentioned in his presentation was that, at this point, reinserting it might create some   confusion of a different type about what our plans are  I put it in there because I do feel that we   March 15, 2011 107 of 165              did strike this compromise some meetings ago  President Bullard and I talked about the   elimination of the unfortunate change in the rate of the pace of purchases at the last meeting  But   the majority of the Committee last time felt that it was not appropriate to include it just for   communication clarity  If there are others who want to change their views and want to reinsert,   I’ll give you a chance, so let me know later at the end of the round  Okay  President Williams    I think that’s a friendly amendment   March 15, 2011 108 of 165               President Plosser    So just one word on that, which is that in an inflation-  targeting regime, we would be talking about medium-term objectives  And that’s really what we   have in mind here  I think that “underlying” abstracts from the temporary fluctuations associated   with commodities    One way to change that is we would move toward a   medium-term type of description    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  So looking at that for a second, has there been   a significant movement in core up?  I don’t think on a 12-month basis that’s really the case    President Plosser    No  How about “have remained low”?  How is that?    Would that work for you, President Lockhart?  I think the part about getting stronger and   firming—I think that goes against what we are trying to say    Well, you don’t like the word “subdued”  “Low” means   low  They’re low  They’re not trending anymore  We got rid of “trending downward”  I   wouldn’t change paragraph 4 very lightly, Dennis, because that’s such an important paragraph    Would you be okay with changing “subdued” to “low” or “have remained low”?    Paragraph 1, yes    Yes  Is that okay?  What do you think?  Anyone?    Well, this is a question of describing the medium term, and   we may want to think more about how we will explain our medium-term objectives in the future    But for the time being, we’re talking about the “underlying trend,” which basically means   indicators like trimmed means and so on that have not really moved much    Yes?    Yes   March 15, 2011 115 of 165               All right  Why don’t we just put this in the inventory of   stuff we are going to come back to at the end?      Dennis, anything else?    Okay  President Fisher    The last thing—repeat the last thing you said    I didn’t understand the last thing    All right  Thank you  Governor Yellen   March 15, 2011 117 of 165               Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo   March 15, 2011 119 of 165               Okay  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Okay, thank you all  Well, as I said earlier, I don’t think   this is the time to be making major changes in our policy, but I understand the concerns and   issues that people have raised, and there are risks, I think, in both directions   March 15, 2011 122 of 165              I think that April will be a very important meeting  It will be a meeting where I hope that   we will be able to provide clarity to the markets on our future plans regarding purchases, at least,   and hopefully we will make progress on exit strategy discussions as well  So, again, that will be   an important meeting   With respect to the statement, people have focused on alternative B, which, of course, I   agree with  In paragraph 2, there has been strong acceptance of President Kocherlakota’s   amendment with the Williams addition, which I will read quickly  “The recent increases in the   prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation  The   Committee expects these effects to be transient, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of   inflation and inflation expectations”  In general, I don’t like to make unnecessary changes, but I   guess I am okay changing the “unemployment rate” to “unemployment,” if that makes people   more comfortable     Okay    Okay  I think people would read that as “unemployment   rate”  But I’ll tell you what, we are going to take straw votes in just a minute on a couple of   items  That’s one of them  The second one is another suggestion of President Plosser, to strike   the word “somewhat” in the second line  And the third is President Lockhart’s  I’m trying to   find a solution at the end of paragraph 1  How about “and inflation trends remain low”?  Is that   better?    As opposed to “underlying”  Okay    Well, that’s what I plan to do  [Laughter]  All right  Let   me ask, is there any further comment on “somewhat,” which slightly strengthens it?  Is there any   objection to making that change?  Anyone?    Dropping the word “somewhat” in the second line—is that   okay with you?    Okay  All right  We’ll do that  The second proposal is to   change, at the end of B1, “measures of underlying inflation have been subdued” to “and inflation   trends have been low”    What’s the right construction?   PARTICIPANT  Moderate    “But inflation trends are subdued”—would that be any   better?    Well, I was suggesting, “measures of underlying inflation   remain low,” which suggests that they are low but not falling anymore  That doesn’t help you,   though     Fine, fine  Okay  I’m worried about time  With apologies,   so the only change we’re making in B1 is to drop the word “somewhat” in the second line  And,   March 15, 2011 125 of 165              finally, with apologies to President Bullard, I didn’t hear much support for putting in the   $80 billion  So let’s strike that  Again, with apologies  Any further comments?  President   Lacker    Any English majors who care to comment on “transient”   versus “transitory”?  [Laughter]    All right  “Transitory” it is  Anyone else?  Any   comments?  Bill    We haven’t decided    All right  It’s linked to the SEP  That’s right    Well, we are going to talk in a few minutes about linking up   our statement and our policy to the SEP more explicitly, and “unemployment rate” is what we   forecast   March 15, 2011 126 of 165               Okay  Again, with apologies to many good suggestions, we   are making the changes that were suggested by President Kocherlakota with the Williams   addition, and we are dropping the word “somewhat” in the second line  If there are no further   comments—Matt    Thank you very much  We have an additional item on   communication  What I would like to recommend is that we go get some lunch, come back to   the table, and have a brief discussion, if that would work   [Lunch break]    The last substantive item is a recommendation on   communications from Governor Yellen’s subcommittee  As you know, she is going to talk about   the idea of having press conferences   I will be happy to answer questions, and so on, from my perspective as well, but I just   want to say one thing before I turn the floor over to Janet, which is that I want to thank President   March 15, 2011 127 of 165              Plosser and his colleagues for the good work they did on a numerical objective for inflation  I   just want to be clear that this discussion today is motivated by timing considerations  It is not   intended to be a substitute—I think, in fact, it will be a complement—for our discussion on the   numerical objective, which Governor Yellen’s subcommittee will take up in due course and   bring back to the Committee  So let’s keep this discussion today separate from that, if we could,   and see what progress we can make  Let me turn this over to Governor Yellen    Let me add quickly that I am very comfortable with this   proposal  I think the difference between the Fed and other central banks has become quite   striking—every other central bank does have this method for communication   I am sure it is something we will learn about as we go; we’ll be learning by doing  But I   want to assure everybody that my objective is both to present the modal view—that is, the policy   decision— quickly after the meeting, or at least quarterly—and to give some sense of what was   discussed and what diversity of views there was  So my goal would be to represent the views of   the broad Committee   In terms of documents, my assumption is that they would have in advance the   Committee’s statement, which we would continue to develop as we do now, and they would also   have just the SEP numbers—not the full narrative description, but the numbers in the projections    I would simply go over those numbers, and I would try to talk about the day’s policy decision  I   think a useful objective here is to try to put the policy decision in the context of the longer-term   SEP, which then in turn will generate more interest in the SEP  But let me stop there, and, again,   either one of us can answer questions, or we would be eager to hear your comments    To give an example, what the ECB does is they have a   statement that the President reads, to start  And it consists, as I understand it, of several   paragraphs of general outlook material prepared by the staff in advance of the meeting, and then   a policy paragraph, which is similar to our statement, and then it’s agreed upon by the Council    Michelle, what is the feasibility of ad hoc press   conferences, if necessary?    No  I was just saying, in case of a situation like Narayana   was talking about    We could look at the ECB and some other models to see   what they do    Casual Friday    Thank you  If anyone has any questions or suggestions,   please call me or Janet, and if necessary we can issue some kind of document and have a call or   whatever we need to do  We’ll be thinking about the format, but I’ve given you a general idea    The goal of it basically, of course, is to try to increase the understanding of what we’re doing   and, in particular, link it up to our longer-term approach  So I’m hopeful it will work well    So that was the plan  April meeting, and we’ll keep you   posted  One implication is that if you have changes to projections, they have to be done by the   end of the first day instead of the end of the second day  All right  If there’s nothing else on this   topic, I want to remind you that the next meeting is April 26 and 27   March 15, 2011 149 of 165               At dawn  [Laughter]  The meeting is adjourned  Thank   you  Have a good trip home   END OF MEETING   March 15, 2011 150 of 165     "
9197,2011-04-26,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Welcome to the marathon   FOMC meeting  [Laughter]  Thank you for accommodating the early start  As you know, we   have an extra go-round today  I hope this will not be the norm, but we’ll just have to see how   things evolve   Given the topics this morning, I thought we would make this a joint FOMC–Board   meeting, and so I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you  Without objection  Let’s begin, as usual, with   financial developments and open market operations, and I’ll turn to Brian Sack  Brian    Thank you, Brian  One other vote that we will be   requesting is the ratification of foreign exchange transactions over the intermeeting period  So I   thought I would just say a word about the intervention that the Federal Reserve participated in   with respect to the yen   As you know, the FOMC delegates to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee—the   Chairman and Vice Chairman of the FOMC and Vice Chair of the Board—the authority to   authorize interventions if they are sufficiently small and if time does not permit consultation with   the full Committee  I think both of those conditions were easily met  As you know, we haven’t   intervened for more than a decade, but following the earthquake and tsunami, there were some   quite extraordinary circumstances  The Japanese called the G-7, cited large moves in the yen in   relatively illiquid trading conditions, and asked for us to participate in a joint intervention  I   April 26–27, 2011 9 of 244              think there was some basis for their concerns about the foreign exchange market, but I think the   response of their colleagues was more about solidarity for the courage that they were showing   under extreme circumstances  So under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Geithner and the   other G-7 leaders, we agreed to participate in an intervention   It was a very short time lag; the time between the call when the Japanese made the   request and the actual intervention announcement was less than two hours, so there was really   not time to consult  The amount involved was very small—$500 million from the Fed,   $500 million from the Treasury—with most of the intervention being done by the Bank of Japan    There was no commitment to any additional action, and I don’t expect any, barring some major   unanticipated developments  This appears to have met the criteria set forward by the Committee,   but I wanted just to add that in case there are any questions or comments on that subject   Now let me open the floor for questions for Brian on his presentation or anything on the   foreign exchange market  Any questions?  President Lacker    Thank you  Other questions for Brian?  President Bullard    President Kocherlakota    President Plosser    President Fisher    Thank you  So there are three measures  open market   operations, foreign exchange operations, and the swap agreements   April 26–27, 2011 17 of 244               Thank you  Before we do that, though, let me just make   sure—Governor Duke, did you have a question?    President Lockhart    Any other questions?  [No response]  All right  We have a   motion on all three of these measures  Let’s take them one at a time  Open market operations—  can I have a second?    Any further questions or comments?  [No response]    Without objection  Foreign exchange transactions—second?    Thank you  Any comments or questions?  [No response]    Without objection  And, finally, the renewal of the standing swap agreements with Canada and   Mexico  I need a second   April 26–27, 2011 19 of 244               Thank you  Any objections, comments?  [No response]  All   right  Thank you   Let’s go on, next, to item 2, Strategies for Removing Policy Accommodation  A   memorandum was distributed from the staff on April 19, and we will begin with Bill Nelson   making a presentation  Bill    Thank you  Are there questions for Bill?  Governor   Tarullo    There’s a question from President Lockhart    It would also depend on what expectations were before that   announcement was made  President Plosser    Other questions?    President Hoenig    Other questions?  [No response]  Okay  In a moment we’ll   begin a go-round to hear views on these and other issues  There are some questions that staff   provided just as thought starters, but I’m sure you won’t constrain yourselves necessarily    [Laughter]   April 26–27, 2011 27 of 244              Let me say a word about what I would like to get out of this  I will have to discuss this   with the press tomorrow, and I would like to provide as much information as I can, but no more   than I should  Certainly, what I will say initially will be that we discussed this issue, that a   discussion of the exit process is a separate thing from making the decision to exit, and that it   doesn’t necessarily signal any change in our stance; it’s a separate issue  I want to emphasize the   provisional aspects of this—that, as President Hoenig was suggesting, if conditions were   different than anticipated, we might want to change the timing, pace, and so on  It would depend   on economic conditions, and then our communication will try to provide as much information as   possible about that  Those will be some general points, but beyond that, if I can get from this   discussion some principles—for example, that the interest on excess reserves is the main tool   supported by reserve drains, that the balance sheet will be adjusted in certain ways—those   obviously would be helpful  If not, I will just be more general   One final note on this  The operating framework per se is a big topic and it is not   necessarily part of our discussion today, but it does have some bearing potentially on, for   example, how quickly we reduce the size of the balance sheet  For example, if we want to use a   floor system, we might not need to reduce the balance sheet as quickly  To the extent that the   operating system bears on this issue, you should feel free to bring that up  Again, I’ll be taking   careful notes, and I hope I can come up with some general principles, which I will then review   with you to see if I can get a sense of the Committee from this discussion   Before ending, without trying to preempt the discussion at all, I thought I would make a   couple of observations that I found useful in thinking about this  One is simply that redemptions   are a pretty powerful tool here  If we were to begin redeeming both Treasuries and MBS in   December 2011, as assumed by the Tealbook, that would reduce the size of the balance sheet by   April 26–27, 2011 28 of 244              more than $1 trillion over four years, and we would be back essentially to normal size in four   and a half years  Now, that may be too long for some, but my point is only that that’s the   baseline and that redemptions alone do move us in the right direction relatively quickly  But   obviously some may wish to go more quickly than that  And of course, that doesn’t account for   the need to swap around MBS, Treasuries, and so on to get the composition right   The other observation I had that I found useful in thinking about this is that it’s important   for us to keep in mind that, in a policy sense, the sales and redemptions of assets and the   movements in the interest paid on reserves are substitutes  To the extent that you do more of   one, you have to do less of the other, and as we discuss these policy tools, I think it is important   that we not treat them in some sense as independent; they are part of a unified process   With those preliminary observations, I see President Bullard is first, and we can begin our   go-round    Thank you  President Bullard, I do have a question about   this, which would be very helpful if you would address—one issue about this is the speed  Is   there a speed limit?  If we think that, say, $200 billion of sales is equal to 25 basis points—to   April 26–27, 2011 34 of 244              take a rough example—then if we were doing 25 and 50 basis point equivalent moves, that might   require a very rapid disposition of assets  So, A, there’s the market absorbency issue, but, B, you   talked about politics  If we were to sell assets that quickly, we would be, I think, more likely to   suffer capital losses, which are also not attractive politically  Do you have any concerns about   any speed issues on this approach?    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lacker    The staff can correct me  I believe we’ve viewed   $150 billion to $200 billion of securities in our portfolio as being roughly equivalent to 25 basis   points  Is that about right?    We currently have about 200 basis points’ worth of ease   coming from securities, according to the staff assessment   April 26–27, 2011 36 of 244               Attributable to our excess holdings of securities    Two percentage points    President Plosser    Thank you  President Plosser, I think you did answer this   question, but just so I understand it  If you’re tying interest rates and asset sales, suppose the   Taylor rule says interest rates have to rise by 25 basis points  Presumably, you would then   actually raise it by 12½ basis points, and then—    President Kocherlakota    President Plosser    That is right    And by the same token, if you sell, then you can delay the   increase in the fund rate  I would point out, just as a factual matter, that if we begin a   redemptions process in December of this year, for example, that 200 basis points is going to   shrink away pretty quickly     No  I asked the staff to look at this, and because of the   anticipation of a declining balance sheet, even though they estimate that there is a 200 basis point   effect as of the fourth quarter of 2010, by the fourth quarter of 2012—that is, a year and a half   from now—that would be down to 70 basis points just from redemptions  So that part will get   smaller over time, even if we just do redemptions  And part of that is because it depends not just   on the size, but on the expected path of sales    Okay  Are we ready for President Fisher?  President Fisher    Thank you  President Williams    Just for my notes, you said to begin the redemption process   after raising rates    Okay  It’s 1230 pm  I understand that lunch is ready    Why don’t we recess until 100 pm, bring our lunch back here, and we will still be eating at   100, but we’ll just recommence the meeting at that point  Okay?  Thank you   [Lunch break]   April 26–27, 2011 53 of 244               Okay  Why don’t we recommence our meeting?  We will   continue with President Lacker    You heard it here first  [Laughter]    President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans   April 26–27, 2011 59 of 244               Thank you  President Rosengren    It shows there is constructive ambiguity  [Laughter]    President Lockhart    Thank you  President Hoenig   April 26–27, 2011 66 of 244               Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Okay  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke     Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for a very   useful discussion   In terms of synthesizing [laughter] this discussion, we have a short-term and a long-term   issue  In the weeks ahead as the staff adroitly puts together the minutes, as they always do, I   hope that they will go carefully through the transcript and try to identify the main themes that   will help us think about how we’ll go forward   I have a more immediate problem, which is that tomorrow I’m going to be asked what the   Committee has determined about exit strategy  So I’m going to try to put some principles or   bullet points down here—Debbie is going to write them down for me—and then let me go   through them, and we can decide if some should be struck or qualified or whatever   First is that we had a useful discussion    And second, relating to what Governor Tarullo said, the   most important thing, of course, is to meet our monetary policy objectives, and the pace and   sequencing of our actions will be driven by those objectives  In particular, the fact that we’re   discussing exit does not necessarily carry implications for near-term monetary policy   Now, getting into more substance—first, I think most people were willing to say that they   thought that the federal funds rate/IOER should be the principal tool for responding to   macroeconomic developments  I would add that, as a practical matter and taking into account   President Lacker’s very astute comments, to make IOER effective, it will probably need to be   April 26–27, 2011 84 of 244              supported by the draining tools that we’ve discussed in this room for some time  So I would put   the funds rate /IOER in the center of our strategy   Second, I would say that our forward guidance and our communication will provide as   much warning as possible as we move toward the point where we begin to raise the short-term   interest rate   The remainder of the points, some of which may perhaps be controversial, bear on how   we’re going to deal with the balance sheet  The first one is that I believe that a pretty strong   majority agreed with the view that restarting redemptions—and I wouldn’t be specific about   agencies versus Treasuries, et cetera—could be something that might happen relatively early in   the process  Next—and here I would turn to the three statements on the sheet—one objective we   have is that in the intermediate term we want to return to a normal monetary policy framework  I   don’t think it’s time to start talking to the public about corridors and floors, but maybe a “normal   framework” that I think most people would interpret as something close to a corridor system   The second of these principles is that our exit strategy involves going to an all-Treasury   balance sheet   The third principle bears on the question of the pace and conditionality of asset sales, and   there we got quite a bit of divergence, particularly when weighted by enthusiasm  Now, a   majority of the speakers did prefer a relatively steady pace of sales, although a couple of those   folks were for very rapid sales and others were for more gradual sales, so it’s a little hard to rank   those views  On the other hand, I think most of the people who favored a relatively gradual sales   process were open to the proposition that the pace of sales could be adjusted if macroeconomic   conditions called for it  So I would propose to summarize that detailed discussion with the last   of the three bullet points, which says that there will be a framework that will be “communicated   April 26–27, 2011 85 of 244              to the public in advance, and at a pace that potentially could be adjusted in response to changes   in economic or financial conditions”  I think the “potentially could be adjusted” leans a little bit   toward nonconditionality, but I think it includes the possibility that we can respond and we will   respond if economic conditions warrant   Finally—and this is a difficult one—When will the asset sales take place?  Now, again, in   simple counts, a pretty clear majority, but again with different motivations and different   perspectives, favored asset sales after the increase in the federal funds rate  We had a few people   who suggested a contemporaneous move, such as President Plosser and President Lockhart    President Bullard, of course, made his very interesting intervention about the LIFO principle  A   few people, like President Lacker, wanted to move very quickly, so that, implicitly, sales would   come very early  I think, looking at the balance of the discussion, what I’d like to do is say   something like “most, but not all,” or “many,” or something like that, “saw sales as taking   place,” and I would say here, again, vaguely, “relatively late in the process,” which would   encompass, perhaps, “contemporaneous with the increase in rates,” like President Hoenig   suggested, or “afterward”—but again, acknowledging that some people had a different   perspective   So these would be some interim things that I would try to report, again, as asked  Some   of these details may not come up, but I suspect some of them will    The last point, yes  I’ve got a little diagram here that shows   the interest rate being increased, and then the question is  Where do asset sales come on this   timeline?  I note that a few people were in the contemporaneous camp—and, President Fisher, I   April 26–27, 2011 86 of 244              have you there with an arrow pointed to the left, meaning that you’re happy to go along with the   Bullard perspective  That being said, a pretty significant majority still were on the right side of   that line—that is, suggesting that asset sales should begin after the interest rate increases would   begin, and that’s consistent, I think, with the view that the federal funds rate is the key policy   tool  I think this is an area where there was legitimate and interesting ongoing discussion that we   shouldn’t cut off   Again, what I proposed was to hedge in two ways  One, we would say that “most, but   not all,” or “many,” or something like that, “preferred,” and then to use some term like   “relatively late in the process” to encompass contemporaneous or later sales  This may be even a   little too weak, but that was my thought   I’d be happy to go through any of these again  I don’t promise even that they’ll come out   exactly as I just spoke them  President Plosser    Okay  Well, “at a pace that potentially could be adjusted in   response to changes”    Yes, up or down   April 26–27, 2011 87 of 244               Can I say “after” if I say “many” and I’m very clear that   there’s still an open debate on this question?    Okay  In the sequence we had last year the redemptions   weren’t much of an issue  Now we have redemptions early or one of the first steps  We have   changes in the language, obviously, as one of the first steps  We have in the center of this   process the increase in interest rates supported by draining tools  And then, most, but certainly   not all—and we have an ongoing debate—preferred that the sales begin after the first increase in   the IOER   President Bullard, I know you’re going to be giving your point of view, and I think it’s an   interesting point of view, but I’ll try to make sure that I am clear that these things are not fine   lines    Yes   April 26–27, 2011 88 of 244               Well, it’s true that they both shrink the balance sheet, but   redemptions are predictable, passive, but I agree that there is sort of a LIFO principle there   though    So I agree with that  Any further comments?  Governor   Tarullo    I think I have to balance, as you say  I mean, I can’t go into   too great a detail, but I hardly can deny that we had this conversation because the minutes will   come out and many of these issues will be on the table  President Fisher    On the other hand, the point of this is to be more   transparent and to provide some help and guidance    Well, I obviously won’t be able to answer detailed   questions, because I don’t know the answer    I will try to do that, but I did want to make sure I knew   where we were  [Laughter]  President Lacker    I said I would say that    I will be clear  Where appropriate, I will give a range of   views  I just don’t want to be clearly less forthcoming than the minutes will be on something   like that, if asked  I’m not going to go out and say, “Here’s the deal, guys,” and give them the   story  But if asked about that, I’ll try to convey the sense that there was a range of views   All right  Well, I hope that all the press conferences will not generate this problem, but   thank you for that conversation  Any other comments?  [No response]    Well, wouldn’t this be a great time for a break?  [Laughter]    I’m informed the coffee is at—three o’clock?    All right  My right-hand woman is going to go look  Is it   ready?    We should keep going?  Okay  We can hear the staff   presentation and then at three o’clock we will have a coffee break  So let me turn this over now   to David Wilcox    Thank you  Questions for our colleagues?  President   Fisher    President Lockhart    President Kocherlakota    Other questions?  [No response]  Okay  Seeing none, I   understand now the coffee is ready, so why don’t we take a 20-minute break and be back at   325 pm    [Coffee break]    Okay  Hope that was refreshing  We are ready for our go-  round on the economy, and we’ll start with President Evans     Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lacker    It’ll take five years to get published, though  [Laughter]    President Bullard    Do you want a rebuttal?    President Bullard     Thank you  President Bullard, you raise valid points about   the relationship between core and future headline, but I think the idea that we target core   inflation is kind of old  I think everybody around the table does target forecasted headline   inflation, and I just want to mention that tomorrow in my press conference I will be highlighting   April 26–27, 2011 142 of 244              the projections, and I’ll be focusing entirely on headline inflation, but on the forecast of headline   inflation in the medium term  Your comment about taking core out of the projections is an   interesting one, though  I’ll have to keep that in mind  Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  President Fisher    President Kocherlakota    Governor Raskin    Thank you, and we compliment you on your original   research   I would do a better job of summarizing this conversation if I had overnight to do it If   your patience will last just a minute more, I’ll give my own views on the outlook, and tomorrow   we’ll start with a summary, and then we’ll turn to the policy go-round   I have not a great deal original to say about the real side  I agree that the weakness of the   first quarter is mostly due to temporary factors, much of which should come back  And like the   rest of you, I think a moderate recovery is going to continue as those factors reverse and as the   labor market continues to improve and generate income  We’ve seen some stabilization in the   saving rate, which suggests that as labor income grows along about a 3 percent path,   consumption should also grow  Note has been taken of the industrial sector, which is doing quite   well and is relying to some extent on very strong export demand from emerging markets  As   I’ve said many times before, notwithstanding the positive direction, we are still in a very deep   hole  For example, total hours of work, which is a good summary of labor input given all the   different margins on which labor can be varied, is still about 6 percent below pre-recession   levels, not even taking into account any trend increases in labor supply  Paradoxically though, I   think that actually increases to some extent the projection of near-term economic growth because   there is a little bit of a bounceback effect that you would expect to see after a deep recession   That said, I marked down my outlook for the rest of this year and next year by a few   tenths  We’ve talked a lot about oil and commodity prices  Of course, they’re a drag on growth   as well as a source of inflation  I think there’s also a lot of uncertainty and lack of confidence, at   least on the household side now  There were some striking polls to the effect that   notwithstanding the improvements in the economy, households are very demoralized about the   April 26–27, 2011 162 of 244              near-term economic future  Housing and commercial construction are very weak  Like a   number of people, I’m a bit worried about fiscal drag  Next year we will see, for example, the   end of the payroll tax cut, the end of investment expensing, the end of the grants to states and   localities, the end of the extended unemployment insurance, as well as ongoing phase-out of   fiscal stimulus  And so that’s a pretty powerful drag, and it’s going to take some momentum to   overcome that  And in general, I think the momentum seems just a bit weaker, even if the first   quarter overstates the weakness, than it was at the last meeting   So to summarize, I still expect, broadly speaking, continued recovery at a moderate pace    I marked down my projections just a little bit   There was a lot of discussion today of inflation and of easy monetary policy  And while I   agree with many of the points that were made and I understand the concerns, I’d like to make   just a couple of somewhat countervailing points   It’s true, of course, that headline inflation has increased  As Governor Yellen noted,   quote, “underlying inflation”—and I’ll come back to that—is still quite low  The staff estimate   of the 12-month change in core PCE for this month is still about 09; market-based core is 09    The Dallas trimmed mean PCE is 10, and the core CPI is 12   Now, President Bullard noted concerns with core, and I agree absolutely that what we’re   interested in is headline inflation  But I think if you look into the price index a bit, you’ll see that   a remarkably large amount of the recent inflation we’ve seen actually is attributable to an   increase in essentially one commodity, which is oil  Moreover, there seems to be a good chance   that the increase will be temporary  So, for example, since our January meeting oil prices are up   $27, which is about 30 percent  Other commodities have risen, but much less  For example,   copper is up 3 percent during that period, wheat is up about 3 percent, corn is up about 15   April 26–27, 2011 163 of 244              percent, but sugar has declined fairly significantly  Oil really stands out as being the commodity   that has increased very significantly  And oil by itself is actually a big source of the pickup in   headline inflation  For example, if you look at PCE inflation and don’t take out energy or food,   rather just take out gasoline and fuel oil, then three-month PCE inflation drops from 456 to 239,   and the six-month change drops from 333 to 145  So that one very narrow product category is a   big part of the pickup that we’ve seen recently   I think there’s a case, as we explain to our students, that this is a relative price increase    We know some very explicit reasons why oil prices have gone up, why demand has increased   and supply has fallen  Of course, the dollar has also fallen, and there are a number of factors   involved  I think arguably that the relative price effects that we don’t have much control over are   certainly part of that phenomenon, and we know how to address that   I mention that this is seen as temporary  We all have concerns about futures markets and   so on, but it is striking that as oil prices have risen $27 since January, the far future oil prices   have risen $750  There really is a pretty strong presumption in the markets that this oil price   level will be reversed, and you can see the reason, which is that the problems in the Middle East   and North Africa presumably at some point will be reversed  So I just raise that point  It doesn’t   invalidate the concerns about pass-through or about inflation expectations, any of those things    But I think at least the initial shock here is not really entirely monetary  I think there are some   real factors going on   The other theme I heard around the table was about how incredibly easy monetary policy   is, and of course, it is easy, but when judging the stance of monetary policy, everything should   be conditional on the state of the economy  The question we want to ask is, “Is the monetary   policy appropriate for the economy?” and not “Is it easy or tight in some absolute sense?”  In this   April 26–27, 2011 164 of 244              respect, I was very pleased to see President Kocherlakota’s analysis using Taylor rules, which   gives you a way of thinking about whether interest rates are about where they should be or not    Now, when I worked with his memo, as I will explain, initially I ended up disagreeing with it,   but then I did some more work and I ended up agreeing with it  So let me just tell you my   thought process, but I think it’s also instructive for thinking about the state of policy and thinking   about where we likely should go over the next year or two   The underlying assumption in Narayana’s memo is that he uses a Taylor (1999) rule,   which has a 10 coefficient on the output gap  In order to create a baseline, he assumes that in   the fourth quarter of last year we were more or less at the right place as far as accommodation is   concerned  I asked the staff to give me their view, based on their assessments of the output gap,   et cetera, and their calculations showed that based on the same Taylor rule and despite the fact   that we were near zero, of course, monetary policy in the fourth quarter of 2010 was still   200 basis points tighter than the Taylor (1999) rule would suggest   Regarding that gap—and I’m sure Narayana would fully understand it—50 basis points   of it came from what I’ll call the LSAP adjustment  In particular, Narayana assumed 250 basis   points of ease coming from our securities purchases  The staff, particularly Dave Reifschneider,   who was responsible for all of these estimates, suggests that the number in 2010Q4 was closer   to 200 basis points, a 50 basis point difference  Obviously that’s false precision, but the   200 basis point number was based on more detail about the expected exit strategy in terms of   redemptions and sales  So that’s 50 basis points  The rest of it comes from differences in output   gap estimates; as Narayana pointed out, a lower output gap obviously gives you a higher desired   interest rate   April 26–27, 2011 165 of 244              Rather than try to adjudicate that difference, I just went ahead and, taking the projections   that we now have, I tried to ask  What does Taylor (1999) tell us about where policy should be?    In order to look forward instead of backward, I looked at the fourth quarter of this year, 2011,   and the fourth quarter of next year, 2012, and that gives you some sense of what the model is   saying in terms of our likely trajectory   First of all, I had to figure out the output gap  My first stab was to take the middle of the   central tendency of our projections for the fourth quarter of this year, which was 855, and to   subtract from that the middle of our long-run NAIRU estimates, which is 54  That gave me 315   as the unemployment gap  I multiplied that by 2 to get 63 percent as the output gap  Thinking   about it now, if you use that, of course, you get very easy policy recommendations and using that   kind of approach suggests that we should still have zero interest rates at the end of 2012  In   thinking about that, I recognize that an objection to that would be that we should probably be   using a higher unemployment rate and higher NAIRU reflecting unemployment insurance and   some temporary factors and so on  So I replaced the 54 percent with 6 percent, which is the   staff’s current temporary level of the NAIRU  That gives me an output gap of 51 percent in the   fourth quarter of this year, which is essentially the same as where the staff is  They estimate   50 percent  So that’s a simple estimate of the gap   With respect to inflation, I stayed away from core, and what I said was  Let’s look at the   forecast for the following year  What is the forecast for 2012?  The middle of the central   tendency of the total PCE inflation forecast for this Committee was 16 for 2012  That’s higher   than the core inflation estimates either by the Committee or by the staff, so I used that  It’s a   more conservative number  And I used a goal of 2 for the inflation target   April 26–27, 2011 166 of 244              An important observation here—and this came up in my earlier exchange with President   Plosser—is that what I call the LSAP adjustment, which is the additional easing being created by   our securities purchases, is going to be waning over time under the baseline Tealbook   assumption that we begin redeeming securities at the end of 2011 and then have slow sales later   on  You have to take that into account, and in particular, when you do that, the LSAP effect for   the fourth quarter of this year is down from 200 to 120 basis points   Put that all together, Taylor (1999) suggests that the correct level of the funds rate,   inclusive of all securities purchases, for the fourth quarter of this year is minus 50 basis points    If you do the same analysis for the fourth quarter of 2012, the LSAP correction becomes 70 basis   points  Again, using 6 percent as the NAIRU, what you get for the end of next year is plus   55 basis points   What this particular guideline—which is, I think, a fairly reasonable framework for   thinking about policy—tells us is qualitatively pretty similar to what Narayana found, which is   that somewhere early in 2012 we should probably be raising interest rates above zero according   to this particular calculation  I’ll come back to weaknesses in just a second  I think it’s striking   that this is actually very close to what the markets are currently expecting; the markets now   expect basically a 37 basis point funds rate in May and a 90 basis point funds rate in   November—pretty close to what I found  So our policy is easy, but at least by one metric, it isn’t   inappropriate, given the state of our economy   Now, having said all that, I really do not feel sympathetic to John Taylor’s recent view   that we should, more or less, just follow the rule and ignore all other considerations  I think   that’s probably not the right way to make monetary policy, and so let me just mention a few   issues  One is that, of course, you might ask, well, why Taylor (1999)  Why not Taylor (1993),   April 26–27, 2011 167 of 244              which has a somewhat smaller coefficient on the output gap?  I think it’s important to note that   both of those rules do give you the same long-run results  They both give you 2 percent inflation   in the long term; they both give you U equals U* in the long term  The difference is where you   are in the Taylor curve  And essentially, what that says is that, if you use Taylor (1999), you are   willing to accept a little more volatility in inflation over time in order to smooth out the business   cycle just a bit  It’s not an issue of allowing a higher inflation target   The question then might be  What has the Fed actually done?  If you look at rolling   regressions that try to estimate the Taylor rule for the Fed, the current estimates of the long-run   coefficients are 094 for the output gap and 173 for inflation, which is almost exactly the 1999   Taylor rule, and you get the same results if you use the data before 2001; it’s not just a product   of the 2001–03 period  One other observation is that this does assume a pretty strong effect for   LSAPs  So if you actually don’t think LSAPs were very effective, then you need to be a lot   more dovish than you are now, because you’re taking away a couple hundred basis points of   effective ease   Of course, one of the reasons that you wouldn’t want to use a Taylor rule without some   additional insight is that, of course, it’s way too simple, and I have a long list of objections here    Let me just mention one that this Committee is very concerned about  Taylor rules have nothing   in them, as we mentioned today, related to inflation expectations and they have nothing in them   related to asset price bubbles  When you see things like that, you to want to be a little bit more   restrictive   Again, I think we have to watch out for those things  I think we do have to look at what’s   going on in the economy and use our judgment, but I just want to push back a little bit on the   view that monetary policy is radically easy and that we need to waste no time moving—you   April 26–27, 2011 168 of 244              know, by 8 o’clock tonight, we should basically have the funds rate up to 100 basis points  It’s   true that monetary policy is easy in an absolute sense, but relative to where the economy is, a   standard analysis suggests that we are not particularly inappropriate and that, indeed, easy policy   would be justified for some time to come   Again, let me just end by saying two things  One is that I don’t believe in simple rules as   superseding thought, and I think we do have to consider issues like the ones that President   Hoenig has raised, for example  And the other is, again, to thank Narayana for bringing this into   the conversation  We will be making a lot more progress if we think quantitatively about when   we should move, what conditions should cause us to move, and how easy or tight monetary   policy ought to be   Okay  Thank you very much  I understand that a reception is just now beginning for ex-  Governor Warsh, followed by dinner  If you have any changes in your projections, please   provide them as soon as possible  We will be reconvening at 830 tomorrow morning  Thank   you   [Meeting recessed]      April 26–27, 2011 169 of 244              April 27 Session    Good morning, everybody  I’m going to start the meeting   today by completing the go-round from yesterday  I’ll give you my quick summary of the   discussion on the economy   As a diversion while we’re doing that, we’re going to have some photos taken  We’ve   learned that photos not taken during the meeting have much jollification going on    Well, act your usual spiteful selves  [Laughter]  Okay  So   again, thank you for the useful go-round yesterday   Participants generally see the continuation of a moderate recovery, strengthening   somewhat over time, notwithstanding a surprisingly weak first quarter and some ongoing   headwinds  Businesses remain relatively optimistic, although they remain concerned about the   effects of higher commodity prices both in their own costs and on the buying power of   consumers  The labor market is somewhat stronger, with payrolls and vacancies up and   unemployment down  State and local fiscal contraction and possibly future federal fiscal   consolidation are shaping up to be a possible drag on growth  The debt limit also poses some   financial risk  International factors are affecting the US economy, including disruptions in the   Middle East and North Africa, which, together with a lack of compensating production by Saudi   Arabia, are affecting oil prices; the impact of the Japanese disaster on supply chains; and higher   inflation and wage costs in emerging markets  Europe is still grappling with sovereign debt   problems  Oil prices are a particularly important downside risk for growth, although the level of   oil prices does not yet qualify as a Hamilton shock  On net, the risks to economic growth seem   roughly balanced  On the inflation front, increases in food and especially energy prices have led   April 26–27, 2011 170 of 244              to a recent acceleration  In light of uncertainties, both about how commodity prices will behave   and the extent of potential pass-through to other prices, inflation risks seem to the upside   Consumers are in a negative mood—a crisis of confidence?—with higher gas and food   prices offsetting the payroll tax cut  However, growth in consumer spending remains moderate,   and retailers in some areas are seeing increased sales and traffic  Labor market conditions are   mixed  Hiring is weak, though firms may be forced into the labor market as they reach the end   of productivity gains  There are upside wage pressures for a few specialized types of workers    On the other hand, there may be significant disguised unemployment, and fieldwork suggests   that many of the unemployed see very little prospect for reemployment at a job comparable to   the one that they had before  Housing remains generally distressed, with prices flat to down,   though sales volume and traffic were reported higher in a few areas   For the most part, as noted, businesses continue to show confidence in the recovery    Investment in equipment and software is up  Many producers are facing powerful cost pressures,   some of which they have already, or plan to, pass on to consumers  They have little fat in their   operations, so that passing through cost increases is the only way to protect margins  Among key   sectors, manufacturing, energy, agriculture, transportation and logistics, and tourism were   reported strong  Manufacturers in particular are upbeat, except that some auto producers are   having difficulty obtaining parts normally produced in Japan   Financial conditions have improved a bit further  Earnings are strong, and equities are   doing well  Banks are seeing better credit quality but are concerned about top-line revenues    Loans to small businesses are up, and there is substantial competition among banks to make C&I   loans  Risks to financial stability exist, including greater leverage and risk-taking in areas such   as leveraged loans and land acquisition  Excess liquidity may be a source of this problem   April 26–27, 2011 171 of 244              As noted, inflation has risen very significantly in recent months primarily because of   energy prices and, to a lesser extent, to other commodity prices  Underlying inflation measures   remain low, however  The degree of pass-through into underlying inflation measures for   commodity costs will be an important variable to watch, as many firms report that they believe at   least some of their cost increases can be passed on  For example, prices-received indexes are up    Some participants supported—and presented econometric evidence for—the view that ongoing   slack in labor markets has restrained wages and unit labor costs, limiting second-round effects   and likely causing the inflation bulge to be temporary  Inflation expectations by some measures   are up a bit  Forward inflation breakevens have increased somewhat to levels near the top of   recent ranges by some measures, although the Cleveland expectations measure remains below   2 percent  Public attention to inflation has increased, which may give firms “cover” to pass on   costs  The lack of theory on how monetary policy should respond to inflation expectations is an   important gap  The increase in inflation will in the end be transitory if commodity prices   stabilize and pass-through is limited  However, close monitoring of inflation and inflation   expectations is essential to prevent any more lasting pickup in the rate of price increases   So that’s my summary  Any comments?  [No response]  Seeing no comments, before we   go on to the policy round, David Wilcox, I believe you have some data to report    Thank you  Any questions?  [No response]  All right  Then   we’re ready to go to our monetary policy go-round, and I’ll call on Bill English to start us off   April 26–27, 2011 172 of 244               Thank you very much  Are there questions for Bill?    President Evans    I think we’re anticipating the discussion  The origin of this   change was actually President Lacker’s memo, which was circulated  And yes, again, “inflation”   is intended here as headline inflation, as distinguished from underlying, and President Lacker’s   memo made the point that, instead of talking about the general term in the context of price   stability, we could talk about the desire to have overall inflation come back down to what we   think is the appropriate level  But this is obviously open to discussion in the go-round  So why   don’t we just do it in that context?     Any other questions for Bill?  [No response]  All right  If not, President Williams, you’re   first    Thank you very much  President Lacker    Thank you  President Rosengren   April 26–27, 2011 178 of 244               Okay  President Kocherlakota    President Lacker    I don’t want to interject, but it may help a little bit to know   that in my remarks to the media later today, I’m going to be focusing very much on the   projections, including the near-term projections vis-à-vis the longer-term objectives of the   Committee, so I think there will be more opportunity to explain this particular configuration than   would otherwise be the case  That’s a central goal of my presentation  President Hoenig    President Kocherlakota      Thank you  There have been several good suggestions   about how we might change the projections, and I’m sure the Subcommittee will be eager to dig   into those    Yet another possible suggestion, of course, is to project the   funds rate itself    President Hoenig    Thank you  President Plosser    And that indicators of what remain subdued, at the end?    Sorry    That’s fair  We have a lot of work to do, I think  Your   particular suggestion is very interesting, but it would also require work in the second paragraph,   too    Right  Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you, President Bullard  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans    President Bullard    Okay  Thank you  President Lacker, you’ve got a two-  hander?    Okay  President Lockhart    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you very much  Let me try to start by saying   something about policy, then turn to general issues of communication, and then we’ll try to   wordsmith the statement a little bit   We are in good time here, so—not that I’m going to tempt everybody to turn into   E B White [laughter], but anyway   The big policy action that’s being proposed under alternative B is to announce the end of   what to my distaste, but nevertheless unavoidably, is now known as QE2  There have been some   postmortems of this already in the media  My own view—and I appreciated President Bullard’s   comments on this yesterday—is that the program was reasonably successful  It was undertaken   at a time when we were concerned about the sustainability of the recovery  It was not clear that   growth was sufficient to reduce unemployment, and deflation risk, although not high,   nevertheless was building as core measures fell below 1 percent, and at that point, of course,   headline and core were pretty close  What our policy did was clearly demonstrate that we can   affect financial conditions even though the zero lower bound is binding; that’s intellectually a   historically important development to show to be the case  I think there’s little doubt of that   even among the skeptics  In addition, the forecasts and outlooks between August and January   April 26–27, 2011 207 of 244              generally improved, and in particular, of course, deflation risk is largely gone and the recovery   seems self-sustaining  That has been slowed a bit lately by the oil price increases  As I argued   yesterday, I don’t think that’s really due to QE2, although some others might disagree, but again,   I think that it’s been generally a successful exercise   Some of the commentary that claims otherwise, I think, does so only because it seems to   assume that we somehow claimed that this was going to be a panacea, that it was going to solve   all of our deep economic problems  We never made any such claim  At one point we published   work that said it would cause 700,000 additional jobs, or about 30,000 a month, which is hardly   a game changer, but certainly something that, at least at the time, most of us thought was worth   doing  I’m sure there’s some rationalization here, but in my own view, it was the right thing to   do, and it was a very important experiment  I would like to complete it both because I think it is   needed substantively and because I don’t like the signal that not completing it would send   Going forward, as some have noted, further actions of this type would have to meet a   very high bar  In particular, I think we’d need to be looking again at real concerns about the   sustainability of the recovery and about deflation; slow recovery, for example, is not going to be   sufficient  Of course, if further stimulus is needed, we could reconsider alternative measures,   such as changes in language and so on, but let’s leave that for the future  My modal forecast at   this point is that we will go on hold for a short period, at least, to see what’s happening, and if   things go as I hope they will and as we all hope they will, we can begin a process of gradual exit   through many of the steps that were outlined in the various discussions yesterday  But we’ll see,   of course, as always  Policies always stay contingent and provisional   I’ll just say one word about President Bullard’s useful interjection about Ss rules    There’s always some degree of that in Committee discussions  In particular, another example is   April 26–27, 2011 208 of 244              the fact that we always move in 25 basis point increments; we don’t move in 10 basis point   increments  In my view, part of the reason why that doesn’t constrain our ability to respond   continuously is because our language and our signals do allow for some variation in effective   tightness by changing expectations in markets  But I agree that we certainly want the markets to   respond in a way that is consistent with the incoming news flow   Let me just say a word about communication  There have been a number of really good   issues raised  First, in terms of general framework, I think we basically have a framework  I   think a lot of it was expressed in the document that President Plosser and his group put together   in their discussion of numerical inflation objectives  It’s pretty much a modern centrist   macroeconomic framework  But it’s also true that in terms of our language, between   “underlying” and “overlying” and “temporary” and “permanent” and everything else, that we are   getting so deep into the code words that we need Alan Turing and the Enigma machine to figure   some of it out  [Laughter]   Now, I’m very flattered about all the comments you made about how my press   conference in 30 minutes is going to clarify all these matters [laughter] and straighten everybody   out, and I will do my very best, I promise  I do think that the press conference over time, in   conjunction with the evolution of our language, will be an important adjunct and will allow us to   clarify and be more explicit about the framework, about the role of the numerical objective,   about the role of short term versus long term, about inflation forecasts, and the like  But I think   that we do need—and I charge Bill English and others with this—as we move even toward the   next statement, to step back a little bit and try to clarify our framework, make it a little sharper so   that we can link it up to the language in a more transparent way  Again, a number of other useful   suggestions about communications were raised today and yesterday  I think that taking core   April 26–27, 2011 209 of 244              inflation out of the projections is something we should discuss  It would send a very strong   signal, and it’s not evident what role it’s playing at this point if we have our explicit forecasts   As I said yesterday in response to President Bullard, future headline inflation is our   objective, and I don’t think anyone doubts that  I think many of the critics either don’t   understand or don’t want to understand what the role of core inflation is  It’s just simply an   intermediate indicator or a forecasting device  At the same time, as we discussed the projections,   additional good suggestions were made; one was that if we can do it in a way that would not be   confusing, given the many dimensions of the balance sheet, maybe we could begin to provide   some information on our balance sheet expectations or on our policy rate expectations  This is   not something I necessarily advocate doing in the next six weeks because it’s complex and   there’s not a whole lot of international experience to draw on, but I think we should be thinking   about that   I have one other suggestion to make, and I’ve thought about this for almost 15 minutes   now  [Laughter]  President Kocherlakota made a very good point, which is that because the   amount of effective stimulus does depend on expectations about how the balance sheet is going   to evolve, and given the novelty of this particular tool, it would be very useful if we could   provide more information to the public about how that’s going to happen  We certainly have had   some very good discussions  I think there are some areas where a majority of the Committee is   in one place or another, but maybe we could begin a process of trying to put together a white   paper or something like one that we would approve and release, that would say whatever it is we   can agree on, and would try to provide at least some guidance to the public about how this   process is going to unfold  Now, as I said, I’ve thought about this for 15 minutes, and I’m sure   the staff are all canceling their vacations as I speak [laughter], but it would be good, I think, if we   April 26–27, 2011 210 of 244              could try to come up with something as a group  Of course, the trouble with these open   discussions is that while they’re extremely informative, at some point, obviously, we’re going to   have to make choices, and it would be good if we could figure out exactly what it is we agree on,   where we don’t agree, and how are we going to decide  So that might be one way forward  At a   minimum, we should try to go back and summarize what was learned in the discussion   yesterday—in the Tealbook, in the minutes, and elsewhere—to try to lay out those points  I   think we have a lot of work to do in strengthening our framework and our communication  Press   conferences are an opportunity, but they are not by themselves going to be sufficient, so I hear   that loud and clear  Particularly at this critical stage, I think we need to keep thinking about that   All right  Now, as usual, I’m trying to keep track of some of the various issues  I think   there was broad support for alternative B for various reasons  If I’m not mistaken, I think there   are really only two questions that we need to decide  The first has to do with the characterization   of inflation expectations in the last sentence of alternative B, paragraph 1, whether or not they   remain “generally” stable  I think I’ve heard three possibilities here  One is just to stay where   we are and say that it remains stable  I personally have a mild preference for that because I don’t   think there’s much evidence of any kind of significant change in inflation expectations  Now,   Bill will argue that if you add up enough small changes, you get a significant change, so I’m   basically open to whatever the Committee wants to do  Again, I have a slight preference not to   change the language because it will create knock-on effects in the “extended period” language,   and so on  But if we decide to change it, two suggestions have been made  One is to add the   word “generally,” and the other, from President Plosser, was to say something like, “inflation   expectations have remained,” and I would say, “within recent normal ranges”  President Plosser,   I would take that part  I would discourage the second part, although I think it’s very useful,   April 26–27, 2011 211 of 244              about “medium term” because we then have the same issue in the second paragraph, and we   would have to restructure the whole thing  I’d like to propose that we just systematically try to   create a vocabulary that encompasses all of the various concepts that we have for inflation, but I   don’t want to do that on the fly  So question number one is how to characterize inflation   expectations in paragraph 1   Question number two has to do with the changes in paragraph 2  There are two changes   here  The first one says, “Increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed   up inflation in recent months”  Frankly, I think if we just have that change, and if we decide to   eliminate the second one just for the moment—again, I’m open to discussion—but because our   previous statement said, “are currently putting upward pressure on inflation,” unmodified, I’m   not quite sure why a change is needed  Once you start talking about the decline in inflation, et   cetera, then it’s becoming more complicated  One option, which I think I heard at least a   plurality favor, was just to keep the first and drop the second, returning to the old language in the   last sentence  The other alternative I guess I would propose would be to accept both changes and   maybe to put in “headline inflation” in both places    I don’t want to complicate it further, but you could say,   “gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization and to levels of inflation consistent with   April 26–27, 2011 212 of 244              the Federal Reserve’s mandate,” without getting into ups and downs  That would be another   way to do it    Okay  I withdraw that then  All right  So those are two   questions  I’m going to take a straw vote on both of these in just a minute, but does anyone want   to make a further comment—let’s start with the first one, on inflation expectations?    President Plosser    Okay  Well, again, certainly the staff, Bill and others, hear   that  Point taken  President Lacker    I think that’s a perfectly viable option, as long as we put in   “headline”    Yes, “overall” would actually be even better, I think  Vice   Chairman    Yes, that’s true  President Kocherlakota    All right  Okay  President Lacker, would you be okay for   this meeting to restore the ambiguity of “in a context of price stability?”    Thank you  That’s with the understanding that this is not a   satisfactory situation  I think President Kocherlakota’s point about starting to throw in   “headline,” adding yet another term, is going to be an issue  So I’m perfectly okay with “pushed   up inflation in recent months” because I think that’s accurate, if that’s okay with everybody   All right  Let’s restore the last sentence of alternative B, paragraph 2, and keep the   change “have pushed up inflation,” not “headline inflation”—“have pushed up inflation in recent   months”   So then our remaining question is about inflation expectations  Let me just see first if   there’s a plurality to leave it where it is, and if there isn’t—let’s vote the following way  Change   or no change, and then if there’s a change, we’ll figure out which change is better  President   Plosser?   April 26–27, 2011 215 of 244               Yes    That’s a little anxiety producing    All right  In the interest of coffee, I’m now going to ask   how many people would like to just leave the characterization of inflation expectations as   “remained stable,” and how many would like to consider an alternative  How many would like   to say “remained stable”?  [Show of hands]    Okay  Well, ten is a majority, so we’ll just keep that   language  Any other comments or questions?  [No response]    Okay  Again, I thank you for both your input and your   willingness to work flexibly with the Committee  We’re ready for a vote  Debbie    Shouldn’t we make the last sentence identical to the   previous statement?   April 26–27, 2011 216 of 244               Thank you very much  We are very efficient  The next   meeting is June 21 and 22  As you know, the press conference is at 215 pm  If anyone is here   and wants to see it, there will be a screening available in the Special Library across the hall   In a moment I will call the end of the meeting and then have coffee, and for those who   would stay, Linda Robertson will present a congressional update—optional  And now we are   still having lunch, I guess?    Okay  At 1130, for those who would like to have lunch;   don’t ever tell me that there’s no such thing as a free lunch  All right  The meeting is adjourned    Coffee for 20 minutes, and then those who want to hear an update on congressional   developments, please come back to the table   END OF MEETING   April 26–27, 2011 217 of 244     "
9222,2011-06-21,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Because this is a joint FOMC–  Board meeting, I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you  We are starting very early, and I thank you for   arranging your schedules that way  We have an awful lot to accomplish today, and I would   certainly like to get to the end of the economic go-round  So let me just ask everyone, where   possible, to be succinct and to be aware of the time   That being said, I would first like to take a minute to note that, with high probability, this   will be the last meeting for Dave Stockton before he ambles off into the sunset  [Laughter]    Dave joined the Federal Reserve in 1981 as the inflation specialist in the section that was known   as Wages, Prices, and Productivity  That year, the CPI clocked in at about 10 percent    [Laughter]  However, after ’81, of course, it began to come down very steadily  After   successfully bringing inflation under control, Dave rose rapidly through the ranks and was   appointed division director in 2000  In all, he has attended 170 FOMC meetings, including 84 as   division director and FOMC economist  At his first meeting back in November ’85, he delivered   a lengthy presentation to Chairman Volcker and the rest of the Committee on the effect of dollar   depreciation on the US economy  They must have liked it, because they invited him back   almost immediately  As far as the macroeconomics is concerned, perhaps it will suffice for   today simply to note that Dave’s time as director included both the last years of the Great   Moderation and the period that I am confident will become known as the Great Immoderation    [Laughter]  Economic historians will puzzle for years over Dave’s role in all of that  [Laughter]    June 21–22, 2011 4 of 282              Dave has given us the benefit of his keen insight as a macroeconomist, his unparalleled grasp of   the inflation mechanism in the United States, and the hallmark of his time here, the wit and   humility in which he has wrapped it all  Never before has the owner of the staff forecast   compared its shelf life unfavorably to that of a jar of mayonnaise in the Mojave Desert    [Laughter]  So, Dave, on behalf of the Board and the Committee, we want to thank you for a job   exceedingly well done  Thank you  [Applause]   Our first item today is our special topic on DSGE models, and I will call in just a moment   on Michael Dotsey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank  He will be supported by Marco   Del Negro from New York, Jeff Campbell from Chicago, and J P Laforte from the Board  I   really appreciated the summary memo and the background papers that we got; a lot of care went   into trying to make this intelligible and understandable to everybody  And it was a great   example of the collaborative effort between Board researchers and Reserve Bank researchers  So   let me turn to Michael    Thank you very much, again, for the collaborative work   that you have done  I think it is very encouraging that staff is trying to introduce new research   developments, at the same time maintaining an eclectic and broad-based approach to forecasting   and analysis  A particular advantage of these models, as you point out, is that they give you an   opportunity to create stories that are economically well-grounded  They also let you look at   policy analysis in a way that will take into account the potential behavioral responses to changes   in policy regimes  Those things are very useful, and I commend the staff for doing this work  I   think it is an important part of our collective progress in analyzing the economy   Let me kick off the Q&A round and ask whether the concept of a utilization rate ever   appears in these models  For example, in housing, we would think that the notion of vacancies   affects the marginal product of constructing a new house  In both capital and labor, you would   think that utilization would be relevant  Because that requires departing from a truly neoclassical   kind of production function and allowing for perhaps some fixed coefficients, it may not be   feasible, but I am just curious if thought has been given to that    Okay  Thank you  Any other questions?  Vice Chairman    President Williams    Governor Yellen    President Kocherlakota      President Bullard    President Evans    Other questions?  President Lacker    President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Plosser    Any other questions?  [No response]  Let me again thank   you for this effort  And just for the record, note—as President Kocherlakota did—that this   presentation was just the tip of the iceberg  There’s a lot of background material, and a number   of members of this Committee were specially briefed, so it was a very substantive educational   process  Thank you for that   Item two on our agenda is called “Refining the Exit Strategy,” and let me explain what   we have in mind here  In April we had a very good discussion of the substance of the issues   surrounding our exit strategy  Let me just say as clearly as I can that we do not want to repeat   that entire discussion today  We’ve already done that work, and time will simply not permit it   What motivates this, from my perspective, is really two things  The first is that our   discussion last time took the form of people saying what their first-best preference was on each   dimension of the exit strategy  What we didn’t get was the sense of whether or not there was a   modal strategy that most people, in the interest of comity, communication, clarity, and so on,   would be willing to accept even if it were not their first best  So I just wanted to probe a little bit   to see if it’s possible for us to come to something closer to a consensus  Perhaps it’s not, but it   would be worth knowing that  The second motivation is communication  I have, of course,   June 21–22, 2011 29 of 282              another press conference tomorrow and then the Monetary Policy testimony in a few weeks    Even if I don’t take the opportunity to actually talk about the exit strategy, I’m almost certain to   be asked about it  Because I’m going to have to say something, I’d be much more comfortable if   what I was saying was consistent with as broad a group within the Committee as possible   The staff, using the minutes and input from the Committee, created a set of general exit   strategy principles—broad, high-level principles2  What I’d like principally to do today is to   have a go-round and ask people  Are you broadly comfortable with this approach?  Are there   things that you’re not completely comfortable with, but that you’re willing, nevertheless, to   accept for the purpose of trying to create a consensus?  Or are there one or two items that you   want to point to that make it really impossible for you to support some kind of consensus   document?  Based on what happens in our quick discussion, I think there are several   possibilities  If a very strong majority of the participants—and I think participants should be the   relevant voting group here, because this is a multiyear plan—say, 14 or 15 of the members and   participants around the table, were willing to accept something like these principles, then we   could note in the minutes that there’s a significant degree of consensus  I would ask you at the   end if you want to actually reproduce this document in the minutes or simply want to have a   broader description of it  On the other end is the possibility—and probably a very likely   possibility—that there is significant disagreement, in which case I would suggest that we just   briefly say in the minutes that there was further discussion, and try to summarize what the points   of agreement and disagreement are very briefly  We would want to be brief—because we want   to be careful not to emphasize an exit discussion at this moment because, of course, we have not   yet taken any decision to actually begin an exit  I hope we can respect the limit of an hour for                                                     2 The materials for the discussion of exit strategy principles are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   June 21–22, 2011 30 of 282              this item, which means that when we ask you to speak in the go-round, I hope you’ll try to keep   your comments to about two minutes or less   Now, before we have that go-round, there are a couple of items on the set of principles   that we probably should resolve before we go around the table  If you look at your handout,   you’ll see three things highlighted in red  The middle one, which says, “During the   normalization process,” was a suggestion by President Plosser, which I think is not at all   substantive but simply tries to make it a little bit more clear exactly what was intended  So if   there are no objections, I would take that change as just given   There are two more-substantive issues, though  The one I want to address first is in   paragraph 6  We circulated a document indicating that the ultimate goal of the exit is to return to   a system in which conventional open market operations are used to keep the federal funds rate   near its target, which I think very strongly suggests a system similar to what we had before the   advent of unusual measures  President Plosser, in a memo that was posted on SDS, suggested   being more explicit about our preference for a corridor system at the end of this process  As a   result, in paragraph 6, there are two alternatives  One is the original language “near its target,”   and the other is the federal funds rate “within a corridor,” and so on  What I’m going to do is to   ask President Plosser and the Vice Chairman, in either order, to take a couple of minutes to   explain their preferences  Then what I’d like to do, if the Committee is agreeable, is to take a   quick straw vote; whichever approach gathers a majority—and abstentions are fine—is the one   we’ll use as the basis for our statement  A second suggestion was made by President   Kocherlakota and distributed to the Committee  He suggested language in paragraph 4 to make   more explicit the length of time between the change in our extended period guidance and the   likely first increase in the federal funds rate  He suggests that we use three to six months, or I   June 21–22, 2011 31 of 282              guess you could say two to four meetings, as the measure  After we look at the first issue, I’ll   ask President Kocherlakota to say a word about this, and we’ll likewise see what the   Committee’s preference is  At that point, again, I hope very crisply, we’ll go around the table to   see to what extent people are comfortable with this broad approach, and if they are not   comfortable, if they could give an indication of what elements are, for them, deal killers   I hope we can make this work  I reserve the right at any time to call a coffee break and   pretend it never happened  [Laughter]  All right  The first issue is the question of whether or not   we explicitly refer to a corridor  President Plosser, would you want to go first?    Thank you, President Plosser  Vice Chairman    Okay  Thank you very much, both of you, for very cogent   arguments  Also, I should say that the Vice Chairman and President Plosser have both said that   they are prepared to live with, or are prepared to accept, whatever the Committee decides  Are   there any pressing questions for either the Vice Chairman or President Plosser?  [No response]    All right  What I would like to do now is take a straw vote on this particular item, and   abstentions are okay  This is for all participants  How many would like to keep the language   where it is and say “the federal funds rate near its target” through open market operations, but   exclude specific reference to a corridor system?    President Lacker    All right  Let’s firm up the language  It was, “and the   associated quantity of bank reserves are expected to be reduced to levels”—“the smallest levels   consistent with the efficient implementation   ”?    All right  I’ll come back to that in just a second  I’m aware   of Arrow’s voting paradoxes and all that  [Laughter]  So what I would like to do is the   following  I’m going to ask for a straw vote on the original two propositions, and then we’ll take   the winner and ask if we would like to compare it with this alternative language  President   Bullard   June 21–22, 2011 39 of 282               I knew this was going to happen  [Laughter]  The efficient   implementation of monetary policy suggests that if there are substantial benefits from a floor   system in payments and in reducing volatility and so on, then the smallest balance sheet would   be consistent with a floor system   All right  Debbie, will you help me count?  Those in favor of the original language    “near its target,” without referring to a corridor system?  [Show of hands]  Okay  So the majority   are in favor of that   Then, we want to compare that with the following language  “The associated quantity of   bank reserves are expected to be reduced to the smallest levels that would be consistent with the   efficient implementation of monetary policy”    It leaves the possibilities open  On the one hand it says that   if we were to go to a floor system, we would have the smallest balance sheet that would allow   that system to work properly  But “efficient implementation” means that we would have to   judge that that smallest balance sheet version of the floor system is effective in maintaining the   funds rate near the target, minimizing volatility, and achieving collateral benefits like improved   payment systems and the like   All right  Who favors the change that I just described  “reduced to the smallest levels   that would be consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy”?  Can I see   June 21–22, 2011 40 of 282              hands, please?  [Show of hands]  Okay  I guess that’s going to be a compromise  President   Fisher     Absolutely not  In fact, my own personal view is that it’s   likely the preferred system    President Kocherlakota, a word on your amendments?    Okay  Is there anyone who, conditional on making this   change, would prefer a different time than three to six months?  Governor Yellen    Conditional on making the change    Pretty substantively different  Vice Chairman    We don’t need to have a complete debate about it    [Laughter]  Give us a chance to vote   June 21–22, 2011 42 of 282               It does say “anticipates”  But that’s fine  By the way,   when asked about this, without a great deal of forethought, in my press conference in April, I   said “a couple of meetings,” which is about three months, but it could be more, obviously    Governor Raskin    I understand that point, but “probably within a few months”   is likely shorter than most people would want to say   June 21–22, 2011 43 of 282               Okay  President Fisher    Well, that’s the status quo, basically  Let me take President   Rosengren and President Bullard, if I could ask your indulgence, and then we could go to the   vote  President Rosengren    President Bullard    Okay  Let’s go to a straw vote  How many would like to   retain the existing language, which says, “When economic conditions warrant, the Committee’s   next step in the process of policy normalization will be to begin raising its target for the federal   funds rate, and from that point on, changing the level,” and it does not make reference to three to   six months?  How many prefer that approach?  [Show of hands]  Okay  So, I think, Narayana,   you’re outvoted  Your point about clarity is a good one, and these are actually very subtle   points, because if you are, for example, interested in providing more accommodation, saying that   it will be at least three months is one way  However, I think the Committee has spoken on that   So we have a document  We have 20 minutes or so, and I am going to ask each   participant to say, first, if you can broadly accept this  If you have a couple of objections to   things that are not your first best but you’re still willing to accept it, of course, you can say that    If you have some reason that you cannot accept it, then explain what that is  We’ll keep track of   that and try to put together an appropriate summary for the minutes, which of course will be   subject to the Committee’s vote and approval  Let me begin with President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  President Rosengren    Are you amenable to the whole document collectively?   June 21–22, 2011 46 of 282               All right  A couple of participants have raised the time   dimension issue, and President Rosengren pointed out two places  If there are others who have   similar concerns, I think they should probably say so  President Fisher    Okay  If others share this view, I think we should just   downplay the timing issues in our discussion in the minutes  Thank you  President Bullard    I’m going to take that as a no  [Laughter]    President Williams    I have a couple of reactions to that  One is that stopping   reinvestment is a relatively passive thing  It doesn’t involve us actually going out and making   June 21–22, 2011 49 of 282              sales  We don’t take capital losses  It doesn’t address nearly so directly the concerns about the   MBS market being relatively oversupplied during this period  So it seems like a more passive   way to go, and, therefore, something that’s worth doing  It also has the benefit, over a period of   time, of bringing the balance sheet down  I think one obvious argument—and I understand   President Bullard’s point—for raising rates first is that if you rely on balance sheet contraction as   your primary tightening tool, given market-based limits and so forth on how fast you can do that,   then you push the first increase in the funds rate off quite a while potentially, and there are   people, including President Hoenig and others, who think that the very low rate has damaging   effects on financial stability  That’s a tradeoff that I think some participants at least would not   like   President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Lockhart   June 21–22, 2011 50 of 282               Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Plosser    That seems like a friendly amendment  Okay    Vice Chairman    Governor Yellen    Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you all very much  This turned out to be very   helpful  [Laughter]  I appreciate the comments  When asked, in fact, I think I will say a little bit   about this in the press conference, with a strong caveat that this does not imply immediate   implementation of this exit  I have heard very clearly, I think, from a majority that we should   take out timing references, and so I will do that in my public communication  I suggest as a next   step that the staff might try to rewrite this a little bit and see if it can gain the same level of   support or even more support than it had today  If it does, we could consider making it an   addendum to the minutes  If not, or if there are enough serious concerns, then the alternative is   to describe the basic points with the appropriate “most” or “all” or whatever, as it applies  Vice   Chairman    Yes, I’m much more optimistic about that than I was an   hour ago    I certainly don’t want to get involved in an editing session   here, given the time constraints and so on  Why don’t we simply send out something soon, get   feedback, make a judgment about whether or not we’ve made a Pareto improvement on this   existing document, and then, based on that overall assessment, we can decide how to proceed    Part of my reason for this was that I anticipate getting asked   the question, in which case I would have to respond  President Kocherlakota    Okay  Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Lacker     Did I understand you correctly to say that your key issue   was the “four to five years”?    But with that number you’d support it?    Again, we’ll try to get a document that people can support    If not, we’ll simply report the preponderance of opinion on the issues   Okay  Thank you very much  I understand lunch is ready  Let’s take about half an hour   to get lunch and sit down, and then we’ll go into Mr Sack’s presentation   [Lunch recess]    Okay  Why don’t we reconvene?  We’re at item 3 on the   agenda, “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and let me turn it over to Brian   Sack    Thank you very much  The Vice Chairman wanted to say a   couple of words on the Maiden Lane II sale    Are there any questions?  President Lacker    Okay  We can turn to questions for Brian, and if anyone   wants to ask Bill another question, that’s fine, too   Brian, let me ask you about the release date on the swap agreements  Because of the   timing of my monetary policy testimony, I believe that there will at least be a serious   consideration of releasing the minutes on July 12, and of course, that will contain the   information  That creates a little bit of a concern for me  Is there any way to move this up?  For   example, if we say that Bank of Japan will be considering, when would the next latest possible   date be?  What’s your thought on that?    Okay  Now we’re open for general questions  President   Fisher    We’ll vote as soon as the Q&A session is over  Thank you    The pricing terms, plus 100 basis points, are intended to keep utilization minimal unless   conditions actually are worsening  President Lockhart    President Plosser    President Kocherlakota    President Lacker    President Fisher    I guess my thought, Brian, is that you should think about   options for preserving market function, and so on, and if we get close to this point, we can   obviously have a teleconference and have a decision about which, if any, we want to adopt    President Lacker    I’m quite confident that if August 2 passes, that there won’t   be an immediate default  I think it would take some time, but there are dates like August 15   where there’s a big coupon payment required that would be much riskier  But I think end of July   would no doubt be sufficient time from the Committee’s point of view    I think it does—Bill, you can add to this  It has a number of   unattractive but nonetheless available options, like selling MBS and so on, to raise revenue, and,   of course, there’s tax revenue  If they prioritize and decide not to pay Social Security, for   example, which of course is a political disaster, they could still make the principal and interest   payments, certainly, for a couple of weeks  President Kocherlakota    Any other questions?  Then we need to vote to ratify   domestic open market operations since the April meeting  Can I have a motion?   June 21–22, 2011 71 of 282               Without objection  Okay  President Fisher has moved to   approve the extension of the liquidity swap lines  I would just add that we’ve had a number of   calls lately concerning the Greek situation  There’s a lot that could be happening in the next few   weeks there  Japan seems to be improving, but still there’s some financial risk related to the   disaster  So I think our stance, which is a penalty rate, no current outstanding balances, but   providing what could be a very important backstop, is desirable  Are there any other comments   or questions about the swap lines?  Concerns?  [No response]    All right  In that case, all in favor, say aye  [Chorus of   ayes]  Any opposed?  [No response]  Okay  Thank you  Let’s go on now to item 4, the   economic and financial situation, and let me turn to Larry Slifman    Thank you very much  A couple of things  First, it is still   possible to change your projections if you have new information  It would be very much   appreciated it you could do it after the end of this meeting  There will be staff in the Special   Library who can help you do that  If you can’t do it by today, I implore you to do it by the   beginning of the meeting tomorrow morning, because this information will be released on an   embargoed basis at 130 pm tomorrow  Second, the Conference of Presidents requested that we   June 21–22, 2011 85 of 282              have an opportunity for those around the table who wanted to make observations or comments   about the financial stability situation to do so, and we will do that very shortly  But let’s first do   the Q&A, and then we’ll come back and allow people to make comments about the financial   stability issues   Let me start with a question for Trevor about the approach to forecasting commodity   prices he described  You showed no forecasting benefit, but all you’re really doing there is   augmenting the futures curve by something which is effectively the difference between your   forecast and other people’s forecast  So I think what you’re basically just saying is that over the   sample period that you tested this on, the Tealbook forecasts weren’t noticeably better than   private-sector forecasts    But in the memo that you circulated, if I remember   correctly, you found that futures curves actually are more informative when they are sloped   either up or down  So an alternative forecasting method would be one that puts a heavier weight   on those situations and, otherwise, when it’s flat, uses some other types of information  Why   didn’t you make that forecasting comparison?    Mine is just a suggestion to take a weighted average of the   two types of forecasts and put a heavier weight on futures when they’re far from being flat    Okay  Questions for anybody?  President Rosengren    Governor Tarullo     Questions?  President Hoenig    President Lockhart    President Bullard   June 21–22, 2011 90 of 282               It’s a propos that President Bullard just commented that this   recession followed the popping of a housing bubble  Larry Slifman made a similar comment  I   think there is an important and interesting distinction between whether it was the housing bubble   or the housing bubble plus the financial crisis  We have some evidence on financial crises, but   we have also seen housing bubbles around the world that weren’t accompanied by a financial   crisis  I think Australia is one example  You may not know off the top of your head, but do we   have any sense of whether recessions are very deep and recovery is very slow when there are   housing bubbles popping but not a serious financial crisis?    Thank you  President Fisher    President Lacker    President Kocherlakota    Vice Chairman    Other questions?  [No response]  This might be a good time   to take a coffee break, and come back at 330 pm   [Coffee break]    The next item on our agenda is billed as a chance for   Committee discussion of financial stability issues  This represents a request from the Conference   of Presidents that we have an opportunity for some discussion on this area  I would like to get to   the economic go-round in time to, if at all possible, get through it today  So I am not   encouraging a full go-round on financial stability  That being said, anyone who would like to   make comments, observations, ask questions—I see Nellie Liang is at the table—about  issues   related to the financial markets and financial stability, of course, is welcome to do so  We will   June 21–22, 2011 97 of 282              solicit your views after the meeting as to whether this format is effective or if there are other   ways to do it  But today, again, we will take comments from whoever would like to speak, and I   have on my list here, first, President Rosengren    Thank you, President Rosengren  I share your concern  I   want you to know that we have in fact worked with the SEC, both in the FSOC as well as   through a roundtable they recently held on these issues that Governor Tarullo attended, and I   think we have had some effect  Certainly, Mary Schapiro is very sympathetic to the idea of   some of these stronger measures, but we’ll keep monitoring it, and I hope you’ll keep us   informed as well  Vice Chairman    Thank you  President Lockhart    Well, either Bill or Brian can add on, but the earlier   discussion that Brian led was about contingency planning from the Federal Reserve’s operational   June 21–22, 2011 101 of 282              point of view, and much of that is mandated by the directive of our normal procedures  I asked   Brian—and I think he is already thinking that way anyway—to consider possible actions that we   might take to stabilize markets to the extent we can, with the thinking that if we came close to   that time, the Committee would be able to talk about them and see what we were comfortable   doing  So from the Desk’s point of view, I think we have a plan going forward   The other consideration is, we have been strongly discouraged by the Treasury from   doing the kind of planning that would involve talking to the private sector  For example, we   have no idea whether the computer systems of BNY, JPMorgan, and the FICC and so on can   even manage  It might be a Y2K type of event in the sense that they don’t contemplate the   possibility that they wouldn’t receive principal and interest  The Treasury’s reasoning is that it   doesn’t want to create too much anxiety in markets, and its view is that it intends not to default   until it was unavoidable  You know, we are continuing to talk to the Treasury, and I think at   some point we may just have to say, as supervisors and regulators, that we need to do this on our   own, and the Treasury doesn’t have to take responsibility for it  We are, I think, very close to the   point where we have to fish or cut bait on those kinds of issues  So those are the two areas where   we are planning  President Lacker    Well, that’s something for the Committee to discuss  We   have competing public policy objectives here  One of them is to avoid Armageddon in the   financial market  We have done some pretty non-bright-line kinds of things in the past to avoid   that Armageddon   June 21–22, 2011 102 of 282               I see no harm in having a list of the options, and then we   can make some decisions    Of course  I would say that I don’t think there is anything   we can do within our powers to prevent a default from having extremely negative consequences,   if only because of the effect on expectations and the creditworthiness of the US Government    Whatever we do, I don’t think it’s really a question of us being able to completely eliminate the   June 21–22, 2011 103 of 282              expectations factor or prevent it from being extremely stressful  All I can say is, I think we   ought to discuss taking into account those expectational effects in what we are prepared to do    President Hoenig, I have you next    Thank you  Would anyone else like to comment?    President Fisher    I agree with you, President Fisher  I think we are making   very good progress, with the intermeeting memos, the operations of the Office of Financial   Stability, and these kinds of discussions  Your comments raised a useful point  At the beginning   you talked about a number of things, like the shadow banking system and so on, which might be   amenable to regulatory or microeconomic-type policies  I think it’s important for us to have   enough granularity so that we can decide when the first line of defense is appropriately   June 21–22, 2011 106 of 282              microeconomic regulation, which gives more cushion to monetary policy to focus on   macroeconomic conditions  But the stock market is an example where microeconomic   regulation probably wouldn’t work, and we want to think about that, although I resist any   Greenspan–Bernanke put ideas   President Kocherlakota    Nellie    President Rosengren    Well, as is often the case, all the real work gets done by the   staff, and I will ask Nellie to comment in just a second  [Laughter]   We have a meeting only about every eight weeks or so  We’re doing some important   assigned tasks, like developing the criteria for evaluating SIFIs  We’ve also had some useful   interactions  As I mentioned earlier, I think that the money market mutual fund discussions have   moved the SEC’s position and have increased the possibility of a stronger credential system for   money market mutual funds  But because it only meets periodically, it doesn’t have the ongoing   working relationships that would be necessary for a truly interactive and effective council  That   being said, of course, we have bilateral relationships with many of the members, and they’ve   June 21–22, 2011 108 of 282              been quite extensive in the process of Dodd–Frank rulemaking, for example  Moreover, there   are many committees of the FSOC, which are made up of senior staff and even deputy principals   in some cases, and my sense is that a lot is happening in those  Perhaps Nellie could give us her   sense of how it is working    Mr Fisher, did you have a comment?    Other comments?  [No response]  All right  I hope that was   helpful, and it is certainly the case that Nellie and many other people have contributed to making   financial stability a more explicit part of our policy discussion  I think it’s only to the good to do   that  All right, we’re ready now for our economic go-round, and I’ll start with President   Rosengren    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Plosser   PRESIDENT PLOSSER  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, I have   revised down my forecast for economic growth in 2011 from 32 to 28 percent  This adjustment   is driven by obvious temporary factors, in my mind, that we have much discussed  adverse   weather, floods in the Midwest, oil prices, supply chain disruptions, and concerns about the fiscal   situation both in the United States and abroad  I admit that these effects are proving somewhat   more persistent than I had anticipated earlier this year but still consider them largely transitory in   nature  Similar to the soft patch we saw last year, I don’t perceive a significant change in the   underlying fundamentals that will push the economy back into a recession  I continue to expect   output growth in the United States to be slightly above trend over the second half of this year and   employment conditions to improve gradually   June 21–22, 2011 115 of 282              The Third District economic conditions mirror the nation  Payroll employment growth in   our three states weakened somewhat in May  Unemployment rates, though, edged down in   Pennsylvania and Delaware, but inched up in New Jersey  For the three-state region,   unemployment now stands at 82 percent, down ½ percentage point since December and almost a   full percentage point below the national rate  The region’s manufacturing activity weakened this   month  The index of general activity has fallen over the last three months and actually turned   negative in June  The indexes of new orders, shipments, and employment also weakened this   month with new orders turning negative  The slowdown in activity has also weighed on regional   manufacturers’ expectations  Our survey is showing the same kind of behavior it showed last   summer and early autumn when the economic expansion hit the soft patch  At that time, we   experienced some weak positive and some negative readings in our survey for about four months   before activity strengthened   Thus, while I’ve changed my risk assessment around my GDP forecast from tilted to the   upside to balanced, I’ve not changed my overall forecast for 2012 and beyond  I’ve been   projecting a weaker pace of expansion next year all along, in contrast to the Tealbook and other   private forecasters  The April Tealbook projected 2012 output growth of 42 percent while my   forecast has been about 3 to 35 percent all along, which is still above trend  I didn’t think we’d   see as much strength in this recovery because I thought the structural changes that we’re facing   in this economy had to work through, and, given the nature and depth of those economic shocks,   would weigh on economic growth for some time to come  The Tealbook forecast now looks like   mine   I also hear views from my directors about the financial sector—concerns about deals   being done on Wall Street, sales of firms where the leverage ratios are growing, where firms are   June 21–22, 2011 116 of 282              promising financing at very, very favorable EBITDAs, and lots of leverage and lots of money to   lend for deals  They’re concerned that the types of deals they’re seeing, in fact, look a lot like   the deals that they saw before the crisis and the run-up to the crisis   I have made little change to my inflation forecast  Both total and core inflation have   accelerated significantly since the beginning of this year  Year-over-year PCE inflation has risen   over 1 percentage point  Core PCE inflation has risen about 03 of a percentage point so far this   year  In the Third District, price pressures remain high  In our June manufacturing survey, there   continued to be more firms reporting increases in prices paid and received than are reporting   decreases, although the indexes are down from their extreme highs we saw earlier in the year    You wanted to hear some further evidence on the ability of firms to pass on their higher input   costs to their customers  In response to a special question, half of our firms told us they had been   unable to pass on cost increases, and about half said they had already raised prices significantly   since the beginning of the year  About 20 percent of the firms reported that they had instituted   price surcharges, and 14 percent said their current contracts already contained escalation clauses    I do expect some deceleration in headline inflation over the second half of the year as oil and   commodity prices stabilize or perhaps even reverse course somewhat, but not as much as in the   June Tealbook  I project inflation to be around 2¼ percent in 2012, which is up from 1 percent   in 2010  My forecast is higher than the Tealbook, which is projecting about 1½ percent this   year  But I note that the Tealbook has consistently revised up its inflation forecast over the past   six months  I found the chart on the bottom of page 33 in Tealbook, Book A, which shows the   evolution of the staff forecast for inflation, pretty unsettling  We need to take seriously the   possibility that we could be missing some emerging signs that medium-term inflation is   accelerating  This is particularly troubling in an environment where our policy is very   June 21–22, 2011 117 of 282              accommodative  Given inflation developments and the upside risk I see to inflation forecasts, I   think we may very well need to take some action to withdraw some accommodation sooner than   what’s priced into the funds futures market or in the Tealbook  In fact, if the current forecast   plays out, I believe we may need to take action before the end of the year, which means we will   need to signal that that’s a possibility sooner than that   As we discussed in the last meeting, if we were following the Taylor principle, policies   should respond to changes in inflation so long as there is no reversal in the unemployment rate or   output growth  As you know, I’m not a big fan of output gaps, but even in their revised forecast,   the staff projects that the output gap will be down ½ percentage point this year and another full   percentage point next year  Given this, the acceleration in inflation indicates that we should be   acting to reduce the degree of policy accommodation  Ending redemptions is one step, but we   should be prepared to take further action as well  Even when we begin to reduce the level of   accommodation, policy will remain very accommodative for some time to come  A 1 percentage   point funds rate is an accommodative policy  I think we should make an effort to explain this to   the public and prepare them for the start of normalization  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you very much  President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  The polite term for those folks is “liquidity   constrained”  [Laughter]  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for what I   thought was a really interesting discussion  I’m going to recess the meeting in just a moment, so   that we can all go home and take a shower before the British Embassy dinner  [Laughter]  First,   let me just say that tomorrow morning we’ll start with my summary, and then we’ll go into the   policy go-round  We also have a short item with Governor Yellen relating to the external   communications policy   June 21–22, 2011 154 of 282              Before you leave, make sure you have a copy of the exit strategy statement  The staff has   made some changes based on the discussion we had earlier today  If time permits—and I   certainly don’t guarantee that it will—we could look at it collectively tomorrow at the end of the   meeting  Otherwise, we’ll be in touch with you by long distance just to see whether this is an   improvement or not  Again, at this point, I don’t think we are completely committed to putting   this in the minutes, but I think it would be a good outcome, if we can get sufficient agreement    So take a look overnight, if you have a chance   We’ll start tomorrow at 900 am, and I’ll see you shortly at dinner  Thank you   [Meeting recessed]       June 21–22, 2011 155 of 282              June 22 Session    Good morning, everybody  Thank you again for what I   thought was an unusually constructive discussion yesterday  Let me start the morning with my   attempt at summarizing the economic go-round   Participants took note of the recent weakness in the economy as incoming data have   almost uniformly disappointed  In part, this soft patch is the result of factors likely to be   temporary, including the effects of the Japanese disaster on supply chains, the impact on   consumers and firms of the sharp rise in energy prices earlier this year, bad weather, and   concerns about fiscal developments  Most participants saw a moderate recovery still in train,   strengthening somewhat over time, but most also saw some longer-lasting loss of momentum and   marked down their forecasts accordingly  A more pessimistic view is that the strong quarters of   economic growth since the end of the recession have been the exception rather than the rule, as   financial and economic headwinds have been stronger than we thought or potential output   growth is slower than we thought  Overall, downside risks to growth have increased as the slow   pace of the recovery brings the economy near stall speed and makes it more vulnerable to new   shocks  Inflation, both core and headline, has risen recently  Again, some of the factors   involved may be temporary, such as the rise in commodity prices that has recently reversed and   the effects on prices of the supply chain problems  On the other hand, input costs other than   labor remain high in absolute terms, and firms will try to pass these costs on if they can; also,   core inflation tends to be persistent  The risks to inflation seem more balanced than at our last   meeting, but a number of participants still see those risks as tilted to the upside   Consumers remain cautious, and spending has remained subdued  In part this reluctance   to spend reflects high gasoline prices, especially on liquidity-constrained consumers, and the   effects of supply chain disruptions on auto sales, effects that may dissipate  The recent   June 21–22, 2011 156 of 282              weakening in labor markets, pessimism about income prospects, and stressed household balance   sheets are also negative factors  A weak housing sector has also restrained consumer confidence    In the housing sector, prices have continued to fall in most cities, and sales and construction   remain depressed, in part because potential buyers are afraid of buying into a declining market    About 25 percent of mortgage borrowers have negative home equity, implying restricted access   to credit and a greater propensity to default   In the business sector, there are some signs of greater caution since the last meeting,   especially among smaller businesses  Surveys generally show reduced expectations for orders   and production, especially in manufacturing  As noted, although commodity prices have come   down, input cost pressures remain significant  High gas prices have affected consumer demand   and shopping trips  Uncertainty about the recovery and about government policies remains an   issue  Firms continue to seek productivity gains in lieu of hiring, which may explain some of the   relative strength in the rate of investment in equipment and software  For medium and large   businesses, balance sheets remain strong, profits high, and access to credit good  Supply chain   disruptions were somewhat more severe than expected but are being overcome  Among key   sectors, energy, agriculture, high tech (notably in Silicon Valley), and tourism are all doing well    State and local governments are a source of fiscal drag, and the federal government is expected   to become such a source as well by next year   Financial conditions weakened during the intermeeting period, and volatility increased    Equities, bond yields, and bond spreads all reacted to the disappointing economic news  The   European sovereign debt situation was a particular source of volatility; although there have been   a few moderately encouraging developments in that area, there is little evidence that a lasting   solution is forthcoming  The debt limit debate does not appear to have had large effects on   June 21–22, 2011 157 of 282              markets as of yet, but the risk is potentially serious  Risk-taking moderated some over the   intermeeting period as concerns about the economy and financial stability increased  Liquidity   remains ample  Banks are seeing a slow but steady improvement in credit quality but remain   concerned about new financial regulations  With loan demand generally weak, competition for   creditworthy borrowers, especially larger firms but also some others such as automobile buyers,   is intense  Credit remains tight in many markets, however, including those for residential   mortgages, CRE lending, and consumer lending   As noted, inflation—both core and headline—has risen in recent months  Headline   inflation should moderate if the softening in commodity and raw materials prices persists  The   increase in core inflation also partly reflects effects likely to be temporary, such as increases in   the prices of new and used autos  Wage pressures have remained subdued in a weak labor   market, and inflation expectations remain anchored  However, there is some concern that the   recent rise in core inflation and related measures, such as the median and trimmed mean CPIs,   may not be entirely reversed  Such measures historically have tended to be persistent, especially   in expansions, and shelter inflation—an important part of the indexes—seems poised to rise, as   credit constraints push people into renting rather than buying highly affordable single-family   homes   Several observations were made regarding monetary policy  One participant noted that a   pattern of economic growth surprising to the downside and inflation to the upside is consistent   with potential output being lower than we might think; the implication is that excessive monetary   stimulation will lead primarily to inflation rather than output growth  On the other side, it was   suggested that the efficacy of monetary policy may decline when accommodation is maintained   for a long time, as financial conditions become less responsive and as aggregate demand is   June 21–22, 2011 158 of 282              shifted over time rather than growing persistently  Assuming that monetary policy is not   completely ineffective, this implies that greater (or more extended) accommodation may be   needed to obtain a given effect   That was my summary  Any reactions, comments?  [No response]  Okay  Thanks  So   having said all that, I don’t know how much more “value added” I have at this juncture, but let   me just say a couple of words   Clearly, we’ve had a very disappointing first half this year  Indeed, in some ways we’re   lucky that the unemployment rate on net over 2011 hasn’t risen, and so we’ve maintained much   of the gains from November to January, despite the fact that output growth has been below what   we think to be potential output growth  In trying to dissect the slowdown, first, obviously there   are some temporary factors  Auto production, for example, has been held down by the supply   chain disruptions, but currently assemblies are projected to increase by 15 million at an annual   rate in the third quarter  You can see the demand for that in depleted inventories and the fact that   sales were reduced because of unavailability of some attractive models and because the lack of   incentives increased prices  It’s a reasonably good assumption that, barring a major further   slowdown, autos will be a source of economic growth in the next quarter or two  We’ve all   discussed a number of other factors  Defense spending seems to have been unusually low    Regarding the commodity price, and particularly the oil price, effects, even the flattening of oil   prices would be supportive of greater growth  In fact, what we appear to be seeing at this point   is a decline of nearly $30 per barrel in oil prices from the peak, which certainly will be a positive   going forward  Europe seems likely to be stable, at least for a while, and maybe we will see a   pattern similar to last year, when a springtime upsurge in concern about Europe led to stock   June 21–22, 2011 159 of 282              market declines and some economic weakness, but those concerns were addressed, and some of   that effect was mitigated   While temporary factors certainly are important, I would add, that there are some positive   indicators that a moderate recovery is proceeding, despite the very well-founded concerns about   the labor market  I think it should be kept in mind that, in the four months preceding my August   2010 Jackson Hole remarks, which intimated QE2, monthly private-sector job creation was   80,000 on average; in the next four months it was 140,000, and so far this year, including the   weak report in May, average private payroll growth has been 180,000 per month  So there seems   to be some improvement there  The risk, of course, is that May is more indicative than the   earlier months of the year  Real equipment and software spending is still strong, as many people   noted  There are different interpretations for that  I think I lean toward the interpretation that   maybe the uncertainty is not quite as large as it’s sometimes made out to be  Indeed, profits are,   in fact, very strong, and balance sheets are very good  Export demand is strong  The other   interpretation is that equipment and software spending reflects the substitution of capital for   labor, but again, I think that’s less likely than the other   The housing sector is hard to read  It’s been a disappointment for some time  I just raise   the following observation for your consideration  Regarding the recent house price declines,   when broken up between distressed and nondistressed sales, the nondistressed sales show flat   prices; the distressed sales are where all of the price declines are  Now, this is not to deny that   the effect of distressed sales on prices is not a real effect; it probably is  But to the extent, for   example, that the repeat sales indexes don’t account for the physical deterioration and other   problems—neighborhood problems and so on—associated with distressed sales, it could be that   the decline in prices is maybe slightly overstated  But still the housing market is very weak   June 21–22, 2011 160 of 282              Financial conditions, of course, remain accommodative  The stock market has retained   most of its substantial gain since last summer, and currently we still have low volatility and low   P/E ratios  Those factors would support further gains  Credit quality is improving, as Governor   Duke mentioned  We have some positive signs from leading indicators  The Beige Book, I   thought, was fairly balanced in its interpretation   I don’t think we should despair with the recovery  I think there is some forward   momentum  But, the bottom line does seem to me to be that there has been some loss of   momentum  I said so last time, and I’ve taken down my forecast even further this time  Some of   the evidence would be—besides the labor market, of course, where the data have been weak   across a whole range of indicators—the very broad range of weakness in manufacturing surveys   and in the IP data, which is not just restricted to autos  That’s a bit surprising, given the   continued strength of exports, but it could be that firms who are oriented toward foreign sales   may, for example, already be seeing some of the expected slowdown in emerging markets and   that might be part of the reason why they are more pessimistic  Consumption is forward looking,   and I while don’t want to overstate this, some economic theories would argue that consumption   is actually a leading indicator because it reflects the best assessment of the public about where   they see the economy going and what they see as happening to their incomes in the future  So   the surprisingly weak consumption, even ex autos, is, I think, disturbing  One other thing to   mention is that the financial markets really seem to have taken on board a greater weakness in   terms of lower bond yields, lower stock prices, larger spreads, more risk aversion, and lower fed   funds futures  That’s further evidence that there’s a broad-ranging consensus in the public that   the economy is going to grow more slowly  Again, I think it’s appropriate to assume some   improvement going forward, but the appropriate Bayesian response in what we’ve seen would be   June 21–22, 2011 161 of 282              to take down the medium-term forecast as well as the near-term forecast  As Governor Tarullo   and others noted, very slow growth also increases the downside risks because of the   escape-velocity phenomenon  In more econometric terms, we have a lot of research on this   so-called two-state model of recessions and expansions that suggests that if you slip from one   state to the other, then you can have a somewhat discontinuous decline   On inflation, there has been a pickup  I think that headline inflation will certainly come   down  I noted in my speech in Atlanta that PCE inflation over the past six months has been   running at an annual rate of 36 percent  Take out one product, gasoline, and that six-month rate   is 2 percent  Given that a single product accounts for much of the headline change and given   that oil prices have come down quite significantly, I think it’s very likely that, at least toward the   next couple of quarters, headline inflation will be reasonably controlled  On core inflation, I   think there have also been some temporary factors involved  First, obviously, oil prices and   other raw materials prices have been passed through, and there are certain areas, like air fares   and other transportation, where pass-through is to be expected  That doesn’t necessarily mean   that there has been a breakdown in inflation expectations, for example, and those pressures   should, over time, moderate  In particular, I think that our agreed-upon view is that one-time   increases, as opposed to continuing increases, in input costs should not lead to ongoing inflation   unless inflation expectations are not anchored and wages respond very directly to those price   increases  Neither of the last two conditions seems to be in play, and so I would expect that   some of those pass-through effects will at least not continue  There are some other examples  I   think motor vehicles are actually a pretty important contributor, and it’s particularly striking in   the CPI  If you compare the core CPI over the past 3 months against the past 12 months, you see   about a 1 percentage point increase in the core CPI over those two overlapping periods    June 21–22, 2011 162 of 282              Arithmetically, about half of that increase is due to auto prices; the effect is somewhat less for   the PCE measure  Because we expect a good bit of that to be reversed, that’s one factor that   should be moderating  Also, I think it’s important to note that the TIPS spreads have come down   to something close to the middle of their historical range  In some sense, the mini inflation scare   that we had has moderated, and I think that should give us some comfort  Now, again, it’s one of   these “one hand–other hand” kinds of situations  As I think a couple of you noted, shelter costs   are potentially an issue  I was a little surprised to see that, at this point in time, shelter costs are   holding down inflation  That is, it’s still the case that shelter costs are rising more slowly than   the rest of core, and so that’s one factor that almost certainly will contribute to higher inflation   going forward  That’s something to watch  Like most of you, barring new shocks, I’m pretty   confident that inflation will moderate over the rest of the year, but I have raised my estimates of   core inflation somewhat, particularly in the remainder of the year, as some of these factors work   through   In summary, we have a recovery that is very weak, especially given the depth of the   recession  That increases the economy’s susceptibility to downside shocks, and it does appear   that some of that weakness is going to be persistent  For inflation, I think a fair judgment is that   we look to be on track to come close to target in the medium term; deflation risk has largely   disappeared  As I indicated before, as we look back over the last 8 or 10 months, I think we have   seen some improvement in the labor market, notwithstanding the recent slowing, and deflation   risk has largely disappeared  I would argue that the second round of securities purchases did   help us move closer to our mandate  That being said, because we are at a very different point   now than we were last August, as we’ll discuss in the policy go-round in just a moment, I think   it’s an appropriate time to watch and wait  Any questions or comments?  [No response]   June 21–22, 2011 163 of 282              We can turn now to item 5, which is the current monetary policy and the statement  I’ll   call on Bill English, who we’re happy to see is recovered from an operation and is back on the   job  Bill    Thank you  Any questions for Bill?  President Evans    Is that because the Tealbook extension respects the zero   lower bound and the optimal control exercise doesn’t?    Dave Reifschneider has a comment    Other questions?  President Fisher    Let me say one quick thing, but an important thing  First, I   thank you for your comments on the mock-up statement  Those were very helpful  I think the   language is better  As Bill mentioned, following your input, we did not include the projections   numbers in the statement  However, there are a range of issues here that need to be addressed    To what extent we do refer to targets?  How do we communicate?  That includes inflation   objectives, but also what we project in the SEP and a number of other issues related to our   communications   I want to thank Janet’s subcommittee for its good work on guidelines on external   communication and on the press conference, and we will, of course, be discussing those   guidelines shortly  But given that there are still important unresolved issues relating to our   communication of monetary policy, including our projections and so on, I’ve asked Janet to take   her subcommittee into a new phase to look at these monetary policy communications issues,   including such issues as how we best use our projections  So Janet has asked President Plosser,   President Evans, and Governor Raskin to join her in some further discussions of our policy   communication, and I just wanted you to know that that process will continue  As the process   June 21–22, 2011 169 of 282              continues, she will solicit your input and, of course, will bring any developments to the full   Committee for discussion     Any questions?  [No response]  If not, let’s begin our go-round, and I see President   Lockhart first     Thank you  But, of course, the actual projections will be   released, so the markdown of the forecast for economic growth will be seen  President   Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Hoenig    President Williams    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Let me raise a question about the application of the Taylor   principle in the current context  We can legitimately debate whether the funds rate should be   effectively negative in some sense  But if we take for the moment the premise that, given the   weak state of the economy, et cetera, the appropriate funds rate is minus 1 to minus 2, I think it’s   pretty clear in the Woodford style of theoretical literature that, as the appropriate funds rate   moves up but still remains negative, you wouldn’t respond because of the zero bound  You may   disagree that we are in fact still constrained by the zero lower bound  But if we are, I’m not quite   sure how I see that the Taylor principle would apply    Certainly, at some point  Okay  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Fisher    Let me quickly respond  My summary, of course, was just   trying to incorporate the comment the Vice Chairman made  I’m not going to introduce   speculative views into official communications   June 21–22, 2011 184 of 282               Okay  Of course, the minutes will be up for comment and   approval, but I think it would, at most, say one person thought that  On the Greenspan–Bernanke   put, it was a statement of revulsion  By the way, I don’t think it exists—you would think I would   know if it did exist [laughter]—and I would like to discourage that perception    Okay, thank you  President Evans    Thank you very much  President Lacker    President Lacker, I missed part of what you said  How   would a stochastic trend with white-noise innovations be consistent with a constant—basically,   3 percent growth over 140 years?  Wouldn’t you expect to see extended periods of higher   economic growth?    Sounds like it is co-integrated or something    Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    You’re referring to the “maintain the current degree of   monetary policy accommodation”?    Okay  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Vice Chairman      Okay  Thank you very much  I think there’s obviously a   broad consensus on alternative B  There were some interesting language suggestions, and I’d   like to take up a couple of them  First, there seemed to be a lot of support for President   Williams’s suggestion to omit part of the first sentence in paragraph 3 and say, “To promote the   ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent   with its mandate,” cut the end of the sentence and go to, “The Committee will keep the target   range for the federal funds rate”  I think that’s fine  It’s not important, but I think you should be   aware that in the April statement, we used that same phraseology to introduce the securities   purchases  So it is a little bit of a swap-around, but I don’t really have any real problem with   that  Is there anyone who has concerns about dropping that language?    All right  “Decided today to” and then restart with the word   “keep” in the next part of the sentence   Next, there was the issue that President Plosser and a number of others have raised about   the “momentum” sentence in the first paragraph  Charlie, could you give us again your proposed   language?   June 21–22, 2011 195 of 282               “Recent labor market indicators have been weaker than   anticipated”    Yes, it does keep with that  Let me raise one concern  I am   not opposed to this, but I just want to point out that what we’re making a backward-looking   statement that both economic growth and labor market have been weaker than expected, and we   then go on to say that the slower pace of recovery reflects in part, importantly, factors that are   likely to be temporary  And then we use language that we have used previously  So I think your   suggestion might be okay, but one thing I am a little bit concerned about is that the statement   will be read as saying, “Fed Thinks Slowdown Temporary”  That’s the headline  That seems a   little more optimistic than some of us were  “Loss of momentum,” as you said, suggests a   somewhat longer-lasting problem    Actually, one possibility is to use language similar to what   I had in my speech in Atlanta where I said, “pick up somewhat”  Maybe that would be—can we   do that?  I’m trying to avoid giving the sense that we think this is entirely temporary  Yet   another approach is President Rosengren’s suggestion about adding a sentence in paragraph 2   saying that the Committee perceives that downside risks to economic growth have increased  I   would note that adding that would be a very significant change, because would we then also have   an inflation risk component?  We haven’t been using the “risk” language  I’m not saying we   shouldn’t do it, but I’m a little afraid of doing it on the fly  President Plosser    President Kocherlakota    Vice Chairman   June 21–22, 2011 197 of 282               I think that is an important point  President Fisher    President Lacker     Okay  I guess my proposal would be to replace the   “momentum” sentence with Charlie’s language  “Also, recent labor market indicators have been   weaker than anticipated”   I also think that the Vice Chairman’s point is important, that news   coverage will also have to include coverage of the changes in the projections, which will make   very explicit the fact that we expect economic growth to be slower going forward  I didn’t hear a   lot of support for “pick up somewhat,” unless I’m mistaken  Let’s see  Charlie also wanted to   say that “Inflation expectations have remained close to historical norms”  I think we’ve said   June 21–22, 2011 198 of 282              they’ve been stable for a really long time, and I don’t know how people would interpret that   change    It is a latent variable that we’re referring to  But there are a   number of those measures that we use    They do  I think the volatility around where we want it to   be has been limited  And the important fact about the intermeeting period, in fact, is that things   seemed to have generally moved in the right direction in terms of inflation expectations  All   right  If everybody agrees, what we’re proposing is to replace the sentence about the loss of   momentum with the Plosser proposal  “Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker   than anticipated,” and then to drop the part of the first sentence in 3  Any other comments?  [No   response]  Debbie, are you ready to read the statement?    I think we are    Good  All right    Okay  Thank you  I assume coffee is ready?    Why don’t we take a coffee break and return at 1115?    Thank you    [Coffee break]    Okay  Item 6 on the agenda is a discussion and approval of   proposed policies on external communications  Governor Yellen’s subcommittee has been   June 21–22, 2011 200 of 282              working hard and consulting with you, and I want to thank her and the members of her   subcommittee for their hard work  Let me turn now to Janet for a discussion    Could I comment on this debate?  The Atlanta blog, I think,   is a really good example of policy-relevant, topical commentary, which does a really nice job of   avoiding the problem  The way I would express the problem would be that we don’t want a   situation in which staff are saying things that move markets or confuse the public about what the   current near-term policies are likely to be  Even with the Eggertsson paper, I think the research   is very interesting and very relevant  I’m not sure that I like very much the statement that we   will not do this, because it does have implications  I have had some conversations recently in   other contexts about policies toward research publications, and my very strong view is that it’s   June 21–22, 2011 213 of 282              best to have a policy that Fed staffers are allowed to do research on whatever topic they’d like,   and it doesn’t represent an official position of the Board  Once you censor one paper and then   you don’t censor another, people are going to assume that there’s some implicit imprimatur   being given to the paper that is not censored  I don’t think this policy is a restriction that will   stifle serious research  I would add also, finally, that these policies are supposed to be   implemented at the Reserve Banks by the president of each Reserve Bank  So each of you will   have opportunities to make these judgments and make sure that within your Bank the appropriate   lines are drawn   We have a motion, and we have a second  We’re going to take one vote on these two   policies  My understanding is, as a procedural matter, that this is a vote of the Committee—that   is, the same people who vote on the current action and the statement  That being said, I think it   would be very interesting and useful to know what everybody around the table thinks, so I’m   going to ask for a vote of all 17 folks around the table  We will probably report, I assume, the   FOMC’s official vote but also indicate in the minutes the views of the broader group, if that’s   okay  We have a motion, and it is has been seconded  How many are in favor, please?  I think   we have a unanimous vote  Thank you  And thank you, Janet   We have a couple of minutes, so maybe we could take a quick look at that updated   version of the exit strategy that we sent out yesterday8  And I don’t intend to get into any   extended discussion here  This is the same as what you got yesterday, so let me go through this   quickly  The changes that have been made—first, in paragraph 3, instead of saying “relatively   soon thereafter,” we say “sometime thereafter,” to loosen the temporal connection between   ceasing reinvesting and modifying the policy guidance  Similarly, in paragraph 5, we have   struck the phrase “probably within a few months”  And, again, the purpose of this is to give us                                                    8 The revised materials for the discussion of exit strategy principles are appended to this transcript (appendix 8)   June 21–22, 2011 214 of 282              some flexibility in terms of the speed at which the sequence is executed, because, arguably, it   could depend on economic conditions  We added the phrase “up or down,” suggested by   President Plosser  We made the change suggested by the Vice Chairman about reducing the   portfolio to “the smallest levels that would be consistent with the efficient implementation of   monetary policy”   Now, the one place where I thought there was not necessarily a clear preference in terms   of giving times had to do with the horizon over which we eliminate our holdings of agency   securities  And, indeed, we have, I think, put in the minutes that the majority of the Committee   participants were in favor of something approximating five years  Let me try to get your sense of   this  First of all, we’ve added the option of selling agency securities over three to five years as   opposed to four to five  One of the memos we circulated made the point that if we sell agency   securities more quickly it doesn’t have that much effect on the overall size of the portfolio  So   even if we sell the agency securities in three years, it would still take two to three years to   normalize the size of the overall portfolio  If we sell them in five years, it only adds about six   months, or something on that order, to the time needed to get to the $25 billion of excess reserves   associated with our pre-crisis policies  This is just for straw vote purposes—do we want to ask   the question about three to five years versus four to five?  Then I’d be interested to get a sense of   the Committee’s preference about simply leaving out the time frame  I gather that was   something about which there were some strong objections  Vice Chairman    When we start sales   June 21–22, 2011 215 of 282               I see  Why don’t we say, “Once sales begin,” something   like that, “the pace of sales is expected”—    You can’t make assumptions today about when we’ll be   initiating sales  So why don’t we say something like “Once sales begin, the pace of sales”   Does anybody want to speak on the issue of “three to five” versus “four to five”?  Let’s   do it sequentially  Once we have a determination on that, I will open the floor for those who   might want to just not use numbers there at all  Vice Chairman    Even though we have a reinvestment policy, we’re   reinvesting in Treasuries, and the MBS are running off   June 21–22, 2011 216 of 282               I think we should give at least some consideration to the   other memo that Brian and colleagues circulated that suggested that the net supply of MBS to the   market was actually going to be pretty high over the next few years because of the portfolio of   the GSEs being run down, because of Treasury sales, and some other factors  That would argue   for the “four to five,” I think  President Fisher    Do you have a language suggestion?    That’s true  There would also be some consideration,   obviously, of principle number one, that we have to do it consistent with our policy objectives as   well  Let me take a few more  I have a feeling we’re not going to resolve this today  President   Hoenig    President Lacker    Right    For what it’s worth, both of our previous communications   and most of our scenario analysis is four to five years  We haven’t worked with a three-year   variant very often  So if you are willing to accept that, I think that was the original version     President Fisher    President Kocherlakota   June 21–22, 2011 220 of 282               Governor Duke    This is how labor negotiations always go—wear them   down  [Laughter]  Okay  So let’s just get a sense here  First of all, put aside completely for a   moment the issue of three to five or four to five years—is everybody okay with the other changes   that were made?  Is there anyone who has strong objections to any of the other changes?    Governor Raskin    I think in this case you could imagine circumstances in   which it could go either way  In other cases, we’ve been leaning more in one direction than the   other  I don’t think this is a critical issue, but I take your point  Anyone else?  [No response]    All right  I’m going to ask, how many prefer “three to five,” how many prefer “four to five,” and   June 21–22, 2011 221 of 282              how many prefer no numbers?  And then, based on that, we’re going to come back to you to try   to develop some kind of consensus based on some more staff work, if that’s okay    Well, if we can get to closure  Yes  Even if we can get to   closure after the meeting, that would be good    All right  Is there anyone who strongly objects to the   inclusion of any numbers?  President Fisher, I think you have noted your concerns  Okay, good    Now, there is a legitimate question of “three to five” and “four to five”  How many are in favor   of “three to five”?  Don’t raise your hand too high, Jeff  [Laughter]  [Show of hands]  Let’s   see—three to five” it is  So we have a document that everybody is at least willing to buy into  Is   everybody okay with posting this in the minutes?    That follows from the “three to five” “Three to five”   implies “two to three”    “Once sales begin,” yes  Okay  Any objection to putting   this in the minutes?  President Bullard   June 21–22, 2011 222 of 282               Okay  Thank you  The next meeting is August 9  I hope   everybody has a good summer   A couple of points  As you know, the press conference is at 215  There is a screen over   here in the Special Library for anyone who wants to take advantage of that  Like last time, I’m   going to be mostly focused on reviewing the projections, including the interpretation of the   longer-term projections for unemployment and inflation and a link to today’s policy decision  I   will follow closely the language of the statement and the material in the projections   For your information, we’re trying to provide the opportunity for media coverage to   actually present in real time the projection table and chart  We’re now going to release those   materials at 200, rather than 215, to give the TV people and so on a few minutes to be prepared   to present the materials simultaneously with the press conference  The table is the one we   normally release and the chart is the one you saw yesterday with more of a fan chart look that   shows the range and the central tendency   And, separately, as we mentioned yesterday, the minutes release will be moved up one   day, because otherwise it would come in the middle of my monetary policy testimony   Is lunch ready?    What I would recommend, for those who are able to stay, is   to get yourself some lunch, and around 1230, Linda Robertson will give you a congressional   update  Thank you  The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   June 21–22, 2011 223 of 282     "
9252,2011-08-01,BERNANKE,"  Thank you, everyone, for joining us  This is a joint   FOMC–Board meeting, so I need a motion to close the meeting  Governor Duke?    Thank you very much  As you know, it’s been difficult to   schedule this meeting, given the vagaries of politics and of markets  Today could have been, of   course, a high-stress day  I hope it’s less stressful than that  Nevertheless, I think there are some   useful things we can do today   Let me propose a program, and if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know  I   thought what we might do first is get some briefings  We can start, in a moment, with Linda   Robertson on the recent developments and the prospects for congressional approval  Brian Gross   is here also to provide backup on that   Second, we’ll turn to Brian Sack, who will tell us a bit about both recent and current   market developments  That’s in preparation for the discussion of potential Federal Reserve   actions, if they were to become necessary  Also, I hope Brian will talk a bit about the possibility   of a downgrade  Even if there’s no default, the downgrade still seems to be a large possibility,   and we’d like to know what implications that might have   Third, Louise Roseman is here  Louise worked hard with the Treasury and with your   staffs to develop a system for handling government payments when we thought they would be   prioritized or at least not fully paid  I’m going to ask Louise to briefly tell you about that, but I   think the issue here, because this is not effective at this point, is to get from you any issues or   August 1, 2011 3 of 53              questions for the future that were raised by this process or any concerns you have about the   system that was devised   Then I’ll turn briefly to Mike Foley to update us on banking developments and any   questions we’ve been getting on supervisory issues     Those are some preliminary briefings to update everybody  Questions will be allowed, of   course, at any stage  After the briefings we’ll turn to Bill English, who, with the assistance of   Brian Sack, will discuss some of the issues raised by their joint memo of a few weeks ago about   potential actions that the Federal Reserve could take  Noting that everything is not signed,   sealed, and delivered and noting that there are certainly many stresses in financial markets, I   think it would still be useful for us to get at least a little bit of input about what kinds of actions   the Fed might consider taking under certain contingencies  Particularly given that we have no   immediate action proposed, I don’t plan to ask for any votes today  But again, your input is   useful to help think about what we might bring to this Committee in the future   So that’s my proposal  Are there any suggestions or concerns about what else we might   talk about?  [No response]  All right  Seeing none, let me begin our briefing process and turn to   Linda Robertson to give us a brief update on yesterday’s negotiations and on where it goes from   here  Linda    If they vote in the Senate today, would they vote in the   House?    Okay  Are there any questions for Linda?  [No response]    All right  I don’t see any questions  We appreciate that report  It underscores that nothing’s   done until it’s done, right?   Let me turn now to Brian Sack in New York, who will talk about some market issues and   maybe, Brian, if you can, the downgrade issue as well    Thank you very much  Any questions or comments for   Brian?  President Fisher    Any other questions?  [No response]  All right  Seeing   none, let’s hear very briefly from Louise  I’m interested in any feedback we might get on either   the substance or the process that we worked through when we got the payment plan done    Louise    Comments or questions for Louise?  President Lacker    Yes    Let me respond to that  That was a very difficult problem    Clearly, our general tendency is to want to do contingency planning well in advance and make   sure everybody’s well prepared, and in this case, perhaps we should have  We’ll have to think   about that for the future  In this case, though, it was certainly complicated by the fact that the   Treasury’s own plans kept changing, and we weren’t entirely clear about what they wanted to do,   which obviously was very important  The other issue is that there was always a consideration of   whether or not too much explicit attention on these issues was destabilizing rather than   stabilizing  But other than acknowledging that this was a complicated calculation, I take your   point, and a number of other people have made the same general observation   Any other questions for Louise?  Louise, on an operational basis, was there anything in   this experience that we should work on going forward, either in terms of the coordination among   August 1, 2011 12 of 53              the Board, the Reserve Banks, and the Treasury, or in terms of the mechanics of our payment   system that we should be thinking about as a broader matter?    Okay  Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Louise, going in the other direction, so this question was   about defaulting, not prioritizing  In the past, the Congress has excepted certain components   from the debt limit where in this case there was a bill, the Toomey bill, that would have forced   August 1, 2011 14 of 53              the Treasury to prioritize not just principal and interest, but other major categories of spending    Would we have been able to do that?    Thank you  Any other questions?  [No response]  Seeing   none, Mike, would you say a few words about what we’re seeing in banks and what guidance   we’re giving them?    I think these banks probably could just finance the entire   federal debt issue and solve all the problems at the same time  Thank you, Mike  Any questions,   comments?  Governor Duke    President Fisher    Other questions for Mike?  Mike    If there are no more questions, why don’t we go on now to   Bill English, who will talk about some of the prospective options in case either things worsen   from here or we have a similar situation in the future  Bill    Let’s see if there are any questions, and then we’ll have a   quick go-round  Any questions?  [No response]  I do not see any questions, so let’s take some   views  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you very much  President Williams    Thank you very much  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  Scott can correct me, but just to make sure I   understand, on 13(3), we’ve lost the ability to lend to an individual firm, but we do have the   ability to set up a program that is open to a broad range of borrowers  So in principle—I’m not   advocating anything, I’m just saying as a matter of law—we could set up an emergency facility   for all money market mutual funds  Is that right, Scott?    Yes—just for your information    Okay  Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  First Vice President Roskom    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you, President Bullard  President Fisher    Thank you  First Vice President George    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  President Kocherlakota, you have a two-  hander?    I think that’s a fair comment  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much  Thank you, everybody  Let me   make a couple of miscellaneous comments  There was a lot of support for 1 through 5, and I   think that was good  I think those policies are pretty much within the realm of usual financial   stability policies  It was mentioned a couple of times that some of those actions were based on   our judgment that the government would eventually pay, and I didn’t quite follow that  Again, if   we’re doing market prices, then we’re basically not substituting our judgment for anyone else’s   assessment  And President Bullard, I think, raised the point that market prices may not be very   clear, but we would presumably have some kind of auction process   I think a point that was somewhat underemphasized is that our transmission of monetary   policy is an issue here as well  So to take an example, doing repos to keep the RP rate from   uncoupling from the federal funds rate, arguably there are issues there relating to transmission    There’s nothing magic about the federal funds rate  It’s our indicator of the stance of monetary   policy, but presumably we’re aiming at financial conditions more broadly  If there’s a   August 1, 2011 49 of 53              decoupling of other short rates from the fed funds rate, I think a monetary policy–dual mandate   motivation might support some of those actions   Finally, just a word about money market mutual funds  They should not exist    Unfortunately, they do  If they exist, they should be regulated  Unfortunately, they’re not   adequately regulated  And as Governor Tarullo pointed out, although we can be persuasive, we   can’t be dispositive on this issue  If they were some kind of bank, which is probably the right   way to think about them, then presumably discount window–type lending plus regulation would   be the right way to deal with them  Unfortunately, we’re in this no man’s land, where we neither   regulate them nor have an appropriate discount window arrangement  In that context and under   certain circumstances, if not only were there problems in money market mutual funds, but the   whole broad context of financial stability concerns were sufficiently severe that we felt we   needed to take some action, buying T-bills might be a more innocuous and more market-neutral   way of trying to address those problems than opening a 13(3) facility—particularly if we   sterilized the purchases, which we could do through the various tools that we have  But I’d note   that, in the case of money market mutual funds, we’re going to be forced into the fourth-best   here, because the institutional structure is not right  It doesn’t conform to our models and the   way we think about liquidity and lender-of-last-resort activities   My final comment is that I agree with the majority, that the bar for the purchase of   defaulted securities should be extremely high  And I can assure President Kocherlakota that we   would not do that lightly  I would be interested, just intellectually—President Kocherlakota   circulated a speech, I think, where he commented that refusal of a central bank to purchase   defaulted government securities was a way of short-circuiting the so-called fiscal theory of the   price level  I’m curious to know at some point, not today, whether that’s a rigorous statement or   August 1, 2011 50 of 53              whether that was just very good intuition  But I do think that buying defaulted securities would,   under most circumstances, be quite worrisome   Again, thank you  These comments are very helpful  They help frame a range of   decisions that we could have to take or that future FOMCs may have to take, so I think this   conversation was worth having  I’d like to ask Linda—do you have a little bit of an update on   the legislative situation?    Done this evening, then?    Very good  Any other comments, questions, issues?    Yes?    Vice Chairman Dudley    Thank you for bringing that up, Brian  I agree with the   Vice Chairman that maybe we should let that situation evolve for a few days  If it looks to be a   persistent and troubling situation, then it would be my proposal that we ought to have another   August 1, 2011 52 of 53              quick call  Is that okay with everybody?  [No response]  All right  So let’s let that situation   evolve for a few more days, and we’ll see where that goes  I assume our presumption is that it   will calm down  If there are new adverse developments in the fiscal situation, I think we’d have   to have another call anyway  Anything else?  [No response]  All right  Thank you very much   END OF MEETING   August 1, 2011 53 of 53     "
9274,2011-08-09,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  This is a joint FOMC–Board   meeting  So I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you very much  Before we get down to business, we   have a few people to whom we have to say farewell—first, Carol Low  Carol, an FOMC   specialist in the Secretariat, is retiring  She’s worked at the Board for only 41 years, begun at   age six  [Laughter]  She has attended 222 FOMC meetings, which turns out to be the same   number that Don Kohn attended  So that gives you a measure—    One Don Kohn unit  That’s right  So that’s quite a record    Carol, you’ve been here for many, many years, and we thank you for your service  [Applause]   It was announced yesterday that Nathan Sheets will be leaving the Board to take a   position in the private sector, and hence he recused himself from the last meeting and obviously   has had nothing to do with this meeting as well  I’m sorry he’s not here to accept our   congratulations, but as you know, Nathan did a wonderful job piloting the Division of   International Finance through some very choppy international waters over the past few years,   and we’re going to miss him and his insights and understanding of the international situation   very much  Steve Kamin will be acting director as we try to regroup in International Finance,   and we appreciate Steve taking on that responsibility  For the record, let me acknowledge our   thanks to Nathan Sheets for his many contributions   August 9, 2011 4 of 162              And finally, this is the last meeting for our colleague Tom Hoenig  Tom began attending   FOMC meetings in 1991 and has attended a total of 161 meetings, which exceeds the sum of any   two other members around the table  The only problem I’ve ever had with Tom is that I’m   unable to get him to say what he really thinks  [Laughter]  It’s a 20-year record of service   through three recessions—I’m not implying any causality—and we have all benefited very   much, Tom, from your perspective, your banker’s insights, and your wide range of experience    Well, we will have a chance to make jokes like that at a   lunch in your honor after the next FOMC meeting, and I suspect that your retirement might get   mentioned once or twice at Jackson Hole  I’m just guessing    All right  Tom, thank you  You have our great   appreciation and admiration    Okay  Without further ado, let’s go to item 1 on our agenda   and turn to Brian Sack for a report on financial developments  Brian    Thank you  Are there questions for Brian?  President   Fisher    Vice Chairman    President Bullard    President Hoenig    I have a two-hander from the Vice Chairman   August 9, 2011 15 of 162               Any other questions for Brian?  President Kocherlakota    All right  Seeing no other questions, we need to vote to   ratify domestic open market operations  Can I have a motion?    Without objection  Thank you  Item 2, “Economic   Situation”  Let me turn to David Wilcox to begin the briefing  David    What do we think is the GDP effect of the Royal Wedding?    [Laughter]    Another failure of fiscal policy, no doubt  [Laughter]  Any   questions for our colleagues?  President Fisher    President Fisher, as I’ll mention at the end of the meeting,   this is going to be part of a special topic for the FOMC coming up pretty soon  President   Lockhart    President Plosser    President Bullard    President Hoenig    President Kocherlakota    Other questions for our colleagues?  [No response]  Seeing   none, we’re ready for the economic go-round, and I’ll start with Governor Tarullo    Thank you  President Lockhart   August 9, 2011 35 of 162               Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  It’s 1000, and I understand coffee is ready    Why don’t we take 20 minutes and come back at 1020?  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Okay  Why don’t we recommence?  President Plosser, if   you’re ready, you’re up    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Hoenig    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thanks  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Raskin   August 9, 2011 77 of 162               Thank you very much  Thank you, all  Let me try a   summary and then make a few comments   Participants were concerned about an apparent ebbing of economic growth momentum,   notwithstanding the possibility that the reversal of temporary factors such as the supply chain   disruptions and high energy prices could bump up activity in the near term  Significant   downward revisions to GDP data for both the first half and earlier years contributed to the   weaker outlook, as have financial disruptions  Many saw the risk to the recovery as now to the   downside, and some worry that the economy might be near stall speed  As one measure, the   estimated real equilibrium federal funds rate has fallen sharply  Others noted, however, that   slower potential growth may account for some of the weaker performance  Leverage and debt   also are retarding growth over a longer period  As to inflation, lower commodity prices will   reduce headline inflation, and overall, people see approximately balanced risks to the forecast   with respect to inflation  Uncertainty about the forecast may be, really and truly in this case,   higher than usual   Consumer spending has been slow or even declining, especially for low- and moderate-  income households, as households have continued to repair their balance sheets and as sentiment   August 9, 2011 80 of 162              has been poor  The declines in automobile purchases associated with the Japan disaster account   for some but not all of this weakness, which has been widespread across sectors  Conditions in   the labor market remain weak, as unemployment has increased, participation rates have fallen,   and the employment-to-population ratio is very low  Some of these phenomena can be explained   by heterogeneity among workers, including both skill loss ex post and ex ante differences, but   long-term unemployment can leave permanent scars on the labor force  Housing and   nonresidential construction remain weak, even though the rental housing sector is stronger  The   weakness of the housing sector has broader macro consequences through wealth, credit, and   business formation, for example   Business attitudes vary, with some seeing modest growth but a number of participants   citing issues of confidence, both economically and politically related  Large firms are doing   reasonably well as smaller firms struggle  For many firms, demand remains insufficient to   motivate significant hiring and investment, and uncertainty, including uncertainty about the   fiscal situation and the debt limit, has also limited expansion plans  Auto firms have done a good   job of overcoming supply chain disruptions and expect higher near-term production and profits    State and local governments continue to lay off workers, and federal spending will also be a   drag   Financial conditions have been turbulent, reflecting the European situation, the US debt   limit uncertainties and fiscal policy, the S&P downgrade, and increasing concerns about US   economic growth, both short term and long term  In Europe, rising borrowing rates for Italy and   Spain threaten a significant widening of their sovereign debt crisis, with implications for global   markets  Questions remain as to whether European authorities can stabilize the situation    Reflecting this turmoil, bank funding conditions continue to tighten in Europe, and US money   August 9, 2011 81 of 162              market mutual funds have reduced their exposures  There are also banking issues in the United   States, as several institutions have seen sharp declines in stock values and rises in their CDS   spreads  Credit rating downgrades could exacerbate that situation  However, the US banking   sector is generally stronger, with improved credit quality—for example, in credit cards—and   lending conditions returning somewhat more to normal, especially for business borrowers    Negative deposit rates, however, are a striking development   Inflation has recently moderated somewhat as prices of oil and other commodities have   receded, although reports of attempts to pass through cost increases persist  Core inflation has   been running high, but trimmed-mean and similar measures suggest that inflation remains   controlled  Nominal wages have remained subdued  Survey and financial measures of inflation   expectations have remained stable  Substantial uncertainties surround inflation forecasts,   including the difficulty of judging the degree of slack in the economy  Measurements of the   output and unemployment gaps are also important for assessing the ability of monetary policy to   stimulate growth  However, the combination of inflation and unemployment that we currently   see could be interpreted as putting too high a weight on inflation in our collective objective   function   I tried to make that organized  I don’t always succeed  Are there any comments or   questions?  [No response]  Let me just make a few comments  A lot of the main points have   been taken   I do think that the data we received during the intermeeting period were exceptionally   disappointing, and in particular, unusually, they came from three separate sources  First, we had   a two-year NIPA revision, which gave us a different perspective on the depth of the recession    Second, we had the downward revision to GDP in the first half of the year, particularly in the   August 9, 2011 82 of 162              first quarter  And then the intermeeting data on spending as well as the developments in the   financial markets were, on the whole, pretty weak  So it clearly is the case that, since the last   meeting, it’s appropriate to downgrade our outlook for the economy   One area of particular concern, I think, in terms of looking at the economic growth   potential, is consumption  Even given the poor performance of income and wealth, consumer   spending has been extremely restrained  There are various explanations for this  I think you   could put together standard economic models to help understand it  Of course, one standard   model is the permanent income hypothesis, which says that people spend based on their   expectations of future income, whether it’s cyclical or secularly induced  I think it’s very   notable that consumers may have been better forecasters than the FOMC in the past few years,   because their pessimism has been quite striking  I took note of a Michigan survey question that   has been asked since 1978  Over the next year or two, do you expect that your family income   will rise more or less than prices will go up?  In other words, will your real income rise?  A   strong majority of consumers now polled expect prices to rise faster—that is, they expect their   real income to fall  The degree of that is the all-time low  It is in fact a little bit lower than in   1979–80—when inflation, of course, was much higher than it is today—and even much lower   than during the recent recession  So people are very pessimistic about future income, whether   correctly or not we don’t know yet  Related to that and related to some of these leverage   discussions, another popular model of consumer spending is the buffer-stock model, which says   that people, generally speaking, do not have much wealth, and they try to maintain a moderate-  sized buffer to protect themselves against various emergencies like health problems  As we   know, through the crisis, we now have a great reduction in access to credit—for example,   through home equity lines and through home equity in general  Financial resources have been   August 9, 2011 83 of 162              substantially reduced; income has become much more uncertain  People have required payments   like rent and interest, gas, and so on  In that kind of world, people will also tend to be very   conservative about spending given the uncertainty in the environment  That consumption is as   cautious as it is is not unexplainable, but it certainly is one of the main factors that have been   affecting the outlook  Now, there are some factors that might make things look a little better    Real disposable income may grow more quickly in the third and fourth quarters as energy prices   decline  And, auto spending, which we’ve talked a lot about, may come back to some extent in   the third quarter  All of that said, I think, as has been pointed out, that we’ve been repeatedly   disappointed in economic growth overall  Consumer spending has been a very important part of   that, and interpreting that, I think, is a very important issue   Clearly, one of the factors affecting household spending and confidence is the labor   market  I only want to make two observations here, both of which have been alluded to already    One is that simply looking at the deeper recession that we had, based on the revisions, may   reduce the sense that there is some pent-up demand for labor  It could be that in some sense   labor is about appropriate given the amount of demand and production going on  I think that   should make us a little bit more pessimistic about future hiring intentions  The other thing that I   found very striking, and David Wilcox mentioned this in his remarks, is that currently in the   forecast the entire decline in the unemployment rate between now and the end of 2012 comes   from the fact that unemployment insurance programs are being ended, leaving the unemployed to   move from unemployment out of the labor force  Our government’s anti-unemployment   program seems to consist primarily of cutting off unemployment benefits so people won’t report   themselves as unemployed, and that’s really not an exaggeration  I think that labor market   conditions are quite concerning  Demand remains quite weak, and I think it remains the most   August 9, 2011 84 of 162              important single factor affecting the willingness of firms to hire and invest, although uncertainty   and other issues are also at work   I take note of the fiscal drag situation  We’ve been seeing, for example, as a very   concrete example, 20,000 to 30,000 jobs a month being lost in state and local governments,   which is pulling back overall job creation  We know there’s very significant fiscal drag on the   horizon coming from the federal side  We are hoping that there will be self-equilibrating factors   in the private sector to offset that  We don’t know that for sure, but we do know that fiscal drag   is going to happen   In the past few weeks, financial developments have been, of course, very important  I   think the developments in Europe are having real effects, not just in Europe but also in the   United States, by affecting optimism, risk-taking, and concerns about financial stability  And we   have seen our own issues, of course, related to the debt limit  These financial developments   since the last meeting are another major reason to cause us to downgrade our growth outlook   On the inflation side, as always, we want to be vigilant about inflation, but with oil down   almost 30 percent since its peak in April, with commodity prices in general down 15 percent   from their peaks in April, with automobile prices receding, and with inflation expectations   apparently reasonably stable, it doesn’t seem that high inflation is a near-term concern  Of   course, again, we’ll always want to pay close attention to that   Let me turn from this discussion of the outlook to try to say a few words to set the table   for our policy discussion  As you know, things have been changing rapidly in the past few   weeks  A week ago or so, when we sent out the statements for FOMC consideration, the way I   was thinking about it was as follows  On the one hand, we had significantly downgraded the   outlook for the economy while reducing our inflation concerns  That in itself would suggest a   August 9, 2011 85 of 162              serious consideration of additional monetary stimulus to try to achieve our dual mandate  On the   other hand, a week ago we had a lot of uncertainty about both output and inflation in the second   half  There was certainly some basis for waiting to see if we could learn more about how the   economy was going to evolve  In addition, we had a second dimension of uncertainty, which is   that besides deciding whether or not to take action, it’s a question of what action to take  In our   current regime, we now have, of course, a range of possible actions  It was my sense at that time   that having further work done by the staff and having a full discussion in September about what,   if any, action should be taken were probably the right ways to go  In that respect, it was my view   about a week ago that a statement that reflected the state of the economy and indicated our   willingness to respond as necessary would probably be sufficient  Over the past week, we’ve   seen a number of developments, most prominently the very severe stresses in the financial   system, including both the European stresses and those in our banking system—two banks, in   particular, were mentioned earlier—as well as the response to the downgrade and so on   Now, should we respond to those financial developments?  As President Bullard   mentioned, we don’t want to be engaging in giving out free puts  I don’t think that’s what we’re   talking about here  I think instead that there are some important connections between what’s   happening in the financial markets and what’s happening in the economy  First of all, financial   markets are giving us information  They’re telling us that there has been a general darkening of   mood and expectations about where the economy is going  Second, financial conditions   themselves have real effects on the economy  Not just lower asset prices, but increased stress   and reduced risk-taking will affect the ability of the economy to recover  Moreover, I think at   this point we’re going beyond just lower asset prices and an increased risk of financial crisis  In   August 9, 2011 86 of 162              addition, the decline in commodity prices, which is part of this financial adjustment, is reducing   inflation risk   My view at this point, and I’m just going to put this on the table before the go-round so   that everybody can comment and take the opportunity to respond, is that simply darkening our   statement—putting that out there—and taking no action have one big and one small   disadvantage  The big disadvantage is that I think the markets and the economy would react   very poorly to that  It seems as though the Fed is saying that the situation has gotten   significantly worse, but we’re not willing to do anything about it  I think that would raise   questions about what the Fed’s thinking is, what our objectives are, and what we plan to do in the   future  Perversely, also, if we don’t do anything but suggest that we may, I have a concern that   QE3 speculation may rise very significantly, and I actually would like to control that  I think all   of us—potentially all of us—would think that it’s not time yet, and we would much prefer not to   get into that particular policy direction   Is there something we can do today that would be meaningful, would show that we are   engaged, that would indicate that we are taking a step to try to improve economic conditions and   financial conditions, and that would give some clarity to our future plans but would still be   something that would be a reasonable step in the current context?  What I would like to propose   is to consider the idea of changing the “extended period” language to refer specifically to mid-  2013  That basically involves taking the “extended period” language from alternative A and   putting it in alternative B, and the language would just say that the Committee now expects that   the conditions that we’ve described, including low resource utilization and subdued inflation   expectations, are likely to warrant very low policy rates at least through mid-2013  I think that   doing that would be encouraging  As a response, it would be a reasonable response, a measured   August 9, 2011 87 of 162              response  Let me anticipate a few concerns about it  First, is this tying us down in a way that’s   dangerous or uncomfortable?  First of all, I would just note that it is, of course, quite consistent   with where markets are today  It’s also consistent with the Tealbook  It’s consistent with the   Taylor rule, at least the ’99 version of the Taylor rule  It’s consistent with the Taylor rule   applied to our projections  It’s consistent with our optimal control analyses as well  So clearly,   it’s not an outlandish proposal  At the same time, I think it would have some benefit because it   would cut off, or at least reduce, the probability of a near-term tightening, and again, it would   convey the sense that the Fed is willing to try to support recovery   President Bullard appropriately raised the question of contingency  Is this sufficiently   contingent?  Of course, the language is contingent  What it is saying is that we expect that these   specific conditions will lead to a situation in which low rates are warranted  What I would   suggest, and I think we’ll have more discussion of this, is that going forward—perhaps at   Jackson Hole and perhaps in September—we can spell out even more concretely how those   contingencies tie into our policy so that it becomes explicitly a rule-based or reaction function   type of behavior  In doing this, again, I think one of the benefits is that it will put a very high bar   on QE3 as we focus on this action and on other actions that we might take, but I think that would   be useful from a communication perspective  Will it do anything?  Again, I think at this point,   confidence and psychology are very important  I worry about us just leaving the situation   completely unaddressed, and, as I mentioned, I think it would have some effect on rates via the   expectation mechanism  I would note that there has been, for example, a lot of discussion about   leverage  Keeping inflation from being too low and keeping interest rates low actually help   reduce leverage, and so I think that it actually might have some direct benefit   August 9, 2011 88 of 162              This is a suggestion  I want to put it on the table initially  I think we could do more  I   think we could consider a commitment with respect to the balance sheet reinvestment policy as   well, and I’m certainly prepared to discuss that, but my own view is that this is the minimum we   should do if we want to avoid conveying essentially insouciance in the face of what is clearly a   deteriorating situation  With those initial observations, let me ask Bill to make his initial   comments, and then questions to Bill or to me will be fine, and then we’ll do our go-round on   policy  Bill    Thank you  Are there any questions?  President Lacker    President Lockhart, two hands    Are there others with this concern?  President Fisher    All right  Shall we just delete the sentence?  Any   objection?  President Kocherlakota, you were supporting that view, right?    Why don’t we just delete the sentence then?     Why don’t we just delete it?    Any other questions for Bill?  President Plosser    Any other questions?  [No response]  Are we ready for the   go-round?  Governor Yellen    Thank you  President Evans    Sorry  President Plosser    Certainly    Certainly we can talk about it, or that’s a step we could take   next time—either way  Michelle, did anyone get this?  Is it possible to circulate that sentence?      Okay  Any other questions?  President Evans    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Rosengren    President Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Fisher    Sure  President Hoenig    President Plosser    On your point about communications, I do face a speech in   a few weeks  And I’d be more than interested, either now or in some other context, in taking   instruction from this Committee about how you want me to phrase it  And in particular, one   thing I could do—I know there’s not unanimous agreement on this—is downplay that particular   option in favor of continuing to look at options, et cetera  But that’s something we could discuss    Governor Tarullo    President Evans    I’m going to call on President Williams and then   President Fisher, if he’s ready, after that  President Williams    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Okay  I need to interject here  I guess it won’t help to   argue for my position any further  We have two dissents, is that right?     President Plosser, do you intend to dissent?    Okay  That’s a very difficult position for me, obviously    Just to get a sense of the Committee’s preferences so that I understand them, if we were to go   back to alternative B as written with the forward-leaning language of the last paragraph, without   the “financial conditions”, how many dissents would I have?  Any dissents?  [Simultaneous   speakers]  I’m asking the question, just so I understand Committee preference    That’s right  Alternative B as written, except we take out   the “financial conditions” language and we use the more forward-leaning paragraph 4    No action at all    I’m trying to get preferences    Okay  Thank you  We have to get this done by 130  Yes?    Well, I’m going to stick with what I have  Let me just   make a comment, and I understand your concerns, but I just need to say a couple of things    Number one, I’m perfectly willing to accept the argument that monetary policy is not the main   tool, that this is not the main thing wrong with the economy, but it’s our duty to do what we can,   to be palliative, to help where we can, even if we can’t solve fiscal, structural, and other   problems  Number two, we have a mandate that says we should look at employment and   inflation  We’ve had a very marked reduction in the outlook since the last meeting  Not   responding in any way not only raises a question of whether we’re following our mandate, but it   also makes the markets uncertain because they don’t know what we’re doing  They can’t follow   our logic  Again, to put out a much darker statement and not to do anything strike me as being   inconsistent  I believe this step is the most modest possible step we could take  It’s completely   conditional; it could be offset by any change in conditions  It could be offset by asset sales, if   August 9, 2011 121 of 162              necessary  We will elaborate going forward exactly what the conditionality is, and I will look   forward to our discussions around the table  We will have a two-day meeting  I think I can   accede to that point, at least, for September  [Laughter]  And we will discuss all of this, and   we’ll continue with the subcommittee’s discussions about the appropriate use of an inflation   objective, which I do not believe is in any way inconsistent with this perspective, because what   we’re saying is, we believe that conditions will warrant, and “conditions warranting” means that   we meet our objectives  I don’t see any inconsistency of this with the inflation objective or that   framework  Again, I feel that not signaling to the market and to the public that we are at least   engaged in understanding that there is an issue here and that we’re trying, at least in a palliative   way, to respond to it, risks a real disconnect in terms of our communication, which I’m   unfortunately not willing to accept  It would be very unpleasant to have three dissents, but I   guess if that’s where we end up, that’s where we end up    Yes    Well, when I was talking about going back to the old   version, I was going to take the most aggressive language  But if you will not dissent, I will   certainly listen to your suggestions    Okay  Let’s go to President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lacker    Governor Duke    Thank you very much  President Bullard was first, I think    I don’t know that that helps, really  Tell me if it does   President Kocherlakota    No, that’s not true because, first of all, it is conditional  It’s   absolutely conditional  But even if it’s not an ironclad commitment, it’s communicating an   August 9, 2011 126 of 162              expectation and to the extent that there’s a misunderstanding or a disagreement it can be   effective  President Fisher    Some may interpret it that way, I suppose  But that’s the   appropriate date given our information    Could I turn to Governor Tarullo, please?    Well, I’m still with the “2013,” unless I have a suggestion   that will accommodate—    “The Committee currently projects that economic   conditions”?  Would that help anybody?    No  [Simultaneous speakers]    No, that doesn’t change anything    Does that help anybody?    No    I only heard one suggestion—the thing about the range of   tools—which is useful but doesn’t address the controversy here    How about this  “Based on current projections, the   Committee anticipates that economic conditions   ”?  Is that all right?    We’re going to the sentence now—about the “2013”    Paragraph 3 of alternative A, which says now, “The   Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions   ”, and would say “Based on current   projections, the Committee anticipates that economic conditions   ”      Yes  Will that help?  At all?    All right, you have five minutes  [Laughter]  All right    Governor Raskin, please    Thank you  All right  Well, let me get a proposal—sorry    Vice Chairman    Thank you  All right  Let me—Michelle tells us we need   to get this done as soon as possible    Yes, of course    “Based on current projections”?  Can you conceive of any   language that would help you?    All right  So what I’m proposing is alternative B  In the   first paragraph, we’ve struck the sentence—   August 9, 2011 135 of 162               No, alternative A involves the lengthening of the portfolio,   and I’m not going to introduce that discussion at this time  I’m sorry, but I promise we’ll do that   at the two-day meeting, which everyone has agreed to   So in alternative B, we’re scratching the “financial conditions” sentence from the first   paragraph  The second paragraph is unchanged  The third paragraph—let me ask President   Plosser now  Is there anything we can do for you in the last paragraph?    What about the language in paragraph 3, where it says now,   “The Committee continues to anticipate,” we’d say, “Based on its current projections, the   Committee anticipates that economic conditions   ”  Does that help?    A sufficient improvement?    Okay    With the proposed change?    It would be, “Based on its current projections, the   Committee anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and   a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low   levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013”  “At least two years”  How about   “for at least two years”?    It’s not political    “Extended,” “substantial”—    All right  Fine  President Rosengren    Are there any objections?    Alternative A—   August 9, 2011 137 of 162               Take out “financial conditions” in the first paragraph    And 3, which is identical now  Get rid of 4 completely    All right  Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of A—but just add the   sentence “The Committee also will maintain   ”—and then paragraph 4 of A    Yes  So it’s alternative A as written, eliminate the   “financial conditions” sentence, and insert at the end of paragraph 3 the material on   reinvestment    Paragraph 4 is as in alternative A, which is exactly what we   had  What did you want to say, Governor?    The beginning of the last paragraph is, “The Committee   discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a   August 9, 2011 138 of 162              context of price stability  It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming   information and is prepared to employ these tools as appropriate”    Yes, exactly what’s in B  The last two sentences in B    Dan, I don’t know  Is it worth the effort at this juncture?    Okay    All right  Let’s go through it now  So paragraphs 1 and 2   from alternative A—and 3 from A    Paragraph 1 in A less the “financial” sentence; then   paragraphs 2 and 3 from A and add to paragraph 3 the last two sentences—“The Committee also   will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings    The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is   prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate”  And then add the new 4  “The Committee   discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a   context of price stability  It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming   information and is prepared to employ these tools as appropriate”  [Simultaneous speakers]    All right  We’ll use communication to downplay the QE3    All right  Any further comments?  Would you please read the current statement?  And I   apologize, everyone, for the rush    Okay    Michelle, are you taking this down?    Here it is  “The Committee”—capital C—“discussed the   range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price   stability  It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is   prepared to employ these tools as appropriate”  Have you got it?    Okay    The last sentence—   August 9, 2011 140 of 162               No, let’s just leave it    That’s standard  Let’s leave it  Okay  Any further   questions or uncertainties?  Are you okay?  Let’s call the roll    Okay  Thank you  Lunch is available  Let’s take   20 minutes to get lunch, and then Linda Robertson will give a report to those who are still here    Our next meeting is September 20  Thank you   END OF MEETING   August 9, 2011 141 of 162     "
9299,2011-09-20,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  This is a joint meeting of the   Federal Open Market Committee and the Board  I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you  Let me start by welcoming Esther George to   the table  Tom Hoenig is still president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for another   10 days, and so officially you’re representing the Bank as first vice president, but at the next   meeting, you will, of course, be succeeding Tom  You’re well known to everyone around the   table  You’ve been in the System a long time, and you have a great deal of high regard  So   again, welcome and congratulations    Our first item is “Financial Developments in Open Market   Operations”  Let me turn it over to Brian Sack    Thank you  Questions for Brian?  President Plosser    Okay  Vice Chairman    President Lacker    President Fisher    Thanks  First of all, I think we all agree that the FOMC   makes policy based on our economic outlook, and the markets have to adapt to that  There’s a   bit of an observational equivalence, though, between markets in some sense forcing policy   actions and markets simply receiving good communication  We have become more transparent   in the past eight years or so  Our minutes, for example, have been a big source of information  I   recall very well the debates we had about moving the minutes, which used to be after the   subsequent meeting, into the intermeeting period  Of course, the minutes describe the options   and the discussion, and so I think that would be one mechanism  I take your point, and would   emphasize that as conditions warrant, we need to act appropriately, but I do think part of it, at   least, is coming from us guiding the markets in various ways in terms of what to anticipate    And to the extent that that’s true, it’s a sign of success that   we are transparent and communicating effectively  Other questions?  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Other questions?  President Kocherlakota    President Lacker    It’s a nice test of the two different theories of balance sheet   expansion  Is it reserves or is it the asset side?  Governor Raskin    Other questions for Brian?  [No response]  All right  We   need to vote to ratify domestic open market operations since the last meeting    Thank you  Without objection  Okay  The next item is a   discussion of alternative policy tools  We’ll start with a staff presentation  Our presenters are   Julie Remache, Seth Carpenter, and Dave Reifschneider  Who’s going to go first?    Thank you very much for a concise presentation of a much   more detailed set of memos, which were very helpful, and I thank you for that as well  Before   September 20–21, 2011 21 of 290              we go into a go-round, let’s have a question period  Are there any questions for the staff?    President Rosengren    President Fisher, you had a two-handed intervention?    President Kocherlakota    Other questions for the staff?  President Bullard    Other questions?  President Rosengren    President Pianalto    President Fisher    Thank you  Other questions?  [No response]  Okay  If you   would indulge me, I would like just to take a couple minutes to frame our go-round on our policy   tools  I see the Committee as having faced two challenges over the past two years  First, with   policy at the zero lower bound, we have had to be more creative and more unconventional in   trying to find ways to provide stimulus  All else being equal, we want to do as much staff   preparation, Committee buy-in, and Committee discussion on these alternative tools as possible    That is very important  However, it does create a little bit of inertia in the policy process  The   second challenge is that the economy has been very disappointing  It has underperformed, at   least relative to our expectations; it is a fact that our forecasts have been consistently too   optimistic, and we’ve had to respond with policy actions   And so those two facts create a certain kind of tension  On the one hand, you want to   move expeditiously to deal with an evolving situation  On the other hand, you want to make sure   that policies are well thought through and that the process is respected and everyone has had a   chance to have input  Now, those two things clearly came into conflict to some extent in August    I felt, and I still believe—and I think the evidence supports the view—that our policy action in   August was both sensible and consistent with our economic objectives  At the same time, even   those who were comfortable with the outcome may have been less comfortable with the process,   and I apologize for that  I think the only way to address this conflict is to do more contingency   planning, and that’s what this is all about  The idea here is to think forward and to think about   what we might do as the situation evolves  In particular, because we know what to do if the   economy gets stronger, what we really have to think about is what we’re going to do if the   economy weakens further   September 20–21, 2011 31 of 290              I would draw another distinction—which again will, I hope, provide some context—the   distinction between frameworks and tools  Our current framework is essentially a flexible   inflation-targeting framework, which means that in the medium term, we try to get inflation near   2 percent or something in that vicinity, consistent with price stability  But in the shorter term,   flexibility means that we have the ability to respond to shocks to the real side of the economy   and to try and guide the economy back toward its longer-term equilibrium  So that is the   approach we’ve been using, and that is, I believe, consistent with our dual mandate and with   central bank practice around the world   There are alternative frameworks—for example, nominal GDP targeting and price level   targeting as advocated, for example, by President Evans  These are obviously different, and, in   particular, they allow inflation to be at least temporarily higher than the long-term price stability   objective, albeit in what I would hope would be a transparent and disciplined way  In terms of   alternative frameworks, we are planning currently to talk about some at the next meeting  You   have already received some materials, and you should be receiving additional supporting   materials within the next few weeks, I hope, so that we can talk about frameworks in November   Now, that said, for today I think it is best for us to continue to assume that we are in a   flexible inflation-targeting framework  And then the question is, how can we best achieve the   objectives of that framework?  Putting aside the IOER—which a number of people are interested   in discussing, so I don’t mean to in any way eliminate that from the conversation—broadly   speaking, the tools that we have in a flexible inflation-targeting framework at the zero lower   bound are two  They are balance sheet tools and communications tools, and we’ve seen   presentations on each of those two areas  Our goal, as we go around the table, is to try to make   some assessments and provide some comments about those tools  In doing so, again, what we’re   September 20–21, 2011 32 of 290              doing today is contingency planning  We’re not making a policy decision today  So I hope that   we can talk about these alternative approaches and try to separate this discussion to some extent   from our policy preferences and our outlook   Let me just say a couple of words about communication because I think this is an area   where we’ve really only scratched the surface  I’ll say, just speaking personally, that at the zero   lower bound, communication tools are attractive  They are flexible  They don’t involve many of   the costs and risks associated with balance sheet tools, and they have a lot of academic support   from people like Michael Woodford as being an appropriate way to deal with the zero lower   bound  So I do think that this is something we should be looking at  In particular, as   Woodford’s work has shown, the communications approach is very consistent with flexible   inflation targeting  And alternative A, which has been excerpted in the memo and contains some   of this proposed communications approach—I will come back to this—was written in a way that   was intended to be consistent with a flexible inflation-targeting perspective  Specifically, I’d   like to say up front—and maybe it, I hope, will short-circuit some discussion—that it is not the   intention of this language to set a target for unemployment  We know the hazards of doing that    What instead is happening is that the policy projections are being made conditional on three   conditions—unemployment, inflation, and inflation expectations—and, in particular, the last two   are consistent with our flexible inflation-targeting framework  We could change it and say that   we’ll hold policy at zero until the Red Sox win the pennant—[laughter]—and inflation   expectations are at mandate-consistent levels, and it still would be consistent with our   framework, because we would have the outlet, the safety valve, that we will not press   expansionary policies beyond the point that an inflation-targeting central bank would accept   September 20–21, 2011 33 of 290              I do think this language, or something similar to it, is consistent with a flexible inflation-  targeting framework  And it’s robust, as was discussed briefly by Dave Reifschneider, even if   we, for example, misestimate the NAIRU or whatever the equivalent concept is  I think it has   some advantages over the “2013” language  In particular, like the language about mid-2013, it’s   a policy forecast, but instead of being time dependent, it’s state dependent, and it explains at   least the sufficient conditions that would keep us at zero  And because it is state dependent, (a) it   provides more clarity, more information; and (b) it allows the markets to respond to changes in   the data  Bad news, for example, would lead the market to expect that those conditions will not   be satisfied for a longer period, and interest rates would respond accordingly  The main point I   want to make here is, first, that communication is an important tool  I suspect that if conditions   continue to be disappointing, we will want, going forward, to use more communication tools, and   that’s why it’s very useful to have a conversation today  Second, the objective was to write a   communications approach that’s consistent with flexible inflation targeting  To the extent that   it’s not, we need to discuss that   Two final observations  I’ve heard a few people say that they were supportive of the   general approach, but they had concerns about the language or the exact implementation of the   approach  If that’s the case, I’m personally very open to alternatives  I’m very interested to hear   how we can better express our intentions and make a policy forecast that’s state contingent and   that also respects the dual mandate—I think that’s very important  So please don’t hesitate  The   other comment I’ve heard is that, while this may or may not be a constructive direction, we need   to do more work to prime the public, to talk to the Congress, et cetera  Speaking personally, that   also is something that I’m entirely willing to do  We’ll have the minutes describing this   conversation  I have a testimony in just a couple of weeks at the Joint Economic Committee    September 20–21, 2011 34 of 290              We have, of course, all of the various mechanisms for both public and congressional   communication  And if that’s the concern, I’d like to hear that, and maybe people would have   suggestions about how to go about that   To close, I look forward to the conversation  I hope we can talk about tools, at least to   some extent in the abstract, away from the policy decision, which will be tomorrow  And again,   I look forward to the input  So we’ll do a full go-round on these issues, and we’ll begin with   President Kocherlakota     Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Plosser    Thanks  I just want to ask one question  Obviously, a   policy tied only to unemployment would risk destabilizing inflation if you misestimated the u*    But, as I said at the beginning, we have the escape clauses of both projected inflation in the   medium term and inflation expectations  You mentioned that projected inflation is a weaker   condition, but, of course, that’s what all inflation-targeting central banks do  And then you also   mentioned the unemployment rate as being interpreted as a target  I just wanted to note that the   language describing the unemployment rate in A(2) comes directly from the FAQs that your   group put together for a public presentation explaining what unemployment is  I think the SEP   suggestion is an interesting one, for example, but I don’t quite understand why it was   inconsistent with the broad inflation-targeting framework    Okay    Yes    Vice Chairman    Okay  We understand the distinction between an inflation   target and an unemployment “target” in quotation marks  We understand that’s an important   distinction to make    Yes, Jim    That was the sense, I think, that the Vice Chairman was   reacting to—that there is a u* and a π* in the Taylor rule, and in that sense, it’s an anchor for or a   determinant of policy  The difference is that we can set π*; we can’t set u*    President Evans    President Kocherlakota    That’s correct    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Fisher    Again, we’re in a process of contingency planning, and   that’s exactly what motivates that    President Lockhart    Thank you  Let me just mention one point  A number of   people have mentioned the role of the projections, the SEP  I’m just raising this for   consideration  Would it make sense to make reference to the SEP in a statement?   For example,   you could say, “As indicated in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the   Committee judges that inflation between 17 and 2,” et cetera  Does that help at all, Charlie?    You don’t have to answer now if you’re not prepared, but that would be one way to refer to   information that’s already been out there, that I’ve already talked about—just something to put   on the table  We’ll put the pressure on President Williams to take us to lunch  [Laughter]    President Williams    I think I need to mention a very ticklish governance issue   that you raised, though  The interest rate is set, of course, by the FOMC, not by everyone around   the table equally  Would you somehow identify the FOMC projections vis-à-vis those   nonvoting, for example, in a given year?  That’s just a question for discussion    Okay  Lunchtime  Why don’t we go bring our lunch back   to the table, let’s say at 135—that will give us half an hour, and then we’ll commence again   even if people are still eating at that time  Thank you    [Luncheon recess]    Okay  Why don’t we recommence with our go-round    President Pianalto, you’re next on the list    Thank you  First Vice President George    Thank you  President Evans    Incredible  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Lacker   September 20–21, 2011 76 of 290               Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    You’re getting the lingo down really well  [Laughter]    Governor Tarullo    Thank you    President Lacker    Why don’t we do that first, and then we’ll take the   remaining comments  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Do you have a comment, President   Kocherlakota?    It falls to me to summarize  This was a very useful   discussion, and I’m certainly glad we had a two-day meeting because—[laughter]—it’s already   past 215, and I think we would be in big trouble now  Just a couple of comments  I’m not   going to try to summarize everything that was said  We will certainly—“we” being mostly Bill   English and his staff—be looking carefully at the transcript and trying to summarize from that   On the balance sheet tools, I think most people preferred the maturity extension program   to LSAPs at this juncture—with some notable exceptions, like President Bullard—on the   grounds that we should perhaps reserve the big gun for later  However, people raised questions   about the quantitative impact or the efficacy of that kind of tool, and observed that it’s a one-shot   tool—it can’t be repeated  I think those are valid questions  I’ll take the opportunity to   editorialize  Some of the very small numbers on rate changes that were being cited are roughly   consistent with a 25 to 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, which in normal times we   think is a pretty significant action  I would also comment, again editorializing, that the channels   of transmission are actually multifarious through many different ways in which interest rates   affect asset prices and behavior  In the paper on the stock prices that President Fisher cited, the   piece of research I did with Kenneth Kuttner, we found empirically that the biggest effect of   interest rates on stock prices was through its effect on risk aversion and risk-taking, and we’ve   been seeing big swings in risk-taking in asset markets  To the extent that we affect risk   preferences and risk-taking, that would be one channel  But to come back to the thrust of the   conversation, while not many people argued that these were positively harmful—except to the   September 20–21, 2011 110 of 290              extent that if they’re ineffective, they would harm our credibility—the question that was raised   was, how effective would they be?   One positive suggestion was made, which I think I’d like to just reiterate  A number of   people—I think starting with the Vice Chairman—made the suggestion about reinvesting   redeemed MBS back into MBS  If we did that, that would keep the MBS stock in our portfolio   constant  It would not increase it, nor would it increase the size of the portfolio  But it might   have the advantages, at least superficially, of addressing the increase in the spread between MBS   and Treasuries and reducing the pressure on longer-term Treasury markets  I think that’s an   intriguing idea, and what I’d like to do is ask Brian and Bill to talk about this and, in the   morning, give us your comments, if you would, about any risks or concerns you might have   about that  And then, depending on how things go in the conversation tomorrow, I may ask the   Committee if they see that as an improvement over alternatives  So let me just give you that fair   warning   On IOER, we had a pretty mixed view  On the one hand, people were concerned about   the perception that we are subsidizing banks, especially foreign banks, and noted that cutting   IOER would have at least a marginal impact on the cost of funds  On the other hand, a number   of concerns were expressed about market functioning, and Seth’s memo provided four or five   different areas of possible concern  I’m wondering, Seth, whether you have reached the limit of   human knowledge on this subject or whether looking at this a little further over the intermeeting   period, for example, or the next few weeks would be useful  Tell me if that’s not the case  Can   we get more insight into some of these potential costs and risks?    The way a lot of people put it is that there are unknowable   impacts on market functioning, including money market mutual funds, bank deposits and interest   on deposits, federal funds market, and so on  I don’t know whether more progress can be made   on this question or not, but perhaps you could give it some thought    Vice Chairman    It’s like, you drive the truck onto the bridge, and you—    I see  [Laughter]    Give us some sense of what further progress you think can   be made   September 20–21, 2011 112 of 290              We had the deepest and most interesting discussion on the communications issues    Clearly, there’s a lot of interest around the table in increasing our transparency, establishing   more information about our objectives, and giving more information about our reaction function    And in particular, we have the problem, or opportunity if you wish, to clarify the guidance that   we gave at the last meeting  I think this is something that should remain very firmly on the table   in the sense of something we should continue to work at closely  A lot of people suggested   making more use of the SEP, the Summary of Economic Projections, and that’s something we   should certainly talk about  For example, the view was expressed that the subtle distinctions   between an inflation target and the long-run unemployment rate could not be adequately   expressed in a statement and needed other kinds of communication like the SEP, press   conferences, speeches, et cetera  And I think that’s worth discussing  The possibility was also   raised of asking additional questions or getting forecasts of interest rates in the SEP  I do note   that—and I think this was raised by at least a couple of people—the SEP is, in the end, the   aggregation of our 17 or 19 opinions  It doesn’t have the imprimatur of a Committee decision,   and that’s a bit of a problem that we’ll have to take into account  But in terms of providing   information to the public, I think it is a useful direction   Governor Tarullo noted that our discussions today didn’t really address the worst-case   contingencies, which a number of people have brought up  And I would say that’s by design   because today we were talking about tools in the context of flexible inflation targeting  I think   that in a flexible inflation-targeting framework, we would try to respond to prices primarily   through lender-of-last-resort activities and liquidity provision  In terms of monetary policy   stimulation, there may ultimately be some limits to how much stimulus we can provide if we’re   going to maintain inflation at the mandate-consistent level  So that’s an issue to be talked about   September 20–21, 2011 113 of 290              further  In those “break glass” situations, I think we would want to at least discuss seriously   some of the alternative frameworks that have been discussed and proposed  Again, as I   mentioned, we’ll put that on the table for discussion at the next meeting  We certainly will talk   about the kinds of situations in which we might want to take more dramatic action   Thank you for this very useful conversation  Coffee is ready  Why don’t we take   20 minutes for coffee, and we’ll come back for the economic go-round   [Coffee break]    We’re finally to item 3 on the agenda    The “Economic and Financial Situation”—Larry Slifman,   Steve Kamin    Thank you  Questions?  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Other questions?  President Fisher    President Plosser    Other questions?  [No response]  Okay  Seeing no   questions, we’re ready for our economic go-round, and I will start with President Rosengren    Thank you  President Lacker   September 20–21, 2011 126 of 290               Thank you, President Lacker  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  First Vice President George    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you    President Bullard    I can confirm that from some meetings of my own  So   they’re keeping the secret very, very tightly to the vest  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much  You’re certainly fully employed    [Laughter]  All right  We will recommence tomorrow morning at 900 am  A reception is   available on the terrace, followed by an informal dinner  No business will be done  Thank you,   all   [Meeting recessed]       September 20–21, 2011 177 of 290              September 21 Session      Good morning, everybody  Let me start this morning with   the summary of the economic go-round that I heard yesterday   Participants took note of continued slow economic growth and the increased probability   of recession, which was put at about one-third by some models and forecasters  The reversal of   some temporary factors that held back economic growth in the first half was positive, but   financial stresses related to developments in Europe, and other factors, have offset much of the   expected rebound  However, some of this slowdown may reflect supply-side damage and   reduced potential as well as Reinhart–Rogoff effects related to the financial crisis  Going   forward, risks to the recovery continue to appear to be to the downside as growth near stall speed   makes the economy more vulnerable to shocks  Inflation has not yet come down by as much as   expected  Core inflation has picked up, and there is some uncertainty about whether that   increase is temporary or not  Most saw inflation as likely to move toward mandate-consistent   levels in the medium term, with some seeing approximately balanced risks, but others now   seeing risks to the upside  It was noted that, unfortunately, growth has come in below, and   inflation above, forecasts made a year ago   Households and small businesses are very pessimistic, with consumer sentiment at   historically low levels  Households expect their real incomes to fall and their financial   circumstances to worsen  Consumption growth is weak, with some categories of real consumer   spending having declined since the spring  The labor market has deteriorated further, with   workweeks and aggregate hours worked declining  Participants debated the extent to which   persistent unemployment is structural or is becoming structural  Consumer debt has declined,   September 20–21, 2011 178 of 290              reflecting more reduced propensity to borrow than a restricted supply of credit  Housing markets   remain dysfunctional, and some workers face the problem of house lock   Businesses have become more anxious in response to increased recession risks and   ongoing economic and political uncertainty, including uncertainty about US fiscal policy,   regulatory policy, and financial developments  Business sentiment and expectations of future   activity are flat to down  Most firms see limited need to hire, and some find it difficult to attract   workers with the specific skills that they need, although this may reflect greater pickiness on the   part of employers  Some firms have contingency plans to cut employment and investment    Export demand for manufacturers and commodity producers remains healthy despite some signs   of slowing in a global economy  High material costs remain a problem for some firms  Among   key sectors, commodity-related sectors such as energy, agriculture, and mining, as well as   tourism and some manufacturers, are doing well  Anecdotal reports, though, from   communications, high-tech, and transportation firms are consistent with slowing growth  Fiscal   drag is likely to be an increasing issue in both the United States and in Europe   Financial conditions have continued to be strained—even reminiscent of 2008 in some   dimensions  European sovereign debt and banking problems have the potential to worsen   significantly, with potentially serious implications for the US financial system and economy    Some large US banks have seen further pressure on their stock prices and CDS, showing some   potential vulnerability, though they are generally stronger than their European counterparts with   respect to capital and liquidity  Money market mutual funds and other lenders are putting   pressure on the dollar funding of European banks, which have a dangerous mismatch of short-  term funding and long-term assets  More supervisory attention is needed in the US, both for   financial stability purposes and to help unclog the monetary transmission mechanism  For most   September 20–21, 2011 179 of 290              US banks, credit quality has continued to improve and banks are generally willing to lend    However, loan demand is perceived to be weak, and mortgage servicing is becoming   unprofitable   Some see inflation as likely to moderate from its current above-target levels, reflecting   greater stability in commodity prices and a reversal of some factors affecting core inflation    Wages and salaries are growing slowly, although benefits are rising somewhat faster, and unit   labor costs are flat  Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and measures of underlying   inflation, such as trimmed mean inflation, remain around 2 percent  On the other hand, inflation   has not yet fallen to the extent expected, reflecting the continued effects of high commodity   prices, higher shelter costs, and perhaps some stickiness in core inflation  Uncertainty about the   future course of inflation remains significant, given our inability to predict commodity prices and   the difficulty of assessing slack, expectations, and other fundamental determinants of the   inflation rate   A number of people commented on the difficulty of assessing the effect of policy given,   in particular, that some normal channels of transmission appear to be broken   That is my summary  First, any comments or reactions?  [No response]  Let me now ask,   as I have been doing this for quite a while, is this still helpful?    Okay  Good  Well, I’ll continue to do it  It is good for me    It forces me to think about what everybody is saying  So my naptime was definitely constrained   Let me just make a few comments of my own, building very much on the comments that   we heard around the table  I don’t have a great deal new to say  I think the most important   September 20–21, 2011 180 of 290              development over the summer is that financial instability looks to be rearing its ugly head once   again  We are not yet, of course, at the level of 2008, but some of the same adverse feedback   loop between the economy and financial conditions looks to be in operation  Others have   discussed the European situation at some length already  Like others, my presumption has been   that the European leaders will do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro and, more broadly,   the European project  Even for Germany, which has in some sense the most to lose in terms of   transfers and bailouts, the benefits of the euro, the single market, and close political cooperation   have always seemed to me to significantly outweigh the direct fiscal costs of saving Europe    That has been my view until now  I have been following, though, very closely developments in   Europe, and as I mentioned, I had the opportunity to attend two extended meetings last week,   one at the G-7 and one in Basel, and I have become more concerned about the ability of   Europeans to manage this  Their political and coordination problems are extraordinarily   difficult, and I can only say—and I know this will be in the transcript in five years—but I think   there is some lack of imagination in the policymaking that is going on now  There seems to be a   very myopic focus now on getting the July 21 agreements ratified, which is in itself a difficult   political task, but I think everybody recognizes that the July 21 agreements, particularly the size   of the EFSF, will not be sufficient  Meanwhile, time is growing short  The Greek situation is   becoming worse   There is a focus on financial conditions, but the European macroeconomy is also slowing    On the one hand, they have had—even more so than we do—the stress from financial conditions,   tightening credit conditions, falling stock prices, weaker banks, and so on  But they are also very   much in the mode of monetary and fiscal tightness; whatever view you might have about the   longer term, in the short term, it seems likely to be a negative for their cyclical recovery  It   September 20–21, 2011 181 of 290              seems clear that persuading taxpayers to approve transfers will be harder if unemployment is   higher than if it is lower  On the politics, Jean-Claude Trichet has, on a number of occasions,   drawn the comparison to the US House vote on the TARP  Recall that there was a failed vote,   the stock market expressed its displeasure, and the Congress went back and narrowly passed the   TARP  He takes that as a point of argument, that Europe eventually will see the necessity of   taking action and will do so, which may be true, but I reminded him that when this happened   Lehman had already failed, and we already were seeing some of the implications of that for the   financial system  Moreover, of course, the US House is one house and one country, and in   Europe we are dealing with 17 countries and a complex political environment   Where we are is reminiscent of Henry Kissinger’s comment that there is nobody to call in   Europe  The only real effective Pan-European institution is the ECB, which has been doing, I   think, on the whole, a pretty good job  It certainly has been helping to assure the short-term   funding for banks, and Trichet himself has done a lot to try to develop a consensus in Europe and   to keep reminding leaders of the importance of avoiding a financial calamity  In that respect, the   fact that Trichet is retiring at the end of October is probably not a good thing  Mario Draghi is a   very capable individual, but his influence and his room for operation will be no doubt more   restricted than Trichet’s was, if for no other reason than he is Italian and will have to demonstrate   that he is comfortable with the German perspective  So it is a difficult situation  Of course, we   are all monitoring it  There is not a lot that we can do directly other than to try to protect our   own financial system, to try to help support dollar funding in Europe, and to think about what   responses we would have in case of a blowup  Now, all of that being said, I think these are   situations that we have to be very attentive to  But given the low likelihood that this will be   completely and entirely resolved any time soon, we have to take into account the fact that we   September 20–21, 2011 182 of 290              should expect ongoing financial stress and periodic alarms and scares even if the situation   doesn’t get out of control   My own assessment is that the instability in financial markets, increase in spreads,   decline in stock prices, increased stock volatility—all of those things taken together are at least   one important reason why the bounceback in the second half that we were anticipating has been   weaker than we had hoped  Not only have financial conditions affected household wealth and   the cost of credit by increasing spreads, for example, but they have led to increased risk aversion,   both in markets, I think, and in the real economy, and have affected sentiment as well  So part of   the reason I think sentiment dropped so sharply in the summer was because of stock market   swings that suggested that we were perhaps near a new crisis situation   In thinking about both the economy and about monetary policy, we should take into   account the fact that monetary policy is only one input into a broader array of financial   conditions, which in turn affect the state of the economy  Financial conditions have deteriorated    If you look at financial conditions indexes, for example, they show considerable tightening  In   thinking about the impact of our policy on the economy, the risk of inflation, and so on, we   ought to take that broader financial stress into account  We also should take into account the fact   that the financial stress we are seeing is not localized to the United States  It is, of course,   global, and countries all over the world—suggested, for example, by Brazil’s recent cut in its   policy rate—are seeing slowdowns both directly through financial factors, including capital   outflows now from some emerging markets, as well as from slowing export demand from the   advanced economies  One of the consequences of that is that seems to make a surge in   commodity prices much less likely if emerging markets are going to grow more slowly  I’d note   that copper prices, for example, are now at the lowest level of the year, and the lead story in the   September 20–21, 2011 183 of 290              Financial Times this morning was about how firms are delaying their deliveries of metals   because they are concerned about demand  The Dallas Fed has led the research effort in the   System talking about how global conditions affect US inflation  I think here is a very clear and   transparent example  And, again, to the extent that financial conditions remain stressed, and that   affects global growth, that in turn will feed back into commodity price pressures in the US   economy   A lot has already been said about the real economy in the US  I do continue to be   concerned that momentum is slipping away, and that we are nearing stall speed  You can take   several different views of stall speed  As I have said before, I put some credence in these sorts of   two-state models, which suggest that there is a tipping point  But even if you don’t accept that,   clearly, if you are growing very slowly, as Governor Tarullo and others noted, you are quite   vulnerable to new shocks, which are always possible  The high-frequency data have been pretty   weak  In the labor market, for example, we noted the very weak jobs report this most recent   month, even adjusted for the strike  But beyond the weak payrolls, as Governor Raskin   mentioned, average workweeks and total hours worked actually fell  UI claims have popped up   again by about 30,000 or so  Expected labor market conditions in both the Michigan and   Conference Board surveys have deteriorated quite significantly  So there is a sense that in the   labor market conditions are worsening  In consumption, Governor Yellen talked about some of   the data  Core retail sales were flat in August  Auto sales have been up, but that is presumably   only a temporary adjustment  Consumer confidence measures and expectations of future   financial conditions, and so on, as I and others have noted, are very much weaker  In the   household and labor market sectors, I think most of the indicators are suggestive of slowing and   increased risk of recession in the near term   September 20–21, 2011 184 of 290              On the production and investment side, I think the data are somewhat more mixed  We   have seen, for example, the auto recovery, and industrial production, even outside of autos, has   held up reasonably well  Net exports in July were pretty strong  Orders and shipments have   been reasonably strong, and we are still seeing manufacturing activity driven both by continued   equipment and software investment and by exports abroad  That being said, the forward-looking   and survey indicators here also are not terribly encouraging  For example, the Fed regional   surveys, the ISM, and so on, have generally shown more pessimism about the future on the part   of businesses  Another important indicator, architectural billings, has dropped quite sharply,   which is indicative of future construction   Putting that all together, I think that we have reason to be concerned that the financial   stress we are seeing is going to, at a minimum, keep economic growth at a very slow pace  And   it is difficult to see what is going to help, unless financial conditions miraculously normalize  In   particular, I wouldn’t expect any help from fiscal policy; fiscal drag will be increasing  And in   terms of pessimism, uncertainty, et cetera, the fact that we have a presidential election year is not   likely to create a lot of calm and agreement in Washington  The point is that it is difficult to see   where the strength is going to come from  That being said, if the past few years have taught us   anything, it is that humility in our forecasting is always in order  The economy does seem to still   be growing, and a few better numbers could improve sentiment  But at this point, I think the   relatively weak forecast is the right one   I agree that inflation is too high, but I do think that it will moderate  My expectation is   that commodity prices are unlikely to spike, and they will probably continue to be relatively soft    To the extent that we continue to have financial stresses, the dollar tends to benefit, which is not   good for exports but is good for import prices  We discussed inflation expectations  Looking at   September 20–21, 2011 185 of 290              the breakevens, I agree that a good part of the movement in the breakevens is due to   idiosyncratic factors, but there are other indicators, such inflation in swaps, the Cleveland   measure and things of that sort that suggest there has been some decline in inflation expectations    In any case, even in anticipation of possible action by the Fed, there obviously has not been any   upside breakout in inflation expectations  There was also an interesting discussion around the   table about the Phillips curve  I don’t have a lot to add except to make just one very elementary   observation, which was that the original Phillips curve in 1958 was a relationship between   wages, not prices, and unemployment  I think it is pretty clear we have not yet seen any upward   pressure on nominal wages, although, in full honesty, I have to agree that sometimes wages are   not well measured and some of the effects can be lagged  But at least through that particular   mechanism, there is not a lot of indication of price pressure    To summarize the outlook, I think the weakness of the real side is a serious concern  We   have ongoing financial stresses  We need to take that into account   Let me make a couple of final comments on the discussion about the structure of the   economy  Two observations  One that was made by a number of people is that the transmission   channels for monetary policy have been in some cases attenuated, weakened, clogged, however   you want to put it  I would note that that argument cuts both ways  I don’t think it is literally the   case that monetary policy is completely ineffective  I think we can see the effects on financial   markets, which in turn must be affecting wealth, confidence, and some other determinants of   spending and production  To the extent that transmission is weaker, that could be used to argue   for more stimulus rather than less stimulus  But it does cut both ways   Likewise, on the arguments about structural unemployment, it is true that as slack, as   conventionally defined, declines, then the scope for monetary policy to have productive effects   September 20–21, 2011 186 of 290              on real output is restricted  But remember, our story is that the increase in structural   unemployment is coming, in part, because of prolonged cyclical conditions that are affecting the   long-term unemployed and are affecting manufacturing capacity  In other words, there are   hysteresis-type effects  To the extent that you think that those are important, that might, in fact,   cut both ways  It might be an argument for being more, rather than less, aggressive in monetary   policy   Those are my remarks  I would be happy to take any questions or comments, and then   we can go to the policy round  [No response]  Okay  Seeing none, let me turn now to Seth   Carpenter to hear about any further work that could be done on the IOER, and then maybe from   Brian and Bill English on the MBS issue    You know, you face the difficulty of talking to outsiders   without tipping a likely move  You need to think about whether it’s possible to disguise that   discussion in the context of a broader set of issues about market function, for example    That sounds like a useful idea  President Lacker    Okay  Thank you  Bill     Thank you, Bill  Any questions?  President Kocherlakota    I think the one thing everybody agrees on is that the mid-  2013 language needs further elaboration  And we will continue to work on that    That is certainly a useful suggestion  President Fisher      The 12-month numbers have not come down mechanically   because some of the deflation-like numbers are being left out    President Lacker   September 20–21, 2011 194 of 290               Well, except that in the August statement, which is the first   page of the handout, we said, “More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and   some commodities have declined from their earlier peaks”    It’s a fair question  We could say inflation appears to be   moderating, which might be better given the commodity price behavior  Let’s put that down as   something for consideration if anyone wants to advocate that  President Evans    Except that one suggestion that the Vice Chairman and   others have championed is that the first paragraph ought to be sort of a retrospective of what we   see has happened and that our forecast should be in a different part of the statement    I don’t want to go through that whole discussion again, but   a very similar concept is “medium-term projections of inflation,” which would be equivalent to   “underlying”    I’m sorry  President Pianalto, did I skip you?  Did you have   a question?    Okay  Go ahead    President Fisher    President Lockhart    President Lacker    Is some of it due to net supply–demand balance?  Is there a   change in the flows, Brian?    A two-hander from the Vice Chairman    Can we save the substance for the go-round?  [Laughter]    President Plosser    Any other questions?  President Lacker    It could be the case  Why can’t it be the case?  Suppose we   could buy corporate bonds in large amounts  We would be effectively, through money creation,   September 20–21, 2011 203 of 290              financing credit extension  We’d be a new source of credit extension  I’m not saying that’s a   good way to allocate resources, but it would certainly affect spreads    That’s only with a total output being given  This is the   basic error of the crowding out arguments that you’ve been hearing, which is that holding output   constant, if you increase deficits, you’re going to reduce investment  That’s not true if output is,   in turn, endogenous and responds to fiscal conditions  If output responds to monetary policy   stimulus, that’s going to affect income and saving   I feel like we pretty much covered the issue here  [Laughter]  Any further questions?    [No response]  If not, why don’t we just go now into the go-round?  And we’ll start at the far   west of the country with President Williams    Thank you  President Bullard    Could I just explore that for just a second?  The only   objection is that we also say in the next paragraph, “The Committee anticipates inflation will   settle in coming quarters,” which is a little bit repetitive  What about something like the earlier   suggestion, “Inflation appears to be moderating;” is that better?  It’s more descriptive, rather than   pure forecast    So, it “appears”—what is your view?    “Inflation appears to be moderating”  Does that help?    Let’s see  President Kocherlakota    That’s your proposal, and others can respond as we go   around  Please continue    Thank you  President Lacker    There was some evidence that the reaction affected market   expectations of the continuation policy, and that reduced the stimulus impact  Both internally   and externally, assuming we do the maturity extension, I think we ought to note it has its own   legitimate benefits  In particular, it does not create massive additional excess reserves, which   September 20–21, 2011 215 of 290              could create problems for our banking system  Second—and I think the evidence already   suggests this in terms of what we are seeing in markets—because it doesn’t increase high-  powered money, it may have less effect on inflation expectations, which would be a positive   from your perspective  I think it has some legitimate benefits, even aside from these   calculations  Let me just assure everybody that we will do what we need to do, and political   interference will not determine our policy actions    Thank you  If I might just say one word about the analytics   between the 1970s and today  There is, of course, one very important distinction, which is that   we are at the zero lower bound in the liquidity trap  You are familiar with the Krugman 1998   paper, which says in that particular case there may in fact be a permanent tradeoff—or at least a   very long-lasting tradeoff—because only by increasing inflation expectations can you lower real   rates at the zero bound  I’m sure you know that literature  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    You said conditional on B, you thought inflation would be   what?    I think there has been a miscommunication that I do need to   address—just a couple of preliminary points  There is a pretty broad agreement that we are   flexible inflation targeters, and President Bullard and others have made that acknowledgement    That is the only one that is consistent with the dual mandate so that means that we are looking at   medium-term inflation and allowing for some flexibility in the short run   September 20–21, 2011 227 of 290              Just a comment on the Taylor rule, which is on current variables, so a worsening in the   outlook associated with financial distress would not appear in any way in that kind of model   But let me address the thing that you have said a number of times, and I really don’t   understand  It’s true that I have said in a number of speeches that our target is 2 percent or a bit   less, by which I mean that if you look at the SEP, it reports that the central tendency of our   Committee is 17 to 20 percent  What I’m saying, basically, is that the target is 185, let’s say    What I have never said—and I don’t think anybody around this table has ever said—is that we   will not tolerate inflation above 2 percent  That is a very different proposition  Under a flexible   inflation-targeting regime, with quadratic preferences or whatever weights you want to put in it,   depending on the state of unemployment, there would be times when you would tolerate inflation   a bit above the target  In particular, there is no inconsistency with having inflation a bit above 2   percent and having a π* that is 185 percent  I understand that you have concerns, and you have   every right to disagree  But on that one point, I really don’t think that that is correct  The ECB   has a somewhat different kind of approach where they seem to have a ceiling  But we have   never expressed a ceiling approach to inflation  Rather, we have a target around which there is   going to be some random variation and policy variation    President Plosser    Thank you  Why don’t we take 15 minutes for coffee, and   then we will come back  Thank you   [Coffee break]     Let’s turn now to President Pianalto    Thank you  President Evans   September 20–21, 2011 233 of 290               Thank you  First Vice President George    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Governor Duke   September 20–21, 2011 239 of 290               Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for comments    Arthur Burns once wrote a speech called “The Anguish of Central Banking”  I can really relate   to that  [Laughter]  Many of you are taking strong positions for debating purposes, but I am sure   all of you are introspective and appreciate how very important these decisions are and how   difficult they are given how little we know and given the wide range of complex economic and   political forces—and even natural forces from hurricanes to earthquakes—that are at play as we   think about this  These are very, very difficult decisions, and I appreciate everyone’s serious   consideration   I was very pleased that we made a good start on contingency planning  What it tells me,   though, is that as difficult as the decisions are today, they conceivably could get a lot more   difficult  For example, there are scenarios where deflation risk increases, and we look at LSAPs   and have to figure out how we would manage that  There are scenarios where we would want to   change our framework  I suspect that, barring a major change in the outlook in the next few   September 20–21, 2011 247 of 290              weeks, it’s going to take us a bit of time to fully work through all of those options  I am,   therefore, not sure what the next steps are likely to be and how quickly they will come   That fact that it’s difficult to judge how quickly and how aggressively we’ll be able to   move in the future is a consideration for me because I do think that the recovery is in some   danger  Recession risks are increased  Financial volatility and financial stress are very   important headwinds  At the same time, while acknowledging that inflation hasn’t fallen as   quickly as we expected, all the fundamentals suggest that, as best as we can tell—and of course,   our forecasting is not particularly good—most of the pressures are toward stabilization or decline   in inflation  Given that, I feel that we need some kind of bridge from now until the time when   we either face some even more dangerous situation or choose to make fundamental changes in   our framework or communication  For that reason, taking into account the very good arguments   made—I was going to say on both sides, but there are probably about five or six different sides   here [laughter]—I would propose to recommend alternative B to the Committee today  The idea   is that we will provide some support for the economy and some reassurance that the Fed   continues to be there  Clearly, it’s not a panacea, as a number of people have pointed out, but I   do think of it as a bridge toward whatever future action this Committee may find to be   appropriate   I favor the reinvestment into MBS  I note for those concerned about this reinvestment   that all this does is maintain our current level of MBS  It doesn’t increase either our balance   sheet size or our holdings of MBS  It has the advantage, first of all, of focusing on a troubled   sector—the housing sector  But we also talked a lot about market functioning the last two days,   and by reducing the purchases of longer-term Treasuries, we’ll actually reduce some of the   pressures in the market functioning in the Treasury market  I think that’s constructive  That’s   September 20–21, 2011 248 of 290              my recommendation  I do want to reiterate what I said before about maturity extension  It is a   different policy from the LSAP  It is not as powerful, and it is, of course, not repeatable, but its   advantages include having fewer implications for excess reserves, for the size of the balance   sheet, for our exit, and for inflation expectations  In those respects, it’s a policy worth   considering   In terms of the language, in the first paragraph we’ve had two suggestions on inflation    One is “inflation has moderated somewhat since earlier in the year”  The other is “inflation   appears to be moderating”  I don’t feel strongly about that  Does anyone have a comment?    President Lacker    That’s fine with me  Is that okay?    President Plosser    And that’s what it says in the sentence here, too    Right, but we count those  “Appears to have moderated,” is   that fine?  All right  Any objection?  Okay  “Inflation appears to have moderated”   I’m going to come back to 3 versus 3′ because I would like to hear the Committee’s view   on that decision  First, on paragraph 4, does anyone have a reaction to the Vice Chairman’s   suggestion of reordering those two sentences?  Any particular concerns?   September 20–21, 2011 249 of 290               If we did that, it would be, “to help support conditions in   mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest    in agency mortgage-backed securities    In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy rolling over maturing Treasury   securities at auction”  Have you got that?   I have a compromise suggestion on paragraph 6  On the one hand, as Governor Raskin   very appropriately pointed out, we did discuss the range of policy tools  The statement should   correlate to some extent with the events of the meeting  On the other hand, I think that “the full   range of its tools” is a little aggressive  I would propose that, as a number of people have   suggested, we go back to the language of August, which is identical to this without the brackets    “Discussed the range of policy tools” is a reasonable step  I don’t think it promises any   additional action in the near term  Is that okay?    Let’s make “these” into “its”  In other words, let’s just take   paragraph 6 as it stands without the brackets, which is essentially the August language   Now the somewhat substantive decision is 3 versus 3′, and we will come back to a couple   of issues there in a minute  Paragraph 3 gives the full amount, but it does note that there will be   review of the program in light of incoming information  Paragraph 3′, which is more along the   lines that President Bullard has advocated, gives a monthly rate  Perhaps it’s a bit more   contingent  We will have the same last sentence in either case, which will be some kind of   regular review  I’d be inclined to take a straw poll on this decision unless there’s anyone who   September 20–21, 2011 250 of 290              wants to make a comment  Anyone?  [No response]  How many are in favor of 3, which gives   the $400 billion total number?  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven  How   many are in favor of 3′?  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six    What?    No, that’s fine    That’s all right  Your wisdom is still welcome even if you   don’t agree with all of what we’re doing here  [Laughter]  Did we have seven to six?  I see a   mild majority for 3   Finally, but in order to maintain the review aspect, President Rosengren, you wanted to   change the last sentence there, “regular review”  back to what was in August?  Is that right?    The last sentence of paragraph 3 now says, “The Committee   will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity   extension program in light of incoming information”  What we had in August was, “The   Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is   prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate,” a simpler statement  Any preferences?  Jim,   do you have a preference?  Narayana?    Are you okay?  I hope this is not too complicated  Let’s   change the last sentence of 3 to the analogous sentence from August  Are there other comments,   suggestions?  President Lacker    Yes, it does    It’s the MEP, clearly  You know how much attention they   paid to LSAP, right?  [Laughter]    I understand that    We should have done statement A, which has both the MEP   and the communications, so that we could have “Twist and Shout”  [Laughter]  Never mind  It   wasn’t my idea  Further comments?     In a moment we’ll take a vote  Let me say that at the end of the vote, Brian, you’re going   to talk just a little bit about implementation?    Following that, after the end of meeting announcements,   we’ll have lunch, and Linda, I believe, will give us a congressional update    She is prepared to do so  Please, are you able to give the   statement?   September 20–21, 2011 252 of 290               Okay    Yes    Thank you  Brian, do you want to take a couple of   minutes?    Thank you  Any questions for Brian?  President Lacker    We have been very clear  We don’t want to involve the   Treasury in monetary policy decisions or monetary policy execution    There was a Financial Times story, which I believe made   the point that should the Federal Reserve undertake any kind of maturity extension program, the   Treasury would not react to that  That’s the appropriate thing we’ve asked them to do, and I’ve   received assurances to that effect as well  Any other questions?  [No response]   First, let me note that we’ll have a special topic in January called “The Role of Financial   Conditions in Economic Recovery Lending and Leverage,” which was a very popular winner   among the FOMC participants and certainly is a topical issue  I want to thank the Federal   Reserve Bank of San Francisco for agreeing to lead the preparations for that special topic  The   next meeting is another two-day meeting, fortunately, Tuesday and Wednesday, November 1–2    Lunch is available, and for those who can stay, Linda Robertson will be providing a presentation    President Lockhart    You should help me, Bill  My understanding is that we   expect to get the framework memos out exceptionally early in the intermeeting period    If there are Reserve Bank contributions that would like to   be made, please be in touch with Bill, and we’ll try to coordinate additional materials    What else would you suggest?    We’re certainly prepared to do that, either assuming we get   early preparations or if the situation changes in a significant way  Governor Tarullo    Oh, yes    Well, on the purely financial stability side, we have an   ongoing LISCC, an Office of Financial Stability, and other coordination occurring on an   operational daily basis    Certainly, but again, the LISCC, for example, is a   Systemwide committee, which in principle can report    Not every Reserve Bank?  Your point is taken  I don’t   know if Nellie is here  We will try to make sure that there is some kind of call at an appropriate   time, particularly if there are any important developments    What?    Yes    There will be some minutes  That’s inevitable   September 20–21, 2011 260 of 290               Again, the liquidity issues or the financial stability issues   don’t have to take place in this particular context    President Lacker    We will have a full interaction with the System and make   sure that everybody is kept abreast  The meeting is adjourned  Thank you   END OF MEETING   September 20–21, 2011 261 of 290     "
9325,2011-11-01,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  This is a joint FOMC–Board   meeting  I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you  We welcome you, Esther George, in your new   capacity as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  Welcome again    Before launching into our official business, President Fisher   needs to describe an intra–Reserve Bank transaction  President Fisher    Okay  Meeting is adjourned  [Laughter]   Let’s turn to item 1 on the agenda  The retirement of Dave Stockton opens up a vacancy    We propose to select David Wilcox as economist for the FOMC, and Larry Slifman as associate   economist, effective until the organizational meeting in January 2012  No objections?  [No   response]  All right  Thank you very much   Let’s turn now to item 2 on monetary policy frameworks  Let me begin the discussion by   turning to Michael Kiley, who will lead the staff presentation    Thank you very much  The floor is open for questions  Let   me start with a quick one  In the nominal GDP targeting on exhibit 2 we show a gradual   approach to the target  How quickly do you assume that actual nominal GDP approaches the   trend level, and how do you communicate that to the public?    How do you communicate how aggressively you are going   to respond to the gap?    All right  Thank you  Other questions?  President Lacker    Governor Raskin    Vice Chairman    On the other hand, nominal income targeting is only an   approximation of the optimal path, so a lot depends on the quality of the approximation as well    President Kocherlakota    President Bullard    Thank you  President Plosser    Any other questions?  [No response]  Well, we’re about   ready for a go-round and discussion  I’d like to make a couple of framing comments   First of all, let me thank the staff, for I think we can all agree that their work has been   extraordinarily helpful, really first rate, and it helped me think about this quite a bit  Thanks very   much for that work done under pressure of time   One might think that a discussion of policy frameworks is a little bit arcane, academic,   and off point, but actually, it’s right at the center of what we’re doing now  We’re in a situation   where the effects of our policy depend at least as much on what people think we’re going to do   in the future as they do on what we do today, and consequently, the framework that we are using   and that we communicate—and the communication is incredibly important—has very real   effects on the efficacy of our policy  This is very much part of the contingency planning effort   that I promised a couple of meetings ago both in the sense of trying to think about our current   framework and thinking about where we might go if things turn much to the worse   There’s probably a narrow way and a broad way to think about this discussion  The   narrow way is to note that I think it’s not too controversial to describe our behavior as   conforming to a version of flexible inflation targeting, which attempts to achieve a broad   definition of price stability over the forecast horizon, but in the short term allows some flexibility   for stabilization of the real economy   November 1–2, 2011 23 of 282              Where we deviate to some extent from international practice on inflation targeting is that   we haven’t done everything that some central banks have done in terms of communication,   including specifying a numerical objective, providing a comprehensive, collective forecast,   providing guidance or even forecasts of future rates, et cetera  One way to think about this   discussion is, what additional steps do we want to take, if any, recognizing that we do have a   rather different institutional situation here than in many other countries—a large Committee, a   dual mandate, et cetera?  But another way of thinking about this discussion is an issue that we’ve   talked about many times before, that we want to take further steps to solidify and clarify our   flexible inflation-targeting approach, and if so, how could we communicate that?   It’s useful—and one of the things I thought that the memo did very well—to show us that   there really is a broader issue here, which roughly speaking is the difference between   discretionary and commitment-based policy, particularly in a situation where we’re at the zero   bound and conventional signaling by moving interest rates is not available  To the extent that we   can show a committed policy—that we can clarify our future policies will correspond to the   optimal path under commitment, similar and analogous to the path that is presented every   meeting in the Tealbook—the better results we’ll get   In some sense the broader question is not just about flexible inflation targeting  The   broader question is, can we provide a communications framework that will allow us both to   convey and to commit to a policy path that will deliver potentially better outcomes on both   inflation and growth than the policy framework we have now?  I think that’s an open question    There are a lot of practical issues that come into play, a lot of special issues related to what   model you believe in, and so on, but I would urge us all to think about this in that context, and as   much as possible, to divorce it from the current conjuncture and ask the question that if we’re   November 1–2, 2011 24 of 282              going to adopt some changes in communication, what would serve this Committee well for a   period of time   Before opening the floor, let me restate the questions that were circulated so they’ll be in   everybody’s mind  Narrowly, to the extent that we’re looking at a flexible inflation targeting   framework, would it make sense to adopt a numerical objective?  That would be one way to   clarify our goals  In doing so, of course, we would have to make very clear how that relates to   our dual mandate and why it’s consistent with our dual mandate  The counter argument is that   doing that convincingly is a communications challenge in itself, and that’s one issue to address   More broadly, again, beyond the flexible inflation-targeting framework is the question of   how we can make better, clearer commitments to future policy, and a number of different   approaches have been suggested  We talked at the last meeting about conditional commitments,   and we showed a few possible examples in the alternative A1 in the statements  Would it be   helpful to specify some conditions under which we change policy, specifying those well in   advance?  That is one way to try to approximate an optimal policy in terms of commitment   An alternative way, as the discussion just illustrated, is by specifying intermediate   targets  Intermediate targets are an old concept in monetary policy  It’s been always used in the   sense of a guidepost or a second pillar, a way of providing additional information about policy    But in the current context, as the memo shows, it could be that pursuing a particular intermediate   target might be a reasonable approximation to the first-best policy under commitment, and that’s   an empirical question, in part   I’m sure many of you have seen some of the commentary on, for example, nominal GDP   targets  Christina Romer made the point over the weekend that one potential advantage of   something like a nominal GDP target is that it could be viewed as a regime change, and to the   November 1–2, 2011 25 of 282              extent that it reflects a real change in how the Fed is doing business, it might have a more   dramatic effect on expectations than something more incremental  That being said, of course,   big changes are also dangerous, and that’s something we need to keep in mind   Now, a fourth question  So—first, inflation targeting; second, conditional commitment;   third, intermediate targets  A fourth question—there was a lot of discussion last time about the   economic projections; can we use those better?  I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that   front  In particular, we have a proposal to look at projections of our policy rate  In what way   could that be complementary to an improved communication strategy?   Finally, let’s not forget, it’s important as we talk about these things to keep in mind   process  Is there a way that we can put this all together in a way that will satisfy the appropriate   consultation and discussion within the Committee but also allow us to bring this to the public in   a way that will be better understood and better accepted?  In particular, a specific suggestion   that’s been made is that we use the approach we did with our principles of exit strategy, which   we published in June in the minutes  Would it be possible, if we do adopt some changes in our   communication strategy, to agree on a set of principles that would be sufficiently broad to   encompass Committee support, that we could then put out through the minutes or some other   mechanism?  I think there’s a whole bunch of interesting questions here, and this is very central   to our current policy decisions  We don’t have to resolve all of these questions today, but I do   think that this is a valuable investment in time, and I look forward to your comments   Beginning the go-round, I see President Evans is first on the list    Thank you, President Evans  Since you took my name in   vain, I do feel constrained to mention—    But I do think I need to clarify that those comments were   directed at the country that actually was suffering significant deflation, and so it was failing on   both the price stability and the economic growth    A two-handed intervention, President Kocherlakota    Well, obviously this will be taken up in some length    [Laughter]  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lacker    You could tell your brother-in-law what his revenue is   going to be in his practice under nominal GDP targeting  [Laughter]   There actually was a good complementarity between your remarks and President Evans’s,   and you talked about the uncertainty of the NAIRU over time    President Evans’s approach, if I understood it, was to try to   find something that was robust to uncertainty over that particular—    President Lockhart    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you    Sure    Let me inject here  I don’t want to get into a deep   discussion of this    I think, President Bullard, that some of us are confused   about the dynamics and the inflation-expectation formation process that supports that   equilibrium  In other words, it’s obviously an equilibrium, but is it one that would naturally   occur?  Rather than ask you to answer that here, maybe you could help us with some comments    Okay    Maybe because policy wasn’t easy enough in the first place,   and they got caught    Okay  President Kocherlakota    Okay  Thank you very much  I understand lunch is ready    I propose that we take half an hour and begin again at 115—with trays, if necessary  Thank   you   November 1–2, 2011 63 of 282              [Lunch recess]    Thank you very much for your promptness  Let’s   recommence with our discussion of the frameworks, and I will turn to President George    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you very much  President Williams    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you very much Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin  I’m sorry  President   Kocherlakota    Governor Raskin    Thank you very much, and thank you all for your   thoughtful comments  Let me make a couple of suggestions and summary remarks  First, on the   intermediate targets like nominal GDP and price-level targeting, I didn’t hear much enthusiasm   for any near-term adoption, although I think there was at least some interest in continuing to   think about these issues perhaps in the context of a significant change in the environment   Just for interest, I do raise one point, which is that a number of people have mentioned   Christy Romer’s piece, and she talked about the 1979 regime change  I actually think that’s the   wrong example  As President Bullard pointed out, when Chairman Volcker changed the policy   regime, in fact, it took a long time for people to appreciate it and understand it, and one   November 1–2, 2011 92 of 282              implication of that is there was a long recession and real interest rates remained very high, and so   on  But there are other examples, like 1933, when Roosevelt took the US off the gold standard,   and prices and asset prices changed almost overnight  There are other examples like the end of   hyperinflations, and so on  There’s something sometimes about regime changes that has   remarkable effects on an economy  I’m not saying that we know how to predict that, but that’s   something that we haven’t really understood or really explored in this conversation  That being   said, I think that there was a lot of agreement that there are a lot of practical issues associated   with implementing such an intermediate target, including both the very long horizons over which   they have to operate and the issues of communication and credibility   There was considerably more support for two specific things  First would be formulating   some statement of principles in the same mode as the exit strategy principles, to try to formalize   a bit more our flexible inflation-targeting framework  One element of that would be a numerical   inflation objective, but I think it was made clear that other important elements would be a clear   explanation of how this framework is consistent with the dual mandate in particular, why it is   that we have a number for inflation and not for unemployment, how those two things differ, how   we think about the horizon under which we take various actions, and so on  I would ask the   subcommittee, if Governor Yellen is willing, to begin a process of trying to put together such a   document  The work that President Plosser and his group did, and President Plosser is a member   of the subcommittee, is obviously a starting point for that, and—we’re not making any   commitment, to coin a phrase [laughter]—we should see what kind of agreement we can get on   such a statement  Incidentally, I thought a useful addendum to the Plosser et al document was a   set of Frequently Asked Questions, which might be a useful thing to work on as well in order to   explore and illuminate some of the issues   November 1–2, 2011 93 of 282              The other thing for which I heard reasonable support was for further implementation and   use of the SEP as a means of policy guidance  In particular, we’ll hear today a report on the trial   run on the policy projections, and I would propose—contingent on the discussion that follows   that presentation, if people are willing—to again ask the subcommittee with a lot of staff support   to try to develop some possible presentation approaches, some mock-up SEPs, and so on for our   consideration to see if we find that a useful mechanism   If we can do these things, let me suggest a very ambitious way of putting this all together,   and of course, which can always be extended  If we were able to get an agreed upon statement   of principles on the framework by the next meeting, by mid-December, and if we were also able   to get to some agreement about the use of our policy rate projections, then we could review those   issues at the December meeting  If we were comfortable with where we were at that point, we   could then have a plan to consider at least ratifying these items as part of a communications   package perhaps as early as our January organizational meeting  If we were to agree to do that,   then we could try to prepare the ground for that in various ways  One thing, for example, would   be that I could give a speech a couple of weeks before the January meeting and outline some of   the ideas that are being discussed, and that would give us a chance to get some public feedback   on the ideas, and we could also do some consultation  But it seems to me possible, if things go   well, that we might consider trying to put together a package by the end of January  Two weeks   after that or so is my Humphrey–Hawkins testimony, which would be another opportunity to   explain this   I think some of these things are better as part of a package of communications ideas   rather than a discrete change in one aspect of our communications  Again, this is just a proposal    November 1–2, 2011 94 of 282              I’ll give people a chance to react after I finish these remarks, but there’s no commitment being   made until we see how things go and how comfortable people are   I have one other set of comments, which has to do with the discussions we had on   conditional commitments  There was a lot of interesting discussion on that issue  I will say for   myself that I think this is something we should keep on the table  First of all, forward guidance   is not something we’re contemplating; we’re well into the forward-guidance game  In fact, that   was something that was part of my predecessor’s legacy—“a considerable period” and   “measured pace,” you remember all those things  We have, for better or worse, given an   estimate of the date at which policy will begin to tighten, and it would be very desirable for us to   think about ways to improve our forward guidance, particularly in light of the fact that we’re at   the zero lower bound and communication is an important part potentially, at least, of our toolkit   Forward guidance is also, again, one way, and President Evans made a couple of good   points  One is that many of the properties of the optimal control path that the staff discussed, or   at least some of them, could be replicated by an appropriately calibrated forward guidance,   where there was a commitment or just a forecast  There’s that advantage, and then President   Evans also made the point that by having triggers or escape clauses, you can protect yourself   against uncertainty about the underlying source of the problem  His example was if we don’t   know whether the problem is a collapse of potential output or a collapse of aggregate demand, if   we have sufficient conditionality, we are protected against both approaches  Again, that’s   something we ought to consider   I do think that some of the discussion helps us address some of the concerns that people   have  Let me mention a few things  In our discussion of the strategies at the last meeting, one of   the concerns people had was that the public would misinterpret a trigger or an escape clause as a   November 1–2, 2011 95 of 282              target  Obviously, if we put this in the context of a broader communications strategy, that would   reduce that risk considerably  Another concern that was raised was that we certainly can’t   estimate the natural rate of unemployment, even if it’s not time-varying, with any accuracy  And   if it’s time-varying, that makes it even more difficult  But I would point out that the kind of   language we have in the statement A includes both an unemployment trigger, but also an   inflation trigger, and that would be a protection against a mistake in terms of where the   unemployment rate should be  Yet another concern about these conditional commitments is that   they involve very long time frames  President Bullard made the very good point that we should   be at least combining with, or maybe just focusing on, asset purchases as being a more active   type of policy action that would be more likely to affect expectations  I make the point that if   our optimal policy involves a commitment which is very long in terms of the interest rate, we   could at least consider combining that with asset purchases as a way of bringing that rate closer   to the present   So there are some issues here that we need to discuss, but some of them may be at least   addressable  Now, having said that, I recognize there are lots of different ways to do this  The   alternative statement A gave three different types of language  It could go into the statement, but   some people have talked about the use of the SEP, and there are a variety of modifications that   could be contemplated  I put this out there as something I will ask the staff—and Reserve Bank   presidents might want to ask their own staffs—to look at, and we should try to make some   progress on this over the next couple of meetings   Any comments or reactions, particularly on the plan to try to get something together by   January?  Again, this will be contingent on it working  I should say that these framework   changes are constitutional-type changes, and I’m certainly going to be looking for a very broad   November 1–2, 2011 96 of 282              agreement before we make any of these changes  [No response]  Let’s turn next then to item 3   on our agenda, financial developments and open market operations; and we’ll turn to Brian Sack    Thank you very much  Questions?  I’m sorry  President   Lacker, do you have a question?    President Kocherlakota    I’m sorry  President Plosser    All right  Let me go to President Fisher    Vice Chairman, you wanted to add to that?    Governor Duke   November 1–2, 2011 109 of 282               President Lockhart    I’ve got President Bullard and President Lacker    President Lacker    I wonder if there is a constituency for taking a vote on   domestic open market operations  [Laughter]  Without objection  It is 315  Let’s take   20 minutes for coffee  Thank you     [Coffee break]    Why don’t we recommence  The next item on the agenda is   the economic situation, and I will call on David Wilcox    Thank you very much  These are some interesting ideas on   how to present the information on projections   It’s been our practice four times a year to have a briefing on financial stability  Given   that we had a videoconference a couple of weeks ago and given how full the agenda is, we’ve   decided not to have that briefing  But Nellie Liang is here and Pat Parkinson is here, and if   November 1–2, 2011 128 of 282              anyone has any further questions relating to financial stability or wants to make any comments or   raise any issues, I hope you will feel free to do that  We’re ready for questions for the staff    President Kocherlakota    President Fisher    Thank you  Vice Chairman    President Rosengren    Are there any other staff who want to comment?    Other questions?  President Plosser    First time anybody ever estimated a Taylor rule on panel   data  [Laughter]  Any other questions?  Governor Tarullo    Exhibit 4B—PCE inflation versus unemployment rate    President Kocherlakota      This is important information, though—what people’s   preferences are    Pages 3 and 4 were intended for internal use    I’m not sure I agree with that  President Williams    President Bullard    Anyone else?  [No response]  Okay  We’re ready for our   go-round, and let’s start with President Lockhart    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  President Evans    Let me ask you, President Evans and President Williams—  I’m a little confused  If potential output is 5 percent lower, how can the output gap still be   comparably large?    So what is your potential output relative to the Tealbook?    Thank you  President Fisher    Okay  Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President George    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Lacker    Well, it sounds as though your drug use anecdote could   argue either way  It could argue for more stimulus to get more people off the streets, right?    Well, off their drug use    Okay  President Plosser    Thank you  Vice Chairman     Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke      Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much  Thank you, all, for a long but   productive day  We have a reception upstairs, followed by an optional dinner, for those who are   interested in staying around, and we will recommence in the morning at 830   [Meeting recessed]   November 1–2, 2011 186 of 282              November 2 Session      Good morning, everybody  Let me start with a summary of   the discussion I heard yesterday  I had more time than usual, so it’s a little bit longer than usual    [Laughter]  You may want to pull out a pillow or something   Participants took note of somewhat better data over the intermeeting period, reflecting in   part the reversal of temporary factors that had depressed GDP growth in the first half  Final   demand in the third quarter was stronger than expected, and near-term recession risks appear to   have declined  There are some positive factors that may continue to support growth, including   pent-up demand, accommodative monetary policy, and balance sheet repair by both households   and businesses  However, most participants saw near-term growth as likely to be slow to   moderate, held back by continued problems in the labor and housing markets, low confidence,   financial market volatility, and fiscal restraint  With relatively modest economic growth will   come only a very slow decline in unemployment  The downside risks to growth appear to have   become somewhat less severe since the last meeting, but that assessment depends very much on   European developments  Potential output may also be lower than had been thought, and the risk   of a lost decade has risen  Inflation will moderate with commodity prices, although core   inflation has come down more slowly than expected  Most participants expect inflation to   moderate to 2 percent or below in the medium run, with many seeing the risks as approximately   balanced   Households remain very pessimistic and expect little to no improvement in their financial   conditions  Income growth has also been tepid, reflecting in part the relatively slow pace of   employment growth  Notwithstanding these factors, consumer spending has recently been   stronger, and there is scattered optimism about holiday sales  However, some of the strength in   November 1–2, 2011 187 of 282              spending reflected lower saving rates, casting doubt on its sustainability  Some indicators of   labor market performance have been slightly better, but the job situation remains very difficult    There was an extensive discussion of the degree to which unemployment reflects structural   factors  Employers complain about unqualified applicants, including those lacking basic skills,   and some will hire only so-called purple squirrels  [Laughter]  Skilled workers are in high   demand  Reverse engineering slack from core inflation suggests that the gap is lower than   estimated by the Tealbook  On the other hand, many of the problems regarding the workforce   are of long standing, and the Beveridge curve estimates for earlier recessions show that the   pattern of vacancies and unemployment this time is not so unusual  Long-term unemployment   may ultimately lead to more structural unemployment, but we may not yet have reached that   point   The housing market remains lackluster in most areas, except for some improvement in   multifamily construction  Foreclosures remain a serious problem, and there are long delays to   resolution  Mortgage eligibility conditions remain tight, notwithstanding some government   initiatives, and LTVs are high in many cases, both of which are impeding purchases and   refinancing  However, attention to factors affecting the housing market, such as REO   management, refinancing by high-LTV borrowers, and neighborhood stabilization, could help   this situation   Reports on businesses are mixed  Some firms are pessimistic and cautious about the   outlook  There are continued complaints about economic and political uncertainty, including   uncertainty about fiscal policy, regulatory policy, demand, and the European situation  Hiring   plans are on hold, or firms are looking to use temporary or part-time workers  Capital   investment to increase productivity continues, however, benefiting from low interest rates  Input   November 1–2, 2011 188 of 282              cost pressures have abated somewhat, and wage costs are low  Profits and balance sheets are   healthy  Autos are seeing modest improvement in sales and production, agriculture and energy   are doing well, and there were some positive anecdotes from retailers and transportation firms    Asian demand remains strong, though Europe is slowing  Low interest rates are increasing   pension contributions   Fiscal policy is becoming more restrictive, with state and local governments continuing   to shed jobs  Much attention will be paid to the report of the congressional supercommittee; its   importance is not just the substantive outcome, but also the demonstration of whether the   government can work   Financial conditions remain quite volatile  The recent actions taken by European leaders   to address their banking and sovereign debt problems were initially well received  However,   whether their actions will be successful in ending the crisis remains uncertain, as many details of   the plans remain to be worked out and there are questions about whether the resources being   devoted will be sufficient to provide adequate firewalls for major debtors  Sovereign spreads   continue to rise, and it is questionable whether European banks can raise private capital  US   banks are doing relatively better, with improved capital and earnings, better asset quality, and   high deposits  However, loan demand is weak, and competition for good borrowers is keeping   net interest margins low  Liquidity has worsened in some markets, including wholesale funding   markets  Farmland prices continue to rise with agricultural prices   Finally, inflation appears likely to moderate as commodity price declines are passed   through to the retail level  Core inflation is also slowing, though possibly more slowly than   expected  Growth in wages and benefits remains subdued, although wage data are affected by   skill composition and nominal downward rigidity  Inflation expectations are well anchored at   November 1–2, 2011 189 of 282              low levels  Measures of inflation trends, such as the trimmed mean or median, suggest relative   stability  On the other hand, if slack is lower than believed, downward pressure on core inflation   will be limited  Moreover, there is some ongoing pass-through of input costs, such as fuel   surcharges  Overall, most saw the risks to inflation as roughly balanced   Let me stop there and see if there are any comments, omissions  [No response]  Okay  If   not, let me make a few comments, always from the disadvantage of having to follow many good   discussions   I led off my discussion last time with a review of the European situation, and many of   you have talked about it  I’m not going to go into much detail  I think there’s a lot of agreement   that the latest plan at least addresses the right issues, notably the Greek sustainability, the   banking system, and the firewalls for the major debtors   There’s also been some attention to the longer-term solutions  How will they ultimately   achieve a degree of fiscal integration that will prevent similar problems from happening in the   future?  I think the consensus around the table, and what appears to be in the markets, though, is   that there’s considerable question about the details and the firepower behind the plans that have   been put forward  I can add one small observation, which is that there’s a fundamental   misconception in the way they’re thinking about this, particularly with reference to the ECB    The function of a lender of last resort is to provide unlimited firepower, unlimited lending   against collateral, and that’s what the ECB is doing for the banking system by lending against   sovereign debt  What’s happening now, though, is that the ECB is purchasing sovereign debt,   which is evidently a fiscal action and probably not appropriate for the central bank given the   credit risk associated with those obligations, but political opinion is preventing it from doing   what it would naturally do, which would be to lend to a bank or some facility that was using the   November 1–2, 2011 190 of 282              sovereign debt as collateral  The ECB is effectively the only institution that can provide   unlimited firepower and therefore can be a completely persuasive lender of last resort, and so I   think that until that intellectual confusion is sorted out, it’s not clear that this is going to work    Moreover, it’s going to get harder and harder, of course, because Europe is slowing, and that’s   not an accident  Austerity, tighter monetary policy, a credit crunch, financial volatility—all of   those things are obviously not going to be good for European growth, and that makes the fiscal   issues worse and worse  This is a very troubling situation, and I can only feel that while this is   partly political, it’s also partly a question of appropriate conception of the problem and the   solution   We are innocent bystanders, but we are very severely affected by what’s happening there    In my dreams, I’d like to know what the US economy could do if financial markets were in a   more placid state  Given the kind of volatility we’re seeing, though, that’s obviously a very   negative factor  So we’ll continue, obviously, to watch  The G-20 meeting is coming up  I’m   sure that the US and other countries will press the Europeans for further action, but this is, in   some sense, the key issue for us   Turning to the US economy, I think the evidence is that the near-term performance has   been a little better than expected  Notably, we saw, as people have noted, good final demand in   the third quarter  Consumption was relatively strong  Total nonresidential investment, including   structures, grew 16 percent at an annual rate  That was fairly strong  We had good final   demand, less inventory billed than expected  All that is positive for the fourth quarter  Beyond   that, the September consumption reading was quite strong, putting consumption above the   average of the third quarter already  The ambiguities associated with the measurement of auto   production suggest that there will be less payback in autos in the fourth quarter  For a number of   November 1–2, 2011 191 of 282              technical reasons, I think the fourth quarter is likely to be a decent headline number again  So   that is good   In the longer term, I think we continue to have legitimate concerns about sustainability of   the recovery  I’d note a couple of points  One is the point that was emphasized in the Tealbook   about the striking discrepancy between the recent relatively stronger economic news and the   continued weakness in sentiment  I think there’s a very interesting question here, which research   might be able to address at some point—that is, to the extent that sentiment has information in it,   is it because sentiment is what economists would call a sunspot, a random thing that relates to   how Lindsay Lohan is doing or something like that, which then in turn affects the economy?  Or   is it reflective of the fact that consumers and businesses have much more micro information, and   that’s being aggregated in some way through sentiment indicators, which is not showing up in   the macrodata?  It’s not clear   I would note again that consumer sentiment remains very low, and there are indications   now that business sentiment has also weakened  President Plosser noted that the Philly FRB   business outlook improved a little bit last month but is still well below where it was earlier in the   year  We’ve seen very big declines in, say, the Business Roundtable CEO survey  We’ve seen   analysts’ expectations for capital-goods-producing firms drop quite considerably  So there is   clearly a sentiment issue in business as well as in the household sector  Sentiment is like the   stock market—it predicts about nine out of every five recessions  So I don’t think we should   overstate that, but it does remain a concern   Another issue related to sustainability has to do with income and saving  This point was   made by a couple of people  I have some sympathy for Governor Duke’s view that balance sheet   deleveraging factors may be running their course to some extent or may be less powerful than we   November 1–2, 2011 192 of 282              thought  We have a discussion of that planned for January, as I recall  But one indicator of that   is the fact that household saving rates remain quite low, which would not be what you would   expect if they were making massive efforts to rebuild their balance sheets  Instead, it feels more   like consumption is being constrained by income rather than by balance sheet considerations    Notably, the September saving rate was 3½ percent  Obviously, these numbers are frequently   revised, but nevertheless, we’ve seen relatively low saving rates, and we’ve seen very weak   income growth  In particular, for one illustration, the NBER, in picking its business cycle dates,   uses two indicators of aggregate activity  One is employment; the other is something called real   income less government transfers, which is a broad measure of income being generated in the   economy  That measure of real income less government transfers is basically flat since the   second quarter  It declined from the second to third quarters, and if the payroll tax cut extension   is not passed, then we’ll see further pressure on that indicator  So the sustainability of household   spending depends on continued generation of income   That brings us, of course, to labor markets  I thought we had a very good discussion of   what’s going on in labor markets  It’s obviously important to think about these things at the   microlevel  I think I would express caution about overinterpreting anecdotes on this issue  We   talked about some of the social issues that have affected labor supply  I was just checking the   Statistical Abstract before I came in here, though, and if you check, you’ll see that drug use,   crime, and a number of other similar social dysfunctions surprisingly have declined in the past   couple of years and certainly are on a downward trend over a longer period  So it may be that   what’s happening there is that rather than those things causing unemployment, unemployment is   causing those behaviors, in which case that would actually be an argument for expansion rather   than for nonresponse  In terms of the sectoral components, Governor Tarullo gave some   November 1–2, 2011 193 of 282              interesting observations on that  I would note that the unemployment increases are very broadly   distributed between men and women, between college graduates and high school graduates,   which makes it difficult to pin this on, say, construction, if women or college graduates are   having the same proportional increases in unemployment as high-school-educated men, for   example  So I think there are still some very open issues there  I guess the last observation I   would make is the historical observation that between 1939 and 1941, after a decade of high   unemployment rates and all of the social implications of that, in a society that was much less   educated than we have today, unemployment dropped from 17 percent to whatever it was, 1 or   2 percent, in the war  Clearly, there is capacity for reemployment  That’s, of course, an extreme   situation, but sometimes demand can generate more jobs   Again, to summarize, it looks to me as though—forecasting, of course, is always   difficult—the near-term numbers ought to continue to be moderately acceptable  But I think,   particularly given the uncertainties in the financial markets, there should be a very wide   confidence band around our forecast for growth in 2012   A couple of words on inflation  Generally speaking, there was a lot of agreement that   inflation is under pretty good control for the moment, although perhaps not coming down as   quickly as some expected  I would note, again, the absence of wage pressure  The ECI just   came out for the third quarter, and the employment cost index showed total labor costs on a   quarter-on-quarter basis of 03 percent, which was the lowest in some time  And I thought that   was interesting in that among the costs included in that number are pension costs, and we had   some discussion about the effects of low rates on pension underfunding and the like  It is true   that pension contributions are up, according to the ECI, 9 percent on a 12-month basis  So there   November 1–2, 2011 194 of 282              has been some increase in pension funding  But if you think about that as part of the total wage   bill, you’re still not getting any significant increases in the cost of labor   I would end this by offering a hypothesis I’ve proposed before, which is a suggestion that   we do need to think about the Phillips curve in an international context, as President Fisher and   the Dallas Fed have talked about before  In particular, there’s an awful lot of correlation   between growth rates across the world  That, in turn, drives globally traded commodities, and so   moderate growth in the US, to the extent that it feeds through, via a variety of mechanisms, into   growth in the emerging world, for example, tends to lead to higher commodity prices  It’s   interesting that the investment interest in commodity prices was sparked a few years ago by   some papers that suggested that commodity prices were pretty uncorrelated with stock prices    That seems hardly to be the case anymore  Commodity prices have become a very sensitive   indicator of global growth expectations, the result being that even if growth in the US remains   subpar, increases in growth expectations or even monetary policy ease can generate some   inflation pressure indirectly through this global commodity price nexus  So that, I think,   probably explains part of the reason why inflation has been less sensitive to domestic slack than   our traditional models would suggest and why there’s more sensitivity to global conditions than   is traditionally the case  The effect of that is going to make inflation more volatile and more   difficult to predict, more linked to global conditions, and that’s going to complicate our lives   going forward as we seek to manage both inflation and inflation expectations   But again, near term, we’ve seen a little bit better data, and that’s good, but going   forward, I think we still face very significant uncertainties, not least those in the financial   markets  Any final observations or comments on the outlook?  [No response]  If not, let me turn   to Bill English to introduce the monetary policy go-round   November 1–2, 2011 195 of 282               Thank you  Are there questions for Bill?  President Fisher    Thank you  Any other questions for Bill?  [No response]    All right  Let’s begin our go-round with President Williams    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Evans    Vice Chairman    President Lockhart    Thank you  Did you want to say anything about   “significant”?  Were your comments meant to encompass that or not?    President Pianalto    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President George    Okay  Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Plosser    President Kocherlakota    Right    That’s correct    The sentence is reoriented a little bit so that it’s not quite so   obvious, but yes, it is in fact the case, and the September statement is, of course, at the beginning   of your handout    President Plosser    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you, President Lacker  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you very much  Thank you, all, for your comments    We are still at a difficult juncture  There is certainly a case, I think, for further action  The best   way to say it is that our medium-term forecasts have inflation below target or at target and   November 1–2, 2011 233 of 282              unemployment well above what most people consider to be the long-run equilibrium level  And   I think it’s pretty straightforward to show that that can’t be a feature of optimal policy  That   said—well, there are responses to that, of course  One can argue that the actions that we could   take at this stage are ineffective or have unintended side effects  So it’s a complex debate and   one that’s been going on in this room for some time   For this meeting, I would propose that we not take new action, and that’s based more on   trying to get our framework clarified than on a clear decision on the need for or efficacy of   further action  We took important actions at each of the past two meetings  Both of these, I   think, were well grounded in theory  But President Kocherlakota and others have a point that   there was some ad hoc feel to those actions, and probably their impact is somewhat less than it   could have been if they had been better cast in the context of a framework and better prepared for   the markets   For those who are advocating more expansionary policy, I would just point out that our   toolkit is not infinite, that our capacity is not infinite, and that we’ll be more effective if we can   use the ammunition we have left in the most focused way  And the best way to do that is to have   a strong communication program that will help people understand what we’re doing, why we’re   doing it, and help guide expectations in both the markets and the public   So I would propose not to take new action today  I leave aside the question of whether   new action is justified  I see a case for new action  But whatever we choose to do, it’ll be more   effective if we are able to provide a more coherent framework for communication  Again, I   think that we should not introduce yet additional policy actions today  We have several things   already in play  Therefore, I do support alternative B, which most people around the table were   comfortable with  I think the majority of people in that statement were in favor of retaining the   November 1–2, 2011 234 of 282              “through mid-2013” language  Whatever the merits may be of the alternative, there’s a case for   waiting until we get to a new communication strategy before making changes, and then we can   consider how to incorporate different considerations into that  So I propose that  “Significant”   is—I got a very divided response on that  Bill    I think that’s right  I would say the two options are, in   alternative B, either striking the bracketed word “significant” and leaving the sentence as it is    “Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook remain, including strains in global financial   markets”—I think the case for doing that is, first, there’s this mysterious overinterpretation of the   word in the markets, and we’re not quite sure what all that means  But more substantively, even   though Europe remains very troubled, there has been at least a little reduction in downside risk in   the near-term US economic data  The case on the other side is that we have already used this   language  And as the Vice Chairman and Governor Tarullo and others point out, we are facing   downside risks that could be significant or worse from European developments  Frankly, I’m   willing to go either way  I think if we do retain “significant,” we ought to go back just to the   language of September, so there’s no need to change   PARTICIPANT  I agree with that      President Lacker     President Bullard    Now, on the other side of that, “significant” is not exactly a   word that would blow most people away  [Laughter]  It is significant, certainly    “Significant”  [Laughter]  I’m not suggesting any change    All right  President Plosser    Right, I guess  President Pianalto    No  Replace the sentence that currently has the word   “significant” in it with—    Exact same  “Moreover, there are significant downside   risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets”    Yes, it’s exactly identical to the last—in September  All   right  I think I’m getting agreement  President Lockhart agrees  Okay, good  So we’re ready to   take a vote     Okay  Thank you very much  A few announcements    First, I do have a press conference at 215  It will be the usual format  It’ll be screened in the   Special Library, if anybody has nothing better to do  [Laughter]  As has been the case, I will   focus on our projections and talk about our policy stance in the context of those projections  I’m   going to say that we discussed communications frameworks today  I will say we didn’t come to   any conclusions  I was thinking of saying that there was a sense that there was no need for a   fundamental change in framework, that we were looking within the context of our current   framework to try to find ways to better explain our policy expectations and outlook  Any   concern about that?  [No response]  Okay  So that’s at 215   Coffee is available for those who would like to have some coffee, and there will be lunch   served in the anteroom at 1130  The next meeting is on December 13  Thank you    END OF MEETING   November 1–2, 2011 238 of 282     "
9353,2011-11-28,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  Thank you for joining us on   this call  As you know, our main topic today is Europe and our swaps agreements  I thought I   would take a minute at the beginning, though, to talk about FOMC confidentiality issues very   briefly  As you know, on Wednesday, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal on the   question of access to Fed officials  As is often the case, there was more innuendo than fact, but   there were a couple of points  One, it was noted that I myself meet with various economists and   consultants periodically in an effort to get outside points of view and to hear what they’re   thinking and so on  And second, it mentioned that until earlier this year, the staff of the New   York Fed had been providing information on the staff forecast to the Bank’s Economic Advisory   Panel   Let me comment briefly on responses to those issues  First of all, on my personal   calendar, the article did reflect a point that the Chairman, like other members of the Committee,   does need to have access to outside perspectives and information, which of course is why we   have not only a Board, but also panels, advisory councils, and the like  The article also   published a long quote from Michelle making the very valid point that people who meet with me   sometimes have an incentive to claim inside information, even if none such exists  And finally,   I’d like to note that my meetings are always in compliance with our policy  In particular, I   always have a staff member there taking notes, and of course I’d never disclose information that   I don’t disclose in public  So I do believe that our meetings have been in full compliance with   the policies that we passed over the summer  That said, the article illustrates that there is a   reputational risk here, and so just for your information, we have canceled all similar meetings of   November 28, 2011 3 of 40              this sort for the near term, and we’re going to look at whether there are any good alternative   ways to get outside information, input, that don’t have that particular risk  We’re taking that   seriously and trying to figure out a solution   Second, on the New York staff forecast, this was something that had been going on for   some time but was discontinued in June after the new policy on external communication was   adopted  So it was in response to that policy that this practice was discontinued  And, in   addition, you may be aware that the past forecasts were posted on the web last week in   conjunction with an article by Simon Potter of the New York Fed on the ability of the Fed to   forecast the recession, which of course was not very good, and the forecasts were put there as an   illustration of some of the problems and issues that had come up  Now, that said, when the   reporter was researching her story and the items relating the forecast materials were shown to us,   I asked Bill English and Scott Alvarez, pursuant to our policies, to take a look at it and see if   there was anything in there that did raise issues concerning our policies, as is required by our   approach  Now, at this point, I think it’s rather moot  But it is worthwhile for us to look at this   episode briefly because we all deal with the problem of forecasts, have boards and councils, meet   with outside individuals, and talk about the outlook in various ways  So I think it would be   beneficial for us to make use of this to try to clarify for ourselves how best to use staff   forecasting information  After Scott and Bill finish their look at this particular episode, I think   we should maybe have a brief discussion at some point about how we treat forecasts and that   kind of information—in dealing with our boards, for example   Finally, a third issue came up, which was not in the article in any way—it was not   referred to—but I got requests from an FOMC participant to look once again at the issue of the   dealer survey, which, as you know, we put out before each meeting to the dealers, confidentially   November 28, 2011 4 of 40              asking them for their views on likely Fed policies, along with issues relating to the economy and   so on  And there’s been a concern raised in meetings that the dealer survey—which, again, was   not mentioned in the article but nevertheless raises similar concerns—might provide or appear to   provide preferential information to the recipients of the survey  Now, I raised this with Vice   Chairman Dudley and Brian Sack, and from their perspective, it’s perfectly fine to go ahead and   start releasing the survey in real time, which we can do as early as Friday for the December   meeting  The alternative would be to have some kind of Committee process, which I think none   of us are particularly excited about but which I’m willing to do if there’s a strong desire for it  In   a moment I’ll ask for comment, but the proposal is just to start releasing it, and of course we’ll   look carefully at it to make sure that it doesn’t have any implied preferential information in it    We’ll start that on Friday   So those are just a few reactions  Vice Chairman Dudley wants to comment, and then I’ll   be happy to take any questions or comments on this particular issue  Bill    I think that’s okay, but others can comment  Does anyone   have any reactions they’d like to share?  [No response]  Okay  Seeing none, why don’t we turn   to the business of the meeting  I think the best way to do this would be to turn first to Brian   Sack, who will give us, as background, some markets updates, and then Steve Kamin here at the   Board will talk about what’s happening in Europe as they try to address the ongoing crisis  I’ll   say a few words about calls and contacts that I’ve had, and then we’ll open up the discussion of   the particular proposal  So let me turn it over to Brian Sack for an update on markets  Brian   November 28, 2011 5 of 40               Thank you very much  Are there questions for Brian or   Steve?  President Fisher    President Fisher, before we begin our general discussion in   just a minute, I can talk about some calls I’ve had  On solvency, just to reiterate what Steve said,   the clearest case of insolvency is Greece, which is being addressed in various ways  Arguably,   for example, the increase in the German interest rate is not a solvency issue; it’s a concern about   the stability of the euro and about self-fulfilling panics  So I think there is arguably, for many if   not most of the countries other than Greece, a significant element of panic or liquidity issue, as   opposed to a solvency issue  But again, to reiterate what Steve said, the Europeans are very   focused—some would say too focused—on the moral-hazard solvency issues and are addressing   that from a number of different fronts    That’s our current intention  I was hoping to address that,   though, before we begin our substantive round  Would you allow me to do that?    I’ll come back to it    Okay  Any other questions for Brian or Steve?  President   Lacker    That had not been our plan  But if they become large, I   think we would have to consider that  Up to now, of course, it’s been essentially irrelevant   because the draws have been tiny  And frankly, I don’t expect large draws  I think this is   November 28, 2011 13 of 40              viewed as a backstop rather than as a major source of funding  But if they became large, we   would have to consider that, yes  President Fisher    Well, as I said, this is technically an unlimited swap line, as   we have had since 2008  Of course, we do have to agree to each individual draw  Is that correct,   Scott?    If they became excessively large, we could either restrict   them or sterilize them  So, no, I wouldn’t anticipate that our balance sheet would grow   meaningfully because of this, but that would be a decision for the FOMC to undertake    Okay  Other questions for Steve or Brian?  [No response]    Well, let me add just a few points  President Fisher asked whether we had information that was   not in the newspapers  I would say that the answer in some technical sense is no, but we have a   lot more, call it soft, information, which comes from extensive discussions with European   policymakers and other policymakers  I had the pleasure of taking two G-7 calls beginning at   700 am on Thanksgiving morning  There were two calls  The first was with both the G-7   central bank governors and the finance ministers, and the tone of these discussions remains, I   think, fairly discouraging  A generous interpretation from the finance ministers’ perspective is   that they are approaching this on two fronts  One the one hand, they’re taking a longer-run   perspective—they’re trying to address moral hazard issues, structural reform, building their   fiscal union, and moving toward a long-term solution, which obviously is an important   November 28, 2011 14 of 40              component of an overall solution—at the same time that they are taking short-run steps, like   leveraging the EFSF, capitalizing the banks, imposing near-term austerity measures, and   allowing the ECB to buy government debt  I think the concern people are recognizing is that the   process is too slow and that the short-run measures on this trajectory are not going to be   adequate  So there is, obviously, a lot of concern  There are very important political constraints    The ECB, in particular, is in a very delicate position  They have been quite frank with me that   although they talk about legalities, they view their main constraints as political  Essentially,   what will the Germans allow the ECB to do?  Their position is quite delicate in that respect, and   frankly, I think it’s kind of perverse that their strategy is to actually buy for their balance sheet   Greek debt, as opposed to lending to some vehicle or to the European Investment Bank or some   other bank to indirectly finance government debt  But that’s where their arguments about   monetary policy have led them  So the main inside information I would share with you is that   there’s considerable concern and a lot of pessimism among the policymakers in Europe   I think it’s also important to note—and I’m hearing this more on calls—the growing   concern about the European economy  As Steve mentioned, the indicators have deteriorated in   just the past few weeks  Draghi noted the risk of a mild recession in his first press conference   recently, but on conference calls, he’s pointed a number of times to a burgeoning credit crunch    That is, the banks are deleveraging very sharply, and that’s beginning to have palpable effects on   economic activity in Europe  So it’s a stress situation  I believe that this would be the thrust of   what Brian was saying—that while short-term funding markets for banks and financial   institutions in the US remain reasonably stable, the movements in stock prices and swap and   CDS spreads for US financial institutions suggest that we are at some risk of having the stress   imported here   November 28, 2011 15 of 40              The second call I had immediately consecutive to that was with the G-7 central bankers,   and there I would just want to convey to you the sense that it’s really important for central banks   globally to work together, to be seen to be coordinating and cooperating  It was felt that   cooperation in this particular matter would be another example that would be reassuring to   markets in general  In particular, there was very strong support across all of the central banks for   taking additional steps on the swaps  The proposal that has come from the group collectively—  this was not really the Fed’s initiative; it was partly our initiative, but it was a collective   decision—has three parts  One is to extend the swap lines  Of course, we could do that later, but   as part of a package, it seems to make sense  And the February 1, 2013, expiration would take us   over the year-end  The second element of the proposed package that we discussed in our call   was creating a complete network of swaps—every bilateral pair  Until now, it’s been US   versus other counterparties; this would create a full, dense network of swaps between all bilateral   pairs of the G-7 currencies  In particular, that would mean that we would be signing up for the   option, of course—which we don’t have to use and probably wouldn’t use—of reciprocal swaps,   where we could access pounds or euros or yen if we so needed  I don’t anticipate we would need   that, but it does provide yet another element  The third element, as you know, would be to   reduce the swap rate to 50 basis points plus OIS  As was mentioned by Brian, the swap line rate   has just recently gone in the money at its current rate  We’re not seeing any activity  It’s   obvious that there is a significant stigma issue, and if the stigma is strong enough, then   essentially the backstop is ineffective  It doesn’t have any impact on market confidence  So   there was a view that by reducing the swap rate, making it more economical, we would reduce   the perceived stigma, and even if it were not heavily used—and I don’t anticipate it to be heavily   November 28, 2011 16 of 40              used—it would have a stabilizing effect, or at least a positive effect, on European funding   markets and then indirectly on US credit markets as well   President Fisher asked about the primary credit rate, and he’s correct that on this   proposal, the rate on swaps would be a little bit below the primary credit rate  I discussed this   with the Board, and I would have to say that our view is not strongly one way or the other  I   think that we could certainly take it up again  Clearly, there is some risk, as President Fisher   suggested, that we would be criticized for lending to “foreigners” at a lower rate than to US   banks  There are a couple of arguments in the other direction, though, which I want to note  The   first is that we’ve been trying over time—and Dallas is one of the Federal Reserve Banks that   has pressed this—to normalize the spread between the funds rate and the primary credit rate    And when we, in fact, moved up the primary credit rate to 75 basis points, it was actually quite a   communications challenge and led to some market swings  So, barring any need in terms of   domestic market conditions to cut the primary credit rate, it seems as though if we did that—  besides possibly signaling more concern than we have—we would then be in a situation where   we would have to again, in the future, move up the rate, and we would be further than ever from   a more normal spread between the funds rate and the discount window rate  So that’s one   observation, not necessarily dispositive  The other point, though, on the question of lending to   European banks  One advantage of keeping the primary credit rate where it is now is that it   would be very clear that we would want European banks to borrow from the ECB with those   additional credit guarantees rather than from our discount window  And that’s something we can   do with moral suasion, but this provides a market incentive for them to borrow from the ECB   rather than from us  I think that’s a good thing for us as well   So those were the reasons that the   Board—again, informally—seemed to have a mild preference for not cutting the PCR  But   November 28, 2011 17 of 40    again, this is something that we can certainly revisit, particularly if there’s a reaction that is   negative  But I guess my sense right now is that the benefits of leaving the PCR where it is are   slightly greater than the costs   You’ve now heard the proposal  I’m happy to now open the floor  We don’t have to   have a formal go-round, but, of course, anyone who has questions, comments, or reactions is   more than welcome to speak  This is, of course, a meeting, and so your expressing your views   on policy is obviously perfectly appropriate  Who would like to start?  President Lockhart    Well, we have a lot of interest from emerging market   economies in swap lines  As you know, we were up to 14 counterparties during the crisis    552 USC (b)(4)  would very much like to have a swap   line with us  Obviously, today we’re talking about the G-7  My own sense is that, first of all,   there should be a higher bar to going to the emerging market counterparties, in part because of   greater counterparty risk  Second, the concerns they have are still prospective rather than actual   November 28, 2011 18 of 40              for the most part  Obviously, if we reached a very destructive situation, we would have to look   at that again  However, at this point in time, I am not planning to propose any further expansion    But, of course, again, this is an FOMC decision, and if conditions warrant and the FOMC wants   to address it, that’s fine  But there’s no current plan in place to go beyond the G-7  Other   questions?  President Bullard    Just a quick comment  I think there are a number of efforts   under way to address moral hazard and fiscal reform issues  The market situation is one that   might not comfortably await a regular meeting  We’ve also had these discussions with the   foreign central banks, and they all believe that this would be a positive for markets and a positive   for perception of cooperation and coordination  But again, that’s a judgment you have to make    Other comments?  President Rosengren    Yes—I’d be happy to get any help that’s needed—but let   me just say that on the moral suasion issue, we’ve been very clear, not only in the context of the   swaps, but also more generally, that the discount window is a very short-term facility, and that   we expect the Europeans and their regulators and their finance ministries to make sure that   European banks’ issues are being addressed by Europeans and not by the Federal Reserve    We’ve gotten a few troubled cases out of the window, as you know, and I don’t believe we   currently have any significant lending to European banks  So, yes, we’ve been very clear   throughout that we don’t want the discount window to be used as a first resort for European   banks   On disclosure, if I understand correctly from our previous practice, we would disclose   regularly the amounts drawn by each counterparty—that is, each central bank  We would not   know necessarily to whom they were lending, and I don’t know about each of the five   counterparties, but as far as I know, none of them disclose to whom they lend, although   sometimes it’s either obvious to figure out or becomes known  But, no, we would certainly not   be doing that, because our counterparties are the individual central banks    This is an interesting question—I should have asked you   this before  If we got yen, could we lend yen through the discount window, or would it be only   an OMO type of thing?    Thank you  President Fisher    Yes    But the counterparty is the central bank    It stays as a swap    It’s not disclosed  We could inquire, of course, but our   counterparty is the central bank  And they’re the ones who are responsible to us    Vice Chairman Dudley    I would commend to the group an article by my ex-  colleague at Princeton, Hyun Shin, which looks at the transmission of credit from US dollar   sources and other dollar sources through the European banking system  Much of that dollar   funding flows back into the United States  This, in fact, is addressing a funding problem of a   credit source, which in turn affects US borrowers  So there is a connection that we can point to    Other questions or comments?  President Fisher    Let me make a couple of comments  Others on the Board   can speak to this if they wish  As I said, while there was not a strong preference in this regard,   there was the advantage of pushing European banks away from our window toward the foreign   central banks, which, by the way, because they are our counterparties, you could argue that, from   a credit risk perspective, they’re actually better risks than banks  But I suppose that’s a different   question  I would say two other things, if I could  One is that—and President Bullard raised this   November 28, 2011 25 of 40              as well—while deliberation is certainly important, we are in a very serious situation, one that is   changing quickly  I don’t think we’re in a mode, of course, where we should be panicking or   anything like that  But obviously, I think speed is useful and preemption is useful  I hesitate to   make this argument, but I will anyway  I personally negotiated some of these ideas with my   counterparts in the other central banks  And I do need to have a little bit of flexibility, I hope, to   represent the Federal Reserve’s point of view in international discussions  Now, obviously, if   you’re opposed to this action, by all means, you should vote against it  But if you’re close to the   edge, I would ask that to be an additional consideration  It’s very difficult for me to consult   continually with the FOMC at the same time that we’re having calls and discussions and   meetings with our foreign counterparties  But to go back to your main point, President Fisher,   rather than defend this to the death, if in fact we do run into problems, the Board can consider   making a change  We can do it in a few hours if we have to    I appreciate that  I agree—communication is a big part of   this  President Bullard was next on my list    On the exit problem, the fact is, of course, that all of the   loans are for finite periods, and we can stop lending anytime we want, or we can raise the rate   anytime we want  So I don’t think that is a real issue   I don’t know how much the swap borrowing would increase  Maybe Vice Chairman   Dudley has a thought  My thinking on why it would not be so large is that if it does create more   assurance, it will ease the flow of private money, because of the backstop feature, so that the   funding can take place through private channels  But I obviously don’t know for sure  Vice   Chairman Dudley, you have a two-handed response to that?    Thanks  President Evans    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  I have Governor Raskin next    All six banks will announce simultaneously before markets   open on Wednesday    Scott, will you help?    Other questions, comments?  President Lacker has two   hands    I think it’s important that we get these details straight, but I   would hope we don’t get too far down this line because this is a pretty hypothetical situation    President Fisher    Right  There will be a press release    Well, technically, you’re agreeing to delegate it to me, in   consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee  But I’m informing you that it would be   my intention, along with the other five central banks, to agree to a rate of 50 basis points plus   OIS    Of course  This is a formal meeting, and it’ll have minutes   and transcripts    Thank you  Vice Chairman Dudley    Thank you  Any other questions or comments?  [No   response]  All right  Well, I thank you for the discussion  The reservations are noted  I   appreciate, Richard, the points you made  We are somewhat reactive of necessity  The world is   changing quickly, and we are trying to coordinate with five other central banks, which makes it   November 28, 2011 36 of 40              more difficult to do things with a long lead time  My view is that this is a helpful step, not a   major step  But I am quite concerned about market developments in general, and I think we   should be prepared to have another meeting should that be necessary  As I said before, my   concern is that it’s even worse than political  I think the Europeans just do not, in some sense,   get it, to use the vernacular  I don’t believe they understand quite how dangerous the situation is   that they’re involved in  They are, of course, in a situation where politicians are making the   decisions, and they have many concerns other than the ideal economic outcome   If there are no further comments, given that there were some concerns, I think we   probably should take a roll call vote on this  Debbie    By the way, President Lacker is voting in place of President   Plosser, who was unable to join us today   Governor Raskin  Yes  Governor Tarullo  Yes  Governor Yellen  Yes    All right  Thank you, again, and we will do our best to   keep you well informed  And, if not sooner, we will see you in a couple of weeks  Thank you   November 28, 2011 37 of 40              END OF MEETING   November 28, 2011 38 of 40     "
9368,2011-12-13,BERNANKE,"  Good morning, everybody  This is a joint meeting of the   FOMC and the Board  I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you very much  I’d like to start with a few brief   comments on FOMC information security  As you probably know, there have been a few issues   recently, and as our rules require, I’ve asked Bill English and Scott Alvarez to look into them,   and when we have some resolution, I’ll certainly be reporting back to the full Committee   I also wanted, though, to mention today some press reports on the timing of our   communications initiatives  It appears that at least one report had information about the agenda,   in particular, that we would be discussing those matters today and providing public information   in January  The substance of our discussions today on interest rate projections and on principles,   inflation targets, and those sorts of issues, are well known  They were in the minutes, and they   were discussed by a number of people in speeches, and so on, but it does complicate the work of   the subcommittee and of this Committee if the expectations of the public are for delivery of   certain outcomes at certain dates  My own sense is that there was not really any reason to   intentionally leak this information, but I want to take the opportunity once again to remind   people that reporters are very good at piecing together little bits of information from many   sources  When they come to you and say, “Well, I’ve heard that X,” it’s a little hard for each of   us in dealing with that  Let me take note of that and ask people, as always, to be careful in their   interactions   Let me turn now to item 1 on the agenda  With the retirement of Nathan Sheets, we need   to appoint a new FOMC Economist  There is a proposal that Steve Kamin replace Nathan until   December 13, 2011 3 of 198              January when we’ll have our annual organizational meeting  Is there any objection?  [No   response]  Seeing none, thank you  Our second item is “Financial Developments and Open   Market Operations,” and I’ll turn, as usual, to Brian Sack    You’ve been earning your salary, Brian  [Laughter]    Thank you  Questions for Brian?  President Lacker   December 13, 2011 8 of 198               President Fisher    Thank you  Other questions for Brian?  Yes, President   Plosser   December 13, 2011 12 of 198               Okay  Let’s turn to item 3, “Economic and Financial   Situation”  Steve, will you be leading off?    Thank you  Questions for our colleagues?  Vice Chairman    President Lockhart    David, are there valuation adjustments in the flow of the   funds that could account for some of the difference or is it conceptually consistent?    Okay  Thank you  President Plosser    Okay  A little certainty  President Fisher    The last name I have on my list is President Bullard    Thank you  Why don’t we turn now to our economic go-  round, and I have first on the list President Lockhart    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard   December 13, 2011 43 of 198               Thank you very much    I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else  [Laughter]    Thank you  President Evans    Thank you, President Evans  President Pianalto    Thank you  It’s 1030  I understand that coffee is ready, so   why don’t we take a 20-minute break?  Thank you   [Coffee break]    Why don’t we recommence?  I will start with President   Fisher    Thank you  President George    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you all, as always  Let me make an effort here to   summarize and then make a few additional comments   Recent data have been encouraging and suggest continued moderate growth and modest,   if possibly erratic, improvement in the labor market  Moderate growth seems likely to continue   into 2012, although that forecast is highly contingent on developments in Europe  However, the   expected pace of growth may be insufficient to reduce unemployment by very much  Weakness   in GDI is also a concern  Factors likely to restrain growth remain numerous and include   continued financial volatility—especially related to Europe—labor market dysfunction, the   December 13, 2011 77 of 198              weakness of the housing market, the slowing global economy, continued high uncertainty,   wealth loss and deleveraging, and fiscal tightening  Risks to growth continue to be broadly to   the downside in large part due to the risk to financial stability emanating from Europe  Growth   forecasts are also made more uncertain by the difficulty of assessing potential growth as well as   identifying the appropriate jumping off point for potential growth from the period of the housing   bubble  Inflation looks to be continuing its recent moderation and may drift below the 2 percent   implicit target  Most participants see inflation risks as largely balanced or to the downside, but   some see medium-term upside risks   Household spending has been somewhat stronger recently, but consumers remain   uncertain about the economic recovery in the labor market  The holiday shopping season   appears to be off to a good start, but consumer spending is value driven  Income growth has   been reported as weak so that higher spending implies a drop in saving rates  Important   questions are whether the drop in income and the saving rate are real and if so, whether the   higher rate of consumption spending is sustainable, particularly in light of the massive $7 trillion   loss in wealth  One reason for somewhat better consumer attitudes is the slightly better tone of   recent labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate and UI claims  Positive   revisions to payroll data are a good sign  However, except for workers with specialized skills,   hiring remains slow, participation rates are down, and labor income is stagnant  Long-term   unemployment may leave permanent scars on the economy  The employment-to-population   ratio remains very low in part for structural reasons  Home sales and construction are also very   slow in part because of fears of further house price declines  New government initiatives may   allow more people to refinance, but more could be done to help the housing market   December 13, 2011 78 of 198              Businesses continue to try to navigate what they perceive to be a very uncertain   economic, political, and policy environment  They see some signs of improvement, but are not   yet confident in the recovery and are concerned about Europe  Their responses to uncertainty   include caution in hiring and investment  A statistical analysis suggests that uncertainty affects   aggregate demand more than aggregate supply  Most companies have easy access to capital   funding, but the investment they are doing is selective, and they are doing more share   repurchases than payment of dividends  Retailers are cautiously optimistic about Christmas   sales, but there is some anxiety about stocking  Pricing pressures are down, reflecting both lower   costs and difficulty in making price increases stick  Auto production and sales have continued to   improve  Among the sectors also doing relatively well are agriculture, energy, electronics,   shipping, and manufacturing  Fiscal uncertainties remain as the supercommittee did not agree on   a deficit reduction package, and the Congress is still considering the payroll tax cut and UI   extension   Financial conditions remain hostage to European developments  Europe continues to   muddle through, but the latest Maastricht 20 treaty appears insufficient, and the risk of a   Lehman-style catastrophic financial event has not been eliminated  The ECB needs to act as a   backstop  A correction in the stock market is also a risk  That said, stress in Europe lowers US   Treasury yields, leads funds to flow into US banks, and may give US banks new opportunities   to gain global market share  Funding conditions for European banks and even a few US   institutions remain stressed despite the extension of the swap lines  The broker–dealer business   and funding model in particular may be at risk  However, in the US, loan demand in some   categories, including CRE, has shown slight improvement  Some saw credit for small businesses   as remaining tight, especially from weaker community lenders  Stresses have increased in the   December 13, 2011 79 of 198              ABCP market and farmland prices remain worryingly high  Nevertheless, balance sheets are   strengthening   Finally, inflation pressures seem to be abating as temporary factors reverse  Commodity   prices have generally been flat to down as global growth slows and as the earlier rise in core   inflation seems to be reversing  Growth in wages and unit labor costs remains subdued—with   some reports of nominal wage cuts—and import prices have softened  Measures of inflation   expectations are well anchored  Some uncertainty about the medium-term inflation outlook is   created by the fact that energy prices have recently risen  Producers expect to see some return of   pricing power, and the extent of slack remains uncertain  Indeed, the recent behavior of inflation   is consistent with the view that slack may be smaller than Tealbook estimates     That’s a summary  Any comments?  [No response]  Let me just add a few things as   usual  Everything has been said, but not everybody has said it, so I will say it  [Laughter]  As   has been the case in the past few meetings, of course, the European situation is the biggest wild   card affecting the US outlook  It’s interesting to note that the Tealbook in its analysis   essentially treats the financial implications of Europe for 2012 and 2013 as a wash, and the   effects that they are looking at are basically the trade effects and the effects of the stronger   dollar  On the financial side, the wider spreads, lower stock prices, and the like are offset largely   by lower Treasury yields, and so again, the financial aspects of Europe are not particularly   strongly incorporated in this outlook   But of course, as we all know, there is a wide range of potential outcomes here, and they   are suggested by the Tealbook’s alternative simulations, which look at two possible outcomes for   Europe, one in which the unemployment rate goes to 118 percent, and the other in which it goes   to 74 percent  We clearly have an enormous amount of uncertainty tied to the European   December 13, 2011 80 of 198              situation  We all recognize that it is dominant, and I sympathize with Governor Duke’s view   about the frustration of making phone calls and not necessarily having much control over what’s   happening   A lot of the discussion about the European situation is treated as a technical problem    Have the technical decisions been made that are sufficient to solve the crisis, or are the   technicalities perhaps enhanced or made more difficult to deal with because there are so many   players?   It might be worthwhile to think about it a little bit from a game theoretic point of view as   well  You’ve got two sides—call them North and South—who have very different objectives    On the one hand, both North and South would like to see the euro continue  They’d like to avoid   a financial crisis  On the other hand, the North—Germany and its close neighbors—are most   interested to avoid making any fiscal transfers or being responsible for providing any financial   support to what they view as profligate Southerners  From the Southerners’ perspective, the goal   in the short term is to meet their fiscal obligations, but in the medium to long term, of course, is   to have a successful growing economy  Those are the conflicting views, and what we’ve seen   here to some extent is a game of chicken where both sides are threatening a crisis essentially in   order to get as good a deal as they can for themselves  In that respect, it feels like we’re pretty   far away from a solution  From the perspective of the Northerners, there has been some progress   in talking about fiscal mutual monitoring and strengthening, the Maastricht treaty and the like,   but it remains quite speculative at this point  The enforcement mechanisms are not clear    Whether they’ll be enforceable or not, in fact, is not clear, and certainly given where we’re   starting from, it’s going to take quite a long time before the countries can meet the new   standards  They’re only making modest progress there   December 13, 2011 81 of 198              On the growth side, the situation is even worse  In the short run, you have fiscal   austerity  Some people have called the European negotiations a mutual suicide pact  To some   extent, that’s what’s going on  Everybody is agreeing to cut in a way that will obviously be   negative for growth, at least in the short run  But my concern, and this was a point President   Evans made very well, is that in the medium term, there simply is no provision at this point for   ensuring growth in the South  In particular, from a current account perspective you have an   enormous set of imbalances in Europe  Germany’s current account in 2011 was about 5 percent   of GDP, while Portugal’s and Greece’s current accounts were in deficit between 8 and 9 percent   of GDP  Clearly, borrowing and continued transfers or affordable lending from the North to the   South—something has to happen to restore that balance or to mitigate that imbalance  As   President Evans pointed out, that essentially has to be through increased competitiveness in the   South, which, barring a productivity miracle, means lower wages and prices in the South or   breaking out of the euro   I won’t give you the numbers, but the inflation rates in Germany, Spain, Italy, and so on   are about the same, and we’re seeing, if anything, very slow progress in that direction  From that   perspective, in terms of achieving both fiscal stability and feasibility of growth, we’re far from a   solution, and given the incentives on both sides to play close to the edge, we should expect to see   uncertainty and volatility for some time  Unfortunately, as we know, games of chicken   sometimes end up in disaster, and that’s essentially part of the whole strategy   There have been many comparisons over the past few years to the Great Depression    Here we potentially have a comparison to Keynes’ The Economic Consequences of the Peace   and the Versailles treaty, where he pointed out that forcing Germany into extreme austerity,   although it might satisfy certain moral, ethical, or political urges, had macroeconomic   December 13, 2011 82 of 198              consequences that might force Germany eventually to rebel  By the same token, if there’s not   growth for the South, eventually they’re going to decide that default and leaving the euro are   better options than what they have  I think it’s going to continue  I agree that there’s a strong   incentive to avoid a collapse, and for that reason the odds are low, but there’s also not very much   likelihood that this is going to be put to bed any time soon   A few words on the US economy  I agree with the general observation that there have   been some modest signs of improvement  We haven’t heard much talk lately about recession   risk, which is of course good, notwithstanding the stall-speed indicator  There are, though, a   number of puzzles that we are all confronting  One has to do with household behavior  The   recent consumer spending seems stronger than can be justified based both on actual income and   wealth and on prospective expectations of income  As some people have discussed, there seems   to be at least some risk that either income or consumption or both is being mismeasured or will   revert to something more sustainable  That’s a substantial source of uncertainty as we look   forward   Likewise, the labor market indicators are a little bit mixed  The differences between the   payroll and the household survey are striking, and although month to month we take the payroll   indicators as being more reliable, over a period of several months the household survey becomes   a useful guide  There are, again, some unusually ambiguous signals being sent out by the   economy recently  Even more difficult is assessing the extent of slack  President Bullard and   President Kocherlakota talked about these issues  I would count myself still on the side that   suggests that slack is still quite substantial  There were some interesting diagrams in Tealbook,   Book A looking at various measures of attitudes and indicators of slack  One that struck me in   particular was the fact that part-time work has been 6 percent of total employment since 2008,   December 13, 2011 83 of 198              and it hasn’t shown any signs of declining  At least one interpretation of that is that it’s evidence   against mismatch, sectoral reallocation  Rather, it appears that firms have workers, and they   have excess labor capacity, but they’re unwilling to make full use of that capacity   President Kocherlakota raised some interesting questions about the wage data, but at least   the data that I have seen across industries, although occupational data are limited, suggest that   compensation growth has been exceptionally weak, particularly when it’s corrected for benefits   and some other factors, which also suggests that labor supply is not a major constraint   The other point I would make on this would relate to President Bullard’s comment that if   slack were so large, we would expect to see more disinflation  My comment related to that is   that there are more factors than slack that affect inflation  In particular, until recently we’ve seen   a pretty strong global economy that has affected commodity prices and in turn, import prices,   and that, in turn, has fed through into inflation numbers in various ways  These are some factors   that are offsetting the slack   I want to summarize these last few comments by saying that there does seem to be a little   bit of improvement recently, and that’s encouraging  We hope it continues, but some very   important uncertainties remain in terms of interpreting the data and drawing inferences about the   degree of slack and the potential output of the economy   I haven’t mentioned inflation  I mostly agree with what has been said  Given weak wage   growth, weak growth in unit labor costs, the fact that core inflation seems to be receding now   that some of the factors that caused the rise earlier in the year are weaker, and the fact that   inflation expectations seem to be well anchored at relatively low levels suggest to me that   inflation should be moderate for some time  Of course, we’ll continue to monitor it  I have one   more comment on inflation  We have had discussions in the past about the role of rent in   December 13, 2011 84 of 198              inflation measures  What we’re seeing is that tenants’ rents have actually increased   considerably  The staff reports about a 4 percent rate of increase in tenants’ rents, but because   private housing and apartments are not in the same locations in some sense, the translation into   homeowners’ rents has been much more moderate than that  I suspect that as the rental–  ownership market rebalances, this surge in rents will moderate, and that it will not be a major   concern either  Inflation looks to be under pretty good control for now, but as I indicated, a   number of factors do affect inflation  Any final comments or questions?  [No response]  If not,   why don’t we turn now to Bill English and go into the policy round?    Thank you  I note that this is identical to what was   circulated in the Tealbook, Book B  Are there any questions for Bill?    I just said that these statements are identical to what was   circulated in Tealbook, Book B, so there’s no change  President Kocherlakota    Other?  [No response]  All right  We are going to do our   policy go-round  Let me ask your indulgence  We would very much like to vote by 130, if we   can  I’m sure that Michelle would like it to be earlier, if possible  If you have broader issues in   monetary policy that can be postponed to the afternoon go-round, that would be very much   appreciated  But, of course, everybody should say what they need to say  We begin with   President Rosengren    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Plosser    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  President Evans    He is very consistent  He has been predicting that since   2008  [Laughter]    Okay  President George    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Lacker   December 13, 2011 100 of 198               Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you  Vice Chairman    Thank you, everyone  It’s 100  What an incredibly   efficient exercise, and very useful  Thank you   Before talking about the statement, I want to follow up on comments by President   Kocherlakota and Governor Raskin about the optimal control exercises  If staff could take a look   at two questions  One is  To what extent does the optimal control exercise take into account the   nonstandard components of our policy?  The second is  If we assume, for the sake of argument,   that our channels through the housing sector, for example, are impeded, to what extent does that   affect the calculation?  I think it would be useful to take a look at that    It would be useful to write that up, though, so that people   understand exactly how that works    Because in some sense, the rate is also in the baseline—the   past efforts of monetary policy, for example  President Kocherlakota    We can discuss that further    One way to look at it would be to look at the optimal   control results for a past period—for example, the Taylor rule based on 1987 to 1993 or   something like that—to see if there is a systematic difference between the two approaches   Turning to the item at hand, there is a pretty broad consensus today for Alternative B,   although, obviously, people have different nuances for sure  I agree with that  We have not seen   December 13, 2011 111 of 198              much change in the outlook since the last meeting  The economy does look a little better, clearly   still not satisfactory, and we are still looking to see how some of the policies we put in place will   play out  More important, I am looking forward to this afternoon’s discussion to see if we can   make improvements in our framework and in our communication  If we can, that would make   any given action that we would choose to take more effective and involve less uncertainty on the   part of the public   We are better off pausing for today and waiting to see if we can develop a clearer   communication framework for January  My proposal would be to maintain Alternative B, not to   change the mid-2013 language for today  I think it would be more effective to make that change   in the context of a more well-developed communications framework   On the suggestion of changing paragraph 5, three people have proposed that we retain the   old language, that we go back to the November language  Is there anybody who would prefer to   make the change?  Is there anyone who opposes that change?  Who wants to speak?    Going back  President Rosengren    President Fisher    Anybody else?  [No response]  My vibes are that we are   okay for making the change back to November, barring anybody else commenting      Okay  Why don’t we do that—let’s change paragraph 5,   taking note of President Rosengren’s comments  Let’s take paragraph 5 back to the original   language  Any other issues?  [No response]  If not, can we take a vote?    Thank you very much  It’s about five after 100  I believe   lunch is ready  Why don’t we reconvene at 135, in half an hour?  If people are still eating, we   can begin the discussion over lunch  Thank you    [Lunch recess]    President Lacker    Thank you very much    We recorded there were only four dissents  [Laughter]    I do actually feel much better now  [Laughter]    Thank you, President Lacker, I appreciate that  I also want   to thank Debbie Danker for the gluten-free carrot cake cupcake, which was very nice as well    For the people recording this, we will just begin the meeting now  [Laughter]  I’m informed by   December 13, 2011 114 of 198              the faithful secretary that we did not take the vote to ratify open market operations, and since we   want to keep Brian out of jail, all in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Without exception  Thank you   We turn now to the last principal item on our agenda, our communications  As you   know, this is a very important topic  During normal times, which we can all remember, market   participants can draw on their long experience with the Fed to infer our policy actions and how   we might respond to certain developments  But currently, with rates close to zero and   nonconventional policies in operation, and with unusual and diverse circumstances in the   economy, communication is absolutely essential for effective policy, and so this is a very   important session   Governor Yellen and her subcommittee worked hard to present a couple of proposals to   you today  First of all, I want to thank them for a lot of good work and for their consultation    I’ll turn it over to Governor Yellen to introduce the topic    Thank you very much  Are there any questions for   Spencer?    Certainly    I’m going to address that in just a second    Any other questions for Spencer?  [No response]  Well, let   me talk a little bit about—    President Rosengren    I think the framework would be the context in which   decisions and discussions would take place, but it would not prevent anyone from expressing his   or her own view, and we could record dissenting views or dissenting arguments as appropriate   Let me address those governance issues that were just raised and add a little bit of   substance while I’m at it  There are two issues on the table  The first one is this policy   framework  I apologize to Governor Duke for bringing this issue up once again  She once said   that she had heard it enough times already, but in fact, the FOMC has been discussing inflation   objectives since the mid-1990s, and we’ve never come to a conclusion  Some of the issues that   troubled us considerably in the 1990s and early part of the 2000s are no longer big issues  For   example, a question that was often raised was  Isn’t it better to have constructive ambiguity?    That is no longer quite as big an issue as it was 15 years ago  The real issue that has always   prevented consensus has been the very thorny question of how you reconcile a numerical   objective for inflation with the dual mandate  My sense is that everybody around the table   understands, in principle, how that would work and how, in fact, it’s quite consistent with   modern macroeconomics, but there are problems with communication as well as problems with   wording and details  What we’re trying to do today is see if we can come to a broad statement   that will summarize our objectives and our policy approach for the public’s benefit and give   some context to our discussions   By the very nature of this, it’s going to have to be a broad tent  It’s going to have to be a   statement that everybody can accept with at least a little discomfort probably, but I hope enough   support that they can support the statement  This will be very valuable  I have supported this   kind of approach for a long time  It would help us in our communications in a lot of ways  That   December 13, 2011 124 of 198              being said, I view this as a quasi-constitutional type of discussion  I don’t think it’s something   we should do on a bare majority; I’m looking for a very broad consensus   What I propose to do on this issue is to hear everybody, just like Governor Yellen said, to   try to get a sense of whether a consensus is possible or if there’s a modification of the statement   for which a consensus is possible  I do not anticipate making any decision today  Instead, the   subcommittee will take the commentary, then go back and see whether they can find something   that everyone or virtually everyone can agree with  If the answer is yes, we can consult over the   intermeeting period and formally approve the statement in January   With respect to the interest rate projections, I have a somewhat different time frame  As   Governor Yellen suggested, it would be really useful for us if we’re going to do this to   incorporate it into the January SEP  The next quarterly projections are April 26−27, which is a   long time from now  It seems to me that agreeing on interest rate projections could be a very   useful tool for us, particularly as we’re wrestling with the issue of these conditional dates and   things of that sort  I’m hopeful that we can come to a decision on that today  I would propose at   the end of the discussion to take a straw vote of all participants around the table and, if there are   people who disagree, depending on the number and virulence of their opposition, we can take   various measures—including recording their views in the minutes or, if necessary, making   modifications   I have a couple of final words on the interest rate projections  First, I remind everyone   that we have been making these quarterly projections since 2007  They have become an   increasingly important part of our communication  They are now the basis, for example, for my   press conference opening statement after the projections are released, and I think the public is   becoming much more comfortable with what they are and what they aren’t  These projections   December 13, 2011 125 of 198              are conditional on so-called appropriate monetary policy, and one of the main gaps that now   remains is that the public is not informed as to what that means, and that’s an important problem    As Governor Yellen said, transparency would be served by providing information on what we   think the appropriate policy is, conditional on information we have today  No one is arguing this   should be a nonconditional commitment   The other observation I’d like to make is, consistent with what Governor Yellen said, that   this is not the last thing we’re ever going to do in communications  First of all, we could   probably take additional steps in the context of the quarterly projections that would be useful,   and a few ideas have surfaced; we should continue to talk about that  But it’s also possible that   we may want to take a much different approach, and that’s fine, but that’s something that’s   certainly going to take some time  In the interim, I hope that we can adopt this approach and   then continue to work as a Committee and through our subcommittees toward alternative   approaches if that, in fact, becomes desirable  President Fisher, does that answer your question?    With that, let’s have a go-round, and we’ll get people’s   views on these two questions  President Kocherlakota    I don’t think we need unanimity on the second item  It’s an   element of our communication, and in the same way that our statements involve communication   decisions, it will be something that a majority could support  The distinction I would make is   that, unlike a policy statement where the Committee votes, this is something that appropriately   December 13, 2011 126 of 198              concerns all participants, and I’d like to have a comfortable majority of participants supporting   the approach  We begin with President Plosser    Thank you  President Fisher    Thank you  President Lacker    Thank you  President Williams    We haven’t finalized, but I assume that we would want to   release this with the other projections that we’ll talk about in the press conference  President   Bullard   December 13, 2011 142 of 198               Thank you  Governor Tarullo    Thank you    President Lacker    President Evans    Thank you  Unless people are eager to get to the airport,   we could take 15 minutes for coffee  Is that okay?  No objections?  All right   December 13, 2011 152 of 198              [Coffee break]    Let’s recommence, and we will turn to President George    Thank you  President Pianalto    Thank you  President Lockhart    Thank you  President Kocherlakota    Thank you  President Rosengren    Otherwise, you are okay?      Vice Chairman    Thank you  Governor Duke    Thank you  Governor Raskin    Thank you very much  Very good conversation and   discussion     On the policy statement, we do appear to be pretty close  We have quite broad   agreement, but, as I said, the subcommittee ought to take the comments that were made today   December 13, 2011 168 of 198              and see if there are any improvements or changes that need to be made and to consult with the   Committee   Some practical issues were raised  In particular, Governor Tarullo raised the question of   how best to bring this out into the public  If anyone has any thoughts on that, either now or later,   I would be very happy to hear them  I suppose it is a possibility that if we could agree on   something in the intermeeting period, I could make some kind of presentation or something   before the January meeting, but I don’t want to promise or count on that  Let’s move forward   and see what kind of progress we can make  Suggestions about how to introduce this most   effectively would be welcome   On the issue of the rates, I will take a straw poll in a moment  I do want to emphasize   that, as Governor Yellen said, this is a work in progress  This is not the last thing we will ever   do  I’m sure there is a lot that needs to be done within the context of the SEP, but also in moving   forward toward even better communication devices   President Kocherlakota, I disagree with you in your characterization of this as individuals   making policy  By the same token, we are all setting our own inflation targets, because we all   give our long-run inflation value in the SEP  This is, as everyone understands, a survey of   current views, and given that appropriate policy is assumed for the projections, it seems   complementary to the survey to have that information  But while I share some of the concerns   about the practicality of bringing 17 people together in a collective forecast, in principle it is the   right way to go, and I agree with you and President Bullard that we should investigate that very   seriously and move in that direction over time  Based on experience, it is not going to happen in   the next six weeks  It’s something we need to work toward over time   December 13, 2011 169 of 198              I do think we can preserve the distinction between commitments made by the Committee   and those made by individuals  For example, it would be possible for the Committee collectively   to decide to make an interest rate commitment that would differ from the sum of all of the   individual projections and to state that officially in the statements, and so on  I recognize that is   not completely straightforward, but I think that with some explanation it would be workable  Let   me, again, assure you that we will continue to look for ways to improve our communication   While it would be nice to do more work and more experimentation, there is considerable   value to putting this out soon  I would like to propose, as the subcommittee has suggested, that   we put the rate projections out in the January round  I am going to take a straw vote of the   Committee participants  I will ask for yes, no, and abstentions  All those in favor?    In favor  One, two, three, four, five, six      We are voting on the rate projections  Seven, 8, 9, 10, 11    Against?  No?  Three, four  Abstentions?  Are you abstaining, Betsy?    That’s an abstention    The debate will be reflected in the minutes and the   transcripts, and we should continue this conversation as we go forward and try to find better   ways  Let me end on the one thing that everybody around the table agreed on, which was that   the subcommittee has done excellent work  We appreciate it  The penalty for good work is they   December 13, 2011 170 of 198              may be asked to do more work  [Laughter]  Again, thank you for that  Any other issues?  [No   response]  Two minor things  First, we did ratify everything  Second, I need to officially   announce that the next meeting is January 24 and 25  Thank you all very much    Present?  [Laughter]  Thank you   END OF MEETING   December 13, 2011 171 of 198     "
9393,2013-10-16,BERNANKE,"  Welcome, everybody  This is a joint meeting of the Board   and the FOMC, so I need a motion to close the meeting    Thank you  The purpose of the discussion today is to talk   about debt ceiling–related issues and potential responses should the debt ceiling be breached  As   you know, and Linda will explain in more detail, the Congress has made considerable progress   today toward, at least for the time being, solving that problem  So, in that respect, this is very   much like the August 1, 2011, meeting, where Granger causality suggests that our meeting was   sufficient to solve the problem   I did consult about whether we needed this meeting today, but first of all the Congress   has not finally acted  Second, they are only putting off this issue until early February, possibly   into March, with extraordinary measures  Third, we haven’t discussed these issues for a couple   of years  And it was also pointed out to me that the minutes of this discussion might be a   potentially useful way to communicate some of our thinking to the markets in preparation for   another episode, which, unfortunately, seems more likely than not to occur at some point  So the   focus of the meeting today will be some briefings from staff members, and then we can take as   much time as we want to talk about issues and things we need to think about for this problem if   it’s not resolved now or if it arises in the future   For the purpose of the minutes, I think it is probably worth my saying that a default on   US Treasury securities would be a grave threat both to the economy and to the financial system    And what we are talking about here today are steps that the Federal Reserve could take to   mitigate on the margin the potential effect of such a default, but, obviously, this is not a problem   October 16, 2013 4 of 50    that we could eliminate, by any means  I just wanted to make sure that was part of the   discussion   Unless there are any questions or preliminary comments, what I’d like to do is turn now   to staff members for briefings and allow time for Q&A after each briefing  I will begin with   Linda Robertson, who is feverishly trying to keep up with the latest congressional developments    Linda    Thank you  Any questions for Linda?  [No response]    Okay  I don’t see any questions  Let me turn now to Simon Potter to talk a little bit about   market developments over the past few days as well as anything you’d like to say, Simon, about   market preparedness    Simon, in the event of a temporary default, what would you   categorize as the most important risks to financial stability?  You mentioned money market   funds, repo    Thank you  President Lacker   October 16, 2013 8 of 50     Thank you  Other questions for Simon?  [No response]    Okay  Thank you  Our next briefer is Susan Foley, who is going to talk about planning for   handling government payments    Any questions?  President Fisher    Other questions?  [No response]  Susan, what is your sense   of the understanding of banks and the public about how this is going to work?  What are the   main weak points at this juncture in terms of their understanding of how payments would   operate?    Thank you  Linda gave me a note here saying that the   McConnell debt ceiling rule will apply once to the February 7 date  Does that mean that   February 7 is not in fact a concern at this point?    I see  So they are applying the McConnell rule at this   instance so that they can raise the debt ceiling without voting for it    But they have to vote for the rule    Okay    All right  Well, at least it’s a step in the right direction, I   guess   Okay  Thank you, Susan  If there are no other questions, let me turn to Mike Gibson to   talk about supervision and other bank issues    This is basically the same guidance that we were planning   in 2011    Okay  Any questions for Mike?  Governor    Is there any discussion of negative interest rates on   deposits?  Bank of New York did that last time     Governor Powell    It’s a very complicated question  In this particular instance,   the first, most likely, contingency would be that the Treasury would pay principal and interest,   and so it wouldn’t become directly relevant  But even in the case where it was not doing that,   the first risk of not paying was after November 1  So the question of, “When is the appropriate   time?” is a difficult one, and I think the best thing we could probably do, if possible, would be to   try to coordinate with the Treasury and the announcements that it makes  Obviously, we haven’t   gotten to that point    That’s right  Vice Chairman Dudley    I think that’s right  As Simon said, the rollovers are   perhaps the most serious risk point because it’s very hard to predict what would happen there    That’s fair  Any other questions for Mike?  [No response]    Seeing none, let me ask Bill English—Bill, are you going to present the joint memo?    We come now to some issues that are FOMC   responsibilities specifically, and also some Board responsibilities      Thank you very much  Are there any questions for Bill or   Simon?  Governor Tarullo     The thrust of your question is if we can’t lend to the   discount window because of stigma, we need—    President Lockhart    Correct me if I’m wrong here—we’re required to buy in the   market  Obviously, we can’t buy directly from the Treasury  So our decision to buy, in some   sense, if it’s helping anybody, it’s helping the private counterparties, not the US government,   except that there is an indirect price effect on their Treasuries  If it’s monetization, it’s a very   indirect monetization    Right  Yes, it’s pretty indirect help  Well, except there’s   the practical issue that the amounts of defaults could swamp our ability to do that, and so I guess   there wouldn’t be any implied guarantee  President Fisher, do you have a question?    Okay  Any other questions for Bill or Simon?  While   you’re thinking, I will report one more comment from Linda Robertson  Apparently, according   to her information, the debt ceiling disapproval vote, where there will be a vote to see if there are   two-thirds of either house to disapprove the President’s decision to raise the debt ceiling, will   take place possibly next week, implying that there may be a little bit of uncertainty between now   and when that vote takes place  That being said, I presume that when the President raises the   debt ceiling, borrowing will be available immediately, so that there won’t be any delay in getting   access back to the market  Any other questions?    Governor Raskin    Any other questions?  [No response]  If not, let me proceed   as follows  The questions that were circulated basically asked for your views on three subsets of   the questions that Bill and Simon raised  I’d like to proceed in that way, one group at a time   If we could start with the first five, those were purchases of defaulted Treasuries as part   of normal LSAPs; rollovers of maturing securities, which is not relevant because we don’t have   any significant number of rollovers; acceptance of securities with delayed coupon payments as   collateral in securities lending activity; injection of reserves to address the situation where the   federal funds rate went above the 25 basis point top of the range set by the FOMC, with delayed-  payment Treasuries eligible as collateral; and, finally, discount window lending against delayed-  payment or impaired Treasuries  All of these actions would be at market prices  We have,   essentially, a process by which the auctions are set in a way that sets a price for each CUSIP   separately, so that we would be able to differentiate between securities that are similar in other   respects but differ in whether they have had a delayed coupon or not   Those are the five that were very broadly supported in 2011  I would add to that that we   still, of course, have the currency swap agreements with our five counterparties, and that is   October 16, 2013 22 of 50    another action that could become relevant that has been authorized by the FOMC  In particular,   the Desk already has the flexibility to change schedules or terms of currency swap arrangements    So if there was a need to auction dollars on short notice, for example, we have the authority to do   that currently, although of course we would want to keep the FOMC informed about any such   developments  Let me throw that into the first five, and let me ask if there’s anyone who would   like to address any of these or has any particular concerns about these potential policy actions    President Kocherlakota    I think that is reasonable and a pretty conservative   approach—to communicate once there is a breach  I guess the question remains, what kind of   communication we should do even prior to a breach, because some of the operational issues, for   example, take longer to resolve   October 16, 2013 23 of 50     Any other comments?  I see Vice Chairman Dudley first,   and then President Fisher    President Fisher    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Actually, more than three weeks because it would come out   with the minutes of the next FOMC meeting    November 20, I’m informed   October 16, 2013 25 of 50     Governor Powell    It’s just very difficult  There is no perfect time  If you do it   right after we breach the limit, which would be another natural time, then that would potentially   send a signal that we are anticipating a default    Governor Tarullo    Those pithy statements are usually in the form of the   statement “The Federal Reserve stands ready to provide liquidity as needed”  We could do   something like that in the sense that it expresses a general willingness to address these issues by   unstinting provision of liquidity without necessarily listing each individual item; that would be   perhaps another way forward   I have Vice Chairman Dudley and President Fisher again    President Kocherlakota    I absolutely agree that we have to make those decisions   based on our own calculations and not based on the Treasury’s views  But they are difficult   calculations, and we don’t want to understate the complexity of trying to decide exactly when the   right time is to make these kinds of statements  President Lacker    Well, that’s a complicated question  I think, though, that   it’s a far stretch to put an Arrow-Debreu kind of market structure on this, because at a basic   operational level, these defaulted Treasuries can’t be handled very well, and then there are legal   questions, like how we treat them as capital, and so on  I think we learned from the crisis that   there are externalities associated with massive financial disruption, and here is a case where   operational and other considerations—legal considerations, transactions costs—create problems   for the market dealing with these securities  Our ability to provide liquidity against these less   liquid securities seems like part of our general financial stability function  But I’d be the first to   admit that it’s not an easy analysis    Governor Stein    Okay  Any other comments on 1 through 5?  President   Kocherlakota    Okay  Thank you    Yes    Thank you  Vice Chairman Dudley    President Pianalto    Okay  President Evans    Okay  I don’t want to try to paraphrase Esther, but I took   her as supporting providing some basic information about our decisions today about policy   responses  President Evans    Yes  The TMPG is the Treasury Market Practices Group,   and they, in consultation with the New York Fed, put in their minutes some descriptions of how   defaulted Treasuries would be handled in payments—in particular, this notion that the maturity   could be artificially extended by one day as a way of letting systems deal with the defaulted   coupon Treasuries  I do not believe there was anything in their minutes about Fed actions,   including discount window actions and the like, so those things are not out there    Okay  President Bullard   October 16, 2013 35 of 50     Thank you very much  I wonder, in the interest of time, if   we could get to the second half, and of course the communications issues are relevant there as   October 16, 2013 36 of 50    well  Let me try to do this in an efficient way  Actions 6 and 7 had to do with the use of RRPs   or RPs in the Treasury repo market  Let me focus particularly on number 7  The idea here is    Suppose that repo rates jump sharply because of liquidity pressures in the market, would there be   circumstances, not all circumstances, in which we would be willing to intervene in order to bring   those rates down somewhat?  For concreteness, I think there are at least a couple of situations   where we might want to at least consider that  One has to do with the transmission of monetary   policy  Even though our explicit target is the federal funds rate, if the effects of the federal funds   rate on broader market rates are being obscured or interfered with by very high short-term repo   rates, arguably our monetary policy mandate would lead us to want to make sure that interest   rates generally were consistent with achievement of our policy mandate  So that’s one possible   reason  The other reason that I can think of offhand goes back to Governor Raskin’s question   about money market funds  This might be a situation in which spikes in Treasuries—short-term   Treasury bills, for example—are putting a lot of pressure on money market funds, perhaps   generating runs  And by reducing those yields, we might be able to take some of the pressure off   of that indirectly  I’m not suggesting that under 7 we would always move to address any kind of   spike in repo rates  But if they affected monetary policy, or threatened financial stability, say, in   the context of money market funds, then we might want to consider that  So let me put that out   there for consideration   And finally, at the same time, I’ll mention 8 and 9  Number 8 is purchasing Treasuries   with delayed coupons in an effort to take them out of the market  We wouldn’t be able to do that   in any kind of comprehensive way, given the size of the Treasury market  Number 9 is a   sterilized version of that, where we essentially swap undefaulted Treasuries for defaulted   Treasuries  It was the presumption of the staff that we would not want to do that, but let me raise   October 16, 2013 37 of 50    both of these things at the same time and get reactions to number 7, which is the circumstances   in which we might want to intervene because of a spike in repo rates  And if there is no support   for 8 or 9, we can take that as given  But if anyone wants to make the case for 8 or 9, then this   would be an opportunity to do that  So let me open the floor for any comments on those issues    Vice Chairman Dudley    Thank you  Any other comments?  President Kocherlakota    Governor Powell, did you have a comment?    October 16, 2013 40 of 50     So you are willing to accept “loathsome” under some   certain circumstances  [Laughter]    President Evans, I think you had raised your hand      Thank you  Governor Stein    I think we agree we are going to have to have an FOMC   vote on that particular one    Governor Tarullo    I think several people supported you on that, and I think   Governor Powell did not exclude this   October 16, 2013 44 of 50     President Lacker    President Fisher    Thank you  President Williams    Thank you  President Rosengren    Thank you  President Bullard    Thank you  Governor Yellen    Thank you  President Pianalto    Well, I think we need to review the discussion we had, not   only in terms of the substance but also in terms of communication  And of course the minutes,   as always, will be circulated, and we will try to come to some agreement  My sense of the   meeting is that we should provide somewhat more detail in terms of our broad willingness to   address liquidity issues without limiting the range of things that we are willing to do  But we   have a few weeks yet  We can work on trying to find language that will meet the concerns that   were raised   But I’m actually very glad that we had this discussion, notwithstanding that it may be   moot for the time being, in part because it was useful to talk about some of these tools, but also   precisely because of this communication issue, which is relevant, even now, because it may be   that this is the right time to communicate some of these things to the market  So we will give   this some thought and circulate something for Committee approval, obviously, at the appropriate   time   We are at 400  Is there anyone who has not been able to speak who would like to speak?    [No response]  Okay  Again, I’m glad we had this discussion  I thought it was actually very   useful, and I thank you for making the time   END OF MEETING   October 16, 2013 50 of 50     "
