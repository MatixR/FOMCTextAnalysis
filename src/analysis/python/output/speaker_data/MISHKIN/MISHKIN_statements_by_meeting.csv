7808,2006-09-20," I wanted to sit right back there, but they wouldn’t let me  [Laughter]     First, on this issue of persistence, I want to mention that I think we should   have some caution about interpreting the results  I do not quite know what the word “persistence”   means because this is really a very reduced form estimate  A key issue is what mean it is that   inflation is reverting to, and that can very much depend on what we do in terms of managing   expectations  It is completely reasonable for you to have done the simulation that you call “less   September 20, 2006 26 of 132                                              inflation persistence,” but I might call it something different  So just I think that’s important to   think about   What I would like you to do is to actually go a little beyond the forecast  I’d like to know   what your thinking is on 2009, maybe 2010  I know you’re going to be a little uncomfortable about   doing so because there is clearly a lot of uncertainty  However, when I think about what the state of   the economy is and how we should do monetary policy, we need to look at longer periods  So I am   not going to hold you to it and say, “Gee, you have to be able to give us a great forecast,” but I   would actually like to know at least what your thinking may be on that issue     Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I just should say that it’s a great   pleasure to return to the Federal Reserve System—I have so many friends here at the table and   around the table It’s also very nice to move to a slightly more comfortable chair  [Laughter]    Many of you know I have an upbeat personality—some might actually   say loud—but certainly upbeat The way I look at the forecast and the situation with the   economy is quite positive in the sense that what we’re seeing, really, is a return to normalcy and   September 20, 2006 84 of 132                        a more balanced economy  The excesses in the housing sector seem to be unwinding in an   acceptable way, so I think it is quite reasonable in terms of the Greenbook forecast to think that   the spillover here is not going to be a big problem because we’re actually moving resources from   a sector that had too much going into it, into sectors that need to have more resources at the   present time  So in that sense, I’m actually quite positive  The other thing that I am quite   comfortable with in the Greenbook forecast—though, clearly, there’s uncertainty—is that we’re   going to see a decelerating core inflation rate  Furthermore, when we look at inflation   expectations, they seem to be very well contained and seem also to have responded well to the   pause at the last meeting   However, I should say that, although we’ve seen that inflation expectations are well   anchored, there’s a question about whether they’re anchored at quite the right level  They seem   to be anchored somewhere around 2½ percent on the CPI, and that is probably with a differential   between the CPI and the PCE of about ½ percentage point, or 50 basis points  It still seems to be   somewhat on the high side in terms of what many people on the Committee have expressed is   their comfort zone  So I think that is a concern  There is a significant probability that things   may not turn out so rosy on the output front—we should have a concern that things could go   somewhat wrong in terms of the housing sector  If that happened, we might see much lower   output growth  There is a reasonable probability of recession  It’s mentioned in the Greenbook    I think your numbers are quite reasonable  So in that context, we could actually have lower   output, a wider output gap, and some actual deceleration of inflation  I agreed very much with   the conclusion that you came to because it’s reasonable to think that the long-run inflation we’re   moving to is around 2 percent unless we get one of the scenarios with a lot more softness  That   September 20, 2006 85 of 132                      the deceleration is not going to go much below the Greenbook forecast of around 2 percent by   2008 does cause me a bit of concern   I’m not sure that I would describe the risks as unbalanced  For me, in terms of a forecast,   probably I would be comfortable saying they’re balanced  However, I think inflation is too high   in the forecast and, in that context, does require much more vigilance  Of course, that will be   reflected in the discussion later today Thank you     Well, in contrast to some people here, actually I’m quite comfortable with   the Greenbook forecast as to the most likely path of inflation  I am more troubled about what is   further out beyond the policy horizon  I think that the most likely path of inflation is to hit   2½ percent on the CPI and stay there, which is correspondingly around 2 percent on the PCE   deflator  So I do have some discomfort there, but I do not think that pursuing something like B+ or   raising rates at this time is the right way to deal with this problem  How we manage expectations   really is an issue, and we can’t do it with the apparatus we have now  I am very much looking   forward to the discussion of communications at the next meeting [laughter] because I think the issue   here is our overall strategy about monetary policy  We have to think about how we put it all   together in terms of what we do at a particular meeting and in terms of how we manage expectations   going forward   So at this particular juncture I am very comfortable with B  I think that the right way to   express the fact that we are uncomfortable with the current rate of inflation and with what will   happen more than two years out is to do it through the minutes  I am sure the minutes will show   that the sentiment of the Committee is that we’re not comfortable with having a situation in which,   if inflation does not moderate along the lines of the Greenbook, we keep rates the same  In that   context, we would likely have to raise them; or if the economy weakens somewhat and inflation   does not decline the way we hope it will, we might actually have to maintain rates at the current   level longer than the market might otherwise expect  So we can do it that way at this stage, and   we’ll just have to see where the Committee comes out in thinking about how we manage   expectations in the future  Thank you  "
7833,2006-10-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I see it, the data have actually been   coming in very much along the lines of where we were at the last meeting in terms of the   outlook  The only way that I would change my view slightly is actually good news, in that I see   somewhat less downside potential than I saw at the last meeting  In particular, I think that the   housing market, although it has retrenched a lot, which I actually consider a rebalancing of the   economy, does not look as though it’s going to collapse in a nonlinear way  For example, we see   that the market has some expectations along those lines—for example, the stock prices of   builders have actually come back a substantial amount  We also see that consumers seem to be   holding up very well  The real danger that we were worried about in terms of a housing market   retrenchment is that it would spill over in a nonlinear way to the household sector  We don’t see   any evidence of that either  Consumer confidence is staying strong  The stock market is up—  again, an indication that these spillover effects are not occurring over and above those that we   think would be normal in terms of wealth effects and so forth  So, for me, there is actually some   October 24-25, 2006 70 of 203    good news here in that the possibility of a soft landing has actually increased  My view of where   the economy is heading has not undergone a major change, but I have a bit less in the downside   tails than I had before   The characterization of a deceleration of core PCE inflation also seems to be a very   reasonable one  I think the evidence is moving in that direction  But I do want to emphasize that   I see no reason that core PCE inflation will fall below 2 percent  We see that inflation   expectations are solidly grounded  The good news in that has been that we had an increase in   energy prices and we did not see an acceleration of inflation expectations  However, the   numbers there are around 2½ percent on the CPI, and that’s consistent with a 2 percent PCE   deflator inflation  When we think about going out past the two years, I do see deceleration along   the lines of the Greenbook  I don’t see anything more encouraging after that  Talking about the   issue of potentially less persistence does not tell us, in fact, that inflation should fall below what   inflation expectations are anchored at  So thank you very much     This is going to come up later  There are real issues about using the word   “potential” that I think will get us into trouble  So I’m sympathetic to your view about being clear,   but I think we had better wait on this  It’s something that’s more complicated than I think we want   to deal with at this stage     I see the data that have come in over the past five weeks as indicating that   the economy is actually evolving in a way that I find quite attractive  In that sense I hate to use this   language, but I think it’s actually appropriate  I think the right language is “stay the course”    October 24-25, 2006 118 of 203    [Laughter]  In that regard, in terms of the statement, we want to modify as few words as possible    Clearly it makes sense not to mention energy for the reasons that have been discussed, but I think   the right way to let the markets know where we are is that basically we’ve paused in the last couple   of meetings, that pausing has actually worked out quite well, and that we’ll wait to see how the data   evolve  Thank you     Some people who know me quite well have been surprised at how brief   some of my statements have been  So in this case I hope you’ll indulge me a little  [Laughter]     As many of you know, I have thought quite a lot about this issue and have   written quite a lot about it  I’ve also been thinking a lot about it recently, particularly in the context   of different political environments and structures of committees in which to operate  I just finished   a report on Sweden  Sweden is not the same as the United States, and the Riksbank is not the same   October 24-25, 2006 134 of 203    as the Federal Reserve, so that will reflect some of my thinking that may be a little bit different from   what you have seen before     Let me go down the decision tree, which I thought was excellent  The Committee and the   staff did a superb job in framing it in a way I find very useful, so I am going to proceed exactly   along the lines that they suggest  The first question is, Is an explicit numerical specification of price   stability helpful?  You are not going to be surprised at my answer  It’s a very strong “yes”  I could   go on and on about this because I have written so much about it, but I’ll try to be very brief on these   issues  The key to successful monetary policy is having a strong nominal anchor  The kind of   success that we’ve seen in central banks throughout the world, which would not have been predicted   ten or fifteen years ago, is really remarkable, and it is because having a strong nominal anchor   allows the markets to do a lot of the work for you  But also what’s very important to emphasize is   that you don’t have to do it with a long-run numerical inflation goal—the Federal Reserve has been   very successful in doing it with an individual  So I don’t see that this has been a problem in recent   years  I have to tell you that, maybe because I am here, I feel we are very lucky to have had the   Chairmen we have had  It could have come out quite differently  Having an explicit numerical   definition of price stability, a long-run goal for inflation, means that the nominal anchor is less   dependent upon who the Chairman is, and I think that’s actually something that is very good  It’s   true in the past that we have not had a problem with that, with Volcker, Greenspan, and now   Chairman Bernanke     But we did have a problem before that, and that is exactly my point  In   fact, not only might you not get the right person in the future—and that could have happened this   time around, but we were lucky in that regard—but even when you have the right person, the   October 24-25, 2006 135 of 203    transition to a new Chairman has been very complicated  In particular, people might not remember   this, but when Greenspan came in, there was an inflation scare in the bond markets  Long bond   rates went up about 200 basis points, and the bond market tanked  I think that there was also some   confusion in the markets when our current Chairman took this office about whether he was a hawk   or a dove on controlling inflation  Luckily, I think that confusion has dissipated, but I think it   actually made your life, Ben, a little more complicated than you would have chosen it to be  So the   way I think about this is that I would like the transition to a new Chairman to be very boring, and   having an explicit numerical inflation goal for the long run would help in that regard   Clearly, there are also the standard advantages that having an explicit long-run numerical   inflation goal would clarify communication with the public, the markets, and the politicians  It   increases transparency and accountability  What is not discussed as much—but I think Bill Poole   hit on it—is that it could clarify and make more coherent discussions inside the FOMC  I would   really like to know, when somebody is advocating a certain setting of the federal funds rate, what   his or her inflation goal is  Jeff Lacker has dissented in this particular meeting  I have an idea why   you did because I think you have been clear on what your goal is  But if I were confused about that,   I would have a harder time understanding why you’re taking the position that you’re taking  We   have seen evidence in looking at how central banks operate that having an explicit goal has actually   improved the nature of the deliberations in these committees   Another thing that is very important is that having an explicit numerical goal would allow us   to think about the way of doing monetary policy, which is becoming better understood in the   academic literature on optimal policy  The way we think about doing optimal policy is looking at   what is an appropriate inflation path  In particular, having a long-run goal that you know you’re   heading to and then talking about the path to that goal is exactly the right way to think about policy   October 24-25, 2006 136 of 203    Let me tell you where I would like to head ultimately and then where I think the Committee   should head in the short run  There’s a slight difference because of some considerations I’m going   to bring up  I’d like to see in the long run exactly what Bill Poole and Jeff Lacker mentioned, which   is the FOMC’s agreeing on an explicit long-run numerical inflation goal and doing it in terms of   saying that we are defining what we mean by price stability  So I am in full agreement with you   that we should ultimately head there  Then the discussion of monetary policy, both inside and   outside, should focus on what the appropriate path is to get there and how long it should take  This   approach is consistent with what we have learned in terms of modern monetary policy analysis  It is   the way we have learned to think about this and, by the way, is consistent with the kind of policies   for the most part that have been pursued by the Federal Reserve over the past ten years  A key part   of the success of the Federal Reserve’s operations is that, in practice, we have actually been   operating in that way   When you have such an approach, there are four basic principles regarding the way you   think about changing the path that you think is appropriate in terms of achieving the long-run goal    First of all, we ask how far away we are currently from the long-run goal—so where we are really   matters  Second, the nature of the shocks, whether they’re transitory or permanent, is clearly   important  Third, it is very important to be aware of how big the projected output gaps are because   we should care about output fluctuations, something I will turn to in a second  Finally, we also want   to be very concerned about financial stability issues because, if something is occurring on the   financial stability front, we have to be able to deal with it  This kind of approach would allow us to   have a concern about business-cycle fluctuations, which I think is key for a central bank  It would   also allow us to change policy in response to financial instability concerns  It should allow us to   deal with the LTCM type of situation, in which there was a potential small probability of very   October 24-25, 2006 137 of 203    disastrous things happening  In fact, it should be consistent with what Greenspan called the   risk-management approach  So I think it is very important to understand that we’re not talking   about going to a rigid form of inflation targeting if we pursue this goal   Now let me turn to the second issue on the decision tree, which is how we express an   explicit nominal definition of price stability  I want to discuss some subtleties that really do concern   me right now, which means that I’m going to shift slightly from where I want to get in the long run   to where I think we should head in the intermediate term  Four critical considerations worry me    The first is the political process  It is very important that we do not get too far ahead of the   Congress on this  It is extremely important that we express a further definition of what we mean by   price stability in a way that is absolutely consistent with the Federal Reserve Act and with the law   and with the dual mandate  This consideration became very clear to me in looking at what   happened during the testimony that the Chairman gave when he took his position  It was clearly a   central issue in the testimony that I gave  It’s very clear that this process is part of the American   system and that it differs from many other countries  So that’s consideration one   Consideration two is that it’s extremely important that we not be considered to be what   Mervyn King artfully has called “inflation nutters”  The British have better training in English than   we have—they always have better phrases for things  But we need to make very clear that, in fact,   we are not inflation fanatics  A key part of the success of the Federal Reserve has been based on the   fact that the Federal Reserve is clearly perceived by the public, the politicians, and the markets as   having a weight on output fluctuations in our decisions  What is also an important part of our   success is that, in contrast to many other central banks, we have been willing to express our   concerns about output fluctuations and the business cycle  So in my past writings, I have talked   about the dirty little secret of central banking, which is that most central banks are not willing to   October 24-25, 2006 138 of 203    admit that they care about output fluctuations  I think this is actually a serious problem for them    Luckily, we don’t have that problem, but if we move toward an explicit nominal long-run inflation   goal, we need to be clear that we differ in that regard from other central banks  The issue here is   that this is a primary reason that we’ve had the support of the public and the politicians  We   certainly don’t want to lose that  That’s the second consideration   The third consideration is that we differ from other countries in a major way, and when I   look at the Riksbank versus the Federal Reserve, I see how different we are  We have nineteen   participants making decisions about monetary policy, and that’s extremely unusual  The only other   comparable situation is the European system of central banks  Our situation is different not only   because there are nineteen people but also because the participants reside in different locations    Now there are six but there will be seven of us existing in house, and there are twelve of you who   factor in different locations and have a very different role  You are CEOs of an organization, and   you have to communicate differently with the public than the Governors do  I really understand this   because I’ve been on both sides, having been at a Reserve Bank and also here  That situation   actually makes things very, very different   The fourth consideration is that the Federal Reserve has been extremely successful  That   gives people confidence in us and tells us that the more evolutionary we can be the better off we are    This consideration is important in two senses  One is that we want to say that we have done a good   job in the past, and we are going to continue to do a good job in the future  Thus we build on the   credibility that we’ve established over the past fifteen years or so  The second sense is political    We really want to promote political support, and looking as though we’re doing something that is   departing from where we were is not a good way to move forward   October 24-25, 2006 139 of 203    Now that I have given you basic principles, let me put forth a proposal—not one to be voted   on today but where I would like to see us head  Although in the long run I would like the FOMC to   be able to sit down and agree on what our long-run inflation goals should be in terms of a specific   number, I would argue that the four considerations I brought up suggest that we need to go a bit   more slowly to that path  So here is what I would suggest  As part of our reporting procedures that   we do for our Monetary Policy Report twice a year, we produce forecasts  In a similar vein, I think   it would be very effective for all nineteen participants, when they are giving forecasts, to say what   their definitions of price stability are and, in fact, provide that number  But I would recommend that   this be done only once a year, not twice a year   What are the advantages of doing this?  One advantage is that I think we are fairly close or   will become fairly close to having agreement on it  I would argue that the numbers will not be that   different among us, and providing our numbers will make it easier for us to come to consensus in   the future  So it is an intermediate step to get us there in the long run  Another advantage has to do   with the fact that we have nineteen participants  I think it’s very important that all participants are   heard from and that we don’t encroach on their particular views until we can actually build a   consensus  So it really fits in with the issue that there are nineteen people in different locations with   different jobs to do  Also, it’s evolutionary; it really is not a radical departure  It’s very much in the   spirit of saying that we have a dual mandate  We’ve actually had individuals talking about comfort   zones and so forth  We’re just formalizing the process, and we’re doing it in a way that is a step   forward in transparency, so it really moves us very much in the direction we have been going  The   bottom line here is that it gets us close to having an agreement  I think that is not too far away   I do want to mention the once-a-year issue, which would come up if the FOMC actually   votes on this  I think people worry about that very much because—and I agree strongly with   October 24-25, 2006 140 of 203    President Poole and President Lacker—we do not want to have the number change very much over   time  (We could also talk about some tricky issues that are created by bad inflation expectations   dynamics, but not now because they are more complicated)  In practice, we have actually seen   something that gives us a lot of information about this issue because one of the concerns that people   had when inflation targeting started was that it would be decided by governments  The problem   with governments is that we know what politicians are like—they have to get elected, and they   think short term; this is one reason that we like to insulate the central bank from the political   process  There was then a concern that, if the government provides a number, it will do so   opportunistically  We have not found that to happen, and the reason it has not happened is that   providing a number is so transparent  When you actually have to give a number, you have to have a   darned good reason for changing it  In fact, I think it would be very unlikely that we would find this   Committee, even if we did this on an annual basis, wanting to change it  Transparency really has   huge benefits  It’s remarkable that, when there have been such changes, they have clearly been for   technical reasons and have been in the right direction  In one case, the Bank of England changed   the number because of a change in the calculation of their price index  It was done in the case of the   Reserve Bank of New Zealand, with some resistance from the Reserve Bank, but they agreed that   the range they went to—eventually to 1 to 3 from zero to 2—was a better number for them  Thus, I   think that concern is really not going to be a problem even if we do this once a year   I have an aside that I wasn’t going to mention, but I think it’s important to mention  It has to   do with the issue of potential GDP and potential employment or a discussion of the NAIRU, and it   relates a bit to President Moskow’s suggestion, which I do not think is the right way to go  If we   provide information about our explicit numerical inflation goal, it’s very important to explain why   doing so should not drive us to provide a similar definition of potential employment, potential   October 24-25, 2006 141 of 203    output, or the NAIRU for several reasons  The first is that it’s extremely hard to know what the   correct values are for those numbers, and they’re extremely hard to estimate in real time, as we   know  I don’t even know what they are conceptually  This is a big issue in the academic literature    We have a good example of this issue right now, which is that the Greenbook has a very different   view on this from what we find in the private markets—you see much slower growth of potential   GDP than the markets do  Any suggestion that we have something like an employment goal would   be very, very damaging to us  We also know that, when the Federal Reserve has acted this way,   which they did in the ’70s, it led to disastrous outcomes; Burns focused too much on output gaps,   and it got the Fed into a lot of trouble  This finding comes from work done by your staff—in   particular, Athanasios Orphanides   In contrast, it is important to clarify that the reason for the big difference between defining   price stability and defining employment goals is that we know from a welfare viewpoint it doesn’t   matter much whether we are off by 50 or even 100 basis points  I think this is the point that Bill   made  He likes zero, taking into account measurement error, but if we said it was 100 basis points   more than that, I don’t think it would be that big a deal  We know that what is really important is to   have a number to pin down inflation expectations, and not the specific number  That is absolutely   not true of an employment goal  So it is very important to get that across, and it is the reason I   reacted to President Plosser’s comments about this issue of talking about potential, although I think   that he agrees with me   It is also one reason that I have a concern with the proposal that President Moskow has   made  First of all, I don’t think it is explicit enough  But I also have the problem that, if you talk   about a five-year inflation forecast as a goal, people start to interpret that as a goal, and if you talk   about a five-year GDP forecast, they’ll also interpret that as a goal  I think it leads exactly to a lack   October 24-25, 2006 142 of 203    of clarity that will get us into trouble  So we need to be much clearer on this  If you ask me my   five-year inflation forecast, that might not be the same thing as my view of the appropriate level of   price stability because I have to think about what everybody else’s decisions are going to be, who   may be the next Chairman, or whatever   Another issue, which is not the main subject today, is important to discuss because it may   affect what the staff has to do  I have another proposal, which is completely independent of our   decision to go toward an explicit inflation goal; it is that markets would tremendously benefit from   more information about our forecasts, which are now twice a year, and to have that information four   times a year  By the way, this proposal came out very strongly in the Meyer survey, which I’m sure   you’re all familiar with  They were quite in favor of it  Again, this could be done in an   evolutionary fashion  We have a reporting procedure on monetary policy, which we are mandated   to carry out twice a year  By saying that we’re willing to do it four times a year, we are actually   saying that, in the spirit of cooperating with the Congress, we are trying to be even more helpful  So   I think it would fit in very naturally  What it would require, of course, is a little more work on the   part of all of us because we’d have to do it four times a year rather than twice a year  But I’m   willing to do that, and I think other people would be willing to do it as well   Another key issue is that we need to greatly improve the quality of the written documents   that go with this process  The current Monetary Policy Report is really terrible  It’s dull; it’s sex   made boring  I don’t want to criticize too much, but it is  [Laughter]     If it were a textbook, and I can tell you I know a lot about this, you   wouldn’t sell one copy  [Laughter]  So it’s a problem  We see this in practice in that the markets   pay very little attention to the Monetary Policy Report  A feature of inflation-targeting regimes is   October 24-25, 2006 143 of 203    that they produce something called inflation reports  (By the way, I would never want to call it that   in the United States; I would want to stick with Monetary Policy Report—it is a good name, and it   fits into this evolutionary view)  They have improved the quality of these documents so that they   receive a lot of attention  Those reports have become extremely important vehicles for getting the   central bank’s views across to the public and for helping the public understand what the central   banks are doing; they actually also provide support for the central bank to pursue optimal policy  So   improving these documents would have tremendous benefits, and I think it could be done, and I   actually think the staff would probably enjoy doing them—well, maybe not  [Laughter]  You’d be   working harder, but that’s why you get paid the big bucks  I think you’d actually enjoy doing this    In the inflation reports, they’ve moved to using the best textbook writing techniques—nice colors,   boxes  Ben and I have been involved in this process  It’s the reason that I can afford my spouse    It’s a change in the nature of the way this is done, but I think it’s very doable and will have a lot of   benefits   The last box in the decision tree is technical issues  That’s not what we’re here to discuss   today  There are a lot of them  How should we report the participants’ forecasts, if we go that   route?  What price index should we use?  We would have to agree at least on what price index and   whether it is a core or a headline measure before providing our views about what price stability   means  Would it be a point or a range?  What should be the form of the Monetary Policy Report   document?  Also, what does economic analysis tell us about the optimal level of long-run inflation   rates so that we can actually think about the sense of it?  Even though I’ve written a lot about this, I   would like to think about all of it from scratch, and I would encourage the Committee to do that as   well  In that regard, I would like to have the staff do even more work  The staff would need to   provide us with a set of documents to get us to rethink these issues  There are a lot of technical   October 24-25, 2006 144 of 203    issues  The documents that you provided for the January 2005 meeting were excellent  But I would   basically have a complete relook because I think there are some changes that we should be aware of,   and then we can decide on what index  Some of us may change our views on exactly what number   we think is the right number for the long-run inflation goal   If we go this route, we might try a dry run on some of these things because of what   Governor Kohn mentioned—once you go this route, it’s not easy to go back; so you had better get it   right  We might want to try dry runs of what procedure we would use to provide information  If we   have a Monetary Policy Report document, we might try dry runs that we would actually discuss in   this Committee  I think by doing that we would be more likely to get it right  Anyway, I am sorry   to have gone on so long  I have now made up for the fact that I have been quieter other times, and   I’ll try to be quiet in the future if I can  Thank you very much  "
7857,2006-12-12,"  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I see the economy evolving very much along   the lines of the past couple of Greenbooks, particularly the ones since I’ve been here  The staff   is to be very highly commended  They pointed out that outcomes were going to be weaker than   other forecasters thought, and they really did get it right  Now, I have promised Dave that I   December 12, 2006 76 of 134         wouldn’t jump on him when they get it wrong, and today I’ll be nice in the other direction  I   think their forecast has been very useful in terms of the numbers      In fact, I think we’re seeing the economy evolve very much along the lines that we   discussed at the past couple of meetings  There really is not all that much new  I think there’s a   smidgen more weakness on the real side, but it doesn’t alter my basic view that the economy is   evolving along the lines of having slightly below potential GDP growth  I don’t see any   indications that we will have big spillovers into other sectors from weak housing and motor   vehicles  In that sense, there’s a slight concern about a little weakness, but the right word is I   guess a “smidgen,” not a whole lot    I see that inflation pressures are also very similar to what they were at the time of our last   meeting  Inflation is likely to decelerate to somewhere around 2½ percent in the core CPI and 2   percent in the core PCE  Part of the reason I believe those numbers is that the nature of the   output paths we’ve talked about is consistent with them, but I also think that we have anchored   inflation expectations around those levels  I don’t like to use the word “persistence” the way   other people do  I think of mean reversion to expected inflation—and very likely that’s where   inflation will be heading, given the paths that we see in terms of the economy and the forecast   from the Greenbook  I see the risks to forecast inflation as fairly balanced  The good news is   that compensation is not as scary as it was  But the bad news is that the labor markets are very   tight, and we’re just not quite sure what the implications of that are going to be  So my view is   that we have a bit greater uncertainty, not a whole lot, so that we need to be very vigilant on   inflation because it is too high, labor markets are tight, and there is still some question about how   quick the mean reversion to expected inflation will be  We also need to be vigilant about real   December 12, 2006 77 of 134         output  There is a bit more certain information coming in, so I think we have to watch both   inflation and output      The last thing to mention is the yield curve  I did some of the research on yield curves in   recessions, and I do not think that the yield curve is providing much information at this time,   exactly for the reasons that Governor Kroszner and others have discussed  I think there are   special reasons that the term premium is extremely low  There is always that nice little table of   the yield curve and recession probabilities, but you notice that I haven’t mentioned it, and I’m   not going to mention it in the future  [Laughter]  Thank you very much      Given the discussion today, there really is no reason to change our stance   in policy or change my views on policy  There is a bit more uncertainty, so I think the word   “vigilance” is important  Then we need to be able to move quickly, and it’s not clear to me that we   are necessarily talking about quickly in terms of lowering interest rates; we might have to raise   interest rates  So I think we just have to be aware of that   I am comfortable with the current assessment of risk  I think it would be a mistake to move   it now, which I don’t think anybody is suggesting, and it’s not clear to me that it wouldn’t be a bad   idea going forward  Even if we have inflation declining, we’re in a situation in which we actually   want to allow real rates to go up  In that sense, the assessment of risk as it is currently stated says   exactly that  If we change the assessment of risk to be more balanced, the market may react and   think we’re getting softer on inflation  So I am comfortable keeping it this way  Even though it’s   not on the table today, it would take a lot more for me to want to change it   On the issue of language, I guess I want to use the smidgen principle  My view is that   things have not really changed very much  There’s a smidgen of weakness  Again, the nuances of   this stuff are not my thing—I’m like President Plosser in that we’re sort of newbies  But the basic   December 12, 2006 110 of 134         principle here is the less we change, the better it is  There’s the issue about whether alternative C   would work by saying just “substantial”  That actually does indicate that we’re aware that things   have gotten a little softer, so I would be comfortable with President Minehan’s suggestion  But I’m   also not uncomfortable with just shortening exhibit 5, which says also that some recent indicators   have been mixed, period  I’m not sure which one of those is better, but I think the key idea here is   that we don’t want to change these a whole lot  We just want to acknowledge that, in fact, things   have been slightly softer but the change is not a big deal  Thank you     I thought you were going to ask about “smidgen”  [Laughter]     I think there’s a fine line here  It’s extremely important for us not to be   taking positions, exactly along the lines that have been suggested  But there is a question about   educating the public about the issues, not about the specifics  Because of the fine line, I’m not sure   how we should think about this question  Whatever we decide, at some point we don’t want to just   spring it on the public, for obvious reasons  There is a role for communication in terms of educating   the public about the issues, many of which we have been discussing—for example, in speeches   about the importance of anchoring inflation expectations  Now, how we communicate that is   actually one of the issues that we have to discuss  Having the public understand what monetary   policy is about is very important in terms of the education process, and yet we also need to make   sure that we are not getting into any details  So there’s a fine line here  It might be interesting to   hear from other participants about how we can achieve getting the public to understand what   monetary policy is really about, which a lot of the public doesn’t, and yet not actually create   expectations that we’re going to go one way or another in terms of communication  We certainly   don’t want to cut off this discussion, which has been ongoing between the Federal Reserve and the   December 12, 2006 117 of 134         public—actually quite successfully  It’s amazing when you look where the public was ten years ago   versus where they are now, and it’s because of the speeches, articles, and other written   communication that the System has been doing quite successfully   "
7883,2007-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I’m last in this line, and I’ll try to be   brief so that we can get to dinner soon  I do see signs of stabilization in the housing market, and   the way to think of it in terms of spillovers is that we do expect some spillovers through the   natural effect of weaker housing on aggregate demand and on wealth  But we’re not seeing   anything out of the ordinary or a persistent pattern, and that gives me more confidence that   nothing really bad is going to happen here  My view is that the risks to the downside have   decreased substantially  Also, the tone of the recent data actually indicates that what is   happening concerning aggregate demand is stronger than we would have expected  As a result,   I’m a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook in terms of what is going to happen next year with   aggregate demand  Actually, I see, if anything, a little more risk to the upside, so I slant a bit in   that direction    The inflation numbers have been very good recently, and one view is that they are just   temporary blips in the data  I tend to be a little more sanguine here because I think that there are   good reasons for inflation to gravitate toward what are solidly anchored inflation expectations    That has been very important in terms of the cycle and is one reason that I’m a little more   optimistic than the Greenbook on inflation  I do think that inflation expectations are strongly   grounded around 2 percent on the PCE deflator  As a result, I expect us to go to 2 percent   inflation over the next year and then stay there but not go below there  I don’t actually like to   January 30-31, 2007 84 of 255    think of this in terms of “persistence”  It is one reason that I’m unwilling to think that things will   get better than that  But I do think that we will likely have a more benign path of inflation than   we might have thought earlier    Even if you think that there’s a more benign path to inflation, which I’m willing to   consider though we’re not sure about it, it is still true that aggregate demand has blipped up   recently  That is an indication that the neutral real interest rate has moved up, which is very   much reflected in the Greenbook assessment  That’s important because, even if you’re happy   about what’s happening with inflation, you have to be more worried about the fact that the   economy is going to be stronger  That does have some implications for the way we think about   policy going forward  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Let me also support Tim on this  I have a slightly different slant here,   which is that the inflation numbers have actually come in better  The concern here is that the   economy is coming in stronger and that it may necessitate tightening  But we don’t want to give the   impression that we think the inflation numbers are worse and that’s the big problem  It’s really a   perspective about going forward, and that’s an additional reason for not changing the language in   this case     I have a slightly different take on where the economy is in that I think the   inflation numbers we have seen recently are likely to be reflecting something that’s actually   happening  So I’m a little more sanguine on the inflation front than I was before and than the   Greenbook is  I don’t see inflation risks on the upside, which is the way many people describe the   situation, partially because I think we’re going to do our job properly; but I am a little concerned   about giving that impression outside  However, I worry about the upside risk for output  In that   context, the implication is that we should think about some upward bias to the future path of the   federal funds rate  Clearly, a change in the federal funds rate is not needed today  That’s no   surprise, and I think we’re all agreed on that  However, we have a situation in which the real   interest rate that will be appropriate in terms of keeping inflation from rising has certainly gone up    In that sense, we are more likely to raise rates in the future as a result of what’s happened recently   In terms of the language, I am a bit mixed about section 2  I lean toward a little stronger   language and, therefore, was leaning a little toward using alternative C for section 2  But I worry a   bit about the word “rebounding,” so I’m not sure  Section 2 in alternative B is fine with me as   well—a little mix there  I feel strongly that we not move to section 3 in alternative C because it   gives the impression that the inflation risks have gone up, whereas the real side is more of a concern   to me  That concern relates as well to my view of section 4, for which I again strongly support   January 30-31, 2007 121 of 255    alternative B  The issue here is not so much that inflation risks right now are the problem but that   output may be stronger than we expect, which means that to keep inflation under control we will   have to raise rates in the future  Again, for that reason I strongly support alternative B for section 4    Thank you     May I help answer this?     The Norges Bank is actually the clearest on something close to a dual   objective  In their inflation report, they have several statements of their objectives, and they   explicitly say that they have a flexible inflation target regime  That’s the first statement  What that   means is that they actually are going to try to minimize both inflation fluctuations and output-  employment fluctuations  Most central banks don’t have anything as explicit as that when they do   January 30-31, 2007 140 of 255    talk in terms of hierarchical mandates in some cases, a country does talk about output fluctuations in   an inflation-targeting regime and is more explicit  I think the Riksbank is going to be moving in   that direction; it was part of our recommendations to them     Currently the Norges Bank is the clearest     First of all, I want to deal with the general question that Cathy alluded to at   the outset  I am strongly supportive of more-effective reporting of a forecast for several reasons    One is that it helps the market to understand our actions better, and I think that has a high value  It   can be part of the process of anchoring inflation expectations, which I think is a key to successful   monetary policy  Very important also is that it indicates a degree of openness and allows public   discourse about our views; that has political benefits in terms of showing that we’re accountable to   the political system  So I answered this question very much in the affirmative   One issue is what the research has said about this  President Fisher is absolutely right    These issues are subjective  The research staff said that there is no strong evidence, and the reason   is that it’s almost impossible to get and, in terms of econometrics, it’s very difficult  The literature   in the area of transparency is, in fact, somewhat unsatisfying because it’s very hard to quantify   anything  In terms of research strategy, it frequently draws people to do case studies, and I am one   January 30-31, 2007 162 of 255    of the criminals involved in that activity  The Chairman has also been involved in doing some work   on case studies that we did together  Part of the reason is that you can look at the details and deal   with this  If you get involved in evaluating monetary policy, which I did for Sweden recently, you   get to talk to wide elements of the society  In the Swedish case, there was tremendous support for   this degree of openness, and it was felt to be politically very valuable by some surprising groups    The labor unions were extremely supportive, for example, of this kind of openness and, believe it or   not, of inflation targeting—which was somewhat of a surprise   So let me turn now to the issues that we have to discuss  I want to provide an analytic   framework in which to think about this, at least for myself  I think about seven basic principles that   are key in terms of how we might go about providing more information about forecasts  So here are   the seven principles, and I’ll discuss them each in turn  First, we need to allow for the diversity of   views  Second, this process needs to be efficient  Third, it needs to be timely  Fourth, it needs to   be relatively frequent  Fifth, it needs to explain the forecast—that is, we need to tell a story, a good   narrative, about it  Sixth, it needs to emphasize uncertainty  Seventh, we need to stress that the   forecast period is longer than the policy period  Let me go into each of these one at a time, and then   you’ll see that it leads to particular answers to the questions, at least from my perspective   The first principle is the need to allow for the diversity of views  I strongly believe,   particularly now that I’m involved in this process, that the diversity of views is the strength of our   monetary policy process  In fact, I take the view that people have very different jobs here  I’ve   been on both sides of the fence—maybe, Janet, you have been more so because you are a president    I was just an executive vice president of a Bank  But Bank presidents bring different information to   bear than the governors, and this difference helps us make better decisions  So I believe in this kind   of diversity  Another very positive aspect of diversity is that we have a set of staffs  We have the   January 30-31, 2007 163 of 255    Board’s staff, and then we have twelve other staffs that actually act as a check and balance on each   other  Again, that has value  Finally, I believe that committees can make better decisions than   individuals  Alan Blinder has a study on this topic that I thought was really quite interesting   The second issue is efficiency  Any forecast process has to be workable in finite time, and   that’s really critical  I sometimes get nervous when Dave starts twitching at me, but you don’t want   the forecast process to overwhelm the staffs  I’m very sympathetic  Having been in research at a   Federal Reserve Bank, I have been on the other side of the fence, and so I really understand their   pain   As for timeliness, there are important advantages to getting out the forecast quickly  When I   said “forecast,” I didn’t mean just the forecast; I include the narrative, too, because you’ll see that I   think the narrative is important  The key reason for timeliness is to give the forecast and the   narrative more impact  The quicker you come out with them, the more impact they have  In   particular, the environment for getting this information out is much more controlled than that for   speeches or even testimony, and I think that’s the value  So quicker is much better  Timeliness also   makes the forecast and the narrative less likely to be stale  The longer the interval between the   policy meeting in which you make a decision and the release of the forecast and the narrative, the   more likely they are to be obsolete  One danger is that data could come in and make the forecast   look silly  So there’s an issue about our looking good  The faster we come out with a forecast, the   better off we are   The fourth issue is frequency  The key here is that the forecast and the release need to be   done often enough so that markets get the information they think they need to understand what’s   going on  Fifth, a narrative is important so that markets, the Congress, and the public not only see   our forecasts but also understand them  To be understood, the forecasts need a story behind them  I   January 30-31, 2007 164 of 255    strongly believe that we need to write up a good story and that a good narrative can help us obtain   public support for our policy actions—which is, again, a critical factor     Sixth, it’s really important to make sure the public and the markets understand the high   degree of uncertainty that we face  Forecasts are tough—not just long-term forecasts but also short-  term forecasts  David is, of course, nodding his head on this  The key reason that emphasizing   uncertainty is important is that it can lessen public criticism when we miss—which we surely are   going to do at times  We’ve actually been very good relative to others, but we’re going to make   mistakes  At least, if people understand the degree of uncertainty, that will help  When you make   clear the uncertainty, you make it easier for people to understand why there’s a diversity of views in   this Committee  It’s not because the participants don’t like each other, and it’s not because we   frequently fundamentally disagree  It is because we have different uncertainty in views of the   economy, and that’s actually exactly what is indicated by the fact that forecasts are very uncertain    Also, information uncertainty is important information for the markets  We want to help the   markets figure out what we’re doing and what’s going on, and we don’t care just about the first   moment but also the second moment and even sometimes the third moment    Finally, the issue of the horizon—I think we need a long horizon  When you look at the   literature on optimal policymaking, what comes out very clearly is that the horizon that you have to   think about in terms of the paths of the variables we care about is further out than the policy   horizon, which I would say would be about two years  Any sensible way of thinking about how we   think about policy will typically involve periods that are longer than the two years it takes to affect   output or inflation  We need to express the recognition of that because doing so will clarify that,   when we have paths in our forecasts, we can then talk about how they are consistent with our   ultimate objectives  To give you an example  If inflation is substantially above our comfort zone,   January 30-31, 2007 165 of 255    getting inflation down in a two-year period may be too costly  As a result, we may have to talk   about a longer period to assure the public, the Congress, and the markets that, in fact, we’re doing   something sensible  So we need to go to a longer period than we have now  We see this clearly in   the Bluebook’s optimal paths  I have some issues about their taking as long as they do to get to the   inflation objective—ten years—and about how we build expectations, but they do indicate that a   period longer than two years is absolutely necessary for thinking about policy   Let me now use these principles to talk about the eight questions that were posed to us by   the subcommittee  First, should the forecast be a joint forecast?  I answer very strongly “no”  The   process for doing that would be way too cumbersome and inefficient  No matter how charming or   colorful it would be, it would be a nightmare     It’s hard enough for the Bank of England to do it with a committee of nine   people  We have nineteen  Furthermore, at the Bank of England they’re all living in the same   house and talking to each other all the time  We have people all over the country with very different   jobs, and so it’s just infeasible to do it  I think Dave would quit  [Laughter]  It would eat up a huge   amount of staff resources, and we might have some of our research directors quitting or going to the   research staffs at the Reserve Banks  It would be very hard to get a timely agreement on it—and,   again, I think timeliness is important  It would also be hard to get the diversity of views clearly   expressed  So I end up where Janet ends up—I think that we need to keep something like the   current procedure in which all nineteen participants give their views  It is very important that there   be no attributions and that we amalgamate the views in some way  The procedure we have now   may not be perfect—maybe there’s something better—but it should be something similar   January 30-31, 2007 166 of 255    Question 2  Should we have common conditioning factors?  Here, again, I believe that the   diversity of views is a good thing, and so again I agree with Janet that each participant has his or her   own conditioning factors  The most important conditioning factor is clearly the path of the federal   funds rate, but I have mixed feelings about it  We may want to provide some information about   what individual participants think about this  The concern I have here is that the details really   matter  There is some danger if people seem to be making a commitment, because we know that   any path one specifies is surely not going to be the path that actually transpires because new data are   going to come in  I’ve been very concerned about this issue, and in fact I wrote a paper on it that is   cited in the R&S document  Sometimes transparency may go too far  In particular, I was not a fan   of the “moderate pace” language that the Federal Reserve used in the past—I was not here at the   time, but I think that language did not express the issue of conditionality enough  If the Committee   then had to change the path, which it surely might at some point, it could be accused of flip-  flopping, which would create severe problems for the Committee  However, maybe we can do it   appropriately through fan charts to derive the degree of uncertainty, but we really need to discuss   this possibility  The details matter  If we even think about going in this direction, the trial runs are   going to be critical, so I want to have a bit more of an open mind on that   On question 3, obviously for reasons that I outlined earlier, I strongly support a narrative to   accompany the forecast  On question 4, I feel that the narrative and the forecast need to be very   timely  If we could do this, it would be a great advantage to do it very quickly, possibly even at the   beginning of the week after the FOMC meeting  That would require a much more expedited   process  We’d have to use some delegation—to the Chairman or the staff—for writing up this   process  That would require moving up the Greenbook a bit  For us to produce our forecasts and a   narrative, we need to see the Greenbook—I certainly needed to see the Greenbook to come up with   January 30-31, 2007 167 of 255    my forecast—but then people could provide information very much along the lines that Vice   Chairman Geithner provided  Some might do it verbally  Some might do it the way you did it,   which was very nice  That could then go to the staff a little earlier than now—let’s say, by   Wednesday  Then a narrative could be written up that would go to people before the FOMC   meeting and then could be discussed at the FOMC meeting  I don’t know how this would work  It   would require that we not go through as much of an iterative process as we sometimes do—that is   critical for the timeliness issue  One thing that we might think about is that we have the “Recent   Developments” part of the Greenbook, and releasing that might have some value  That would be   from the staff; it would not be from the Committee  It gives some flesh to the discussion that would   be in the summary, so we might think about doing something with that as well   As to question 5, on frequency, I don’t think that twice a year is enough to give markets the   information they need  As for eight times a year, again, I worry about losing our top people from   the staffs; they might come after us with pitchforks  I tend to lean to four, but there is the interesting   issue about the timing of our meetings, so we’d have to work that out  So quarterly seems about   right to me  On question 6, because I believe the forecast period needs to be longer than the policy   period, for the reasons I discussed earlier, it clearly has to be longer than two years  However, too   long a period might put too much of a burden on us  A period of three years, which is common in   central banks, would give the flavor of the direction of the path that we’re thinking about and would   be adequate   On question 7, to keep things from being too burdensome, I want to use the KISS   principle—the fewer variables the better  At a minimum, the three variables that I think are the   right ones are the ones that I think are obvious—an inflation measure, an output measure, and an   employment measure  I think we should kill nominal GDP; it’s a vestige of the past  There is an   January 30-31, 2007 168 of 255    issue about the federal funds rate, but, again, that should be discussed  It hasn’t been mentioned yet,   but I would be uncomfortable providing projections of potential GDP  I think we do need it for our   own purposes, but it raises really huge political economy problems because people can think of it as   a speed limit or a target for growth, which could be dangerous  So although I welcome it in the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s document that we received, I do not think it would be   particularly wise to release it   On question 8, for the reasons I outlined earlier, I think it’s extremely important for us to   provide information about uncertainty  Fan charts are the right way to do this  I really like what I   see here, but there might be technical details that we’d have to decide on  Should we give only one   70 percent confidence interval?  Should we give more shadings?  There’s an issue about how this   chart would be produced  The reality is that it would have to be produced in the same way that the   narrative is, in the following sense  It would have to be delegated  The information from the   nineteen participants would help in producing it in terms of their views  The staff would have to   come up with some measures  Then there would be some iteration along the same lines as the   narrative in order to produce it  But it then would have to be timely; it would have to be released   with both the narrative and the forecasts themselves  So with that, let me stop  I don’t think I’ve   been quite as charming here  Thank you     This is why we need trial runs  The narrative needs to be a little more   detailed than that and actually a little more reflective of the different views  I think it’s a question of   writing a good story  One thing I have learned is that, even as a scholar, I learn particularly from   writing  In this case I think the Committee will learn from doing these trial runs  Then we might   say, gee, this is too short; it doesn’t give the flavor, or it is too long and too involved, or it’s too   difficult to come to a decision about it  So my answer here is let’s do it and discuss it, and then   we’ll have a much better feel for it  "
7908,2007-03-20,"  We want to be the good guys     Thank you, Mr Chairman  One way I think about the situation is to   compare what’s happening now, not to the last meeting, but to two meetings before  From   December to January we had positive news  Now we have gone from January to March, and we’ve   had negative news  When you look at the overall picture, we’re not in a very different place from   where we were in December, although I do think that there’s actually more uncertainty around the   forecast  So let me go into a little more detail on this  I’m much less worried about the housing   market as a serious downside risk  First of all, I do see signs of stabilization of demand, and I really   agree very much with what Randy just discussed  First of all, this market is a fairly small part of the   overall mortgage market  Also, there are ways for people to work out their situations  So the   subprime market has really been overplayed in the media, and I do not see it as that big a downside   March 20-21, 2007 69 of 196    risk  I am comfortable with the fact that we have lowered our forecast on housing a bit, but the   numbers that just came in recently were actually ones that indicate some stabilization there—in   terms of housing demand, in particular     When I worry about the risk to the forecast, I’m really much more worried about capital   expenditure in terms of investment  The problem here is that the fundamentals look fairly strong   and yet we haven’t seen strong business fixed investment  I ask myself, “Well, what’s going on?”    One possibility is that, in fact, there will be a bounceback—that these strong fundamentals in terms   of balance sheets and so forth will produce actually stronger investment in the future, and I think   that is a significant possibility  However, I’m really a bit more worried that the weak capital   expenditures may indicate that something deeper is wrong in terms of the fundamentals  In   particular, I’m a bit worried about the issue of what could be happening to productivity in the future    We’ve seen some weaker numbers in terms of productivity, and we think that is just sort of cyclical   and not a change in structural productivity  But maybe the business sector is seeing something that   we’re not seeing, and in that context, businesses may not be investing as much because they don’t   see that productivity will be that strong in the future  They don’t see the returns in the future, and so   they’re not investing as much  That’s actually bad news in several dimensions  One dimension   would be that it would actually indicate a serious downside risk in terms of aggregate demand  Also   if productivity is lower, that’s not a good thing for inflation  So the situation here is one about   which I’m not super worried; but the environment is more complicated, and it makes our jobs more   interesting  [Laughter]  There is, of course, the Chinese curse that you should live through   interesting times, but we’ll have more-interesting FOMC meetings   On the inflation front, I am comfortable with the view that the Greenbook and others have   expressed that we should expect some moderate decrease in inflation  In fact, the latest data don’t   March 20-21, 2007 70 of 196    really get me that nervous on this  However, we must recognize that, when we have more-anchored   inflation expectations, it’s actually harder to forecast the little blips in inflation because what’s really   going on is what’s left—it is no longer the trend but just the transitory movements, and those are   particularly hard to forecast  So there is a bad side to the overall better news, but I think the key is   that inflation expectations seem to be very solidly grounded  It’s hard to know exactly what the   numbers are, but they seem to be around 2 percent  So it’s realistic to think that, in fact, inflation is   going to move toward the 2 percent level, although there may be some blips up and down    However, it is also important to recognize that I don’t see any reason for its dropping much below   that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Good answer  I think it’s tentative—the judgment is tentative     Thank you, Mr Chairman  To get perspective on this, again, I go back to   where I think we were in December  We’re really not that much different in our forecast from   December, except that we have a little more uncertainty  That means that for the assessment of risk   I lean toward keeping the same language from the last meeting and from the December meeting,   particularly because of the issue that President Hoenig mentioned—that we need to indicate that we   are still very vigilant on inflation and that we’re worried about it  A further issue is that I think the   change will be seen as removing some of the bias, which will have a big impact on the markets    That’s where I was before the meeting  However, Vince has been very convincing  Maybe it’s his   wonderful vests  [Laughter]  You might notice, Vince, that I tried to liven it up by wearing a   double-breasted suit  So we have a little action going on here, different from the usual  [Laughter]   March 20-21, 2007 101 of 196    It’s really the ghost of 2000 that worries me  The argument that we could be in a situation in   which we get a shock and need to have the flexibility to deal with it is actually very important  In   that case, I have concerns along the lines of President Hoenig’s, but I’m willing to live with the new   language in alternative B for the reason that you mentioned  Because I think “predominant” has a   little stronger connotation—not because of the dictionary but because it was used in the testimony—  I would stay with “predominant”  It is just sort of an offset, and I would keep it on that level  In   terms of the big debate about what we do regarding the rationale, I think it is a tough call  I do not   like mentioning financial markets, as Governor Warsh said  Then crafting the language is very   difficult  So I guess I end up with the KISS principle, which is “keep it simple, stupid,” and I would   put a full stop after “quarters”  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Could you repeat the sentence?     Two hands     I’m a little worried about that because there’s been such a big deal made   about the housing market and the media have been making a big deal that it’s going to collapse  We   March 20-21, 2007 107 of 196    mention in the first sentence that it has gotten weaker, and if there’s no counter to that, which is part   of the view that we think there’s some stabilization of demand, I would worry  So, I worry a little   that by saying “nonhousing” we don’t have enough of a counter to the first sentence  When I first   read this, one reaction I had was to follow the KISS principle; but that worried me a bit because we   changed from the previous statement in which we said we had a problem in housing  Then it was   all right because then we came back and said, “Yes, but we think it’s going to work out okay in the   end”  So there’s a little tension here that worries me about saying “nonhousing,” which may spook   the markets a bit     First of all, I really want to congratulate the staff on the documents they   produced  When I was thinking about how they might be written, I would have had a hard time   figuring out how to make sense out of all of this  It was really extremely well done, and so you   really deserve congratulations on this  One thing I find, by the way, in talking to staff members   is their incredible professionalism  When you ask them to do something that’s really hard to do   but important, they love doing it  That professionalism showed in this case   Let me go down the list of questions  Obviously, I don’t think my answer to number 1   will be a huge surprise  [Laughter]  Some interesting discussion would be created if it were   different, but clearly I believe that having a numerical price objective is important  The reasons   are the ones I’ve discussed before  Very briefly, I think it clarifies communication with the   March 20-21, 2007 121 of 196    public, the markets, and the politicians  It increases transparency and accountability, which I   think is a key issue for central banks  Also, a numerical objective would actually improve the   clarity, and has improved the clarity, of discussions about monetary policy inside central banks    I think it would help in this context in the FOMC as well  The reason I think it would is that it   would lead more naturally to discussions about policy in terms of appropriate inflation paths    That is the way that modern monetary policy analysis indicates is appropriate for us to think   about how we do our policy  It actually is an element now of the way we discuss policy, but I   think a numerical price objective would make the discussion even clearer  If we were having   such discussions inside, at some point the numerical objective would have to go outside  There’s   an issue about transparency here  If we’re going to clarify how we make policy inside and we’re   not telling the public how we’re doing it, at some point it will leak out  Then we look foolish or   as though we have not been transparent, which I think is also a problem   So there always are issues  The devil is in the details, and that’s really what the questions   are dealing with  I like to think about the principles by which I deal with the rest of the   questions  A numerical inflation objective has to have three important features  First, the   objective needs to be absolutely and clearly consistent with the dual mandate  That’s also very   important politically, but I strongly believe in the dual mandate, and so we have to make sure   that that’s the case  Financial stability concerns, though you might consider them somewhat   separate, are part of the dual mandate and, as such, are clearly key to how we do this  Second,   the objective has to be easy to communicate clearly to the public, which is something that   President Fisher pointed out  Third, the objective needs to be evolutionary because we want to   build on our successes and because it would be politically more palatable  All three of these   features, by the way, are actually very important in terms of the political process, in terms of   March 20-21, 2007 122 of 196    talking to the public about how we are conducting policy, and in terms of helping them have   confidence in it   Regarding the questions, I want to start with question 4, because I think that question—  the issue of the appropriate time horizon—is critical to thinking about all the other questions    The first part of the question is to ask what kind of things might affect the time horizon  The   reality is that the time horizon can have a lot of variability  The science of monetary policy, or   the economics that we have learned over the years in terms of the best way to do monetary   policy, says that, in fact, your horizon is going to change depending on how far away from your   ultimate goal you are currently, what kind of shocks you’ve had, whether the shocks are   temporary or permanent, how big the output gaps that you project are, and then, clearly, what the   financial stability issues are  If you get shocks to the financial markets, you have to worry about   them  So my thinking is that the minimum time horizon is going to be two years because that’s   effectively the policy period  But the horizon could be substantially longer than that, and I think   this is extremely important in the design because it has a big impact on the issue of the dual   mandate  I think it’s absolutely critical that we make it clear that the horizon would sometimes   have to be quite long  In fact, from a political viewpoint doing so is extremely important   because by indicating that the horizon could be sometimes quite long we are actually indicating   that we care about output fluctuations, which is a key element of the dual mandate  Politically it   is also important because it makes it clear that we would be unwilling to beat the economy over   the head with a baseball bat in order to get inflation down quickly  Again, that indicates that we   do care about output fluctuations  So I lean toward not being too precise about the horizon but,   instead, indicating that the objectives to be achieved in the long run are sort of on average over   March 20-21, 2007 123 of 196    the business cycle  The Chairman used language like this in a speech in St Louis in 2003, and I   was very comfortable with that language   Let me deal with the other issues, some of which I don’t have strong views on, but I can   give you the different sides  On the issue of the price index, I really don’t have strong views    It’s really six of one and half a dozen of the other  I lean slightly toward the CPI because it is   more readily understood by the public  It’s what is reported every month  It might even have an   advantage in that it is never revised  The R&S document actually changed my view on this   because I think you are quite right that from a policy viewpoint it doesn’t really matter  But   there is the issue that when a revision occurs and is, for example, upward, it may look as though   you didn’t do a good job when in fact, with the information you had, you did the best job   possible  So the lack of revision has a bit of political advantage, although not an advantage from   the view of actually doing policy  I think you’re quite right in that regard  What is the   advantage of the PCE index?  It has the advantage of continuity, so it fits the evolutionary   element that I talked about  It also has slight advantages on a technical basis; however, they’re   not as big as they used to be  When the Fed went to the PCE instead of the CPI in talking about   the inflation numbers at which it was looking, doing so then was more necessary than it would be   now  The bottom line here is that I’m willing to go with whatever other people are willing to go   with on this, but I have a slight preference for the CPI    What about headline versus core?  I have problems with a core measure from the   following viewpoint  There is really no one right measure of the core, and theory can change in   telling us what it should be  Also, regarding the issue of whether the core has the more   permanent trend elements, let me give a case as an example in which that might be shifting    Usually we think of food prices as very temporary because they have to do with drought,   March 20-21, 2007 124 of 196    anchovies leaving the coast of Brazil, or something like that  But think about the case of ethanol   right now  There’s a push for ethanol production  I have to tell you, I think that is a very bad   piece of public policy  However, it could have permanent effects  I’m sorry, Tom, it’s going to   help your District      I don’t think it’s a good idea  It may have much more permanent   consequences for food prices  Then, should you necessarily exclude food from the core when, in   fact, it’s more of a permanent shock?  In that case, I think there are issues  Another critical issue   relates to the horizon  If you think that the horizon should be long or not precisely defined, then   the difference between core and headline becomes much less important because, in the long run,   the number that you should shoot for in the core will be the same as shooting for that number in   the headline  In this context, it makes sense to use a headline measure, not a core measure    However, for policy discussions we will need to continue to refer to the core, particularly in   regard to shocks such as the recent episode with energy  In fact, other central banks have   successfully done so  I think the International Finance document talks a lot about Canada and   how they’ve done it exactly this way   On question 3, point goal or range, again the time horizon is critical  If you have a fixed   period for evaluation, there is no question to me that a range makes a lot of sense  It nicely   shows that you care about uncertainty  I recently wrote an academic paper that shows that a   range has very nice properties in terms of the appropriate objective function that you get and the   behavior of a central bank, because it’s clear that you’d be shooting for the midpoint and then   there’s some uncertainty around it  The problem is that, if you take my view that the horizon   should be potentially long or not fixed, then talking about a range creates confusion  A range   March 20-21, 2007 125 of 196    then looks like a zone of indifference  So if we took a number such as 1 to 2 as our comfort zone   or range, would 19 be okay relative to 15?  As the purpose of talking about a numerical   inflation objective is clarity, I think that a range would be a mistake  It also could mean that   inflation expectations would be less grounded  When inflation goes up to 19 versus 15, people   might move up their inflation expectations up  Again, we would be losing one of the key   benefits of having a numerical inflation objective  One thing that was not in the IF document—  and they shouldn’t have put it in because it’s a private communication, but I can—is the issue of   Australia  Australia is one of the countries that have a “comfort zone” range  They call it a thick   point, and they talk about a number over the cycle  It hasn’t been a disaster, so it is not a huge   deal  But officials there said, “You know, if we had started this process a little differently”—  they had to convince their governor, who was not particularly enthusiastic initially about   inflation targeting and so used a thick point—“it would have been better if we had just picked a   number”  So I think they have some discomfort  My research is not scientific—it comes from   sitting and having a beer with them in the pub—but I think their experience argues for a point   target   What about the issue of level?  Again, this is very important  I have to point out that my   perspective reflects my views on the way the economy works and the way expectations work  I   strongly believe that just announcing an objective will not substantially change inflation   expectations  The Chairman and I participated in writing a book on this topic  We looked at the   adoption of inflation targeting by many countries, and the evidence was that it did not change   inflation expectations immediately  In fact, expectations were anchored over time through   actions and through having inflation targeting, which was a huge benefit  Again, the memo by   Reifschneider and Tetlow on optimal-control exercises was really terrific—a beautiful memo  I   March 20-21, 2007 126 of 196    thought it was just really first rate  When I looked at it, I was very comfortable with the   characterization of learning from policy actions  I do not accept the standard view in past   Bluebooks that it takes ten years to get down there, which is based on what happened to inflation   in the past and then gets incorporated into expectations  I think expectations can move faster   than that, but the way you do it is by actions as well as by words  You have to bring out the   baseball bat a bit, which indicates that there is some substantial cost to doing so  You saw that in   the simulations   My view is that there are substantial costs to moving inflation expectations down from   the current level of around 2 percent  Also, from reading the memo and from reading the   literature, I don’t see a big difference in terms of economic efficiency between a 2 percent   steady-state inflation rate and a 1½ percent steady-state inflation rate  So I really do disagree   strongly with you, President Lacker, on this issue  I think transition costs matter  They should   be part of our calculations  When I include the transition costs and my view that there’s not a   huge difference from a welfare standpoint in terms of 1½ versus 2 percent, I’m comfortable with   2 percent     Let me state one other advantage and then go to what worries me  There is an important   political issue here  To me, what’s really important is to anchor inflation expectations, and I’ll   do anything to get there  The actual number is less important so long as it is a reasonable   number, consistent with the Greenspan definition of price stability—that is, it’s sort of like   pornography; you know it when you see it  A number of 2 is certainly consistent with that  But   choosing a level at the upper end of what people have talked about in the comfort zone will help   allay politicians’ fears that we’re inflation nutters  It will also help alleviate the fear that we are   insufficiently concerned about the second element of the dual mandate and will suggest that we   March 20-21, 2007 127 of 196    do care about output fluctuations  I worry a bit that, if we had an objective of 1½ percent, we   could get into the following bind  To be serious about getting there, which would be critical   because otherwise we’d lose our credibility, we would need to raise the federal funds rate from   current levels, as the simulation indicated, to convince people of our seriousness and that would   help bring inflation expectations down  I worry that doing so would make the political   environment very hostile, and we could lose support for a numerical inflation objective—that   would be very costly—and could weaken the support for our independence  That’s the reason I   tend to be driven to the 2 percent number   Let me tell you about the one downside that I think is serious and that we have to think   about  There is a downside to a 2 percent PCE objective (or a CPI equivalent, appropriately   adjusted)  The downside is that we may get the opposite of the automatic stabilizer that was   talked about in the R&S document in the context of price-level targeting  I’m going to use an   allusion that Dave Stockton mentioned, which I thought was great  It just shows that Dave is   watching too many cartoons  Choosing the 2 percent number has something of the flavor of   shooting an arrow and then painting the bulls-eye around the arrow; it seems to have an element   of opportunism to it  Here’s the problem with that kind of opportunism  It can create very bad   expectations dynamics, just the opposite of the benefits of the price-level targeting  Say in the   future you chose a number  If people think that you might change it again when you overshoot   the objective, then inflation expectations would rise because they think you’re going to raise the   objective  That would then cause inflation to rise more than it otherwise would, and you would   get more output fluctuations  So it has sort of the opposite of the benefits that were discussed    The result is that you could actually do much worse in terms of achieving the dual mandate  You   could do worse both on inflation and on output fluctuations, which is something that we don’t   March 20-21, 2007 128 of 196    want to do  I’m not sure how big a problem this is if we communicate carefully the permanence   of the number  Here I agree strongly with President Lacker that it’s very important not to change   the number unless there are very strong scientific reasons to do so  The IF memo helped me   here, too, in pointing out that many countries chose a number based on where they were  They   actually shot the arrow and then painted the target around it, and it did not create a huge problem   in terms of commitment  Norway is an example that comes to mind, and I know a similar issue   came up for Sweden as well   Let me quickly finish with questions 5, 6, and 7  I’ve thought about this a lot more, and   now I want to take back something I said at the first meeting in which I participated  Was it   October?  This goes to show that I don’t think consistency is always necessary; it has benefits,   but sometimes you do need to change your mind  I think it would be a very bad idea to take a   survey of the participants on the objective or publish the participants’ views in the minutes  My   view has to do with the opportunism issue—doing so would make it much more likely that the   inflation objective could change from year to year  That really does worry me because it would   make a commitment to the inflation objective harder, and we would get the bad expectation   dynamics, which could be problematic  So as I said, I think that we need to come to a consensus   and make it clear that the objective will change only if there is a good scientific reason for doing   so—that is, a change in our view, say, on measurement error, or something along those lines   I really don’t have much to say about the issue of a trial run  A trial run for producing a   forecast narrative is a very good idea  I want to mention that having a forecast narrative might   change the timing in terms of the minutes not just twice a year because I would advocate that we   do this four times a year  Very likely it could be part of a monetary policy report, which is   something that I would advocate  That report would have to be issued, and then the Congress   March 20-21, 2007 129 of 196    might want to set up testimony about it, and the likelihood is that they would want it to be before   the minutes to get maximum attention for the hearings  We saw this occurrence in Sweden, for   example, and I would suspect that it would be true here  In that context, I think that we would   more likely have to do the discussion of the forecast among us a little quicker than the minutes,   and we should just be aware of that  Thank you very much     No, definitely not  Again, you have to take into account the welfare   considerations of the steady state, which are extremely important  My view is that any number   between 1½ and 2½ is reasonable  I tend to be a little more reluctant about 1 because I do worry   more about the lower-bound problem  I also worry a bit about the issue of potential deflationary   effects on balance sheets, so my number tends to be a little higher than your number in the steady   state  Numbers above 3 are not sustainable, and they would have very negative welfare   consequences  I’m willing to choose 2 because, when I assess the literature and ask whether   there is a difference in terms of the steady state and in terms of the welfare benefits from   2 percent versus 1½, I just can’t find it  Then the transition costs become an issue, as do the   political considerations  That is why we come to somewhat different views  At 4 percent, I   March 20-21, 2007 130 of 196    would be advocating our bringing out the baseball bat; I would agree that we would have to raise   rates a lot to convince the markets  In fact, this is what Volcker had to do, and he was a great   Federal Reserve Chairman  Luckily, we’re not in that situation right now     I’m indifferent between 1½ and 2  However, that doesn’t mean that I   have a zone of indifference about choosing a number  I think you have to pick a number  The   experts in monetary economics might have a preference  But if after reading the literature you   asked them whether they thought there was much difference between 1½ and 2, I would be   extremely shocked if they said “yes”     I agree with you on this  You want to talk about the implications of the   one for the other     Thank you  [Laughter]     Yes  Actually it’s an issue concerning some information that perhaps   Karen can provide for us  The ECB has used “less than 2 percent but close,” and in a way I find   that very attractive  But I do worry  I know the academics have been quite critical of that   articulation of a target as being a little waffley  I don’t know if that’s really accurate or not  Karen,   do you have any feel for what the reaction has been?  Maybe people in general have been a bit   concerned about the ECB’s communication strategy  It may have to do more with the second-pillar   issue  But has there been any problem in this regard?     An issue that arose for the ECB, too, in this regard is that they had a whole   big review—similar to the one we’re doing—and then they came up with something that was   considered Rube Goldberg-ish     It just is a concern that we want to learn from other people’s experiences,   and on this particular issue there has been some experience that has not always been favorable    Even though in one sense I actually liked that approach and thought about it, I was a little concerned   about exactly the issues that Karen has mentioned  Thank you     For the euro  "
7930,2007-05-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would characterize where we are compared   with the last meeting as that we have gone through a soft patch, which was more extensive than we   expected  But the basic longer-term outlook is really the same as the one that we had the last time   around  That is what is really relevant to our policy decisions because our policy decisions now do   not affect the economy until a year or two down the road     Looking at the issue of the risks, I was most worried at the last meeting about what was   happening in business fixed investment, particularly because I did not really understand what was   going on; and it is always the case that, when you have Knightian uncertainty, you get much more   nervous  The numbers have come in a bit better on those grounds, so I am a little less worried about   business fixed investment  But then we have had a downshift in housing, which again was   unexpected  So when I put those things together, I think that we are in a situation of a fair amount   of uncertainty  Maybe I am a little less worried about the uncertainty and the downside risk,   although I think they are still there, only because in the housing case, from the point of view of the   longer-run fundamentals, I do not see a big problem  It really is an inventory-correction issue,   which we are trying to sort out  That is creating uncertainty, but it creates more uncertainty in the   shorter term rather than in the longer term  Even though there is still uncertainty with the issue of   business fixed investment, it may be a little bit less  So perhaps there is a slight skew on the   downside in terms of my confidence intervals, but a little less than last time, if that gives me any   comfort   May 9, 2007 68 of 130    About the inflation issue, I am more optimistic than the Greenbook  I see inflation coming   down to 21 percent by the end of 2007 and then to 2 percent and staying there thereafter  My   reasoning here, I think, is familiar to you  I consider long-run inflation expectations to be a key   driver of the inflation process  I see those numbers as around 2 percent, and unless we make a   concerted effort to change inflation expectations, I think that is where they will stay  Also, I am   confident that we will do the right thing to make sure that inflation expectations do not go up from   there, and I think the markets have similar confidence in that regard   When I look at the risks in terms of inflation, of most concern to me is the issue of what has   happened to structural productivity  We have numbers coming in that we really cannot fully   explain  Maybe there is just something a bit wrong with Okun’s law, and productivity will revert   back to it, and then we’re okay  But maybe there is actually something more, that we have had such   tight labor markets when, in fact, the economy has been growing at quite a slow pace  There is a   real question about what this may mean  If structural productivity is actually downshifting more   than we expect, that does create a serious inflation risk that we have to be very concerned about  On   the other side is the issue about whether we really are in tight labor markets  You look at the   numbers in terms of compensation and so forth, and they don’t look too bad  This might tell us is   that the NAIRU may be somewhat lower—again, if we even know exactly what the NAIRU   concept means—which is the issue of Knightian uncertainty, not normal uncertainty  So in this   context, the basic forecast outline that we have is actually a fairly benign one  I am willing to bet   that it is probably the most reasonable forecast to have  I am pretty comfortable with it  But we will   have to wait to see what kind of data come in  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, I support alternative B  It seems   from a policy perspective that our outlook hasn’t really changed  We want to change as little as   possible in our statement  My SAT scores in English were much lower than my SAT scores in   math, so I’m not going to comment on the issue of the phrase “on balance”  [Laughter]  But let   me return to the issue that Vince originally raised and that has come out from several of the   participants’ perspectives  I think we will soon be facing a very difficult situation  If the   forecast comes in along the lines that we expect, which for us is a nice situation in which   inflation comes down to 2 percent in the core and looks as though it will stay there—that it’s not   just a temporary one-shot deal and that it will go back up again—we’re going to face a very   difficult issue in terms of the statement  Unless I have a sense of the consensus on this   Committee for what is our ultimate objective for inflation, I’m going to have a real problem  My   view of where the number should be is that I lean toward 2 percent because I do think the   transition costs are important, although I am concerned about the issue that President Lacker   mentioned  We cannot be opportunistic and just change the number because, as I mentioned   earlier, that creates actually a very bad expectations dynamic, which has the opposite effect of an   automatic stabilizer in terms of what happens to both inflation and output  If the Committee   decides that 1½ is a better number, I could definitely live with that  That would make it easier   for me to deal with the statement because, if we’re at 2 percent and have not built a consensus on   our ultimate objective for inflation, then I’m going to be opposed to saying that inflation is   elevated, and that would be an issue  If the Committee does build a consensus that we should be   at a lower number than 2 percent, then I would be comfortable with it  The reason I think this is   important is that we’ll be forced into a discussion about this   May 9, 2007 100 of 130    The problem that will then arise is that, if we have a consensus inside it will not be   transparent not to reveal that to the outside  So the issue is that, whether or not we want to, we   are going to be forced into a discussion about how we talk about our objectives on inflation, and   we have to think very hard about it  We may not be there now, but I actually hope we are   because I want inflation to come down  It’s going to be on the table, and it’s going to be   complicated because we’ve had trouble building a consensus in the Committee about this issue    But we need to be aware of the difficulties we will face  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I just want to mention—I don’t know if this is true of other people—  that I had two big problems when I was doing this dry run  So though it will come out in the   survey, I have a feeling that other people might have views on this  One problem was that I   really had difficulty thinking about the confidence interval because I didn’t feel that I had   enough background from the staff about how to think about it  It’s not your fault because we   didn’t ask you to do it  But here is my problem  I knew what the Greenbook errors were in   terms of the confidence interval  I knew what the FRB/US confidence intervals were, and then   there was an issue about how to think about them  I think there are things we can say about that    For example, in the context of the FRB/US, we don’t assume any model uncertainty  So the   issue is that you think some more uncertainty might exist for the FRB/US errors, but then, there   are problems with the Greenbook forecast errors, which display greater uncertainty than the   FRB/US errors  So if we had a memo to really think this through, it might provide a lot of   background for us to think about how we do this  We might need to do that before we go into   the next dry run, so we can have some discussion about that   The other problem in figuring out what to write down is the issue of appropriate policy,   which is central  Again, as relates to the issue that we just discussed, I use an appropriate policy   of a 2 percent inflation goal because I think that’s one that I’m comfortable with  It’s also   May 9, 2007 108 of 130    consistent with what I think revealed preference has been on this Committee in terms of the   policy actions we’ve taken  However, I would also be comfortable if the Committee built a   consensus of 1½ percent  Then I would have had a different view in my projections because I   would have felt that the policies in that case would be different  So there is a question mark   about how to think about that in the future because it is the gray area that makes this exercise   more difficult  We do need to think about it  That’s what I struggled with when I sat down and   asked, “How am I actually going to do this?”  "
7953,2007-06-27,"  Thank you  My view of what has been happening in the economy   is that we have been basically going through a rebalancing  We had a sector that was clearly   June 27-28, 2007 87 of 261    bubble-like with excessive spending, and now we are getting the retrenchment, which is   taking a bit longer than we expected  But the good news is that we are going through a   rebalancing in which we are just moving resources to other sectors and that is actually going   much along the lines that we want to see  The problem in a rebalancing episode is that you   are always worried about the risk that is possible because these transitions don’t always   occur smoothly  I think that we were much more worried about that—at least I was more   worried—at the previous meeting  But we have been seeing that the rebalancing is actually   going along pretty well  In particular, although the housing market is very weak, very much   along the lines of the Greenbook forecast, it hasn’t surprised us this particular period  It’s   just that it is pretty bad  But the risks are actually fairly balanced on housing because we do   not see it as very strong and that is part of the process of undoing the previous excesses    Another very important thing is that we have not seen any surprising spillovers from the   housing market  As time goes on and nothing really bad happens, we become more   confident that, in fact, the downside risk isn’t there either  We have also seen that the   investment sector has been looking a little stronger  Again, that really did concern me at the   last FOMC meeting  Yet we have had some reasonable numbers; they are not spectacular,   but I think the downside risks have dissipated   So the bottom line is that I see the economy as rebalancing and doing it in a fairly   good way  In fact, from a long-run perspective, this is a good thing and not a bad thing    The downside risk has dissipated, and the risks are now quite balanced  So I am quite   comfortable with the Greenbook forecast on this, which is that we have growth somewhat   below trend but moving back toward trend, and I see that there has been a shift in a positive   direction and the risks are not excessively on the downside but are much more balanced   June 27-28, 2007 88 of 261    When I look at the inflation picture, I am in a way pleased with the recent numbers   because there is no strong indication that we are far from potential output and, in particular,   there is a little indication that the tightness in the economy certainly will be unraveled    According to our forecast, not much is going on in that area, so what’s going on in inflation   expectations will be dominant  I mean, given that inflation expectations have been pretty   well anchored around 2 percent, although there is some uncertainty, I thought that we would   have a return to 2 percent numbers a bit more quickly than the original Greenbook forecast   showed  I was really pleased because the Greenbook has basically moved closer to the   picture that I had all along; so now I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook forecast   In contrast to some other people, I think the risks are pretty balanced  Now, maybe   that is not really different because of the people who have inflation going below 2 percent,   and I don’t see that  So I believe it’s going to be 2 now and it’s going to be 2 for a while   unless we make a concerted effort to change inflation expectations  Then there is the whole   issue of how we might go about doing that  But given the current environment, my view is   that risks are fairly balanced  Other people are saying that there is risk on the upside, but I   think that’s because they just have slightly lower numbers regarding where they think   inflation will be  But probably when we look at it from that perspective, it is about the   same  So right now I think the economy is evolving in a pretty reasonable way, and I’m   sure we will be surprised in one direction or another in the future  Thank you very much     Thank you  I support alternative B with the amendment that   Governor Kohn suggested, so I am very comfortable with that  The real issue for me here   is one that I think has been expressed by several others, what President Plosser called the   June 27-28, 2007 117 of 261    “elephant in the room,” which is that writing the statement is getting harder and harder  I   think that we have a brilliant fudge this time around, but it is not going to work forever   There are two senses in which I have a problem with this statement  One is the   issue of the appropriate level of inflation that we should be shooting for  This is really   two separate questions  One is what we do about communication outside, but there is   also an issue about consensus inside the Committee  I would find it much easier to agree   to statements of certain types if, in fact, there were a consensus  As many of you know, I   am actually comfortable with an inflation number of 2 percent  On the other hand, if the   Committee comes to consensus for a lower number, I would be more than happy to be   comfortable with that  In fact, I would be willing to have a statement that would reflect a   lower number  I sense that this is true for other members of the Committee—some who   might be caught on the dovish side with 2 percent while some members are on the   hawkish side at 1½  But the difference between the hawks and the doves here is   extremely slight  In fact, from more than five feet away, you couldn’t tell the difference   between a hawk and a dove  [Laughter]  That’s one issue that is very important  I think   it is going to become more and more difficult as we go forward, as long as inflation   evolves in the way that we expect  I mean, we could have bad news—inflation could   actually start rising—and we’d have a different kind of a problem  But let’s hope we   don’t get into that problem  We want dealing with the good news to be the problem   The second issue relates to core versus total  I am quite concerned about the   emphasis on core, not because I don’t think it is very important to communicate about   core, particularly when you get a big shift in something like energy prices and you don’t   want to unhinge inflation expectations  In that context, we need to talk about core so that   June 27-28, 2007 118 of 261    people understand that the currently high inflation rates, in terms of things they care   about—going to the gas station or going to the supermarket—are not actually something   that should change their long-run inflation expectations  That’s why the use of the core   measure makes a lot of sense  The problem is, as I read the research, that no one measure   of core will always be good  In fact, the core measure that we have evolved to has a lot   of history behind it, but it is not clear that it will be the best measure in all cases  There   are certain alternatives that I think will work in some cases—a trimmed mean may   sometimes be appropriate, but at other times it will not  So I think there will be a key   problem, as has been discussed today, which is that at times one core measure may make   more sense than another core measure  Our whole discussion is very much in terms of a   particular core measure that excludes food and energy  That measure will sometimes be   problematic for telling us about long-run trends, particularly if we think that energy   changes are more permanent or crazy policies about ethanol may be having a more   permanent effect in terms of food prices  In this context, we are going to have to deal   with exactly this issue going forward  Also, a problem is that people do consume a lot of   food and energy, and it is very peculiar to act as though we don’t care about that    So I think that we have to grapple with these issues  They are part of our   communication issues  The bottom line is that we are fooling ourselves if we think that   we are going to get away forever with not dealing with them  We will have to figure out   some way of doing this  I think that we can do it because, in my reading of what people   on the Committee have been saying, the differences here are actually fairly minor  It is   the outside world that wants to make them into a big deal because doing so sells   newspapers  But we do need to get to some consensus on these issues so that the outside   June 27-28, 2007 119 of 261    world sees that the Committee actually has unity rather than differences  Thank you very   much     It’s the word “appears,” which is fine     You do know that English professors get paid very little money    [Laughter]     Yes, I do have a question—just a clarification  One thing that we   talked about early on when you gave us information was that there is the information   regarding our views about whether risk was greater or less than usual and about the   skewness of the risk  You might also want to include in the documents that would go out   information to guide people on what is normal so that you would have the things that we   actually sent out, which was either a picture or the table showing the forecast errors  Is it   your view that part of it would be not only the charts that we actually responded to but also   the background information?   June 27-28, 2007 132 of 261      I’m just trying to remember—did the table have the uncertainty for   the variables?     The Greenbook and FRB/US     Right, but the key idea is that we do have a table with actually   some numbers as part of the document  Thank you very much     How about the Red Sox?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I share many of President Lacker’s   concerns, but I come to a different conclusion because I strongly support this proposal  It   is a major step, but it is incremental  But I’d like to go through some of the issues that   President Lacker discussed because I think that they relate to where we may be heading   in the future and how we may have to handle things now  The concerns that he raised are   very, very important ones   The first is that a third-year or a three-to-five-year projection does not reflect a   commitment  We know that there are some very strong benefits to having a commitment    A particular thing that’s important here is that being opportunistic in terms of changing   what our view is of where we will head in the future creates very bad expectations   dynamics  In fact, it creates an anti-stabilizing influence rather than a pro-stabilizing   influence because, when you overshoot, you might tend to have higher projections    Similarly, when you might undershoot, you might lower projections  This has become an   issue, by the way, in other countries  In countries that have inflation targets, when they   were undershooting for a long time, people actually pushed them to lower the inflation   goal  Doing that turns out to have very negative effects on the economy because, when   you get a negative shock to the economy, people lower their expected inflation  That   raises the real interest rates and means that you have a contractionary impulse  That’s   very problematic and a serious concern that we have to worry about  I’ll talk about how I   think we can deal with some of these issues   Second, I also very much worry about the issue of the projections  Although they   have the benefit of giving information about what people’s views of our inflation goals   June 27-28, 2007 194 of 261    are, they could be interpreted in relation to output and unemployment as also being speed   limits, goals, or whatever  In the end, that is a very dangerous thing to happen   The third thing that I think is an important concern is that, without a consensus of   this Committee, it is much harder to deliberate  It will be much harder to write our   statements  I have been struggling with this  I am willing to go along on this for a period   of time because we are still not there yet, and a question is whether we can get to a   consensus  So I am willing to hold off  But there will be a point at which some of us   may say, “Gee, I can’t sign on to that statement unless a consensus is built”  I think that   problem could become serious in the future   So how do we deal with these issues?  The reason that I’m comfortable with this   step at this point is that through speeches we can clarify some of these issues  So, for   example, if we go with this approach, I would give a speech and say that, although some   information is here about inflation objectives, we should not think about it as having   information about unemployment or output objectives because we have much uncertainty   about what potential GDP or the NAIRU is and, furthermore, we can’t control either  So   I think that we can clarify some issues in speeches  I’m sure that the Chairman will do it   The point that I think is relevant, and the reason I am discussing these issues, is   that people have to realize that, even though this step is exactly the right way to proceed,   it will still leave us with problems, and the reality is that we will have to deal with them    The advantage of proceeding this way is that it gives flexibility, particularly to the   Chairman for dealing with the political considerations   Eventually we will have to go to a numerical inflation goal  Not doing so will get   more and more untenable over time  A question is, What is the right time to do it?  What   June 27-28, 2007 195 of 261    is the right time in terms of the political environment?  What is the right time in terms of   where the economy is?  So people have to be aware that this is really a first step  To be   honest, I will not be satisfied with this as the end game  At the same time, the question   is, When would be the appropriate time to move forward from here?  We will have to use   our best judgment on this question, and the Chairman will have to use his judgment as   well  So I am very supportive of this proposal, but I want to make clear that I think that   we’re not settling the issues  I’m sure we will have to deal with them in the future, and I   think we will deal with them in the future  So those are the general issues   Let me go to some of the specifics  The issue about the horizon is really very   tricky  I am very comfortable right now with a three-year horizon because things are   working out pretty well  Thank goodness the economy has been coming out pretty much   in line with our forecasts—that we actually have inflation coming down and that it is very   close to what the goal of anybody on this Committee would be because we are all   between 1½ and 2 percent  Given a goal of 1½ or 2 percent and a three-year horizon, we   should get approximately there  So I do not think there’s a problem now with a three-  year horizon  However, I don’t see this as stable because, God forbid, there could be   cases when we get shocks and where we are substantially away from where we want to   be, and then a three-year horizon will not be adequate  President Yellen and Vice   Chairman Geithner made this point  The issue here is that doing three years now is fine,   but we will have to rethink this in the future  At some point, we may have to go to a   longer horizon, or the alternative will be that we will have objectives—so it is one or the   other  I think people know where I stand on that issue—I have a preference  Right now,   I’m actually very comfortable with three years because three years plus a long-run   June 27-28, 2007 196 of 261    inflation goal will provide the information that people need  If we don’t have a long-run   inflation goal, then at some point, if things don’t go right, we may need a five-year   horizon as well     I get concerned about providing a federal funds rate path  I am known as a person   who is very pro-transparency, but I wrote a paper called “Can Central Bank Transparency   Go Too Far?”  The problem here is exactly the one that Governor Warsh and others have   mentioned  Even though we know that, when you put out a path, it is completely   contingent on events and a lot of uncertainty is around it, making that clear to the public   is very hard, particularly to politicians who want to use things in their own way  It’s   amazing, when you testify in the Congress, you’ll say something, and then they will try to   use whatever you say in a way exactly opposite to what you said  Everybody knows it is   exactly opposite, but they will do it anyway  So you have to be very careful with what   you put out there  This has been a problem with other central banks  The Swedes   actually had problems when they first announced their path because they didn’t clarify   the uncertainty and some problems arose in the marketplace  We shouldn’t rule it out in   the future, but it is a tough thing to think about  For the time being, I would certainly not   advocate it, and I have serious concerns about it   On the issue of the CPI versus the PCE, a lot of details are here, and my view is to   let the subcommittee decide  I’ll go with whatever they want here  I do have a   preference for the CPI, but it is very slight—I don’t even think it’s a second order issue,   maybe third order; it’s not really critical  An advantage is that CPI is better known  Vice   Chairman Geithner mentioned it is actually involved in a lot of contracts  One reason   that the CPI is used is that it is not revised  That turns out to be the reason that I lean to   June 27-28, 2007 197 of 261    the CPI rather than the PCE  I think the PCE is a slightly better measure, but the CPI is   not revised, which will make our lives simpler because we know that we’re making   decisions ex-ante with the information we have now  However, when the PCE gets   revised, people can second-guess you  We’ve had this in the past, when our PCE was   getting very close to 1 percent  It turned out to be revised quite a bit upward, and then   people said, “Gee, why weren’t you tougher on inflation?”  So I think that using the CPI   has a political-economy advantage, even if there is a slight disadvantage from a technical   viewpoint     I share some people’s concerns about the histograms  But I love to see the   histograms  They were very useful to me  I like them because they provide information   and actually show that there is less diversity  What was remarkable about them—and I   don’t think that this will be a problem in the future—is how close we generally are  I   think that actually will help dissipate some of the issues in the press  But, again, I don’t   feel particularly strongly about this issue   A very important issue that comes up here is where we put the enhanced   projections into our documents and their relationship to how quickly we do the minutes    I lean toward having the projections as a separate document in some form, either as an   addendum or whatever, because I think it gives us a lot of flexibility  I am going to say   something that may get me an IED (improvised explosive device) in my office later on,   but we’ll talk about that in a second  [Laughter]  There is also an issue about the times of   the testimonies, which are happening two times a year  I suspect that we will end up with   testimonies four times a year, and in that context it may be difficult to have the full   minutes done within three weeks  We will definitely need to expedite the enhanced   June 27-28, 2007 198 of 261    projections  In fact, if we have the flexibility of having a separate document, we may be   able to do one and then do the other; that way we can basically relieve some of the   pressure on people  We’re going to end up having to speed up the process on that part of   the picture, so separating them to some extent has the advantage of giving us more   flexibility   So the last issue, for which I may get the IED in my office and which I think is   going to happen even if I didn’t propose it, is that I think there really is an advantage to   having these enhanced projections as part of a Monetary Policy Report that is issued four   times a year  My suspicion is that we will be in a situation when we do this that the   Congress will likely want testimony more often  I am sorry for the Chairman here, but I   would welcome the increased testimony because it gives us a bully pulpit from which to   provide more information to the markets and to tell them our point of view  I wouldn’t   have to do the testimony, but there is a little work because, as a Board, we have to go   over the testimony  I’m going on vacation, so we have to do a conference call about the   testimony  I will have to do that four times a year, so there is a little cost for me but more   for the Chairman  Having a Monetary Policy Report with these enhanced projections will   actually be a plus  Again, it gives us an opportunity to express our views, and I suspect   that it will actually end up improving the quality of the Monetary Policy Report  It could   be an important part of our communication process   Now, let me mention an issue so that I don’t get the IED but instead just a water   gun shot at me by the staff  We have a really serious problem right now in that our staff   at the Board is getting severely overwhelmed by work  That is of great concern to me   and, I think, to other members of the Board  The situation is such that, if we don’t fix it, I   June 27-28, 2007 199 of 261    think the staff will break  This means that we have to think about the products that the   staff produces for us  Do we absolutely need them?  Even if we like them a bit, if they’re   very costly to produce, do we need them?  This will be an issue going forward  The   process that we are talking about now will increase work for the staff  If we do a   Monetary Policy Report four times a year, it will be even worse  We may need to think   about what goes on in terms of FOMC documents  Can they be done in a more efficient   way?  Do we need certain information?  What is the most efficient way to run a research   operation?  The issue here also is that there has become a discrepancy in terms of the   workload for the Board staff versus the research staff at the Banks  I think that it is great   that the Banks actually have the research that is coming from them, which has greatly   improved over time  That is a major positive for the System  But the discrepancy in   terms of workload, which is killing our staff—if in fact their work is increasing relative to   that of the Banks—is not a healthy situation for the System in the long run  So one of the   things that I am proposing is more work in a sense, but the Committee will need to think   about the issues of how we can use our staff more efficiently to continue to provide us   with all the services we need, so that the quality of work does not decrease  If it’s done   right, it can improve the quality of work for us and can actually take some of the pressure   off the staff  So I’m doing this so that I don’t end being a victim of Jihadism, but I   actually strongly believe it  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     Well, considering the group  [Laughter]     In terms of this issue of forward-looking language, I’m quite   comfortable with the statement and with forward-looking language so long as it’s on the   right-hand side of the Taylor rule in terms of what’s going on with output and inflation  I’m   actually not a fan of forward-looking language in terms of the federal funds rate, and in fact,   I differ from some people on this  I really didn’t like it, even during the unusual period   when there was some concern about deflation—in that context, it did have elements that   people might have interpreted as a commitment  It turned out that nothing bad happened   because the economy evolved in a reasonable way, but I can think of scenarios during that   period, particularly in 2004 and so forth, when it might have been a real problem  So you do   have the statement at the end that we’re always contingent on events  I like that statement;   but what I don’t want to see is moving from that to what we did in that period, except in the   most unusual circumstances  At the beginning it was justifiable in terms of concerns about   June 27-28, 2007 213 of 261    deflation, but it actually had real potential problems that did not arise, but I think we got   lucky  So I’m very comfortable with where we are right now  I think the editing process is   going well in terms of the meeting—there is fine-tuning going on, but it’s done in a very   constructive way, and I think it’s working well   In terms of governance, I guess I lean toward the idea that we should vote on it, for   the following reason  When you think about doing policy, it’s not just what you do today   that’s important  What you are signaling about the future is every bit as important  This is   the whole issue that the Chairman has worked with Mike Woodford on—the issue of   managing expectations is not just what you do with the federal funds rate now; it’s also the   path  In fact, the projections that we are talking about doing are very much consistent with   that way of thinking  So the reality is that, from a policy viewpoint, what we say in the   statement is as important as what we do in voting on the federal funds rate  Indeed, since   I’ve been on the Board, that’s been really the only issue because we really haven’t had much   debate about the federal funds rate decision  So in that sense, if it is really important and it   is a key part of policy, it makes sense for us to vote on it  I’m not worried about the issue of   dissents because the point that you made, Governor Kohn, that there should be a very high   barrier is exactly the way people have been proceeding  The barrier is fairly high for the   federal funds rate decision, but in this case even more so  It’s just a couple of words, and if   you dissent, well, to be honest, then you’re a jerk  [Laughter]  I don’t see any jerks here     So my feeling is that I don’t think we’re going to have a big problem     So I’m actually quite comfortable with moving in that direction    Thank you very much   June 27-28, 2007 214 of 261      I’ll be an outlier in terms of the transcripts five years from now;   they’ll say, “Oh, God, Rick is here”  "
7977,2007-08-07,"  Charlie, could I ask you about the issue of the fan charts?  As I understood   the proposal, the fan charts would be in there, but we would not be producing our individual fan   charts     So I think you are absolutely right  I strongly agree with you that it is   important to have something that is visually dynamic to get across uncertainty for many, many   reasons, particularly to get people to understand that, even when we don’t get it exactly right, we   may still actually be doing a very good job and then, of course, to evaluate us in a more reasonable   way     But I think it is a question of nuance  One of the issues that I wonder   about here is that for us to do a communal fan chart would be extremely difficult technically  So the   question is how we get across the issue of uncertainty in a very graphic way, and I think it can be   done by producing information along the lines that the proposal mentioned  But I think we will   need to see examples  So I would recommend that the subcommittee or whoever will be involved   with the staff give us some different ways of doing it so that we can actually get some polling   information on people as to whether or not this is effective     It is not just the media  Think about the financial analysts who are writing   about this all the time—and they get paid a lot more than we do   August 7, 2007 49 of 136      Thank you  Well, except for the fact that we have had a benchmarking   of potential GDP downward and greater weakness in housing, my forecast is basically similar to   my forecast at the last FOMC meeting and is consistent with the Greenbook forecast—that we   would have a return to trend growth a bit later than we had expected but by mid-2008 and 2009    In regard to the issue of inflation, let me just provide a little information on the model that I’m   thinking about  You know that I think a key driver of inflation, of course, is inflation   expectations, and that there are good arguments to say that they are grounded around 2 percent    August 7, 2007 78 of 136    We have been seeing numbers continually coming in that are very consistent with that, which   gives me more and more confidence that, in fact, inflation is gravitating strongly to this 2 percent   level   But I want to talk a bit about the issue of output gaps because I think that it is important,   even if you think that inflation expectations are extremely important, not to have a deus ex   machina view of the inflation process, which is that inflation is caused by expected inflation and   then where does that come from?  So I think that resource utilization is important  However, the   problem is that what is really important is not just current resource utilization, which is what we   tend to put in our econometric specifications, but also the future expected path of resource   utilization and output gaps  Of course, one problem here is that it is hard to measure  Also, if   you are doing monetary policy right, then there is an expectation that you are going to do the   right things to eliminate those output gaps  In fact, that is exactly what is in our forecast and   exactly what our policies have been doing  So one reason I think, in the current juncture, that it   is not critical to talk about output gaps a whole lot is that basically we are doing the right thing    That context gives me further reason for saying, given our forecast, that a 2 percent inflation   number is where we are heading, just not now, and that the trend is solidly in place  But we are   going to stay there for the foreseeable future, unless we screw up somehow, and we are not going   to do that  [Laughter]   One key point that makes me a little different from the Committee on inflation is that I do   not see the upside risks as being greater than the downside risks  I really do see the risks as   being quite balanced on inflation—again around this 2 percent number  Yes, we do have some   temporarily good news, and it is going to be unraveled a bit, but it is still consistent with the   August 7, 2007 79 of 136    2 percent overall trend  In terms of output gaps and future expectations, I don’t see those getting   people thinking that we’re going to have too tight resource utilization     Let me turn to the issue of the financial markets because, obviously, that is the big gorilla   sitting at the table  I don’t see what is happening now as a direct spillover from the subprime   market  It is very consistent with the way that Bill was talking about this issue  Of course, the   media are making the subprime market into the whole story, but I think it is just not the right   story  The subprime market is really a very small percentage of the total credit markets  What I   think is much more important is that people are questioning and reassessing the quality of the   information that exists in financial markets  The point of the subprime market is just that we   now trust the credit-rating agencies less  Basically what I think is happening in a way is quite a   good thing  We were concerned that the markets were a little too optimistic, that there was too   much opacity, and that people weren’t worried about it  Now, in fact, they are worried about it,   and I think that is fundamentally a healthy situation  Also, the parts of the market that are having   the problem are the most opaque parts, it is not clear that they are particularly important to the   things we really care about in terms of our policies, which is what will happen to aggregate   demand and, therefore, to both inflation and output  So at this point, I take the view that this   could all end very well and could in the long run make the situation healthier, and this view is   consistent with what Governor Kohn was pointing out   But I do worry that this reassessment could actually find more—what’s the right word?—  skeletons in the closet or bad things happening than were expected  In the past, we’ve seen that,   when the quality of information gets questioned and people don’t think the marketplace is   providing the right information, headwinds in the economy can become quite significant  The   most recent episode that I am thinking about, of course, is the episode of Enron and its aftermath,   August 7, 2007 80 of 136    in which a key reason that the economy was so slow to recover was that the quality of   information was impaired  Then, people realized that the markets in fact did have some slight   elements of financial instability—again, not too serious because the banking system was in such   good shape  We could have a similar situation occurring now  So the sort of bad scenario that I   see is an Enron-type scenario, not something much worse than that  But we really have to keep   on top of this  It means, I think, that there are greater downside risks to the forecast  The survey   of all of us indicates that people are now much more worried about downside risks than they are   about upside risks  I think that is absolutely right, and, in fact, it could get a lot worse  So the   way I would view the situation is that right now we should be pretty calm, but we want to   monitor it very carefully and be ready for some potentially bad things to happen and just hope   that they don’t  The kind of scenario that we’re seeing in the Greenbook is one that is going to   play out  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously I agree that we should not have a   change in the federal funds rate  So I want to talk about the statement  When I think about the   statement that I would write, a key thing from my viewpoint is just to ask what the inflation   objective is because it really affects the statement in a major way  I believe that a 2 percent goal is   reasonable for reasons that I have discussed before  In that context, inflation has moderated, and so   I would have difficulty saying that we are concerned that it has not moderated when I think, in fact,   it has  But I do have to say that I think we want to stick with alternative B as it is written here for   two reasons  The first reason is that I am actually in a conflicting situation because it is not clear   whether I should think about writing a statement that’s appropriate for Governor Mishkin or a   statement that’s appropriate for the Committee as a whole  We are going to have to deal with this   challenge  When I read the projections, it’s clear to me that I’m on the high side, that my 2 percent   is higher than the median, which is around 1¾ or 18  I would not have difficulty accepting an   inflation objective of 18 as long as the Committee came to a consensus  I think that the issue of   writing the statement is much more difficult when we don’t have consensus of the Committee  It is   creating a problem for me in terms of thinking about how to get involved in the internal deliberation   on what the statement should be, and that will be important in the future  I do not think that now is   the time to deal with that  So one of the issues then is let’s deal with that at some point in the future   August 7, 2007 104 of 136    The second reason is the issue of what is going on in terms of the financial markets and what   kind of impression we give outside  I agree with Governor Kohn that we have not been operating   under a Greenspan put or a Fed put  It is very clear to me that we have not been doing so, except   that I think an impression has been created, and I would like to mention that I am a little less   sanguine about what was done in the past  I think that one mistake was made, perhaps because I’m   looking at it ex post  When the Fed lowered interest rates 75 basis points in the LTCM episode, it   was a brilliant stroke  It was exactly the right thing to do  But when you think about an operation   like that, which was basically to restore confidence to the markets and was very much like a classic   lender-of-last-resort operation, we know that you want to put in liquidity; but when the crisis is   over, you want to take it out  At that time, I was quite critical that the Fed did not then remove the   75 basis point decline, and I think it created an impression—I don’t know about a Greenspan put,   but there was some element of that—and it is very hard to dissipate that impression  Maybe it is   true that people said we weren’t trying to do that, but we did create some kind of impression along   those lines  So I think the issue of perception still is important  In that context, it is very important   that we not give the impression that we are responding to financial markets now because the   discussion here has been that we are very concerned that this might be a problem in the future but   right now it is not affecting our forecast in a major way  That’s exactly what we have to   communicate to the public and the markets; and in that context, changing the statement too much in   moving toward balance will create problems along those lines   If I were not worrying about these issues, I would take the word “predominant” out of the   statement  In fact, I might even take out the issue that I’m worried about, that we say inflation has   not moderated  But given the current situation, I think it is best that we stick with “predominant”    That we mention downside risks to growth and then the “predominant” side in terms of inflation   August 7, 2007 105 of 136    does create an element of balance  Thus I think there is a potential issue that we have to worry   about in future statements and that we will have to grapple with  I hope that this Committee could   come to a consensus on what our inflation objective is so that we can have a more coherent   discussion of these issues; however, I do not think this is the time to pursue that  So I support   alternative B as written  Thank you     But there’s always an issue about what we mean by the word “classic”    What I’m thinking about here is that a lender-of-last-resort operation is really about restoring   confidence  It can be done without actually putting any liquidity into the system  If you look at a   successful lender-of-last-resort operation, just the announcement that you will be a backstop for the   system has tremendous impact  Of course, this is one reason that what was done in ’87—with   Greenspan not actually sitting in the tub that morning but getting up early and announcing before   the market opened that the Federal Reserve was going to be a backstop—was extremely important    I’m thinking of it in that context, which is that we wanted to provide information to the markets,   August 7, 2007 106 of 136    which was that we were going to be there and that we were not going to be the Bank of Japan and   allow something to spiral out of control  Clearly, it was basically taking out insurance, saying that   the Fed will be there  Once you don’t need insurance anymore, there’s a really strong argument to   take it away  So I’m not talking about this in terms of liquidity per se but what we are trying to do   in terms of expectations  That episode was important for doing the right thing, which was critical to   the way the financial markets recovered; but I think a problem was created when we didn’t reverse   it in the same way that, when you actually do a lender-of-last-resort operation, you put liquidity in   and you take it out  That’s the sense in which I mean putting lower interest rates in and then taking   them out when the crisis is over     May I make a two-handed intervention?     Could I ask a question of Brian?  “Predominant” is a key word  So what   do you think might be the response of the markets if we leave it in or take it out, in terms of two   elements  One is the issue of how the markets would think about the future evolution of our policy    Two is how the media might read whether we are reacting to the distress in the financial markets     Right     Could you clarify?  Are you saying that you would then get rid of “credit   conditions have become tighter”?     Fine with me     Well, “credit conditions” is more general because it can encompass both   price and nonprice     We flip a coin?  "
7997,2007-08-10,"  Yes, I’d just like to understand a bit more about what’s going on in terms   of Europe  My understanding is that yesterday, when the European Central Bank injected all that   August 10, 2007 5 of 12    liquidity, a lot of it was done through borrowing from their standing facility  Do we have an idea of   what exactly the banks are using those funds for?     So is it spending directly?  Are the banks buying commercial paper, or are   they lending directly to the people who can’t roll over their commercial paper?  "
8011,2007-08-16,"  I was going to ask about the same issue that President Moskow asked   about, which is the 50 basis point issue  I do understand the reason for not going all the way to the   federal funds rate target, but an issue is that the purpose of this is to send a signal to the marketplace,   and there is a concern that too many people might be coming to the discount window  But my   understanding is that at the discount window we do have haircuts that might be put into place  First,   we are going to put in haircuts in terms of the kind of collateral that will be brought and, second, it   can be administered if people are bringing us “dreck”—a good word—stuff that’s not terrific  So I   do wonder whether 50—in a way, it’s halfway—may not be enough of a signal, and I think that we   could manage this with numbers below that  Do the people administering the Desk have a concern   about being able to operate this successfully if we were only 25 basis points above the federal funds   rate target?     But would it be manageable?     I strongly support both of these statements  There’s a very strong reason   for thinking that the discount window has a special role here and that credit policy makes sense    The issue is that there’s an information problem in the markets, but the banks’ knowing that there’s   a backstop and that we’re doing something in terms of the discount window could actually unfreeze   the system so that we could have players come into these mortgage markets to replace the players   that are now not in the mortgage markets  That’s an extremely important part of the way you deal   with a seizing-up of financial markets  This kind of situation has occurred before but in different   markets, and credit policy does have an important effect in that context     In fact, I would actually argue that we should move the discount rate down 75 basis points   rather than 50, and my argument is as follows  Clearly there is a tradeoff  I understand the issues   that people have raised today—that having the number be 50 basis points above is advantageous   because the markets can self-regulate, and I think that is a plus  However, the tradeoff in the other   direction is that we want this credit policy to have an impact, and having this signal is extremely   important here  Having a more dramatic signal, I think, could make it more likely to work  Clearly   even then it is not guaranteed to work, but the stronger the signal that we can provide without   actually disrupting the operation of the discount window, the better off we are  There are some   technical issues about operating the discount window because the discount rate will be set at a rate   that’s too low; but the risks are much greater that we don’t send a strong enough signal  We really   want this credit policy to work  One reason that we want it to work is that it then can differentiate   credit policy from monetary policy so that we don’t end up with a situation of a Federal Reserve   August 16, 2007 30 of 37    put, which looks as though we are actually trying to use monetary policy to bail out the markets    We want to use credit policy to focus where it’s needed, and then monetary policy can focus on the   outlook of the economy   I strongly support these proposals  There are strong reasons to go to a 75 basis point   decrease in the discount rate because the balance of risks here is that it’s better to have the signal   stronger  If we end up with a little too low discount rate, I’m confident that people at the Reserve   Banks, particularly the New York Bank, can handle this to sufficiently contain any risk  So I would   just modify this by putting 5½ percent on the primary credit number rather than 5¾     May I just ask a question of Brian on this?  We know clearly that under   normal conditions, particularly with the 100 basis point penalty, we want this to be a standing   facility with no questions asked  Given the situation that’s so unusual in this context and the fact   that what we’re doing now is clearly temporary, there is an issue here that we might have some   cases in which we cannot have purely no questions asked, but close to it  Would that be a problem?  "
8033,2007-09-18,"  Yes  Just a question, really, for Bill and Brian  One thing that is   positive about all of this—although maybe I’m wrong about it—is that the spillovers into the   September 18, 2007 33 of 188    other markets outside the United Kingdom have been very, very minor  Normally, what’s   happening in the UK context would be an information shock that could trigger problems  The   good news here is that, if anything, the markets have actually gotten a little better since this   whole episode occurred, and it has been contained in the UK context  Is this a fair assessment?     It is really an important issue     It’s a question of how desperate you are  [Laughter]       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Clearly, the key issue in thinking about   where the economy is and what we need to do about policy is the financial destruction that is   going on right now  When I look at it, I think about the different episodes that we’ve had in the   post-World War II period and separate them into two sets of episodes  There’s the episode of   1970 with the Penn Central crisis, there’s the 1987 stock market crash, there’s the 1998 LTCM   episode, and then, of course, the World Trade Center terrorist tragedy in 2001  That’s one group    In those contexts, there was a lender-of-last-resort operation  It was active policy on our part,   and it did resolve the situation in the financial markets very quickly  The other episode is the   early 1990s, when there was much more of a severe structural problem in which the banks got   into trouble  Therefore, it took quite a long time for them to fix their balance sheets in order to   get players back into the financial markets to make loans to people who had good investment   opportunities   When I look at the current episode, I see something in-between  I do not think that in this   case the situation can be resolved quickly because I think that the price discovery issues are   severe  In particular, we’ve gone to an originate-to-distribute model, which Governor Kroszner   mentioned, and we have found some serious flaws in it  The expectation is that we will have   new models coming out  In fact, I think that this is actually going to be a long-run profit   opportunity for the banks  So if we were allowed to buy bank stocks, I think it would be a good   idea  [Laughter]  But the key problem is that this is going to take a substantial amount of time,   even if things go very well; in that context, there is a substantial negative shock to aggregate   demand and, therefore, a substantially weaker economy  However, the issue that most concerns   me here is that, even though I think the modal forecast is that growth will be slower than we   September 18, 2007 89 of 188    expected, the downside risk is actually very, very substantial  Though we may not be allowed to   mention it in public, we have to mention the “R” word because there is now a significant   probability of recession  The problem here is really the interaction of the financial side with the   real side  I’m worried that, as the economy becomes more nonlinear, we have the potential for a   vicious circle or a downward spiral, whatever phrase you want to use—that, in particular, we   have a financial disruption, which means that it’s harder to allocate capital to people with   productive investment opportunities and, as a result, you get a contraction in economic activity    A contraction in economic activity makes information revelation or price discovery harder to do    That can then lead to more financial disruption, which leads to a downward spiral in terms of   economic activity  So the big issue here for me is that this nonlinear element is very real right   now  The question is what to do about it, and that’s what we will be discussing shortly   However, I think it is also important to recognize that inflation risks are just not that   severe right now  That’s the good news because it will allow us flexibility to deal with the   situation  In particular, we see inflation expectations that are very grounded, something that   everybody has mentioned  Also, even in the modal forecast and not worrying about the   downside risks, the expected future output gaps are more negative, so we have less pressure   going forward there  I was happy that the staff slightly lowered the NAIRU estimate, which was   consistent with my views in the past couple of cycles, when I thought that it might be a smidgeon   under 5 percent  I think their revision makes sense, and, again, it means that there’s a bit less   likelihood of upside risk to inflation  Then, also, there are the downside risks to real growth    When I look at the inflation situation, I do think that inflation expectations are grounded around   2 percent right now  By the way, that’s not necessarily written in stone because things that we   might do could actually change inflation expectations; but I think that we have to take inflation   September 18, 2007 90 of 188    expectations as given right now  However, I see that the risks are slightly to the downside from   that 2 percent level because of the things that I’ve just mentioned  The key point here is that we   have a situation of potential nonlinearities, big tail risk, that could actually get very nasty, and in   fact there is a potential for recession  On the other hand, I don’t see that inflation risk is the big   problem right now  Thank you     I’ve already said that I don’t see that the risk is on the inflation front right   now, although clearly we have to keep monitoring inflation, and that the serious risk is the nonlinear   downward spiral that could occur  Of course, the big problem is really the issue of information   revelation and price discovery  I want to point out that there are really two sources of this  One is   that it’s very difficult for the market to figure out what the value of assets in these structured   products is  Clearly, that will take a long time to work out, and it is not something that monetary   September 18, 2007 103 of 188    policy can do anything about  The second source of the problem of price discovery is the fear that,   in fact, we might have a severe economic downturn, and we can do something about that  So in this   context a cut is not controversial because everybody is coming to the conclusion that we should cut   the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and, in particular, that we want to get ahead of the curve to   indicate to the markets that we are on top of this and that we are trying to remove the downside tail   that we’re particularly worried about   But I want to talk a little about a somewhat longer-run perspective on monetary policy   strategy and how we might proceed from here  The way I think about this is that the situations we   have to deal with fall into two camps  The normal situation is when things are fairly linear, when   we don’t have financial disruptions  In that case, there is a lot of reason to have what has been   characterized in the academic literature as policy inertia—that is, the idea that, when you move the   federal funds rate, you don’t move it back quickly and, in fact, you have very persistent federal   funds rate moves  Indeed, I think that is the right thing to do under normal circumstances  Clearly,   there’s an issue that moving a very short-term interest rate will not have an effect unless people   expect it to persist  Because the longer-run part of the term structure is more relevant to people’s   decisions in terms of spending, there’s a very strong case for pursuing things in a persistent way    Also, there is always a problem that, when you reverse, people may say, “Gee, you didn’t know   what you were doing, and you had to change your mind?”  So there’s always this issue of flip-  flopping that you have to be concerned about  The other situation is exactly the environment we’re   in, when you really have to take out insurance against something that has the potential to create a   downward spiral that’s hard to control  It’s particularly imperative in that situation that you get   ahead of the curve  In fact, there’s a very strong case to make sure in that situation that you   emphasize to the markets that you are trying to take out insurance against the downward spiral  But   September 18, 2007 104 of 188    if you are successful, things may start to turn around, and if things go the right way, which is what   you hope happens, then you want to reverse course  So in the projections that I provided, I did   something that was unusual  I think I was the only person to have a rate reversal in the projections    Oh, you did, too?  Okay  So I had us going down 50 at this meeting  I thought there was a   possibility—though I hope not—that we might have to go 50 at the next meeting and, if we did, that   would certainly be enough, and then we would move back up afterwards  So in this context, I think   that we really do have to think in terms of potential reversals and, therefore, to not be scared of   overshooting a bit  There tends to be a lot of inertia in the way we do monetary policy—it is well   documented  There’s even inertia in general, just in that we have nineteen participants at a table    As an academic, I mentioned to Don Kohn at one point that sometimes I think these meetings have   elements of faculty meetings, and that is not always something that you enjoy  [Laughter]  Some of   you guys may not have experienced that, but it’s a lot of fun  So I think the bottom line here is that   we have to be prepared to think about being much more aggressive, not just now but even in the   future  However, I do want to point out that this does not mean that we should have an alternative   that indicates that we are going to do further cuts in the future  I strongly advocate alternative B   because, by aggressive action now, we may start turning the markets around and, if that’s the case,   then it will not be necessary for us to quickly do more  So we do not want to say to the markets that   we have to keep on going when we’re hoping that we won’t have to keep on going  I think that’s   extremely important in thinking about where we are right now     Another issue in terms of an extremely aggressive policy and then possibly doing reversals   is the moral hazard context  Again, I think this is a communication issue  I have a slight   disagreement with President Plosser in that I think we have to talk about the financial market   disruptions because it is very important to indicate that, in being very aggressive, we are not losing   September 18, 2007 105 of 188    sight of our inflation goals and that this is a case of worrying about the downside tail that we have to   deal with and really showing that we’re on the ball in that context  So we’re in a slightly different   situation from the normal one, and I would advocate keeping the discussion of financial disruptions   in our statement the way we have it now  Thank you     I was completely fine with the proposal  The only thing it mentioned   that I would slightly differ on is that I would like the box on uncertainty to come out with every   forecast narrative—you know, the four times a year deal  The negative is that it would be the   same each time, so there would not be much that is new  But when you look at inflation reports   that people have done, they frequently have a box that’s the same each time  In my view, the   issue of making sure that people understand that there’s a lot of uncertainty about our forecast is   so critical that, even if they ignore a bit because we’re putting it out every time and it’s just a   standard part of the package, I think it is extremely important     It’s hard to think about exactly how to do that in terms of the survey,   but certainly that’s exactly where the narrative would have a lot of value because it’s really hard   to do it just in terms of some kind of standard survey  I hope that in the future we won’t have   many discussions like today’s, but we might  Maybe that could be handled in the narrative     Actually, great minds think alike  The first question you asked was   exactly the one I was going to ask        Just as long as you need 50 million bucks   September 18, 2007 140 of 188      Won’t they figure it out almost immediately?     I think that this proposal has an important advantage in that it is   channeling funds to a place where they are most needed, so it has macroeconomic consequences  If   you think about it, open market operations are a very blunt tool  Here you are actually able to direct   credit to a market that isn’t working  We have a LIBOR market that really is not working; it clearly   has spreads that are way out of line  When people talk about what’s going on in the market, they   basically say, “Yes, there’s an arbitrage opportunity, but there’s so much risk that I can’t take   advantage of it”  That is something that I think is important  For example, my understanding of   commercial real estate deals is that all the deals are done off of LIBOR, and so this actually is an   September 18, 2007 164 of 188    important market  Do I think this will solve the problem of price discovery in general?  No  But I   do think that this is an important market that is having important macroeconomic implications, and   going in and doing something about it can have very strong benefits   There are some tricky issues  The issue I really worry about the most is the 20 percent   number, where we might have five guys, and everybody knows that some people will be politically   problematic for us  So maybe you might want to think about whether that 20 percent number is   exactly the best number  That’s why I was going to ask the same question that you asked, and now   that we have some time, I would encourage the staff to think about exactly that issue   Another element here is important—which is that we’re saying to the marketplace that   we’re not just thinking about using monetary policy tools; in fact, because it is a credit problem,   we’re thinking creatively about how to use credit tools as well  In that regard, there’s an advantage   that we are thinking outside the box and trying to deal with this another way  Let me give you an   analogy to something that we did on August 17  On August 17 we pulled out the discount window    We did it with a 50 basis point penalty  You know, you look at it, and in one sense it was not a   success  It didn’t make a big difference in terms of the numbers  It wasn’t bad, but I’ll tell you,   when you asked people out there whether it was a positive thing to do, they’d say, “Oh, yeah”  It   really sent a very, very good signal  My sense is that this may not completely solve the problem—  there are some issues about how much should be taken up—but I think that it would send a signal   that we’re on the ball  It has another element, which I’m a bit sensitive to, that there is criticism that   we are too academic here because some of us have worn tweed coats  [Laughter]  So that you   know, the Chairman used to come to the New York Fed meetings and would wear those patches on   the outside of his coat  I actually like that look and have my assistant professor corduroy suit  But   here we are trying to think very practically in a creative way  It also has an advantage for this   September 18, 2007 165 of 188    institution at this juncture because we are thinking about market issues and dealing with very   specific details in the markets  I think that’s something that we’ve gotten across to some extent    We’re ready, and I think this would help  So I’m not saying absolutely that we definitely should use   this, but I think Governor Warsh talked about this exactly right  If we’re seeing that there’s some   stalling, that these spreads are not improving, then this is an option that will have benefits  Thank   you  "
8055,2007-10-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My forecast is actually quite similar to the   Greenbook forecast  In terms of inflation, I see a little faster movement back to 2 percent, where   I think inflation expectations are grounded, but the difference is very minor  I do think the risks   are quite balanced around that  In terms of economic growth, I am fairly comfortable with the   Greenbook forecast, maybe a smidgen less sanguine in the next two quarters but really not very   different  However, in terms of the issue of potential downside risk, I do think that, given the   policy path that the Greenbook assessed, there are substantial downside risks and they come   from several sources  One source is that the financial market disruptions have led to some   tightening of lending standards  I think that could have some potential effect on business   investment  The housing market is pretty grim  We still have a big inventory overhang, and   there is a question about whether that large inventory overhang is going to lead to even fewer   housing starts than the Greenbook has forecasted  Furthermore, it has raised the issue about   October 30-31, 2007 67 of 162    house prices, which have spillovers into household spending  The spreads for commercial real   estate are still very high, and so there is a question about whether commercial real estate will be   as strong as it has been  That is a bit worrisome as well  Consumer confidence has not   deteriorated too much, but it has been on a path of deterioration  So, again, I worry a little about   what the consumer might do  In general, I worry more about these downside risks, given the   policy path of keeping the federal funds rate constant   What about the financial markets and their disruptions?  Well, I think that there are two   elements to the disruption in these big, widening credit spreads  One is the valuation risk  All of   a sudden people realized that they didn’t know as much about what kind of assets were in   portfolios and how complicated the structures were in terms of those assets  Clearly, the solution   to that problem is price discovery  We see that happening, but it is going to be very slow  So   that problem, in terms of the credit markets, will take a fair amount of time to resolve  The   second element is what I call macro risk, which is the concern about a downward spiral  The   problems in the credit markets will lead to a weakening of the economy, which then makes price   discovery harder to do, which means that you have wider credit spreads, which then make things   worse  Of course, that’s the issue with the tail risk that all of us have been talking about  I think   the policy change that we did in September clearly had a big impact  It did exactly what we   wanted it to do  It is almost a textbook case in doing what we wanted it to do—it took out a lot   of the macro risk  It didn’t take out the valuation risk, which is getting better but very slowly   over time   So looking at this issue and thinking about going forward in terms of the credit markets, I   am a little worried that credit markets are still quite skittish  That has several elements  One is   the danger that macro risk could come back  So there is a question about shoes dropping  There   October 30-31, 2007 68 of 162    is an issue about what we might do at this meeting, and then there are issues about what might   actually happen that people don’t know about  One thing that is sort of surprising is that, when   you look at what is happening in credit spreads, they seem pretty reasonable in their steady but   very slow improvement  But then, you sense some discomfort—in particular, the reaction to the   Treasury superconduit has not been very positive  If it worked, it would actually reveal   information because it would look like the way that the old clearinghouses used to work, when   they would combine assets  Randy knows all about this because he studied this stuff  You pool   your assets, then you monitor each other, and then you actually create information that makes the   markets work better  I think that is what the Treasury was trying to get at  But the skepticism in   the markets is such that they think this could be used to hide information about assets and that   other shoes may be dropping in this regard  This does not give me a lot of confidence, and so I   worry very much at this juncture, which I think is a critical one, that a policy move could have an   effect of sending the credit markets in a bad direction  That is something we have to take into   account tomorrow  Thank you     The mantra      I just wanted to ask you for a little more detail about the market’s   reaction to the GDP numbers and the ADP data  You said that it’s the same  Can you be just a   little more precise?  Is there any movement at all in terms of the assessment of the federal funds   rate cut at this meeting?     About how much?     They will be  The histograms will be published—yes?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I take the view that a cut today is justified on   the basis that keeping rates where they currently are leaves us with a lot of downside risk  That’s   exactly what I’ve been hearing from other people  If there is, in fact, downside risk, why not move   today?  I would be very troubled by not changing and still using the language in alternative B   because it says there’s a lot of downside risk  Then there is the problem of why we are sitting there   and not doing anything  On just the straight economic issues, I think that a cut could be justified  In   particular, I was one of the people who advocated a cut at this meeting  In fact, I was being a bit—I   don’t know what the right word is—flamboyant when I suggested a cut of 50 basis points and then   that we might move back up 25 basis points  I was trying to make the point that I was very   concerned about the macroeconomic risk, the potential for a downward spiral of financial disruption   leading to problems in the real sector and then feeding back on the financial markets, and really felt   that we needed to keep ahead of the curve   What is key is that the response to our actions on September 18 was almost textbook perfect   in the sense that the markets really got the message that we were not going to be asleep at the wheel    As a result, the macro risk was taken out of these markets, and we achieved exactly the kind of   signaling that we intended  So clearly I do not feel that we need to get ahead of the curve in that   sense, the way I did last time  Also very important in my thinking about the macro issues is that I   think inflation expectations are contained  We have been able to achieve that  In particular, there is   a bit of concern about inflation compensation having gone up in terms of the spread between   nominal rates and TIPS  But the analysis that I’ve heard from people who are much more   knowledgeable about the way yield curves operate is that the way to interpret this is that there’s an   increase in uncertainty about what inflation would be  I hope that our communications strategy will   help in that regard  In fact, that provision of information will actually help the markets in the   October 30-31, 2007 110 of 162    current environment  Furthermore, the Michigan survey has, if anything, gotten better in terms of   inflation expectations  I always get a little nervous about asking regular people what they think   because if you ask them what they’re watching on TV, they’re never going to tell you that they’re   watching Vanna White  They’ll tell you that they’re watching ballet or the History Channel    [Laughter]  But I don’t see a problem there, and that the ECI numbers came in the way they did also   gives me some confidence on the inflation front   I am very concerned about Charlie’s issue—I always call President Plosser “Charlie”   because we have known each other such a long time—about being led by the markets  It is very   important that we not get into that box  I worry about that, but I am a bit less worried about it in this   context in that we affirmed last meeting that we were not being led by the markets because we sure   as heck surprised them  So the fact that we don’t surprise them this time to me does not create a   pattern that we’re just doing whatever the market tells us   I also want to raise a consideration that I think deserves some emphasis, which is thinking   about scenarios of what may happen  This relates to what Bill talked about, but I want to be a little   more explicit  I want to ask myself what might happen as a result of our policy actions today and   what the implications might be for the economy  In particular, let’s think about the case of our   doing alternative B  In that case, I think there is a significant probability that the markets would   react quite negatively and that the macro risk that we took out by our action on September 18 might   creep back into the credit markets  I’m actually very worried about the skittishness of the credit   markets  When you’re in a financial-disruption type of world, things are much more nonlinear  So   I would have no disagreement at all with Charlie on the issue that, if you are in a normal situation,   then you definitely do not want to be led by the markets at all  But I think that we do have to worry   about market considerations a bit more in the current situation, when we could have a negative   October 30-31, 2007 111 of 162    reaction to what we do  That creates problems in the credit markets, and then that weakens the   outlook for the economy and there is an issue about what do we do then  If we then cut in   December and cut more than 50 basis points, that’s really bad  Or if we don’t cut and things head   south, that could be very, very problematic   But I do not think that cutting today will have very negative effects on inflation   expectations  However, I do think that the issue of going forward is very important, and this relates   to the statement  I strongly agree that we need a much stronger balance and an indication that our   action today—if we do what I suggest, which is to cut 25 basis points—does not mean that we   expect to cut at the next meeting or further out  We really need to make that very clear  The   statement will be one part of it, although I worry very much about the issue that we always put   much too much weight on the statement and that we don’t have other means of communicating    I’m not sure what to do about this; I’ve been thinking about it and haven’t come up with any good   answers  But there are issues in terms of how other central banks communicate things beyond the   statement that are hard to communicate with fifteen words rather than something more extensive   So my view—and it is reflected in my projections—is that, if we cut 25 basis points, it’s not   clear to me that the balance of risks is so much to the downside  I think the risks to the downside   have been very substantially eliminated—not that they aren’t still there to some extent  I think they   are but not really as much, and I think that is true of the actions on September 18 and today    Because I’m never very precise in my language—as you know, I tend to say pitiful things—  somebody will craft this much better than I do  But I’m wondering about the assessment of risk    Let me make a suggestion, although I’m not sure this is the best way to do it  We need to   emphasize that it’s not just the upside risks to inflation but also the downside risks to the economy   that have lessened  It is also important when we have a 25 basis point cut not to say to the markets   October 30-31, 2007 112 of 162    that we’re so worried about the economy  One possibility might be, for example, to say that “the   Committee judges that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the somewhat   reduced downside risks to growth”  So we would not be saying that there isn’t some downside risk   but that it’s not really as strong as we thought  It’s certainly not as strong as we thought on   September 18  But I think that, with this kind of reduction in rates, it would reduce the risk  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Gary, I’m a little puzzled here  I’m not sure I understand  What I   understand from your reasoning is that the key issue is that you don’t want to give an impression   that we are going to keep on cutting       So if you take that first phrase out, you’ve taken out any issue of balance   of risk  My view is that the markets would interpret this as actually indicating that the Committee   would be more likely to cut in the future     But in this case, if we do alternative A, we will have cut     Thank you     It was to add a phrase before the downside risks to growth to say, “The   Committee judges that the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the somewhat reduced downside   risks to growth”  It would give a flavor that, in fact, our actions have reduced the downside risk     I didn’t feel strongly about this  It was just maybe I’ll do it in speeches   afterward     Thank you  I just want to return to the point that the Chairman,   President Poole, and President Fisher raised  In my conversations, people have expressed   different views at this juncture about what the optimal long-run inflation rate is  People know   that I am a 2 percent kind of guy, and I know good people here who are 1½ percent kinds of   guys  But in talking to people about this, I hear a lot more consensus and that people don’t feel   October 30-31, 2007 137 of 162    strongly  So I would be in concert with what President Poole said  If the Chairman said, “How   about X?”, I would be more than happy to say, “Giddyap, I am with the Chairman”  So, again,   my colorful language  But the key point here is that I think it would be very helpful at this   juncture that people really not emphasize differences but that, in fact, there really is consensus on   this Committee  That takes one of two forms  One is if you had something in the past, that’s   fine; but you can say that you had that in the past but you are actually comfortable with where   the general Committee is, and that way you can soften it  Two is a case in which somebody like   me has not actually publicly talked about an inflation goal  In that case, I would keep my mouth   shut on the issue  In terms of this initial launch—again emphasizing the fact that there really is a   lot of consensus on the Committee because we know that the press loves to create the opposite of   consensus because it sells newspapers—the more we can be supportive and to the extent that we   can look unified on this, the better off we are  I sense that is actually where the Committee is, so   I would encourage it in this process  "
8080,2007-12-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both measures  The way I think   about this is that the TAF, particularly, has the advantage of getting funds to the institutions that   need it most  So it’s not so much that Operation Twist is the issue that’s relevant  The issue here   is that distribution—where funds go—really does matter  That’s why I think that the discount   facilities have a special role to play and, in fact, give us more flexibility  The TAF is a finer tool   to get funds to different parts of the financial sector where they may do the most good    Therefore it gives us more options in focusing our overall market operations on monetary policy,   which is exactly what they should be focused on     Clearly there is an issue that we create some moral hazard in terms of liquidity   management, but I think that the danger here is not that large  I consider the moral hazard   problem that might be created from people not worrying quite so much about liquidity   management to be much less severe than the moral hazard in terms of credit risk  Second, a lot   of the issue of moral hazard occurs when it is idiosyncratic—one institution is doing something,   and they’re going to get away with it  Well, here clearly we are trying to deal with a systemic   liquidity problem not with an idiosyncratic liquidity problem  Furthermore, there are protections   here in terms of the credit risk—we are going to be lending only to institutions that qualify  The   Reserve Banks, if they’re uncomfortable with having this facility go to a particular institution,   can pull the plug  I think that’s extremely important  That’s exactly the key issue of the role that   December 6, 2007 43 of 51    we have—we lend, but we know to whom we lend  So the Reserve Banks have an extremely   important role to play in this regard   Obviously, we’re not sure that this is going to work  But in the circumstances, which are   complicated and difficult, being creative and trying different things—ones that we think have   very low downside risk but might have some positive benefits—is exactly what we need to do    In this context we are flying a little in difficult waters—I mixed the metaphor somehow on that   one  [Laughter]  But the key point is that this does have the backing in terms of thinking about   how lender-of-last-resort operations can work well  This is not out of line with that  It is, I   think, a more creative way of solving certain problems, and in my view, it’s definitely something   that we should try  Thank you very much  "
8102,2007-12-11,"  Talk for yourself, Bill  [Laughter]      Thank you, Mr Chairman  You are all aware that I have a very optimistic   personality; and at the last FOMC meeting, I actually had that kind of optimism  I felt that the   economy was evolving in a quite reasonable way and, in fact, was responding to our policy changes   in a way that I felt was very appropriate in order to minimize the cost of the financial destruction   that we’re experiencing  In particular, with the credit markets stabilized, we were in a situation in   which our policy moves had reduced a lot of the macroeconomic risk that was out there in terms of   credit spreads  Clearly we were still left with the opaqueness spreads or valuation risks that would   require price discovery to resolve  It looked as though that was going to progress very slowly and   over time we’d get out of the situation we were in and the economy would go through a solid   rebalancing, moving away from some sectors that had too much going on—that is, housing—to   sectors which we needed to expand—for example, the tradable sector—to deal with some of the   global imbalances that we had  So I was actually feeling very positive  I felt that things were going   exactly the way that I had hoped     December 11, 2007 82 of 138    Of course, things don’t always work out that way, and we started to see shortly after the   October meeting a substantial deterioration in credit markets  My view is that the deterioration that   we’re seeing is appropriately reflected in the substantial revision to the forecast  I’m very   comfortable with the way the staff has revised the forecast downward  It’s obviously something   that is an art because you have to do it in terms of add factors, but you do want to inform it by   science, and I think they have appropriately done so in terms of thinking about what we’ve learned   from past experiences that may tell us about how credit disruptions of this type will actually lead to   lower spending in many categories   But I want to talk about why my sunny disposition is much less sunny right now and why   I’m actually very, very worried—not to say depressed, but at least a little more that way than usual    It is because I think that the kind of negative scenarios that are pointed out in the Greenbook are   very real possibilities  In particular, there are two scenarios that they go into separately—the   housing correction scenario and the credit crunch scenario  I think that there’s a very strong   possibility those would come together because, if housing prices go down more, that creates a much   more serious problem in terms of valuation risk, and a serious problem in valuation risk will mean a   further credit market disruption, which then can lead to more macroeconomic risk because it leads   to this downward spiral  The real economy gets worse  That means that there is more uncertainty    Credit spreads get worse, and you get a very bad scenario happening  That could lead to the credit   crunch scenario  Similarly, a credit crunch scenario, I think, would have a very negative effect on   the real economy, which would mean that housing prices would go down, which would then make it   much more likely that we have the greater housing correction scenario  So that’s the first part of my   depression   December 11, 2007 83 of 138    The second issue is that the Greenbook does not go into the issue of what effect that might   have overseas  There has been a lot of discussion in the media about decoupling the US economy   from foreign economies, and when it’s just trade that’s going on, I think that is usually completely   reasonable  But when it’s financial, then there is very good reason to think of recoupling because a   financial disruption in the United States is very likely to spread to financial disruption abroad  We,   of course, have already seen that  It’s remarkable that what happened in the subprime sector has in   some sectors affected European banks maybe even more than American banks  So the possibility   that problems develop in the United States and lead to problems in Europe and other advanced   countries and then those problems actually spill over back into the United States again means that   there’s a third scenario that could be all tied together   When you look at all of this, I get very nervous  The bottom line is that my modal forecast   is certainly down, very much along the lines of what the staff has suggested  But I think there is a   significant probability that things will go south  You don’t like to use the R word, but the   probability of recession is, I think, nearing 50 percent, and that really worries me very much  I also   think that there’s even a possibility that a recession could be reasonably severe, though not a   disaster  Luckily all of this has happened with an economy that was pretty strong and with banks   having good balance sheets; otherwise it could really be a potential disaster  I don’t see that, but I   do see that there is substantial risk that the economy could have a severely negative hit to it that   would be very, very problematic     Now, when I look at the issue of inflation, I have a different view from many of the people   at this table  I feel strongly that the one thing a central bank can never afford to do is to lose its   nominal anchor  If we do that, it’s a disaster  With that viewpoint, I should say that, if shocks   occurred such that recession was going to occur and the only way we could stop a recession from   December 11, 2007 84 of 138    occurring was to inflate the economy, we couldn’t allow that to happen  We actually have to   preserve the nominal anchor because, in the long run, the pursuit of price stability is what makes   good monetary policy and has been a key reason for the remarkable success of monetary policy by   the central bankers throughout the world in recent years that I think nobody would have predicted    But when I look at what’s going on in terms of inflation right now, I really do not see the substantial   upside risk that a lot of people are talking about  For me the key driver of inflation is, as you know,   inflation expectations  The question is whether inflation expectations are grounded, and I think the   answer is “yes”  In fact, we’ve had a situation in which higher energy prices have not led to any   upward movement in expected inflation as far as I can tell  Neither has the dollar declined—that   actually happened when the economy was doing much better   Now we’re facing a situation in which we have some substantial negative shocks to the   economy, and those substantial negative shocks actually, if anything, put some downside risk in   terms of inflation  I don’t see that inflation will move much from 2 percent  One thing that has   happened recently is that we have not seen some of the favorable inflation numbers  President   Plosser talked about the fact that we’ve seen less favorable inflation numbers, but that’s because we   had temporary factors that were going to make inflation look overly good and drive it below 2   percent  The staff strongly indicated to us in the Greenbook and in past Greenbooks that those   temporary factors were not going to persist  They got that one right, but there’s no information   from the fact that those temporary factors are no longer present that says that inflation pressures   have actually heated up  Indeed, what we see is that inflation seems to be moving around 2 percent    That’s where I think inflation expectations are grounded, and I see no tendency at all for things to   get much worse in that regard  I’m not saying that couldn’t change, and so I think we have to be   very vigilant  But in the current environment, where I see a very negative potential path of the   December 11, 2007 85 of 138    economy, the idea that inflation is our primary concern right now is not where I am  With that let   me end     You will be sailing     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The modal forecast suggests a cut of at least   25 basis points  In fact, it indicates that we need to have further declines after that  As Governor   Kohn pointed out, the 25 basis point cut still leaves us as somewhat restrictive  So we could just   sit at a 25 basis point cut and not move further and keep our options open  I think Governor   Kohn made a very good argument for that  However, I do really worry about the significant   probability that things could go south in a vicious circle  In that context, I think that the issue of   macroeconomic risk is really a severe one, and an action of 50 basis points could help deal with   that risk  So I would prefer alternative A  If the Committee were going that way, which it is not,   I would have added a sentence about high uncertainty because I think the balance of risk   sentence does create certain problems  There is a question about whether you should have that at   December 11, 2007 115 of 138    all  But if you have it in there in situations like this, we definitely should emphasize the   uncertainty much more and use a sentence like the one that is in alternative B in that case   So let me just lay out this argument  Would a 50 basis point cut matter?  This is a   question that President Fisher has asked  I think the answer is very much “yes”  It is not the   actual cut itself that matters; it is the managing of expectations that really matters  In fact,   whenever we make a 25 basis point cut and you ask, “How big an impact does that have on the   economy?” the answer is, “Not a whole lot”  That comes out of our simulations  It is really the   path of interest rates implied by our actions that is important  In particular, the idea here of a   50 basis point cut is that, by getting ahead of the curve, we provide a signal to the markets that   we would be willing to take steps to react to events in the financial markets that might indicate   that we are getting into a vicious-circle type of situation  That is exactly what I felt we did in the   September meeting  That move was very successful, and the markets really improved very   dramatically afterward  The signal we were sending at that point was that, if things got much   worse, we might have to do it again     Now, as I said, we thought in October that things were looking pretty good  I thought we   had this great game plan; we were on board for the game plan; and, of course, the game plan is   unfortunately out the window  So I think that taking an action like a 50 basis point cut would   have an important impact and would provide the signals and the managing of expectations that   can have critical implications for how the economy evolves, particularly how the credit markets   evolve  It also raises the issue that one thing we do need to do, no matter what, is to indicate to   the markets that we understand that our job is to prevent bad shocks from propagating in a very   bad way  We can’t prevent the shocks—because things happen—but our job is to make sure that   they don’t propagate in a very bad way   December 11, 2007 116 of 138    The same issue comes up in terms of inflation  I have talked about the real side and the   justification for a 50 basis point cut in that case  But what about inflation?  Normally this   Committee acts in a very inertial way, and under normal conditions, there are good reasons for   doing so in terms of the way you manage expectations about the term structure and so forth  But   thinking that way about operating in a situation of financial disruption is not the right way to   think  In fact, the word that I really like in this context is Governor Kohn’s “nimble,” which was   exactly the right word  You have to be nimble  What do I mean by that?  Well, as all of us   completely agree, keeping inflation expectations contained is the most critical thing that we do    We do need to worry about the real side of the economy; but we know that, if you unravel   inflation expectations, then the jig is up, and you get very bad monetary policy outcomes, not   just for inflation but also for the real side of the economy  That is one of the key lessons that we   have learned in the past fifty years about monetary policy  So the question here is, Is this a   problem?  Well, I don’t see that there is a problem right now with inflation expectations getting   unhinged, but it could happen, and could happen quickly, in the future  That says that we have to   be aware of this and possibly change policy very quickly and that the word is “nimble”  I don’t   know if that is what you meant by “nimble,” but I like the word  This requires that we reverse   course very quickly   Now, the problem that President Plosser and others have raised is that the Committee has   not acted that way in the past, and that really is a serious concern of mine  There are ways to   operate differently on that, which is to recognize that if you are going to reverse course, you are   not going to do it on the basis of what is going on in the real economy or what is going on in   terms of actual inflation  Just as right now our decision is really not so much about the incoming   economic data as much as it is about the problems in financial markets and the credit disruption,   December 11, 2007 117 of 138    I think we are operating in a very proactive, forward-looking way  In that regard, we would have   to act similarly in terms of thinking about inflation  There are two cases in which there would be   signals that we would have to act very differently  One is that credit conditions could improve   very quickly  We are hoping that this would happen, and actually sometimes you do see these   things just turn around on a dime  All of a sudden a virtuous circle occurs  If that actually   started to happen, it would be imperative if we did a 50 basis point cut that we reverse very   quickly on that action  Second, we have information about inflation expectations, and if we saw   those numbers starting to go in a bad direction, we should also operate very quickly in a   reversing direction  It is extremely important not to be in the Taylor-rule type of framework,   where you wait to see actual inflation and output outcomes to drive your policy  It really has to   be much more proactive than that  There have been mistakes in the past, at least in my   viewpoint, when we could have reacted more quickly  For example, in ’98, it was very   appropriate for us to cut rates the way we did  But we were a bit slow to raise them, and I think   part of the reason was that we were reacting more to what was going on  I’m not sure—you can   correct me in private afterward, Don—but I think that inertia was there, and if we think about   doing things differently, it could work out very well   I have to say that I do not worry about the political issue of the election  It is a change in   the way this Committee operates, but I believe that we can change  [Laughter]  If we just think   about it and have a framework with which to think about it, we could be much more nimble than   we were in the past   So let me finish  Although I prefer alternative A, I am going to accept alternative B  I   am perfectly happy with the language of alternative B because I think there is a lot of uncertainty   in the marketplace right now  In particular, I feel that showing that the FOMC has consensus in   December 11, 2007 118 of 138    a very difficult situation like this will be beneficial to the markets  If I were not willing to accept   alternative B, it could create some problems in terms of the marketplace, and I certainly am not   willing to do that  Thank you very much  "
8122,2008-01-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the Chairman’s general   assessment of the risks to growth, and I think that currently we are well behind the curve and that   we need to act much more aggressively in terms of monetary policy  However, I want to say   that, even though I take the view that we need to be much more aggressive, I do not think that   today is the day to do it  There are really three reasons that I am not in favor of doing a move   today  The first is that it is very important to keep moving in the direction that I have hoped we   are moving in, which is to be much more systematic in terms of thinking about monetary policy   January 9, 2008 43 of 60    and actually communicating that to the markets and the public  Moving today would have the   potential to indicate that we are being much more discretionary than I think would be   appropriate, and that could be very problematic  I also would be concerned that it might give an   impression that we would be overreacting to one piece of information—the employment report—  and I think that would also be dangerous  There is serious potential for this to be viewed by the   markets as our panicking, and that would, again, be very harmful in the current environment   In terms of where I think we should be heading with monetary policy, I definitely think   that given the information we have today, though things clearly may change in the next couple of   weeks, we would need to move at least 50 basis points at the next meeting  Actually, I don’t   want to rule out the possibility of doing even more at the next meeting or talking about having a   contingent move, for which we’d prepare the markets, so that it would be more systematic in   terms of a possible intermeeting move afterwards because there is important information—  another employment report, retail sales, and so forth—that will come out shortly after the next   FOMC meeting   As I talked about at the last meeting—and I will go into this in more detail in a speech on   Friday—I think it is very important to be ahead of the curve and react aggressively to financial   market disruptions  There is an issue of very strong nonlinearity that makes the normal response,   which we think about in terms of doing optimal policy—the standard linear quadratic framework   we often work in—not the correct one  In a situation such as the one we are dealing with now,   with a lot of potential for nonlinearity, it is extremely important to get ahead of the curve  This   argues for quite aggressive action at this point—as I said, not particularly today but in the near   future   January 9, 2008 44 of 60    One concern that people have raised is the potential upside risks to inflation  I am less   worried about that than some other members of the FOMC for the following reasons  Very   importantly, inflation expectations seem very solidly grounded  We have had no indication of   any deterioration in terms of inflation expectations, despite our previous easing moves and the   very high increases in energy prices  Second, when I think about what drives inflation and what   are the dynamics of the inflation process, what is important are expectations not only with   respect to inflation but also with respect to the future path of output gaps  In particular, I do not   see at this juncture that people are worried that we are going to allow the economy to get   overheated  In fact, it is the opposite right now  We are more worried about the downside risks,   where there will be increased economic slack in the economy, and of course, that is consistent   with the forecast coming from the Board staff  So when I think about the inflation process, I   think in terms of underlying inflation, which is inflation not over the next year but over the   longer run, which is appropriate for monetary policy and when we can have an effect  I do not   see that the upside risk is huge there; in fact, this is very important in terms of allowing us to be   aggressive in this situation of financial disruption   One issue that I think is very important, which other participants here have raised, is that   there is a fear that we might overshoot if we ease aggressively  In fact, two things could indicate   that we may have gone too far  One is that we frequently see financial disruptions dissipate very   quickly  That is what I hope happens, so it is not something that I would be depressed about  I   would be very pleased about it because, if things start going the right way, just as you can get an   adverse or a negative feedback loop when these financial disruptions occur, you can actually get   a virtuous feedback loop, and that can happen fairly quickly  If that occurs, we should be very   ready to take away some of the insurance that we have provided by aggressive easing  The   January 9, 2008 45 of 60    second is, of course, inflation expectations  If aggressive easing led to the unhinging of inflation   expectations, that would be a terrible thing  The most important thing that I think we do is to   ground inflation expectations; it is a key part of our success and of central banks throughout the   world in recent years  So I think we have to monitor very carefully what is happening to   inflation expectations  If our easing looks as though it’s causing a problem in terms of inflation   expectations, then we have to act accordingly   I would argue that the way we have to think about policy is that we need to think about it   being less inertial but maybe more systematic  When we talk about risk management, I think in   the past there was some element of thinking that risk management was just discretion  We have   to think about risk management in terms of being more systematic and to think about how we   might react to changes in conditions so that we would not be inertial  By so doing and indicating   to the market that we were thinking that way, we could alleviate some of these fears   So the bottom line is that I think that we have to be ahead of the curve  I am actually   very sympathetic to President Evans’s view that we are going to have to move more than   50 basis points, certainly, over a longer period than just the next meeting  I also think that we   have to think about that hard and about doing this in a systematic way and prepare the markets to   understand why we are reacting the way we are, so that we are not seen as being discretionary   but as operating very much consistently with our dual mandate  Thank you  "
8167,2008-01-29,"  May I have a two-hander on this?     When you think about what’s going on, it is plausible that it is both up and   down  That’s the key point here  Because if you also look at the projections, there is a lot more   uncertainty about what’s going on in the real side of the economy  That could mean that inflation   could drift down and longer-run inflation expectations could drift down if, in fact, there’s some   uncertainty about what the objectives of this Committee are  On the other hand, we actually did   take a very sharp interest rate cut, and that could indicate that the Committee might tolerate   somewhat higher inflation  So even though the action that was related to the big jump in inflation   compensation was a cut in interest rates, I think there is a plausible argument that it could be   symmetric in terms of increasing uncertainty on both sides     I think it is consistent with your view, but I just wanted to clarify     Don’t worry; be happy?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we’re all trying to be cheery here  It   reminds me a little of one of my favorite scenes in a movie, which is Monty Python’s “Life with   Brian”  I remember the scene with them there all on the cross, and they start singing “Look on the   Bright Side of Life”  [Laughter]  So let me talk a bit about my views on this  My personality does   do that, but it is really that I’m strapped a bit to the cross  My view on the economy is that we are   going to have quite a weak first part of 2008, in which we’re going to skirt recession  This is my   modal forecast  I do think that the economy will be stronger in 2009 and 2010, but that’s because I   decided to be even less of a piker than Governor Kohn  He accused President Yellen, but I was   going to accuse him because I did actually assume a 75 basis point cut at this meeting and then   another 50 basis point cut at the meeting following  Then I hoped that afterward we would be able   to reverse  Of course, this is something to discuss tomorrow, but it has to do with my views on how   you deal with financial disruptions and risk management  So I’ll talk about that tomorrow   Even though I have a scenario that looks okay, I do want to point out that four very   significant downside risks really worry me  We all talked about them  Of course, the first is   housing  But I worry about a particular dynamic, which is that the negative price movements that   we currently see could be getting worse  People could be expecting that they’re getting worse, and   therefore, they want to hold off from buying a house because the effective cost of capital is higher    As somebody who stupidly is just going to contract on a new house because I have to please my   wife, I actually thought exactly along these lines and was thinking about pulling out but then   decided that my marriage was more important       By the way, if you know my wife, no it wasn’t close  The second issue is   that the potential for weaker house prices, which really is a significant possibility, not only could   lead to lower household wealth but, more important, also could reduce the value of collateral for   households and as a result mean that the relaxation of credit constraints that collateral affords is no   longer there  That could have major implications in terms of household spending, so it is also a very   substantial downside risk to PCE  The third issue is that we also see that the financial disruption has   already gotten worse  The good news is that there has been improvement on the liquidity front, and   I give a lot of credit to the TAF, which was superbly thought out by our staff and has been quite   helpful  However, credit conditions have worsened  Particularly worrisome—and something that   hasn’t been discussed much—is that the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey had substantial   tightening  Usually when you see this kind of tightening, it could indicate that we could have   serious negative economic consequences  Again, that actually makes me very nervous  Finally, to   get even more depressed, there really is potential for a negative feedback loop that has not yet set in    The financial disruption that we’re seeing right now could then mean a more substantial worsening   of the aggregate economy, and that could make the financial markets have even more strain, and   you have a problem  So I really worry about the downside risks and think that they are very   substantial and that we should be very concerned about them in thinking about what the appropriate   policy stance is   On the issue of inflation, I’m more sanguine  I see inflation going down to 2 percent by   2009  The key here is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded—in fact, are grounded at   a level that is consistent with my inflation objective, around 2 percent on PCE, which might be   different from others’ views, but that’s where I am right now  In that context, given that inflation   expectations plus expectations about future slack in the economy are the primary drivers of inflation   January 29–30, 2008 94 of 249    dynamics, I actually think that inflation will come down  It is true that the recent inflation numbers   have been very bad; but in thinking about the overall risks, I’m a bit different from the average   person on this Committee because I think the risks are balanced and actually somewhat to the   downside  The reason I say this is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded  At the same   time, there is a substantial downside risk in the economy that could really widen slack in the   economy, and that would mean that inflation would come down   I don’t want to be too sanguine on the issue of inflation expectations being grounded  In   fact, one thing that I think we have to monitor very closely is what’s happening in terms of inflation   expectations, particularly financial markets’ views of inflation expectations  In a sense, I think of   that as the canary in the coal mine  We are also going to want to look at expectations spreading to   professional forecasters and to households, but I think information would come in first in terms of   the financial markets for the reason that they put their money on the table and react quickly  That’s   one reason I think it’s very important to look at things like inflation compensation  But we do need   to look at this and do the analysis  My reading of the analysis that the staff gave and my thinking   about the issue is that there is just no evidence that inflation expectations have gone up  The story is   extremely hard to tell to go in that direction  However, it is very easy to tell a story that inflation   uncertainty has gone up a lot, and this is something that President Evans talked about and we talked   about at the very beginning of a long day  In this context, that does concern me, and it really tells   me that we have to think about whether we can better anchor inflation expectations  So I think that   this is something that we have to be concerned about, but I do not think that what has happened in   inflation compensation is that the canary is dropping dead at this stage  But we do have to monitor   this very, very closely, and again, it’s part of the risk-management strategy that I think we have to   pursue  Thank you, Mr Chairman   January 29–30, 2008 95 of 249      I hope so     January 29–30, 2008 99 of 249      I would like to ask a question and possibly make a comment about the   risk-management strategies  Am I correct in understanding that the treatment of expectations is   basically backward-looking?     So even though you know I am a fan of—well, let’s put it this way, you   said moderation, and I am not a fan of moderation in many dimensions  But there is a potential   January 29–30, 2008 106 of 249    cost here that is not articulated, which is that if there is a very aggressive easing and it has an   effect on inflation expectations, then the more benign scenario that we have in terms of cost may   not be there  This is one of the reasons that, if we think about a risk-management approach, we   have to think about whether we can do it more systematically  What kind of communications   would be attached to it?  Also, what kind of information would we have to watch out for to make   sure that we don’t unhinge inflation expectations?  So although I think this is a terrific box and it   was very, very useful, there is a bit of a qualm here  It is also very hard to model the issue of   what would happen to expectations  So I am not complaining in any way about the usefulness of   this; but we should have another concern, which is how we would manage inflation expectations   if we pursued an approach like this  Thank you     Yes  I just want to make a comment about what President Geithner said   and follow up on President Evans’s question  One thing that the simulation doesn’t get at is the   adverse feedback loop  It’s just not built into the model  So the benefits of pursuing a risk-  management approach are not as clear as they would be if they were included in the simulation    However, I would like to focus on President Evans’s issue because I think it really is critical  He   asked about how we might know whether or not we should reverse and talked about things like   the yield curve  But one thing that is important to recognize in this scenario is that I think it is   very unusual in terms of this Committee’s past behavior  But I don’t know  Don, you are my   man who is the ancient mariner here  Have we ever reversed this quickly in past episodes?     What the path of the prompt reversal is     So let me turn back to President Evans’s question because there is an   issue about what kind of information might tell us that we took out insurance and then it wasn’t   needed  I think some pieces of information that the staff has been looking at are relevant    Particularly important in this regard is that there are a lot of indicators of financial stress  What   is different about this episode is that the reason we are so worried about downside risk is the   financial strains, and there are a lot of pieces of information that the staff has been producing that   could be very important in terms of looking at this  They have a financial—I don’t know what   you call your indicator, but you have something that you have been using in your model, Dave,   that takes up spreads and volatility and—       —principal components of these things     Also an issue that the Chairman raised yesterday was that the housing   market is a big component of our downside risk  The market’s concerns about future declines in   housing prices are causing a very sharp decrease in demand for housing  That could turn around   very quickly as well  Even now we should be thinking about these issues, and Governor Kohn’s   use of the word “nimble”—I like “flexibility,” but I think “nimble” is probably a better word—is   January 29–30, 2008 115 of 249    really I think key here  It is somewhat of a departure from normal—exactly what the Chairman   said  This episode is different from past episodes  So we do need to start thinking about this,   and the staff will need to think about exactly these issues     It is not age  It is how long you have been in the System      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know from my discussion of the   economy, I think that we’re skirting a recession, but I see very large downside risks  When we   looked at the Greenbook, I agreed with the view that the equilibrium fed funds rate has dropped   substantially, at least 125 basis points from the last FOMC meeting in December  When I think   about a 50 basis point cut in this meeting, which is clearly the consensus of the Committee, my view   is that it is consistent with the downward revision in the modal forecast but it does not take out any   insurance; and this is something that the Vice Chairman alluded to before   So all else being equal, I would actually advocate a 75 basis point cut at this meeting   because I do think there is a need to take out insurance  However, there are mitigating factors, so I   do not feel as strongly as I did at the full FOMC meeting in December, when I took the view that we   should take out insurance and aggressively cut more than the consensus of the Committee, but felt   that dissent would not be helpful in terms of the perceptions of the Committee and the Federal   Reserve and so was willing to vote with the majority  In this case, I don’t feel as strongly, so I am   more comfortable with 50 basis points, although everything else being equal, I think that insurance   is warranted, and I get nervous that we are not getting sufficiently ahead of the curve   So what are the mitigating factors that allow me to be more supportive of the consensus of   the Committee?  One is that I do worry that markets might think we are panicking  This is the issue   that President Fisher raised  A 50 basis point cut would be a cut of 125 basis points in a month    There has been a lot of discussion in the media about our panicking on this, so there is a danger in   this regard, and that is a mitigating factor for my not pushing hard for a 75 basis point cut  The   January 29–30, 2008 148 of 249    second issue is that we saw a sharp move up in inflation compensation after the 75 basis point cut at   the last conference call meeting  Actually there’s no evidence at all that this was a result of higher   inflation expectations, but I do think it illustrated that there was more uncertainty about inflation and   where our long-run inflation goals might be  This is a reason that the Committee needs to get to   more clarity on our inflation objectives  You know, it is no surprise to people that I’m not   completely happy with where we are now in terms of the range  Exactly in a situation like this, just   as in 2003, you may drift up to the top of the band and be happy to stay there or drift to the bottom   of the band and be happy to stay there  I do think there is a cost  This illustrates a cost to our   communications strategy, and I hope we would reconsider that at some point in the future   The third mitigating factor is that there is an issue about taking out insurance when the   Committee is not completely prepared and we have also not prepared the markets to think about   how we might think about reversals if they were necessary in the future  The whole insurance   strategy is one in which you can’t take out insurance and then have it be seen as always easing and   thus unhinge inflation expectations and lose the strong nominal anchor  So the Committee has to   think more about conditions under which it would reverse course and actually prepare the markets   for that  As I said, there are two kinds of information that I think we get fairly quickly, along with   others—particularly information on inflation expectations and information on whether financial   market strains are easing  I think we need to clarify that in terms of the public  It is a point that   Governor Kohn made, and I want to return to it in a second  But the bottom line is that I support the   50 basis point cut in the funds rate, so I support alternative B   On the statement, I am probably the only person who likes the alternative A, paragraph 3,   rationale  But I am sympathetic to President Stern’s concerns—the less said the better—so I’m not   going to push it  But I am comfortable saying that inflation expectations are currently well   January 29–30, 2008 149 of 249    anchored and that there is some expectation of easing of slack in the economy, and so my view is   that the upside risks to inflation are not the serious concern right now  I’d be willing to state that if   it were me personally, but the issue that President Stern has raised that maybe the less said the better   is fine with me  Again, I’m perfectly comfortable with alternative B as it is written now   One last point, which is to address an issue that Governor Kohn mentioned  I think he’s   absolutely right that we should not be saying or thinking that we expect to reverse right now  Even   if we actually did a 75 basis point cut at this meeting, which we’re not going to do, I would not take   the view that it would mean that we plan to reverse it  When you put these projections out it’s tough   to indicate that you would be willing to reverse but the reality is that we’re taking out the insurance   because we think that the financial strains will last for a long time  That is our best prediction, and   on that basis, to give an impression that we want to take it away would create problems  This is the   issue that Governor Kroszner talked about in terms of Japan, where clearly expansionary policy was   not working because they kept saying, “We’re going to take it back”  As a result, from the   viewpoint of expectations, the policy was not expansionary  I do think policy needs to be   expansionary at this point  However, I’m not sure that I agree that we should not talk about the   issue of reversals  It’s a question of the way we talk about it  It’s not that we expect that we would   be reversing quickly, but conditions could change, which we’re not expecting, but we really would   like that to happen  We’d be hopeful, in particular, that the financial strain is turned around quickly,   which in the past we have seen happen in some cases  In some cases, it takes a very long time  The   episode in the early 1990s was one in which those financial strains took a very long time to   dissipate  Similarly, we don’t talk about it as much, but in the early aftermath of the 2000-01   recession, there was a sequence of financial strains, particularly things like Enron and the lack of   confidence, that lasted a heck of a long time  So I would say that we do need to think and talk about   January 29–30, 2008 150 of 249    it, but it is not that we want to reverse it  We are ready to reverse, but the conditions must be such   that we’re actually getting information that tells us that reversals are appropriate  Thank you very   much     Actually, I wanted to focus on the same issue—conflict of interest    This is something I did a little work on in the past  When you look at the standard corporate   ratings market, the move to have the issuer pay really did not create a problem in the market    There clearly is an inherent conflict of interest, but there are things that can counter that—in   particular, reputation     We could talk about Arthur Andersen, too, because I am going to talk   about the more complicated issues of conflicts of interest  With plain vanilla conflicts of   January 29–30, 2008 172 of 249    interest, if there is enough information, the market frequently can solve the problem because if   you know that if you do what the issuer wants and you give a good rating, then you lose your   reputation  Then, if it has no value, issuers won’t pay for it  What is interesting here is that for   the subprime market, you didn’t find any evidence of conflicts of interest, and I am not surprised   by that, because those securities are much more straightforward  Where I really do worry about   the conflict of interest is in the structured products because one thing that happened was that it   became less plain vanilla  You actually had consulting practices inside the credit rating   agencies; these structures are very complicated, and you need to slice here and dice here, and   consultants were providing advice on structuring them and making a lot of money, and then it   was much less transparent  What I wondered about here is that you didn’t say this for the first   one, subprime RMBS  You said you didn’t find the evidence  I buy that  But what about the   CDOs and the SIVs, for which I would expect that this problem would have been more severe?    In the book that I wrote with others on conflicts of interest in the financial services industry, we   actually said that there was not a problem with the plain vanilla products because the markets   have the information, but we worried about exactly this issue in terms of the structured products    I am just wondering whether or not it was an accident that you said for the plain vanilla that there   was less problem  Could there have been an issue here?  The reason this gets complicated is that   the standard view of conflicts of interest in Arthur Andersen was in the firm’s compensation   scheme  Actually, the conflict of interest was that the Texas unit did not worry about and   weakened—not their ethics, but what is it?  The center has rules for its branches so that they   don’t screw the overall firm, and that is what got weakened during the fight between the   consulting part and the auditing part   January 29–30, 2008 173 of 249    So do you have any information on these very complicated elements, particularly the   nontransparent parts?  Was it an accident that you said for subprime that you didn’t find   evidence, and for these is there more possibility that there was a problem?  That really does have   important implications for the nature of the regulation and accreditation agencies and also their   ability to give good ratings for these very complex nontransparent products  You talked about   investor practices later, Bev, when you said that we should differentiate between plain vanilla   and this very complex stuff  I don’t know whether or not you have views on this     Right  But this is the typical Federal Reserve cautiousness, and I am   pushing you a little harder     There would still be problems     One quick follow-up on that—is one implication that we might take   from this that structured products are just so complicated that they may never get good ratings or   sufficiently good ratings, so the market really has to shrink?  Could the rating agencies just fix   themselves up so that they actually could do decent ratings?  I’m trying to get a feel for this  It   really relates to the issue that Bev raised, which is you want to differentiate between the two    But is there something inherently problematic so that maybe people should just realize that these   structured products are just not such a great thing  Financial engineering can go too far     But they could come back  I think subprime lending will come back   under a different business model     Torture works   January 29–30, 2008 177 of 249   "
8213,2008-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I’m quite depressed  That’s not my   usual personality trait, but the reality is that we’ve had as bad a set of shocks as I could have   imagined, and I want to talk about this set of shocks  We have been hit with things that are making   our policy environment as complicated as I possibly could have imagined  The reality is that we are   in the worst financial crisis that we’ve experienced in the post–World War II era  I don’t think we   should be shy about saying it  We are in a financial crisis, and it is worse than we have experienced   in any other episode of financial “disruption,” which is the word I use  I will not use “financial   crisis” in public  “Financial disruption” is still a good phrase to use in public, but I really do think   that this is a financial crisis  It is surely going to be called that in the next edition of my textbook   PARTICIPANT  When is it coming out?     Wouldn’t you like to know!  I believe that actually the Greenbook forecast   of a mild recession is reasonable, but the possibility that we could have a severe recession is   uncomfortably high, and I find the prospect pretty scary  The reality is that we are in this adverse   feedback loop that I and others talked about  I think we’re deep into it  The credit markets have   been deteriorating  That’s led to a sharp weakening of the economy’s prospects  This is reflected in   the very large change in the Greenbook forecast, with which I do strongly concur, so I don’t think   that it was out of line to put those in  Of course, that weakening has been feeding back to   deteriorating financial conditions  So I think we’re really in a tough pickle, and there are costs not   just in terms of the economy  One result is that we’ve just expanded the safety net to a much wider   set of institutions, and we are in a brave new world here, and it is very disturbing  So the   March 18, 2008 69 of 127    ramifications in terms of the economy weakening and the adverse feedback loop go beyond just the   fact that we might have unemployment  It may have major effects on the way markets work in the   future, and that, I think, is something that we should be worried about and should be a consideration   as well  The bottom line on real activity for me is that the prospects are very poor, and I find the   downside risk just plain scary  That’s the first part of my depression   The second part of the depression is that it’s bad enough that we had these contractionary   aggregate demand shocks from the financial sector, but we also have had very negative supply   shocks that are both contractionary and inflationary  So we are getting hit by the double whammy    The news on inflation has generally not been good, even with the recent CPI numbers  But then, of   course, they are reversed by the PPI numbers today  I don’t put that much weight on the actual   current numbers because, as you know, I take a view that the primary drivers of inflation and   inflation dynamics are inflation expectations and expectations about future output gaps  So that’s   the framework in which I’d like to discuss what will happen on the inflation front   We have two problems in terms of inflation expectations right now  One is the supply   shock, which I think is having some effects on inflation expectations, and also the view—although I   believe it’s incorrect, I do think that there’s a problem that this view is widely held outside, and   President Plosser mentioned this—that we on the FOMC are focused only on growth and are not at   all worried about inflation  This is a communication issue that is hard to deal with because, even   though I’ve been advocating being more aggressive in terms of easing, I do worry very much about   the issue that we also have to indicate that, if necessary, we’ll get out the baseball bat to keep   inflation under control  That is not an easy thing to do  So when I look at inflation expectations,   which I consider to be a key driver of inflation, I think that the evidence in the data is that we have   had not a big increase but a slight increase in inflation expectations, on the order of about 10 basis   March 18, 2008 70 of 127    points  There’s a lot of uncertainty about that; it could be a little more than that, but I don’t think a   whole lot more   Also disturbing is that we certainly have had a big increase in long-run inflation uncertainty    That’s reflected not only in terms of inflation compensation but also in the fact that people are   buying inflation caps, TIPS are becoming very popular, and so forth and so on  In fact, one of the   negative things that happened to me as a result of taking this job is that I had my entire TIAA-CREF   in TIPS and unfortunately I had to divest all of it because they are government securities, and that   turned out to be bad  But that’s only one of the minor costs of being in this position  [Laughter]    The issue here is that, although I don’t think that inflation expectations have gotten unhinged at this   point—and I think that we can say that the phrase “reasonably well contained” is okay—there is a   greater risk that they could get unhinged  Now, I want to be clear  I’m not talking about the 1970s    It’s not “That ’70s Show”  I have not been particularly happy with Allan Meltzer’s comments about   a bunch of things  The issue here is not that inflation expectations would go to that kind of level,   but it could be that inflation expectations go up to 2½ or maybe even a little higher and it would be   costly to get that down  That’s the concern we have to worry about     But let me talk about the other side because, when I think about the inflation dynamics, it’s   not just inflation expectations  I do not believe in the deus ex machina view of the inflation process    Something has to tie things down, and what ties it down is not current output gaps—which is why I   think the standard Phillips curves don’t predict very well—but expectations about future output   gaps  On that score, I worry that there could be a lot of downside risk to inflation from that  If   really bad things happen, which I think unfortunately is a seriously possibility, inflation could fall    A key fact, by the way, is that if you look at past recessions, you do find that inflation falls in the 12   months after recessions  In a couple of cases with supply shocks, there was a rise in inflation at the   March 18, 2008 71 of 127    beginning of the recessions  Seven out of eight are in that category  Particularly if it’s a severe   recession, it’s much more likely for inflation to fall  So it’s not true that there’s just upside risk;   there is downside risk as well, and that’s one reason that inflation uncertainty is not an issue just of   potential upside  In fact, in the 2003 episode that President Lacker mentioned, the reason there was   such a sharp rise in inflation compensation was not that people worried about inflation going up but   that they worried that inflation would go down  Nonetheless, there’s still a cost to the fact that long-  run inflation expectations are not as solidly grounded as they were before  So my view in general is   that we are facing an incredibly unpleasant tradeoff  We basically have the risk of the economy   turning very sharply and the risk of inflation getting somewhat unhinged  I want to discuss that   later   I wasn’t going to discuss this, but I just really can’t not react to the comments that you   made, President Fisher  There’s a view out there in the media that monetary policy has been   ineffective  This was the statement that I think you made, and I think it is just plain wrong  So I   want to discuss it because it’s actually really important in thinking about a policy stance right now,   and it’s important to think about the economics of this  We have had a very nasty set of   contractionary shocks from the financial sector, particularly the widening of credit spreads and the   restriction of credit  So I want us to think about a counterfactual  Let’s think about a situation in   which we had what’s happened and we did not lower interest rates  What would have been the   outcome?  Do you think that credit spreads would have lowered?  I think credit spreads would have   risen  In fact, when you think about what credit spreads are being driven by—I’ve argued this   before—there’s a valuation risk—the fact that we can’t value assets, and that’s this price discovery   problem that we really can’t do that much about  But there is also a macroeconomic risk, which is a   lot of what’s going on right now, particularly in terms of the housing market where people don’t   March 18, 2008 72 of 127    know where housing prices are going to bottom out  The view that they may keep on going   down—and we had a very negative number on housing prices recently—means that even the AAA   tranches now look as though they’re very vulnerable, and therefore, the credit spreads on them go   up a whole lot  My view is that monetary policy has been very effective because things would be   much, much worse if we hadn’t eased  On the other hand, we just had an incredibly nasty set of   shocks as a result of what you described were the problems in these sectors   So I really think that this is very important  To finish up on this, the example of Japan is   constructive because the Bank of Japan had a view very similar to the one that you’ve expressed,   which is that they had all these problems in the banking sector, and the problems were not their   fault  But they then took the view that they couldn’t do anything about it  Monetary policy was not   the source of the weak economy, so they were very slow to lower interest rates  The Chairman has   talked about this  Every monetary economist who went to the Bank of Japan during this period—I   did it when I was with the New York Fed in the mid-1990s—told them that their monetary policy   was too tight  They basically said, “Well, you know, it’s not too tight, and it’s not our fault that the   banks are all screwed up because of poor regulation”  Well, the result was they ended up with   deflation, and they lost ten years of growth  I’m being a little more blunt than usual, but I think that   the economic arguments here are actually central in our discussion     I am done, yes     Yes  I’m not arguing that lowering the federal funds rate narrows these   spreads a whole lot  It certainly works in that direction, but there is a big independent movement   because of both fear in the markets and some liquidity concerns, which is why I think it is very   March 18, 2008 84 of 127    important for us to have both sets of tools  We have tools that can work on the issue of expectations   about monetary policy and stance, but to the extent that we can use other tools, that’s also extremely   helpful  It is not that we think we can solve all the problems, particularly because these shocks are   so large  This is one problem that we are facing, which is that this disruption is really big, big time    So then the question is whether we want to use all the tools at our disposal that we can     I think the issue here relates to the whole question about nongradualism   that we’ve been talking about  Clearly, if we got lucky and financial markets turned around in a   major way, then the stance of monetary policy would need to change, actually very rapidly  This is   March 18, 2008 85 of 127    one of the issues facing us—a communication issue, which is how we indicate to the markets and   the public in a serious way that we really care about keeping inflation under control  I’m not sure   what the answer to that is  It is one of the great challenges that we’re facing at this particular   juncture  Clearly, part of it is that we don’t want interest rates to be particularly low  In fact, the   higher interest rates could be for us, the happier we would be because that would be an indication   that financial conditions had turned around a lot  However, the problem, of course, is that inflation   expectations get unhinged     We’re always going to love you, come on  [Laughter]     PARTICIPANT  We don’t like being unpopular either   PARTICIPANT  Happy birthday!  [Laughter]       You mean Pizza the Hutt, not Jabba the Hutt  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, we are facing a very difficult   policy problem, and that is why, Charlie, we will go have a beer later, so that we can deal with   our depression     Yes, maybe two  Clearly, we are challenged by the fact that we have to   balance the risks of both underlying inflation and inflation expectations going up  Against that,   we have to worry about the downside risks to the economy, and the financial sector could really   go south  So that is really the policy problem that we face   March 18, 2008 104 of 127    I do support alternative A, but I would like to give some perspective on that because I   may have a different take than others on this  If you are thinking about the risk-management   viewpoint that I and some others have talked about, I want to emphasize that lowering the federal   funds rate 75 basis points is not—and I want to repeat, is not—taking out insurance  If you look   at the Greenbook projections, they have 75 basis points, and they have a further decline after   that  The r* has dropped 125 to 150—well, it depends on which model, but quite a bit more than   75  So from an insurance perspective, we should actually be doing more than 75 basis points    But I am not going to argue for that  In fact, I would argue for that if some of the other things,   such as negative supply shocks, hadn’t been happening   I also have a concern about a phenomenon that has occurred, which I don’t fully   understand  Normally I would not worry about dollar depreciation  I gave a speech recently on   pass-through—it was an opportunity for me to interact with Nathan’s staff and to read the   literature—and the evidence is that there is just not a whole lot in terms of pass-through  But   lately we have seen something that is very peculiar, which is that, every time we have had   depreciation in the dollar, the oil price has gone up  That makes me much more nervous about   dollar depreciation than I would usually be  I hope that it may be just coincidence, but it makes   me a little more nervous   Another problem that we face is that we have not convinced the markets that we will be   willing to bring out the baseball bat if inflation starts to get out of control  That is really a key   part of the risk-management approach, and a key part of—I think Vince Reinhart called it post-  gradualism in his speech  He gave a very interesting speech the other day and called it post-  gradualism  But we have not yet convinced people about it, and part of the problem is that we   really haven’t operated in that way in the past  This is one reason that it is worthwhile talking   March 18, 2008 105 of 127    about this and saying that we need to think about operating in a different way  But it suggests to   me that, if we actually were more aggressive than 75 basis points, it could have very negative   reactions in the markets about our commitment to controlling inflation  So, that is one of the   reasons that I strongly support the Chairman’s proposal  I should say, by the way, that even so,   the 75 basis point cut, which I don’t think takes out enough insurance, does pose some risk that   long-run inflation expectations will rise  But we have to realize that there is a lot of risk of really   bad things happening that could mean that things really get out of control  The discomfort is that   we now have a tough tradeoff  But then, when I think about the tradeoff, I am willing to say that   we have to take the risk because otherwise the consequences could be very problematic   I should mention that I have one concern about the wording in the statement  I usually   don’t make comments about the wording because I am just not subtle enough to get that  But I   did worry a bit, for exactly the reason that Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned, about the issue   that talking about inflation expectations getting unhinged could be actually very dangerous  The   first sentence in alternative A says, “Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation   expectations have risen”  Well, I worry about that  First of all, the evidence is not completely   clear on that  It is true that there has been an increase, and I have said it is about 10 basis points    But there is other research, and there is a lot of uncertainty about these measures  I am   wondering, if we put that in, whether it will actually cause a problem in terms of market reaction    So it worries me a little  I would probably be more comfortable with what we have in   alternative C, which is that inflation has been elevated and then the reasons for upward pressure    I am not sure that this would be helpful  I don’t feel super strongly about it, but the comments of   Vice Chairman Geithner made me a bit more worried about it than I otherwise would have been     May I just ask a question back?  I do think that inflation expectations   are a concern  It is just a question of how the markets—and I am not as good at this as the   people who really follow the markets—and the press will react to this phrase because I think that   the amount of movement here is still very small  You know, the kinds of numbers we are talking   about for inflation expectations are on the order of 10 to 20 basis points  Will this mention,   because it is new, raise a flag that will get more attention and more concern than, in fact, is   justified?  That is the tricky problem here  We should acknowledge it, but again, I am not good   enough at wordsmithing to figure out how to do that  This is a bit of my concern here  I don’t   know if anybody has any thoughts about how to handle it     We could use my “smidgen” word, but “edged higher” is better       “Have risen somewhat”?   March 18, 2008 109 of 127      “Slightly” or “somewhat” risen  "
8240,2008-04-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My modal forecast is for a mild recession in   the first half of 2008 and is very much in line with the Greenbook forecast  I am more   pessimistic, however, than the Greenbook on the issue of recovery  Again, the issue is that we   have had a major disruption to our financial markets and there is a mess, and I think it is going to   take a long time to clean up the mess  The parallel that President Stern made to the episode in   April 29–30, 2008 84 of 266    the early ’90s is very apt  I suspect that there will be substantial headwinds coming from the   problems in the financial sector for quite a while, and that means that the recovery we would see   would be more L-shaped than V-shaped   When I look at where I was at the last FOMC meeting, there has really been a big change   for me  I re-read the transcripts, because you always want to see what things sounded like, and I   sounded so depressed then, as though I might take out a gun and blow my head off  That is the   way it read  But my sunny, optimistic disposition is coming back  [Laughter]  I think it is very   possible that we will look back and say, particularly after the Bear Stearns episode, that we have   turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced  I should   mention, however, that it doesn’t mean that we should be complacent  I am not sure that is the   case  We have been disappointed before  But I think there is a very strong possibility that the   worst is over  You can see this in that there is less concern about credit risks in financial   institutions  That is because we had a major institution get into trouble, but because of our   actions, it didn’t blow up the world  There is an issue, of course, of potential cost and moral   hazard going forward, but I think it has had the effect of calming down the markets in a very   substantial way     Very important in this regard is that we are seeing that our large financial institutions are   able to raise capital now at not too high a cost  In fact, they are doing so in a major way  When   we think about the long-term solution to the problems in the financial markets, cleaning up the   mess and raising capital is going to be absolutely critical, particularly because in the long run the   securitization market will come back  But it is going to very much involve the large financial   institutions, which will have to solve the agency problems that were not solved in this recent   bout of securitization, which created all of the problems  So their having enough capital is   April 29–30, 2008 85 of 266    critical  I think it is very possible that we are on the path to their sorting out their problems,   which in the long run will help sort out the problems in the credit markets   I should mention, by the way, that I still don’t want us to be complacent about this   because things could go in the other direction  There is still the puzzle about what is going on in   the money markets  In particular, we see these very large and actually widening spreads between   LIBOR and OIS  So even though I am starting to become optimistic, I don’t want to be   Panglossian in my view  From my perspective the key issue is that, although my modal forecast   hasn’t changed much from March, I see that the tail risks have decreased substantially, and I   think that the probability that we will have a severe adverse feedback loop, which really scared   me just a little while ago, is going to be much lower  I still see some downside risks    Particularly, I am concerned about the issue of housing prices  They could fall more than we and   the Greenbook expect, and that could trigger some problems  But I do think that the downside   risk is much, much lower  Another thing I should mention is that I think there is very high   uncertainty right now  So I could get depressed again, but we will have to see  I hope not   On the inflation front, I see that long-run inflation expectations are still reasonably well   anchored around 2 percent  The information in the financial markets on this score is that there   has not been a big blowout in that case  There have been problems regarding some of the   surveys, but I am a little less worried about the surveys in terms of households  I am very   skeptical of them because they tend to react very much to current conditions  Also, if you ask   people what TV shows they are watching, they will tell you that they are watching PBS and   something classy, but you know they are watching “Desperate Housewives”  [Laughter]     But I do have a concern about the risk to inflation expectations because   of the high commodity prices that we see  This is coming from the very adverse supply shock   and the fact that we have had headline inflation so high for so long  The good news, by the way,   is that it is actually quite remarkable, given how high headline inflation has been, how anchored   inflation expectations have been  I think that has to do with confidence in this institution’s doing   the right thing  It is very important that we retain that confidence  We have to think about that   when we decide what we are going to do regarding policy   About where I think inflation is going to be—I have been a 2 percent guy for a long time    I am not changing that  I think that inflation expectations are around 2 percent and that there is   no expectation that we will have excess demand in the economy  If anything, it is the opposite of   that  I see the risks as balanced—there are some risks on the upside, particularly because of what   is happening with commodity prices  On the other hand, there are risks on the downside because   of the expected slack and because there is some downside risk in the economy  So on that   ground, I basically have the same story that I had before  Thank you      Is yours on this point?      Then why don’t you take my slot, and I’ll come in after     Just to ask Bill a question—first the tall Bill, but the shorter Bill can   answer afterward  [Laughter]  On alternative B, you indicated that this would be very much in   line with market expectations and, therefore, shouldn’t have much impact  I was wondering   about the statement aspect, in particular the assessment-of-risk part, because this is not just   saying that we are doing 25 basis points; it is also saying that we are now in a different mode of   operation regarding the cycle  So where do you think the markets are concerning where the   statement would be in this regard?   April 29–30, 2008 103 of 266      Okay  Good  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I’m in a very uncomfortable position   here because I usually like to be very decisive, and I think in all past cases I’ve had a strong view   before going into the meeting in terms of what is the appropriate alternative that the Committee   should take, at least that I should take  I’m in a very uncomfortable position because I’m actually   sitting exactly on the fence between alternative B and alternative C  As you know, sitting on the   fence and having a fence right in that anatomically uncomfortable position is not a good place to be    [Laughter]  So let me go through the current situation and argue why I’m in this uncomfortable   position   The first point to make is that inflation expectations are actually reasonably well contained    It is true that I have a concern that high headline inflation could make containing inflation   expectations and preserving the nominal anchor more difficult  But it is important to note that we   have been in a situation in which we’ve had very high headline inflation and, in fact, core inflation   and inflation expectations have behaved very well  So it’s very important to emphasize that this is   not the 1970s, and I really get disturbed when people point to that as a problem  We do have to   worry about inflation expectations possibly going up, but it’s not a situation that, if we make a   April 29–30, 2008 130 of 266    mistake, they go up a whole lot  They could go up, and it might be costly to get them down, but it   would not be a disaster   The second issue is that, although we may have turned the corner, we are still in a situation   of very fragile financial markets, and we have been disappointed before  I am getting more   optimistic  I’m hopeful and think it’s very possible that we’ll look back at the middle of March and   say that was the worst of it  But there is a possibility, and it’s not a small possibility, that things   could go south again, and that would argue for the need for aggressive cuts in the future   The third thing that I point out about the situation is that the modal forecast given by the   Greenbook—and consistent with my modal forecast and with the modal forecasts of most of the   participants—suggests that we may have to cut a bit further in the future  So the problem is that,   given the conditions that we face, we need a lot of flexibility to deal with potential downside risks  I   think the downside risks have diminished, but they could go back up again  So there could be a   situation in which we need to ease aggressively in the future  Of course, we’ve convinced the   markets that we are non-gradualists, but so far we’ve been non-gradualists in only one direction,   which is to ease  In fact, we’d like to be in a situation where we could aggressively ease in the   future if we had to but not risk having inflation expectations go up  That’s a very serious problem   that many participants have pointed out   So how would I like the markets to perceive us?  Well, I’d like the markets to perceive us as   being willing to be very aggressive in terms of easing, if necessary; but I’d also like them to   perceive us as having the Volcker characteristics of being six feet, six inches, tall and having a big   baseball bat and, if inflation and inflation expectations are starting to unhinge, being willing to take   out the baseball bat and do whatever is necessary  You really would like to position yourself to   have those characteristics     April 29–30, 2008 131 of 266    So let me first talk about the case for alternative C of not changing and then go to the case   for alternative B  In the case for C, the advantage of pausing at this point is that it would actually   indicate to the markets by our actions that we’re serious about keeping inflation under control and   that it’s more likely that we would bring out the baseball bat  In that sense, it could enhance   credibility, and a very important, positive element of that is that it would be easier for us to be   flexibly aggressive if we needed to be so in the future  That is one reason that I think there is a   strong case for alternative C  But I also think there is a strong case for B  First, the evidence that   inflation expectations are unhinged or are likely to get unhinged is not very strong  I do not put a lot   of stock in consumer surveys  But I tend to look at financial markets as being the canary in the coal   mine  Though being a New Yorker, I actually have been in a coal mine [laughter] – at the Museum   of Science and Industry in Chicago  It’s really cool  All of you should go there someday when you   go visit Charlie      I have seen a canary  But the key is that the canary has not keeled over    In fact, if you look at what’s going on in the financial markets, the concerns in terms of inflation   compensation have dissipated somewhat  I think the fact that they were moving up is an indication   of greater inflation risk  They’ve come back down again  I don’t think that should make us   complacent, but I do think it tells us that we haven’t seen anything really bad happen at this stage   So the question is why we should cut now and go with alternative B rather than C  Well,   first, I think the modal forecast suggested that a cut is in line with optimal monetary policy, and I   think that’s an important argument  It is particularly so because there is a very strong likelihood   that, even though I’m a little more confident that the recession that we’re probably in now will be   very mild, if it’s even a recession at all—I think it is likely that we’re in a recession but a mild   April 29–30, 2008 132 of 266    one—the recovery actually is going to have a lot of the characteristics of the recovery that we had in   the 1990s because it’s just going to take a long time to clean up this mess  That again argues for a   cut  The other issue that I think is important is that there is a very long period between now and the   next FOMC meeting  Given that the modal forecasts indicate that things are likely to get worse in   the economy in this quarter, there is an issue that, if we get bad news, then we might regret not   having cut now, and I’m not a big fan of intermeeting cuts  That would be another argument for   cutting now   I guess the bottom line is that I’m just in a very uncomfortable position in that I dislike   being not very decisive here  One thing that has helped me a lot in being comfortable with   alternative B is that the language has changed quite significantly from the initial wording  I was not   happy with the idea that, if we suggest that there will be a pause in the future, it would be time   dependent  It should be clearly data-dependent  If it were time-dependent, we would get into   exactly the problem that Charlie Evans talked about  We want the flexibility of saying that what   we’re doing is dependent on data, not time, because if people know that you’re going to reverse   things later on, it doesn’t have the impact  I think that is an important change here  So I’m quite   comfortable with the language of alternative B  I’m willing to support B  It looks as though that is   the consensus, and my view today is that I’m going to go with whatever the consensus is  Thank   you very much     I’d like to understand this issue in terms of the voluntary targets  How are   they deciding on these?  Clearly a big part of the issue is whether or not they choose you  I was just   completely confused about what their considerations in choosing these numbers would be and what   April 29–30, 2008 158 of 266    implications that would have  Now, there is experience for that one case  I’m sure you have views   on this, but it’s sort of the black box in this proposal, and it’s a really important part of it   The second question regards the corridor approach  I do not think it is a good model for us   because the countries that use it have very few banks  The issue of using the central bank as a   financial intermediary is less of a problem for them because there are fewer guys that they have to   look at, and we have to look at a zillion people  But is it true that they have high volatility?  I’m not   sure  I just would like to know the facts, but as I say, I don’t think it’s critical  I don’t think the   experience there, even if it worked well, really does tell us that we should do something here     It is five or six banks, right     The Bank of England has used a procedure like this  What has been their   experience?  Again, it may not be completely comparable     So let’s say that actually happened, that they were zero  Then what?  Let’s   say we implemented this and they came out at zero  What are our options?     Right, and that would be the answer   April 29–30, 2008 160 of 266      Right  You could raise the cost of daylight overdrafts, or you could adjust   the interest rate that you pay on reserves to get it right  That could solve the problem     But in the context of the law, we would have the ability to adjust these   parameters     Okay  Thank you     I am very comfortable with the analysis and the approach, so I don’t   have any major comments there  Although in the white paper you might mention them, I would   like to take options 1 and 3 off the table  Option 1 has just too much administrative burden  We   have enough tsuris already  Although option 3 may work well in countries with very different   structures of the banking system, I don’t think it is a feasible alternative for us  So I think that   we should look at options 2 and 5, and I am certainly comfortable with another look at option 4   One issue that I worry about a bit is that these markets do sort out some interbank credit   risk issues  We don’t want to lose that, so we have to be very aware of it  I also worry a bit   about setting a price when there is a credit risk element to it  When there is no credit risk   April 29–30, 2008 187 of 266    element—if you want to set the Treasury bill rate—it is no big deal  But there may be an issue   there, I am not sure, and it should be one of the considerations in this context  Thank you  "
8264,2008-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, we have seen recent data that actually   have been stronger than expected  Also as time goes on, there seems to be a lower probability of   financial meltdown and these adverse feedback loops that we’ve all been discussing  But I don’t   June 24–25, 2008 86 of 253    think we want to become too sanguine about the current data because some very negative things are   going on that might tell us that this is just very temporary stuff  In particular, it’s really remarkable   how weak consumer sentiment is  There is also a huge hit from energy prices, and it’s going to get   worse  One thing in the Greenbook is that the very low margins that we’ve had in refining are   going to increase, so we’re going to see gasoline prices that are well over $500 a gallon, according   to the kind of numbers you’re coming out with, and that is going to be a major contractionary hit to   household spending  Luckily I don’t drive much anymore—I’m down to less than 600 miles a year   right now—so maybe that is okay, but unfortunately I’ll get back to driving more in the future     In any case, I do think that what the Greenbook has done is reasonable in terms of changing   the forecast  They have a stronger first half, but the longer-run forecast, particularly regarding the   output gap, is really not very different, and I think that’s a reasonable forecast  My baseline is   somewhat less optimistic because I feel that the “delayed credit recovery” alternative scenario was   actually a nice one to put in this Greenbook, and I was glad to see it because it is very close to the   way I am thinking about the situation right now  I think there’s going to be a much slower recovery   of financial markets than was in the Greenbook baseline because two things have to occur for us to   get back to normal underwriting  This, of course, doesn’t mean what we had before, which did not   have serious enough underwriting standards, but something we think is realistic given the kinds of   risks in the economy  Financial institutions have to have enough capital just to make loans—so   there’s the direct effect that we think about  But also the securitization market is clearly very   impaired  Eventually it will come back, but it will need new business models to solve the agency   issues that have led to all of the heartache that we’ve seen recently  When I think about how that is   going to happen, I think the large financial institutions have to play a key role because you need   somebody who will originate these loans and then will have the incentives to make sure that the   June 24–25, 2008 87 of 253    agency problems are not severe  Only when that’s done can they be sold off, and that requires that   there is recourse, which requires that they have plenty of capital  Of course, it is a very slow   process for them to build up capital in the current environment  So given that situation, I think the   idea that the financial markets will be back to normal over the next year or two is a little optimistic    It’s going to take a long time for this to get worked out  So the bottom-line scenario is one in which   we’re going to have strong headwinds for quite a time, and that’s going to be important in terms of   our monetary policy stance   When I think about inflation, as you know, I put a lot of emphasis on long-run inflation   expectations and on expectations about future economic slack in the economy  At this point, I do   not see a major change and deterioration in long-run inflation expectations  I’ll explain that in a   second  I should emphasize that I say that is true so far  But an issue is whether that will change,   and that’s going to be very important in terms of how we manage monetary policy  The first things   I look at when I think about long-run inflation expectations are, of course, the surveys of consumers    As you know, I’ve always been a little skeptical of them, but I think that my views are very similar   to the ones that President Yellen mentioned  I have a slightly different explanation using behavioral   economics  Behavioral economics tells you that surveys will rise a lot with what happens currently   and overreact and that’s exactly what should happen because it’s a framing issue  You see very   high headline inflation  You’re going to raise expectations of inflation one year out  But it’s very   natural that you’re going to raise them for the longer term, and they’ll come back down when   headline inflation comes down  So I really am not as concerned about the survey expectations   being a long-run problem as long as inflation comes back down  I think there are good indications   that it will, given that headline is so much higher than core and that core has actually stayed very   stable   June 24–25, 2008 88 of 253    The other things that I look at, and look at much more seriously, are the Surveys of   Professional Forecasters (which have basically moved up a bit but not very much and have not   gotten much out of the range in which they have been in the past) and then information from   financial markets, that is, inflation compensation  Again, that has not risen recently, and actually   it’s better than it was at its peak  So I don’t see a huge problem there  What this tells me about the   inflation forecast is—you know, I’m a 2 percent kind of guy on PCE, and I’m still a 2 percent   guy—that even though headline inflation is very elevated, we’re going to see over the forecast   period that inflation will come back down to around the 2 percent level both on the headline and on   the core  However, though my baseline on this is that inflation will return to a level that, by the   way, I am comfortable with as an inflation objective, I do very much worry that inflation   expectations could be more fragile in the current environment  So it’s not that I think we have to do   something now  But we do have to be extremely vigilant to see whether inflation expectations are   actually starting to move in an undesirable direction, and if so, we will have to take action  The   challenge may be that we have to take action when unemployment is still rising, but what is key is   that we have to be aware of that  My modal forecast is that it isn’t going to happen, but I think we   have to be ready to deal with it and deal with it quickly  As you  know, I’m not a believer in   gradualism in circumstances such as we are in currently, and I think this applies to dealing not only   with financial disruptions but also currently with inflation expectations  We have to be willing to   move very quickly in that context   Let me turn to the issue of long-term projections  You will not be very surprised to know   that, in fact, I’m a supporter of this  This Committee has actually been well served  Even though it   is not my normal personality—as you know, I like to move fast on things—we have moved in an   evolutionary process in terms of communications, and I think that has worked quite well for us    June 24–25, 2008 89 of 253    This is just an obvious next step  Our communication strategy in terms of the long-run projections   now has an important flaw in that we are not providing the information that we intended to provide,   and it needs a fix  We now realize that that’s the case  It’s particularly relevant concerning   information about potential output growth and the NAIRU  I do share the concerns that President   Lacker mentioned on these, and I have talked about this in many speeches  I think this can be   handled by speeches—in particular, by the Chairman emphasizing these issues going forward  So I   don’t see it as a huge problem, but it is something that we have to deal with   In any case, we need to clarify what our projections mean  We’re not providing information   that we should  We have to fix it, and there’s no reason not to  I think it’s a minor change  I do not   think that there will be much reaction by the markets or in the political sphere on this  I agree   completely with Governor Kohn that, relative to the other problems that we are dealing with, this is   very small potatoes; but I think it is good to show that we’re still sticking to the basic things that we   need to stick to and that, in this very complex environment, we can do the things that need to be   done on communication strategy  That argues that we should be doing this and even doing it right   now  Regarding the issues that you raised about going more to the full Monty on this kind of stuff, I   do agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that now is not the time to do that  I should mention that I   will be giving a speech in which I will be advocating going to an explicit inflation objective, but   that’s because I’m leaving the Board, and I have to say what I think  But there’s an issue in terms of   what this Committee should be doing, and I am sympathetic to Vice Chairman Geithner’s view that   this is not what we should be doing for the Committee right now  On the other hand, I’m a free   individual now  In going back to be a civilian, I can say what I want   In terms of my preferences, I really don’t feel strongly  There are a lot of issues here  When   I first thought about it, I preferred an option like 3 because I didn’t want to give the impression that   June 24–25, 2008 90 of 253    we’re great at forecasting five years out, and I think that’s really the strongest argument for it  But I   do understand how we articulate that is a little tricky, and I think that’s something that we have to   think about  It might be clearer to do something along the lines that President Bullard discussed, as   arguing it that way, but maybe we can do it in some other way  I think that’s exactly why the staff   can have some extra work for themselves to think about the best way to describe this, but I think   something along the lines of providing information that we actually are putting in our projections   right now, where we have a little section that says, “What are your long-term assumptions?” and we   put them down  Somehow we need to convey that information to the public  Then the question is,   What’s the best way to do that?  You can have all the wonderful arguments that we have over the   statement each period  We’ll get something like that going, and I think we’ll figure it out  Thank   you     Just a quick question  When you do this based on the Greenbook   projection for headline inflation, how far forward are you going with headline inflation?     Four quarters ahead     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I do support alternative B and the current   language in the statement  I have no problem with that  I think it conveys what we need to   convey  Although I think that the next move is very likely to be up and it maybe should be done   quite soon, I would argue that we still need to have a lot of flexibility and to think in terms of   having a lot of flexibility in where we may have to head in the future  I want to argue along   those lines and outline why I think that is the case   June 24–25, 2008 128 of 253    The first issue is something that the Chairman mentioned yesterday, about which I felt   very strongly—in fact, I meant to say it, but as always the Chairman says things better than I   could in this context—that there really is still a very serious possibility that the shoe could drop   in the financial markets  The Chairman mentioned a set of institutions that we have to be   concerned about, and although there has been some improvement in terms of the stress that the   financial markets are under, I don’t think we are out of the woods yet  We are likely to be, but   we have to be ready to recognize that things could go south  So that’s one issue  The second   issue is that the recent positive data we have seen are, again, very tenuous to me  I’m hoping that   they indicate that things are going in the right direction  But a bunch of things make me very   nervous, which I mentioned yesterday—how consumers react in housing crises, consumer   sentiment, and the big problem that is going to occur when people have to face very high prices   of food and energy, which hit their pocketbook very directly  So, again, that could be quite   contractionary  The good news that we have seen recently might reverse very quickly  The third   issue is that I think the headwinds could be very substantial in the future, that this cleanup will   take a long time, and in that case we could have very slow and subpar growth that could widen   output gaps more than the Greenbook and most participants here are expecting    So I do not consider the current stance of monetary policy to be overly stimulative  For   me it is just about right and very much along the lines of what I think would be optimal policy    Of course, my view relates not only to the real economy  I also think that inflation expectations,   as far as I can tell so far, are reasonably well contained  There is very little movement in the   measures of inflation expectations that I pay most attention to  That argues that our stance is   about right  I would also very strongly argue that I do not think that we have taken out a lot of   insurance  I have argued that before  We have moved less gradually, which I think is very   June 24–25, 2008 129 of 253    beneficial, and I would commend the Committee in that regard  But we moved in line with what   the forecasts have been telling us optimal policy would be, and I think that is quite important   However, here is why I think we need to have flexibility in the other direction  If you   think about a risk-management approach, it should not be focused just on tail risk to economic   growth, which has been our most major concern because of the financial disruption  It equally   implies that, symmetrically, we should be just as worried about tail risk to inflation, particularly   to long-run inflation expectations, which I think are the key driver of underlying inflation, which   is what monetary policy can particularly deal with  Here we have a situation in which we have   hit the perfect storm of shocks because of the huge supply shock and there are much more   serious upside risks and tail risks in terms of long-run inflation expectations  So I really do   worry that with long-run inflation expectations and, therefore, underlying inflation we are in a   more fragile situation and that we have to be very cognizant of that in terms of what we do in the   future   The bottom line is that we may have to move very quickly to raise rates if any of several   things happens  One is that headwinds are not as serious as I think they are likely to be  There is   certainly a very serious possibility that things could be better than I expect  I would not be   unhappy, so I would not get depressed, about that  Really more depressing would be if inflation   expectations started to look as though they were getting more unanchored  Particularly, I would   worry much more about what happens in terms of inflation compensation and the Survey of   Professional Forecasters, paying some attention to consumer surveys but putting a lot less weight   on them  If the canary starts to look as though it is keeling over, we have to move very quickly,   and so I am going to watch that canary very, very carefully     Before the python gets it  I think another consideration is very   important  I have to commend you on the Bluebook this time—it just had some great boxes    [Laughter]  It would be nicer if they had a little color to them  As a textbook author, I think they   could have been a little ritzier and have had a little color, but they were great boxes  In   particular, a very important box was the one on the optimal reaction to oil price shocks  One   thing that comes out very strongly from that box is that if your credibility is weak on   commitment to price stability and containing inflation expectations, you would have to tighten   more to restore that credibility and get to a policy that would produce better outcomes  So here   is an issue that, with these supply shocks potentially causing a problem for long-run inflation   expectations, we actually may have to react more quickly and more aggressively than we   otherwise would  This is an issue that I have been concerned about in terms of communication   strategy—about how we better anchor long-run inflation expectations   So my bottom line is that I support alternative B  I would like to keep the language the   way it is currently, which I think works quite well  But I do think that, going forward, we should   not lock ourselves into what our policy is going to be, in either direction  We need to preserve   flexibility because we could be very surprised, although I think that the signal we have made that   we are more concerned about inflation risks is absolutely appropriate  We have to make clear   that we will do whatever it takes, including raising interest rates when unemployment is rising, if   we feel that long-run inflation expectations and inflation are not remaining under control     And it will come out in the minutes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also strongly support the short-term   strategy that was laid out by the Chairman  I don’t see that we really have an alternative in that   context  There are a lot of issues here  The reality is that this is super complex, and we have a   lot of work over the next year to be ready for the next Administration, when all these issues are   going to become extremely relevant   In general terms, regarding the long-term issues, although we got here under exigent   circumstances, in a financial disruption, we might have gotten here anyway  The reality is that   there was a fundamental change in the way the financial system works  When banks are not so   dominant, the distinction between investment banks and commercial banks in terms of the way   the financial system works is really much less  It would be nice to think that we could limit the   June 24–25, 2008 189 of 253    kinds of lending facilities that we have so that we didn’t have to worry about regulating or   supervising other institutions, but I don’t think that is realistic  The nature of the changes in the   financial system means that we extended the government safety net but it probably would have   been extended anyway  It was just unfortunate that it had to happen in such a crisis atmosphere    So I think we have to think very hard about the issue of limiting moral hazard in terms of a much   wider range of institutions   I am very sympathetic to the issues that President Stern raised, which is that we have to   think about the kind of things that we have thought about more in terms of the banking industry    How do we actually set things up so that it is easier for firms to fail and not be systemic?  There   are a smaller number of firms that we actually have to supervise and regulate, and the reality is   that we have to think very hard about how we’re going to extend regulation and supervision to a   wider range of firms  We just can’t escape that  It would be nice to say that we could limit it,   but we are not going to be able to limit it except to the extent that we can think about some of   these issues  But it is going to be a huge issue going forward, and we really have to be ready to   deal with the political process   The way we are proceeding makes a lot of sense  It is not committing us in a way that   creates a problem, but we have to be ready when this issue is dealt with  It will be one of the   hottest issues that the next Administration and the next Congress will have to deal with  We   have to be really on point and to have positions very carefully thought out, not just by the Board   but by the entire FOMC and the entire System, so that we can have a unified position to make   sure that crazy stuff doesn’t happen and that sensible stuff does  Thank you  "
8289,2008-07-24,"  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the basic point that it’s very   important to recognize that we do not want a lot of these facilities to be permanent and that at some   point we will need to remove them  I do worry about the issue of creating the kind of moral hazard   from an idiosyncratic viewpoint, and that’s very different  There are two aspects to moral hazard    July 24, 2008 41 of 50    One is moral hazard that is created by providing a backstop when there’s a systemic problem  But   you expand this tremendously if you have a backstop for an idiosyncratic episode or for   idiosyncratic episodes for individual institutions  So we have to think very seriously about the   temporary nature of many of these measures     On the other hand, I just don’t see the stress dissipating  I’m getting ready to go back to   academia, and it’s going to be a much quieter life for me  I really am extremely nervous about the   current situation  We’ve been in this now for a year; but boy, this is deviating from most financial   disruptions or crisis episodes in terms of the length and the fact that it really hasn’t gotten better    We keep on having shoes dropping  So although there’s an issue that we’re going to need to get out   of many of these facilities, the reality is that we’re in this, and I’m not anticipating that this is going   to go away quickly  I hope that it will  I just don’t understand the argument that actually thinking   of more ways to be on top of this and being creative about it will indicate that we want to do   something permanent  I just don’t see that   I am also a bit puzzled by the objection to these options  I think that they worked quite well   during the Y2K episode  I think they are more targeted  I don’t think they are a major deal  On the   other hand, I just don’t see where the problems are  I do recognize that there is a lot of work that we   have to do to basically make sure that we’re managing credit risks better, particularly with an   extension of the maturity of the TAF loans, but I do not think that this is a situation in which we can   just sit back and get everything perfect before we put in these facilities   So there are a lot of issues here  Maybe just because I’m having a bit more trouble sleeping   at night, I am supportive of going in this direction  I think that we have to keep on pushing, and I   don’t think that this in any way encumbers us or hinders us from removing these when we need to   July 24, 2008 42 of 50    do so  I hope that happens soon, but I think the reality is that we’re still in very difficult times    Thank you  "
8313,2008-08-05,"  I think there’s no question that headline inflation is very high right now    Clearly, when you get these kinds of increases in energy prices and food costs, you’re going to have   to reflect them in current prices  In fact, that’s exactly what you need to have happen so that relative   prices shift  The reality is that high oil prices have to mean that real wages fall  People have to   conserve and not drive as much and so forth  So this is a normal process, and monetary policy does   not control these relative price shifts  What I think is more critical is that, although there are some   problems in terms of core, the effect has actually been quite limited given the incredible rise in   energy prices  While it’s important to think about headline in the long run, the information from   core is very useful in terms of thinking about policy because it tells you whether this is spilling over   into underlying inflation     One of my concerns about going to anecdotal information and why I think we need to use an   analytic framework in thinking about what is really driving the inflation process is that we do need   to focus on the longer-run because that’s what monetary policy can control  I get a bit nervous   about these anecdotal concerns, which I think can tell us something about headline  Then we have   to ask what they tell us about the longer-run context but not put too much weight on them  That’s   one reason that I think some of the analytic frameworks that we’ve developed here are very useful   for thinking about these things  Thank you   August 5, 2008 48 of 145      Well, I get one more chance in the policy round  That is the one I am   going to really go for  I am sure that people are waiting for it  [Laughter]  My modal forecast   has not changed appreciably  Clearly, I am very concerned about the headwinds as a result of   the difficulty in recapitalizing financial institutions, which Governor Warsh talked a lot about    As a result, I think that we are going to have subpotential growth for quite a period of time   However, the bigger concern is that I see downside risks as having risen substantially  So   let me first talk about the things that are the less worrisome downside risks  I think there are   increased downside risks just on the real side of the economy  In particular, the consumer has   been very resilient, but I am not as sure that that will be true in the future  We just saw terrible   auto sales  It could be just one month, and it could bounce back up  But it could be a precursor   to much bigger problems, which would not be completely surprising given some of the other   things going on with housing prices and credit restrictions  That is one downside risk  The   second is that European growth may have shifted down, and so the kind of problems that we are   August 5, 2008 89 of 145    experiencing here perhaps are being experienced there, particularly in terms of lower housing   prices in some parts of the euro zone  That could mean less demand for our exports, and it   would be another negative for economic activity  The third is that we have actually seen a   backup in mortgage rates, and that can have a direct effect on housing demand  It is pretty grim   when you look at what is going on in terms of housing starts, but it could get worse  It can’t go   below zero, but it could get worse   So if that were all there was, I would say that there may be a little increase in downside   risk, but it wouldn’t frighten me  But I really am very worried about the potential downside risks   in the financial sector  I have to disagree very strenuously with the view that, because you have   been in a “financial stress” situation for a period of time, there is no potential for systemic risk    In fact, I would argue that the opposite can be the case  Just as a reminder, remember that in the   Great Depression, when—I can’t use the expression because it would be in the transcripts, but   you know what I’m thinking—something hit the fan, [laughter] it actually occurred close to a   year after the initial negative shock  In this particular environment, we have to think about   where we started  We were very lucky that this financial disruption occurred when bank balance   sheets actually were in very good shape initially  You know, thank our lucky stars that it   happened at that point     We are now a year into this  Bank balance sheets do not look very good, for all the   reasons that we have been discussing  In fact, they look pretty grim  We have had some failures,   and we are concerned about other failures  So we have a very different environment  In that   situation, if a shoe drops—and we have had big shoes dropping; we had Bear Stearns, we had the   GSEs, and we had smaller cases like IndyMac—and if financial systems are in a very weakened   state, really bad things could happen  I think that there really is a serious danger here  In   August 5, 2008 90 of 145    particular, we could have a dynamic through a decline in demand for housing because of the   backup in mortgage rates or other reasons lowering housing prices and that spilling over into the   financial system in terms of raising credit spreads, which then lowers demand, and we could get   a nasty, vicious spiral  It is exactly one of these adverse feedback loops that we are all concerned   about  So this is not off the table, and it very much worries me  I will talk about the implications   of that for policy later   On the inflation front, although I definitely see upside risks, I think they may have   diminished just a smidgen  There is a question about how large those upside risks are  In terms   of my thinking about what drives the inflation process, it is expectations about future output gaps   and expectations about inflation over a long period, not a short-term period  I see absolutely no   evidence that, in the last couple of months, we have had deterioration in long-term inflation   expectations  If anything, they have gotten a little better since March  If you look at the   numbers—and Bill had it in his picture—basically there was some ratcheting up when the crisis   first hit  I would argue a lot of that had to do with inflation risk, because there really was   increasing inflation risk  There has been a slight movement up—maybe a tenth, maybe you   could say two-tenths—in expectations when you look at forecasters     I am very skeptical of consumer surveys because, exactly what behavioral economics   tells us, there is framing  If headline inflation is high, short-term inflation expectations go up,   which should happen, but long-term inflation expectations also go up  When headline goes   down, then they will come down  There was a nice little article from the San Francisco Fed in   one of those little letter deals on exactly this issue, which came up with exactly this conclusion  I   recommend that you read it; and the good news is that it takes only four minutes to read because   the articles are meant to be very short  So I really do not see that there has been deterioration,   August 5, 2008 91 of 145    and—I think that this is very important—it is why I stressed the issue of the analytic framework   for thinking about the inflation process and what monetary policy can do  We can’t control   relative prices, but we can do something about long-run inflation expectations and expectations   about future output gaps   So I haven’t seen a problem lately that there has been deterioration in long-run   expectations  What about output gaps?  Well, if anything, they look as though they are expected   to widen maybe a smidgen, not that much  We don’t have any indication to expect that we will   be overshooting in terms of having output greater than potential  Again, that should not be   raising inflation  It should, if anything, maybe lower it a bit  Finally, of course, oil prices are   lower  I don’t think that means that they will stay low because the volatility is huge; but at least   the fear that they are going to keep on going up and up and up—so it would not be a one-shot   change but would be put into long-run inflation—has, I think, diminished somewhat   So where do I stand in terms of the upside risk?  There still is upside risk because having   high headline inflation does have the potential to spill over into inflation expectations  All of us   have that concern  But I want to emphasize very strongly that it has not happened yet; I think   that is very important  I also think it is very important to monitor this  One concern that   members of the Committee have is that we wouldn’t react fast enough because we have   sometimes been inertial in the past  That is a serious concern  But I think there is a strong   argument that, when you have very big downside risks to economic activity, you want to deal   with inflation expectations when they actually indicate that there is some problem  And I just do   not see that at this juncture  Thank you very much     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just let me talk a little about monetary policy,   and I’ll be brief there  But then I have to use my opportunity to raise some issues for the Committee   when I’m not here  I do support alternative B  As is obvious from my earlier discussion, I believe   that the risks are balanced  I have one modification to Janet’s language because I think it is just   simpler to say that “the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of concern to the   Committee”  I don’t see the need for “both,” but we’re actually on the same wavelength in terms of   this issue   What I’d like to spend some time on—because I feel this is sort of my swan song, but   maybe because I’m a classy guy, I’ll call this my “valedictory remarks”—are three concerns that I   have for this Committee going forward  I’m not going to be able to participate, but I have a chance   now to lay them out  The first is the real danger of focusing too much on the federal funds rate as   reflecting the stance of monetary policy  This is very dangerous  I want to talk about that  Second   is that I think it’s absolutely critical that we keep our options open in the current circumstances, and   so I want to talk about that  The third is on the communication issue, but it’s not going to be on   inflation objectives  I’ve already talked about that enough in public, so it’s clear to you one way or   the other  I hope you consider it, but that’s something that I don’t need to go into here   First of all, let me talk about the issue of focusing too much on the federal funds rate as   indicating the stance of monetary policy  This is something that’s very dear to my heart  I have a   chapter in my textbook that deals with this whole issue and talks about the very deep mistakes that   have been made in monetary policy because of exactly that focus on the short-term interest rate as   indicating the stance of monetary policy  In particular, when you think about the stance of   monetary policy, you should look at all asset prices, which means look at all interest rates  All asset   prices have a very important effect on aggregate demand  Also you should look at credit market   August 5, 2008 121 of 145    conditions because some things are actually not reflected in market prices but are still very   important  If you don’t do that, you can make horrendous mistakes  The Great Depression is a   classic example of when they made two mistakes in looking at the policy interest rate  One is that   they didn’t understand the difference between real and nominal interest rates  That mistake I’m not   worried about here  People fully understand that  But it is an example when nominal rates went   down, but only on default-free Treasury securities; in fact, they skyrocketed on other ones  The   stance of monetary policy was incredibly tight during the Great Depression, and we had a disaster    The Japanese made the same mistake, and I just very much hope that this Committee does not make   this mistake because I have to tell you that the situation is scary to me  I’m holding two houses right   now  I’m very nervous  [Laughter]   The second issue is that it’s absolutely critical that we keep our options open  This relates to   the points that I already made in my discussion—I argued that we don’t know where this situation   of financial stress is actually going to head and that the potential for shoes dropping and bad things   happening out there is real  I think it’s likely that it won’t happen, but it’s a significant probability   with very serious negative consequences  In that situation, we don’t know exactly the direction of   where we have to go  I was actually very pleased with President Evans’s comments  Charlie has   been a good friend for a long time, and he is one of the people I have tremendous respect for as an   economist  Although we had a disagreement in our view of monetary policy today, on the issue   going forward I was pleased to see that you actually indicated that there is a possibility—we hope it   doesn’t happen, by the way—that things go south and that we actually have to be much more   aggressive on monetary policy and on liquidity issues  I know that there have been some concerns   on the Committee about that as well, but no option should be taken off the table if bad things   happen, and we cannot get boxed in  I feel very, very strongly about that     August 5, 2008 122 of 145    I would also say that the same issue comes up in terms of inflation  I have argued very   strenuously for nongradualism in a situation like the one we’re in  We are in a different world when   we are in a situation of financial stress, and it’s very possible that we might have to raise rates very   quickly  There’s a good news case and a bad news case  The good news case is that housing prices   stabilize  That could actually turn things around very quickly  I think, Bill, if I’m not incorrect, you   mentioned that possibility, and I think you’re absolutely right  In that kind of situation, our policy   would become very accommodative  I do not think it’s too accommodative at all right now  I think   it’s balanced; it’s appropriate  But if the financial markets improve, it will become much too   accommodative very quickly, and we then have to respond very quickly in order not to have   inflationary consequences  I’d like to see that happen, by the way   The other case, which I would not like to see happen, is that inflation expectations get   unhinged  I have seen no evidence that long-run inflation expectations have gotten unhinged, but   there is substantial risk  If that happened, we would also have to move up very quickly  So I really   implore this Committee to keep your options open  Do not get boxed in  Let’s hope and pray—  let’s all get around in a circle and hold hands—that oil prices fall, which will also help us not get   boxed in  Don, I told you I was going to be a little colorful  He was waiting for this one  I should   mention that Don was actually at a conference where he talked about constraints on people’s   behavior as a result of the transcripts being recorded, and he said, “But not Rick”  [Laughter]   The third issue is something about which I am less constrained, which is communications  I   would not have talked about this earlier, but it really does worry me  We have a complicated   governance structure in this Committee, which I actually think is the right governance structure    We have two types of groups that vote on this Committee  We have the people who are Presidential   appointees and then confirmed by the Senate, who are Board members, and I will soon not be one of   August 5, 2008 123 of 145    them  I’ll be a civilian again  Then we have Bank presidents, who are much more tied into the   private sector because your boards of directors, which are composed of private-sector people,   recommend you  Then we do have some role, but they’re the primary people who decide who   becomes a Bank president   I think that’s a very good framework  It actually serves us very well  I’ve been on both   sides  I’ve been on the other side of the fence, not as a president but as an executive vice president    It serves us very well because we have a link to the private sector that we normally would not have;   importantly, it keeps us real in terms of information; and there’s a group of people out there who are   not in Washington or New York (because people also have a hard time about New York) but who   tend to be very important supporters for us politically  So this is a system that I would very much   like to see preserved  It does have a problem because of the different roles here  What I have been   very concerned about—and I have had people in the markets speak to me about this—is that   recently I had a very prominent central bank governor say to me, “What in the hell are you guys   doing?”  The issue here is that we need to have a situation where Bank presidents and also members   of the Board can speak their views  They may have different views, and I very much encourage that   in terms of discussion, of where they think the economy is going, which is what we do inside; and I   think that does need to be done outside the Committee because it shows that there are different   views, that we’re thinking about it, that we’re trying to learn from each other, and so forth and so   on  What is very problematic from my viewpoint are the speeches, discussions, and interviews   outside, when people talk about where they think interest rates should head and where the policy   rate should head  That’s where the criticism has been coming from  I have to tell you that a lot of   people whom I respect tremendously are saying to me that it’s making us look like the gang that   can’t shoot straight  I think it’s a really serious problem  I understand that we want to keep the   August 5, 2008 124 of 145    priority of speaking our minds, but we have to work as a team, and I think that we’re having a   problem in this regard     Let me talk about why I think this is dangerous  It’s dangerous in terms of policy setting    You can see this is very blunt  Clearly, if you were in a multi-period game, you wouldn’t be this   blunt  But now I’m not going to be here anymore, so you can hate me—I don’t care  [Laughter]    But this kind of cacophony on this issue has the potential to damage us in two very serious ways    One is that it weakens the confidence in our institution, and I have to tell you that I love this   institution  It’s very hard for me to leave this place, but it’s something I have to do  If the   institution is damaged in terms of the confidence that the public and the politicians have in us, it will   hurt us deeply  It will hurt us in terms of policy because it will weaken our credibility, which   actually will make it harder to control inflation  So I consider this a very serious cost  The second   issue is on the political front  It is very possible that we’re going to have a reopening of the Federal   Reserve Act with the next Administration and the next Congress  The reason I think it is possible is   that we have to restructure our regulatory structure  There’s no way to get around it—we are in a   brave new world on this  That could lead to an opening of this issue  The problem here is, in that   opening, there are a lot of people in the Congress who are very uncomfortable having policymakers   who are not Presidential appointees and confirmed by the Senate  Two outcomes could come out of   that  One is that they could take the vote away from the presidents, which I think would be a   disaster because then you’re not going to have good people going into the System  We won’t have   boards of directors that will be good  We won’t have all of the benefits that we think we have from   the current system  The other alternative is that we then have presidents who are actually appointed   by the President and then confirmed by the Senate  I think, again, that hurts the private linkage   August 5, 2008 125 of 145    So I feel very strongly about all three of these issues, but I think that you’re going to come   up with serious challenges in the future that could be very damaging to the System  So I hope you   think about this and still like me for being blunt, and also miss me because there will be a little less   amusement  Who else would have brought Monty Python into the FOMC?  Thank you very much  "
