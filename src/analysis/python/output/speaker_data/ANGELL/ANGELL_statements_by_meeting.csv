0,1987-08-18," I guess the question is Why not ask for enough? If $10 billion might not do it, why not ask for $12 billion?   My question is Is there any real danger of erring on the side of having too much leeway to be able to manage the account the way we want to manage it?   And I guess the answer is yes [Laughter]   Do you want to formally recommend? "
1,1987-08-18," In many ways, Manley, you've made my speech, because I think what I hear you saying is that there is more uncertainty than some of the comments might indicate It does seem to me that it's appropriate for us to assume that inflationary pressures need to be dealt with, and that it's appropriate for us to have a monetary aggregate growth path such as we have been having To me, a 4 percent M1, M2, and M3 path is, in itself, a rather significant antidote for these inflationary pressures that exist Even though those inflationary pressures are there, and we are far from having turned the corner in abating these price increases, there might be some possibility that we will be successful if we are willing to maintain a monetary aggregates growth path such as we have And there's something that I notice when I get out in the country and I talk to farmers and people in the oil business and realtors there is a sense of unease that's in our country that really goes against what you were suggesting, Si, in regard to farm income It is true that 1986 was a record year for net cash farm income; and 1987 is going to be another record above that record But what I notice is that there is a conservatism, or even a super conservatism, that exists Those  -16-    8/18/87  people who are the survivors, and those businesses that are successful, are the ones that kept their borrowing down I notice no rush to borrow; I notice no stories from the entrepreneur types about how it makes sense to borrow money to do this or to do that I notice instead that the fast-food business is not quite what it was, and that owning houses doesn't seem to be quite the way to profit And I notice some unease and a scare out there that moderates behavior  So, it might be that this growth path of the monetary aggregates could bring a stop to the commodity price rises that we've seen during the last year, beginning last August And if these commodity price rises do abate and the inflation expectation goes away, there is some possibility that deflationary forces could once again return I think what we need to do at this point is to be open to look at the various possibilities and to see if we can do the trick of getting commodity price rises stopped in sufficient time before they feed back into the wage/price cycle If that can be accomplished, then it seems to me that a 41 percent GNP deflator and a 45 percent increase in the fixed-weight index for 1988 is totally unacceptable We just must not let that occur But having said that, let's not get ourselves too ready for an overkill   Sometimes he's hard to influence "
2,1987-08-18," It seems to me that we need to remind ourselves that these minutes will be published six weeks from now, around the time of the next meeting It just seems to me that we ought to be somewhat careful about making asymmetric statements when there is this much uncertainty I think the real question is what do we do, not the question of symmetric or asymmetric I would prefer a symmetric ""B"" Now, that puts me at the far end of those who have been speaking so far I do believe that the monetary aggregate growth paths are quite different from those we had in the period that led to the price pressures we are now seeing; and I think it is a mistake for us to react with the monetary aggregates behaving in this nice 2 to 4 percent growth range, which might very well be the right path for the long run Yet, as you anticipated, Mr Chairman, and I would agree with you, we do have this change in velocity It would be a mistake for us, then, to go to $600 million on borrowing, because $600 million will certainly be a vote for a lower monetary growth path The members of the Committee know that I have not favored returning the monetary growth paths back to within our target ranges for the year; I have favored coming in below the ranges But, just as a year ago, we were undoubtedly somewhat careless in not recognizing the 15 percent  -27-    8/18/87  monetary growth path when we made that discount rate change last August, I think it could be just as much a mistake for us to move now before we see the need I am prepared to make adjustments as might be needed if commodity prices and the exchange value of the dollar were to move in such a direction as to make inflation and our worst fears realized I would want to move at that point, but I am not willing to take a hard position now for minutes to be published six weeks from now based upon our feelings   The people who don't vote don't have to be responsible   I wasn't quite certain what the vote was in regard to the dollar's position I would be among those who would like to leave the dollar as being an important indicator, somewhat more prominent But I may be out-voted, I'm not sure   I would really favor making that broader and going 3 to 6 percent It seems to me that you could have a circumstance in which the aggregates were growing at 3 percent and, for other reasons, you still might want to tighten  -33-    8/18/87   I guess I'd want to hear Don Kohn's comments on that   How about going to 4 to 6 percent then? It just seems to me that 5 to 6 percent is so narrow   You're going to leave it at 5 to 7-1/2 percent?   If we're changing the top one, why is there any harm in changing the bottom one?   About 5 percent would be fine   4 to 8 percent   --the federal funds rate I think it would be the wrong signal, in light of the 1976 experience   I thought there were seven votes for five hundred; that was the way I counted   I don't think anybody will know it's $525 million; you don't tell anybody   We already have that in the tilt of the directive, anyway That is, you can go firmer, based upon developments, without calling a Committee--   I think that would be appropriate Change that "
54,1987-09-22," In regard to long bond rates, I think what we are seeing has something to do with the development of an exchange rate policy that no one thought out that carefully ahead of time It's unfortunate that there can't be some median ground between recognizing that monetary policy needs to be adjusted to take into consideration foreign exchange developments and trying to pinpoint and draw lines in the sand in regard to foreign exchange rates If we had been willing to make monetary policy adjustments before we drew the lines in the sand, we probably would have avoided some of the difficulties we are now in Nevertheless, the line got drawn in the sand And when that happens, it is very difficult to unhitch during a period in which inflation expectations are on the increase-- particularly, I think, when you have some commodity price pressures that would require stable exchange rates in order not to have commodity prices rise So, in that environment, it seems to me that  -25-    9/22/87  long bond buyers are mainly anticipating what monetary policy and future short-term rates are going to be, and it's kind of a win-win situation from their perspective, because they think that we might have to raise rates to support [the dollar in] foreign exchange markets or we might have to raise rates to resist inflation; and either one works in the same way Second, I think the long bond prices are affected today more strongly than they were ten years ago by a kind of speculative cycle That is, at one point in time, long bond buyers really intended to keep the bonds But we have developed an environment in which we have investors and fund managers whose success is based upon their performance; and there are times when it doesn't pay to be owners of bonds and, consequently, you're going to have long bond rates move a little too far In some ways, it doesn't bother me to see long-term interest rates high I think it would bother the US Congress I hope it would bother them, and I hope it would indicate to them how much opportunity there is to help there by controlling spending  In regard to the Greenbook forecast, I really have no significant disagreement over the 1987 forecast The staff has been lowering their inflation rates for the second half of 1987, so I don't see much disagreement there I do have three areas of difference in regard to the 1988 forecast I disagree, I guess, with Martha and some others who took one position with regard to real exports I'm taking another position I believe real exports will maintain a longer sustained growth path than is assumed in the forecast I believe that we have many producers in the United States who have never learned to be involved in international markets But once the United States became such a huge importer, we began to change the whole nature of the opportunities that exist So, we have many, many small and medium-size businesses that have never taken that international market seriously, and now they are learning that they do have to compete in international marketplaces at home and abroad And so I think we have a long learning curve involved here We have a lot of financial institutions that have not done very well with regard to recognizing export lending But I think that learning curve also will occur Therefore, I expect that these present exchange rates will give us a wonderful opportunity for a long period of export increases  As for my second disagreement with the 1988 forecast--and I know that Mike, or maybe Ted, mentioned the GNP deflator and its strange behavior--I would point out the staff's numbers on the CPI In July, the staff had forecast a 60 basis point increase in the CPI from the third quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988 Now they are projecting a 150 basis points increase in the CPI Now, that really is making things get worse rather rapidly I think that's not likely, first of all, because businesses have found that the environment is one in which you do not make profits by being able to increase your prices but you do it by learning to control costs So, I think we are in a different environment than we were Second, we have already gone through the big oil price increase, which the staff is telling us should have occurred earlier About the second half of 1987 is when it should hit us, and I think that has kind of passed us Third, I think foreign exchange rates are not likely to fall by the amount [indicated in the forecast], because I would presume that the majority of this Committee would not believe that the inflation forecast that we have is acceptable and they would be willing to take the steps that are necessary to not have those inflation rates  -26-    9/22/87  materialize Consequently, the dollar should behave quite well in that environment  The third disagreement [with the forecast] is in regard to tax receipts I think everyone is underestimating the effects of the Tax Reform Act, which is our first tax reform act since 1963 It is the first time we have broadened the base while decreasing the rates All the evidence shows that the tax receipts are coming in higher than anticipated We are going to have tax receipts that are going to be the largest percent of GNP in any peace-time year in our history Not all that goes away with the one-time capital gains move, so I am somewhat optimistic in that regard I am certainly willing to take whatever steps are necessary to make certain that the forecast for 1988 isn't correct because, if it is, then it is absolutely essential that we have policies that would lead to a tremendous slowdown in this economy "
55,1987-09-22," I am with the Chairman   I like ""around"" 4 and 6--   I know, but, Don, you have a different number for M3 than you do for M2, don't you?   See, really, around 4, and around 6   But you're actually anticipating 4-1/2 percent and you're anticipating 6 percent   I still think you could miss quite easily with a between 4 and 6   I just asked him--   But quite often we really attempt to kind of keep it centered, don't we? We don't like--   But, I do think it is somewhat important that we follow that suggestion of easing in to the $600 million so as not to cause the markets to believe that we have made a policy change at this meeting   Yes   Yes, we have watched him before, and he just knows how to do that "
110,1987-11-03," If we were to go back to 1983 and 1984 and have people look at it in terms of where the dollar should have been at    11/3/87  that point in time, the dollar didn't stay within what anyone would suggest was a workable US balance-of-trade level When the market could go to the extreme on the upside and run the dollar up to 161 on our index--when any careful analysis would say that that didn't make any sense--why do you have such confidence that somehow or other on the downside true market forces will prevail in the midst of political whims and a political climate that could be devastating? A truly floating exchange rate environment is really quite different than an environment in which you have political posturing and then it appears that [the floating exchange rate environment] is gone It seems to me that there is extreme danger that at some point in time the dollar could become a serious problem Given the Treasury's policy, I think we have only one choice we have to make domestic price level stability our primary objective and, if the world believes that, then I think the dollar will be okay   Of course   But instability breeds instability, and that's something we have to be very careful of   Being in such a position, with our fiscal deficit and our balance of trade deficit, as a net debtor nation, I don't understand how we think we ought to blame all these problems on someone else To me, that's naive We have to run policy in a manner that is consistent and sound And what's appropriate for our domestic economy can very well be appropriate for the others, if we consider price level stability important    11/3/87   Somewhat   Yes, that word respectively isn't needed is it? The word respectively should be out?   Right  -46-    11/3/87 "
111,1987-11-03," It seems to me that the economy was headed for a box in a corner and it wasn't going to work the way it was [earlier] We had really slow money stock growth for a nine-month period But we had something else going on that it seems to me has been missed somewhat--that is, the dramatic improvement in labor productivity Now, I know you wouldn't expect me to mention the manufacturing sector of the US economy, but it is much larger than agriculture Manufacturing is 24 percent of our economy and we have a 4-1/2 percent growth rate in labor productivity in that sector And that improvement is running faster than any edging up of wage rates, so we have unit labor costs falling in a dramatic way while the dollar exchange rate is adjusting That leads, of course, to what I think we expected to have happen--dramatic increases in real exports 179 percent in the second quarter and 168 percent in the third quarter And it seems to me--and here's where I differ somewhat with the staff forecast--that that is apt to continue I see no reason why that won't tend to continue as far as the eye can see, because there are just so many adjustments underway, given the wonderful new opportunities of labor productivity That, of course, carries with it a need to have higher capital expenditures in the Rust belt, the manufacturing sector; and so that makes our economy stronger than it otherwise would have been Then, on top of that, instead of reducing government deficits by $73 billion, according to the staff forecast we  -22-    11/3/87  have a $16 billion increase in the deficit So that's an $89 billion [swing] and it just seems to me the economy wasn't going to work The stock market event seems likely to bring some relief in that it might be expected to slow consumer spending enough so that there is room for this other rather rapid expansion to continue But this doesn't give us a bad inflation environment at all; it indicates, of course, with this productivity going the way it is that you have less inflation In fact, it seems to me that the inflation rate in 1987 is just unbelievable, in view of the oil price rebound and the import price adjustments To have the CPI, which should have more imports than other measures of inflation, peak out at 62 percent in the first quarter, and move down to 46 percent in the second quarter and 36 in the third was just unbelievable So, in a way, everything was going all right except that expectations were bound to derail the train; and those expectations came out of the lack of understanding as to how inflation wasn't going to return; it wasn't there in spite of the fact of a falling dollar I don't know that there's any appreciation of the way in which the Federal Reserve's commitment existed in that environment So, we have a rather unusual occurrence With regard to the forecast, the one item that I think seems like a rather rapid reversal for the fourth quarter would be the income velocity of money The income velocity of money spurted up to about a +4 percent annual rate in the third quarter from zero in the second quarter; and then it looks to me like it falls at about a 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, which would be a swing of velocity of 10 percentage points That seems a little stronger than I might expect The real trick is how can we maintain confidence in the domestic value of money in a period of declining foreign exchange rates for the dollar? "
112,1987-11-03," Yes, Mr Chairman I'm delighted to have you take that position I support you and alternative ""B"" and borrowings of $450 million But I'd like to suggest somewhat of a variation on that in regard to the fed funds range Ordinarily, we would leave it at 5 to 9 percent; but it seems to me that there are about three reasons why we might lower that to 4 to 8 percent under alternative ""B"" And in part, this speaks to how that would be interpreted as people read these minutes In regard to President Morris' comments about upward movement in interest rates, a dramatic movement upward to the 9 percent fed funds level seems to me very unlikely; that probably would be destabilizing in financial markets So I'd really rather have that upward bound down a point I'd also like to have the lower bound down a point to 4 percent because, while we are not anticipating it, there might be some circumstance between Open Market Committee meetings that would give us the flexibility [to move] downward, and that might be appropriate So, 4 to 8 percent on the fed funds range, even though it would maintain the policy stance about where we are, would give us a slight variation Frankly, I would prefer staying with variation II of the language [shown in the Bluebook], which is the more normal expression It just seems to me that the additional language shown in variation I could pose difficulties The very nice thing about the statement that was released by the Board Tuesday morning, October 20th, was that it was very simple and short And I would prefer in variation II to have the words read ""slightly greater  might"" and ""somewhat less  would"" be acceptable   That's where ""B"" would be   No, no   Mine also would be [current policy] I would presume that bringing the wide range for the fed funds rate down to 4 to 8 percent would be more consistent, in the short run while we are in this period of greater flexibility, with a short-run policy in which we would really hold it and not let it go to 7 percent and not let it go above 7 percent   Well, I would certainly be opposed to our going to an announced narrow fed funds target It seems to me it is very important that we do not have the semblance of returning to the 1970s style, which would really require frequent consultations to move it,  -37-    11/3/87  and would give some the impression that over the long run we might be willing to allow whatever reserves might be consistent with that I would much prefer to have the wider range but with a temporary understanding, as we have had in these recent weeks, that we expect it to be in the 6-1/2 to 7 percent area   What was your first your sentence again?   Recent days or recent weeks--either one?   I think that would; that would indicate 6-3/4 percent I wouldn't do it   You want what on the fed funds rate?   Could I ask a question about the Corrigan--   Yes, I'd like to look at the Corrigan language Where it says ""may call for a special degree of flexibility"" I think that's that first sentence where he added a phrase Would it be okay to say ""may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility because""  -43-    11/3/87   Well, I understand, but I'm just looking at the amendments   That's all I'm asking, yes   Would our transition borrowing be expected to be $450 million or $400 million?   Okay   The words that I wanted to look at here would be to continue to call for a special degree of flexibility, which would be an indication of continuing what we have been doing rather than of some new policy And then I have trouble with that sentence the outlook for monetary growth over the months ahead is subject to unusual uncertainty I'm not sure what that means; it seems to me that the only uncertainty when you look at Don's new figures is that it looks as if we have had a liquidity bulge But certainly we don't expect uncertainty in regard to the downside do we?   I'm just not sure what that sentence says It seems to me that the uncertainty is somewhat directed at one side   No, somewhat, slightly   Would or slightly greater restraint might   Oh, it's not-- I think the way it is now changed would [unintelligible]   Yes   You're not voting on that? "
167,1988-03-29," You are not authorized to play for the System; it's just restricted to New York?  SPEAKER(?) That's right  SPEAKER(?) Are there implications for the exchange markets?   Yes, I'm interested in the discussion I'm really interested in Governor Heller's point; he made the point that I'd like to make, but on the other side I'm arguing his side--I think that he's saying that the system really isn't broke and let's not fix it It's working better than you expected that it would work, or theoretically would work, and that's enough  It seems to me that we have really three kinds of alternatives you can target the fed funds rate, and if you choose to do that, we've had experience with that and that can be accomplished; or you can target the money aggregates; or you can target reserves to target money aggregates I prefer the present position because we, in a sense, are in between This would permit us, when we believe we can, to emphasize once again the monetary aggregates more forcefully It seems to me to go in the other direction, and to go back to fed funds targeting, would be seen in the markets as an abandonment of the kind of sound money policies that came out of the policies that resulted in this nation's double-digit inflation rates being brought under control So it's a very symbolic issue And the markets, I think, would respond very adversely if we were to move in that direction  In regard to the political consequences, it seems to me that our experience in 1987--after the October 19th crash and all of these people predicting recession--was that we actually did become very fed funds oriented, and that that was the political incentive If the fed funds rate didn't respond properly to what we thought was the lowering of the target, then we got all excited So it seems clear to me that having a fed funds relationship does put you closer to the political situation I believe that it is so important that money be restricted over a period of time to maintain some scarcity And this [reserve] pressure approach that we are under is one that enables us to proceed toward a somewhat restrictive monetary aggregate targeting in the future All of us know that that's important for price level  -16-    3/29/88  stability So I would consider a move to fed funds targeting to be a wrong move and to result in inappropriate policy choices Now if --   Now, if Governor Heller suggests that $200 million or $300 million doesn't make much difference, I ask you How much difference does it make to change the fed funds rate from 675 percent to 650 percent? I would suggest that in doing that, we're more tempted to make that move I would suggest that we would not have made the move we made in February--which I thought at the time was an incorrect move and I still think it was an incorrect move--if we had not been concentrating on the fed funds rate It was only because we thought that someone might see that very slight change in the fed funds rate that we were encouraged, it seems to me, to accomplish it  So I would go back, Manley, to the period in 1986 and 1987 I agree with you that we did not strictly follow in an unbiased manner the borrowing targets during that period It seems to me that we not only had some misses, but there were times that we accepted the actual outcomes that were different I'm not suggesting a return to that period; I'm suggesting that the Desk follow more closely the adjustment plus seasonal borrowing targets early in the two-week period We start off following those very closely and we let the fed funds rate move It seems to me that there's no need on the last day, with contemporaneous reserve accounting, to try to make everything fit and hit the borrowing target on that last day If we have our average in there early during the two-week period, then I don't mind letting the fed funds constraints be more important on the last day to prevent those spikes So, I share your frustration concerning the earlier procedures and I don't want to return to them I really want to follow more precisely adjustment plus seasonal borrowings as an interim policy that will enable us later to return to closer monetary aggregates targeting   But I think all of us know why that took place; I don't think there's any need for us to go into that I think we can pursue borrowing targets and have deviations of borrowing around those targets be unbiased   You mean when you have strong deviations? You have--  -17-    3/29/88   But that bias is brought in because of the choice of a borrowing target closer to zero If we would always choose a borrowing target somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion, then we would have more leeway to have fluctuations on both sides   Well, then you can change the discount rate If you don't like the monetary policy that goes with $500 million adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, you lower the discount rate   But you said that we're all strong men and women who can stand up and be counted, and I would suggest to you that there's no better way to stand up and be counted than to change the discount rate   I guess it's a surprising development here for the members of the Board of Governors, for the most part, to be arguing that they want the FOMC to have more say, and for the Presidents to be arguing that they want the Board to have more say, which is what's involved   Manley, analytically there's no--   There's no disagreement, analytically; you're correct, analytically It's a question of emphasis; it's a question of stance Of course, you're going to get the one; you're going to get the other   I think we all do   Mr Chairman, from your perspective did we have a policy change the first of February?   Okay; that's what I was assuming--that we didn't But then, when you went before the Congress, I thought there was an indication that there was a policy change   I think that focuses on the point that if you're looking at adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, then that small change might have been consistent with, what, a $50 million change?   A $50 million change Clearly, it seems to me, if you make a $50 million change in borrowing, it's so slight that you wouldn't consider it a policy change and you wouldn't announce it   But I think that's Jerry's point that targeting the fed funds rate may put you in a position of having to make a statement more often than would be the case otherwise Do we really want that?   It's because the market was able to discern [a change in the desired funds rate] Under the adjustment plus seasonal borrowing procedure, the market wouldn't have known, on an 1/8th of a point move   So this takes us back to pre-October 19th? "
168,1988-03-29," It seems to me that our economy has some very bright spots in it I am not quite as concerned as others that we are going to move from somewhat slow growth to very, very robust growth Even though I had a forecast of 3 percent real growth fourth quarter to fourth quarter at the February FOMC meeting, there are still some areas in our economy that have weakness It is my belief that price pressures may not come because of output pressures but because of some of the developing notions about our policy response in a period in which the foreign exchange value of the dollar could come under serious attack It seems to me that commodity prices, which at best are mixed, have never really had the fallback that generally is accompanied by their leveling off Some commodity prices have moved up and some have moved down, and I suppose, on aggregation they seem not to be posing a tremendous problem But it seems to me that they are high enough to motivate a lot of productive activity and a lot of capital goods orders, so that the producer durable goods orders could very well be higher in the second half than we have projected  I also share the view of Bob Parry and about five or six others of you about the inflation forecast for 1989 Frankly, I am not as complacent as I would like to be in that regard In the past I felt that we have been overpredicting the rate of inflation a little; yet it seems to me that we are now at a crucial point where price rises could become rampant and could explode That's why I am worried about the broader aggregates growing at almost double-digit rates in January, February, and March Knowing, as we found out last fall, that it takes quite a bit of time before changed opportunity costs of holding money seem to affect the growth of those aggregates, it seems to me that we are in a precarious position here where we could have a  -48-    3/29/88  breakout on the price side that would be most unfortunate So I, for one, believe I would like to join the 4-3-2-1 club That is to say How in the world can any of us be policymakers and not want to get the rate of inflation, as Lee Hoskins says, down to a zero rate? If we are going to get it down, we really have to begin And it seems to me that 5 percent doesn't do it; it needs to go the other way My preference would be to start with four percent on the CPI in 1987, be down in the 3 percent range in 1988, and proceed lower [thereafter] But I would invite anyone to join the club who would have a different timetable; I wouldn't care if you wanted to start in 1988 rather than in 1987 But for those who really care about price level stability, I would think that we have to make some changes at this point "
169,1988-03-29," I believe that forecast would [unintelligible] one large thrift almost $1 billion   Bob, you and I are talking about the same institution   And that's fairly easy to do All you do is just let people borrow from the discount window without asking a lot of questions on whether they have collateral "
220,1988-05-17," Does whole hog mean ""C"" or--   I think the question that was asked for those who want to wait is What are you waiting to see? I think it is a good question I'm very sympathetic with the notion that we can give misleading signals in regard to what it is that it appears we are focusing on when we make the move It does seem to me that if the staff forecast is accurate, at some point in time the discount rate change would be a part of such a move And I point out that if that were to take place, of course, it could take place at any point in time between Open Market Committee meetings If there are factors that would make us think that we would need that much of a change, it seems to me we ought not rule that out So, I don't see that today is necessarily the time to move But I would have a strong preference as to what kind of signals we use I happen to like something in alternative C very, very well And what I like in alternative C are the M2 growth paths Frankly, I would like for us to look at those very carefully, and, if I thought we could wait, do nothing now in regard to a borrowing target move That would be acceptable to me because I don't think we know at this stage what has happened on the money growth that would be anticipated from the moves we have made Certainly, April was a month we knew wasn't going to give us very clear readings on the monetary aggregates; May looks like it might be consistent with ""C""; and if June doesn't follow that path, frankly, I'd like to have that be the factor that would cause us to make a move I say that in keeping with my view that we will be able to achieve our movement to price level stability if we do not allow the exchange value of the dollar to fall further I believe that an alternative C growth path of the monetary aggregates would be consistent with a stable dollar in the short-term horizon, and I'd like to have that kind of restraint But I certainly feel comfortable in having the Chairman--he has shown already that he is responsive to these forces and that we could make this move as we see some more alternatives So, it's okay with me to have a strong tilt in the directive and to have no change today in the borrowing target, provided there is some assurance that we will be ready to act if those monetary growth rates do not return to what I thought was the very good path that we had in 1987 Hindsight says that wasn't too bad   It seems to me that 5 to 9 percent would be more appropriate   So you have a preponderance of a move and a tilt  -12-    5/17/88   Majority   It seems to me that that's a very appropriate response And as I understand it then, that almost means that we would expect maybe a telephone conference call if we don't do it   There would be a telephone conference   But, Ed, the count was four people who favored an immediate tightening   No, no I'm just talking about a count of the voting members   There were four members   Sure   No, no   That's right, so it could be $100 million now and $100 million [more] before the next meeting   Let's take the ""C"" numbers   I know, but that's--   March to June?   Why do we use March to June rather than May to June?   Well, I know; but it seems to me that what you already have behind you, you can't alter I thought maybe--   How about May to July?   Really Because otherwise you convey a mistaken impression   Why not May to July?   Yes   I know But what we do in June--   But what we do in June can't affect June's growth rate or even July's growth rate   So I'd prefer to say 4 to 6 percent from May to July That would give some indication here of what we're--   Yes, April Right; that would be a quarter   I'm very appreciative of the fact that there are so many members of this Committee who place price level stability in such high regard that they want to find some way to accomplish that [objective] This proposal, it seems to me, is somewhat deficient in that regard in that it does not have within it a proposal that, in a sense, gets you to price level stability I guess I see it as a way to live with 5 percent or 4 percent inflation, because 4 percent inflation can occur while maintaining this kind of constraint, so--   Yes Second, even though I call myself a monetarist, I've always been a discretionary monetarist And I believe that there are some circumstances--anyone who has read Irving Fisher, I think, would be aware of the fact that once you begin targeting money, and you cause money to be more scarce than it otherwise would be, you can alter the expected rate of inflation And when you do, you get a shift in the demand for money Now, it seems to me, that's exactly what occurred in 1986, with the worldwide deflation in commodity prices led by the plunging price of oil Certainly, many of us were mindful of the fact that during that period of time we were getting some extreme numbers And I remember in July, August, and September of that year looking very carefully at the commodity prices, which had turned around, and saying that we ought to put more restraint in place And yet there were some who felt--and I think quite rightly so--that those countries with balance of trade surpluses were not engaging in action that was sufficient in regard to the survivability of the third world And we thought it was essential, in some ways, to push the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank to more expansionary programs And we did this, with some risk, which made it necessary for us to follow a very different course of monetary policy in 1987 And there were those who were the strict rulemakers who told us at that point in time how disastrous it was going to be Now, as it turns out, it wasn't disastrous for us to follow a very low growth path for the monetary base during 1987 It turns out that that seems to have been exactly the right thing to have done So, I really can't find myself in a rulemaking camp versus a discretion camp If you want to be discretionary, then you have to ask yourself what you want to use for discretion And I've made it very clear that commodity prices are very good signals in regard to money growth rates   But what would be the money market response if the money market knows that we have these guidelines and then we decide to violate them? Don't you think there would be an expectational impact upon the money market?   Yes, but you see, by March or April of 1986, or by May at least, I presume we already were running up against that constraint And if the marketplace had seen that out there, then the path of interest rates in April and May would have been affected by market expectations of the fact that that was there   Well, not to the target range; I think that's right   Well, Tom, would you object to paying more precise attention to M2 right now? Is there anyone here who believes that 8 percent growth of M2 is consistent with our price level stability goals?   I cannot tell you   October 6th "
242,1988-08-16," Well, I'm not a purist on intervention I think there are times when that certainly is constructive But I would believe that to intervene all the time is a good way of demonstrating that you have very little power and, thereby, you are not affecting in any way this perception of a two-way risk It seems to me that if central banks are willing to alter the basic scarcity of their currency they can do a great deal to influence its exchange value And if intervention is trying to coincide with central banks' willingness to do that, it can indeed give a perception of a two-way risk I find it particularly dissatisfying to have intervention to the level and the extent that we have done during this intermeeting period while at the same time we clearly wanted to decrease the scarcity of dollars in world markets I see no point whatsoever in demonstrating that we were unsuccessful They might find it out anyway without our so clearly making it evident "
243,1988-08-16," It seems everyone wants to comment about the drought Let me mention one item of caution, and that is that a drought has an impact not only upon the supply side of production, but also on the demand side And no one really knows whether or not the demand side effects are less than or greater than the impact upon the supply side So, I think I'd have to caution that there is a much larger segment of the US society that is affected by agriculture and the loss of rain It may affect behavior in regard to consumption as  -23-    8/16/88  well as durable goods expenditures So, I think there's some uncertainty here that needs to be kept in mind  In the second place, I think you have to remember that just as we have the drought-adjusted GNP figures for 1988, you're going to do the same process for 1989 We are looking at agricultural production in the grain area that is only at 73 percent of capacity; and that's going to go to 97 percent of capacity next year And you're going to have a dramatic move forward, because when you change the acreage reduction to qualify for government programs from 27-1/2 percent to 10 percent, you're getting more than that change in plantings because the higher price will induce some people not to play the game That is, there will be farmers who will leave the program restrictions altogether So there'll be an impact for GNP that is not a capacity or inflation induced impact that does need to be considered And the final thing I might mention about the drought is that no one really knows how much that bill they passed is really going to cost It has a lot of complexities in it, in regard to $50,000 and $100,000 limitations and whether the $100,000 encompasses other payments So there will tend to be, in some sense, probably less actual outlay than may have been anticipated   It could very well be less than $39 billion because no one has really done a microeconomic analysis regarding how many of the people who are supposed to receive the payments will be restricted by the caps And there will be some farmers who will reject the payments because they do not want to commit themselves to two years of crop insurance So, there are a lot of uncertainties there  I think that all of us would recognize that we have more strength [in the economy] right now than we would like to have And I would agree with Jerry that certainly the rate of inflation currently going on is unsatisfactory But it seems to me that that's an indication that our policy wasn't exactly what it should have been in previous periods Certainly, in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we did not have the monetary policy in place that in hindsight we would like to have had in place  I think we can learn something, however, by the impact of this discount rate increase and looking at the bond markets Now, I have looked at key markets because I think there's a lot of instruction there The bond market weakened, of course, as it always does when the discount rate increases It almost didn't for 30 minutes this time; the bond market almost tried to remain strong in the face of a discount rate increase, because there were some people there apparently at first who thought that the Fed's going to be tighter, so that improves the outlook for inflation   But it didn't take long for the normal stance to develop, which was that, after all, if the Fed did this drastic thing which wasn't expected--and, of course, it makes the markets a little angry for us to do something that they don't expect us to do--then things really must be worse than they anticipated And so we have a kind of feedback that, if we are not careful, impacts the bond market Now the equity markets, it seems to me, also reveal some indication about how monetary policy affects perceptions And I think the rate of real investment is not unrelated to equity market behavior It seems to me that in spite of the fact that you can't see everything you want to see, Lee, there's some evidence there to say that there's some restraint in place I think the foreign exchange markets also certainly can be expected to operate with feedback loops--from the bond market particularly And when the US bond market has a difficult period of time, then I think you'd expect foreign exchange markets to react to that My own view is that the foreign exchange markets will probably continue to be stronger than anticipated, and indeed, that's our primary policy mistake--that we did not stand against the foreign exchange depreciation which in a sense is behind [our having] a heavier growth path than we should have had  I think commodity prices also are showing some effect of monetary restraint And I don't know whether the rest of you have noticed it or not, but to me it's kind of pleasing to have M2 be on a 4 percent growth path; and maybe we'll get it down to 3 percent When you get ready to do your report, Don, I guess I want to find out what impact a 9-1/2 percent fed funds rate and a 10-1/2 percent rate will have on M2 growth Certainly, that seems to me to be a difference And I guess it's pleasing to me to see that when M2 growth got up to 8 percent and right above our target range that, policywise, we were able to turn that around and bring that down to an acceptable level Now I don't know whether 4 percent is right or 3 percent or 2 percent, but I guess I'm more confident than others are that if we stay with 4 percent or 3 percent or 2 percent on M2 growth that things will work out so that we'll all be happy with the inflation results down the pike   It depends on which index you're looking at   The Economist index is the highest year-over- year rate of increase of any index "
244,1988-08-16," Don, I appreciate your--   Well, fortunately, I get to ask the questions   Don, for the fourth quarter of 1988 and the first quarter of 1989, M2 growth was, I think you said, 4 and 3-1/2 percent Could you give me some confidence intervals on those estimates?   Do you want to give me the standard error of the estimates then on--   Well, give me just sort of a range   Oh, that's pretty narrow Okay   I don't mean to cast aspersions on your forecast, but that's pretty tight   Thank you   M2   But Don, you've got built back in some rebound in those   And you've got weakening in the reserve balance, so that's still accounted for in the forecast  -32-    8/16/88   The political perspective is quite different If someone said well, the Chairman moved the fed funds rate--   Absolutely    8/16/88   I agree with you that the markets, particularly the equity markets and to some extent the bond markets, did react in such a way as to indicate that a discount rate change is more than a $200 million change in borrowings It really shouldn't be, but it  -38-    8/16/88  does seem to be I would favor the $600 million I favor the increase in the fed funds trading range, that is 6 to 10 percent, to go with that I would also be most appreciative if there was support here for moving the behavior of the monetary aggregates up in the order [of the factors listed] in the operational paragraph I would prefer having it go to first place I could certainly settle for it being in second place In fact, if we said something like ""the behavior of the monetary aggregates consistent with reductions in the rate of inflation""--that combination would seem to be very appropriate for me By that I don't mean that the growth rate of M2 in any one month ought to be a cause for a dramatic move What I would mean would be that if the 26-week rate of change of M2, for example, were to get below 3 percent, I suppose that to me would be significant   Asymmetric would be fine I would prefer symmetric, but I'd accept asymmetric If I can get monetary aggregates, I'll take it   Okay, so you mean you want to go to $700 million now and then to $800 million by the next meeting?   He's going to take it above, into number three   Yes   I think your resolution is fair   Yes   Well, it's close   We already have you down "
294,1988-09-20," Yes, Mike, I'd like a follow-up question to Governor Seger's questions Apparently, you have an optimum growth rate in mind, let's say, over the next four quarters What would that optimum growth rate be?   But, Mike, precision is helpful in communication I can take the time to pry the number out of you by asking you a series of questions, but it would save some time if you'd simply tell us   What would you think would be the optimum adjustment process? I mean, do you like 1-1/2 percent better than 2-1/2 percent?    9/20/88   But, Mike, there's a policy assumption involved in the interest rate forecast and I am just not sure whether you'd prefer 1-1/2 percent real GNP growth or a 1/2 percent GNP growth or a negative 1/2 percent I'd like to have some better understanding of what you think it would take in order to get this best adjustment   Thank you The last statement finally answered the question   Bob, it sounds like quite a bargain, doesn't it?   I'm very pleased with the present state of monetary policy and conditions in the economy That doesn't mean I like the 4 percent rate of inflation I just didn't believe that we could make the exchange rate adjustments that were so necessary to make--[along with] the rebound of oil prices from those lows and some rebound in wage rates from what I would call somewhat unsustainably low nominal rates--without having some temporary bounceback in the rate of inflation I have no reason to think that the staff's real economy forecast is not within the range of that which is likely I would tend probably to have a slightly higher net export figure, Ted-- closer to what you had in the June Greenbook than those that you have in today--but there's not enough there to argue much about I think if anything is different, consumer spending might be slightly softer, but it's very difficult to predict  The pleasing aspect of policy at this point in September 1988 is that, as far as I can see, we've returned the growth of the monetary aggregates to the pace that was occurring in 1987--and I thought the rate we had in 1987 was appropriate to provide a soft landing for the dollar And it's very encouraging to me to see that, after the monetary aggregates responded to the somewhat easier stance we maintained during the fall and winter, the aggregates have responded the way they have to our attempts to be serious about not letting M2 rise above the top of the target at the first of the year, even though we had a somewhat distorted base level And now it looks as if M2 is going to end the year in the fourth quarter below the midpoint and could very well be as low as 4-1/2 to 5 percent at the end of the year Don Kohn shakes his head a little bit at that I think we have to keep in mind the time lag between interest rate changes and response in those monetary aggregates  In June, as you may remember, I talked a little bit about the hint of changing commodity prices, and I think I was kind of reading tea leaves at that point But we've had further evidence that the monetary restraint in place is having an impact on commodity prices-- and even though we've had, it seems to me, a peaking of commodity price rises earlier in the year, the drought gave us a kind of a double-peak effect But the commodity price picture does look much improved I believe that the fight against inflation is a long one and one that we must sustain over a long period of time; and I would be willing, of course, to accept very low growth rates in the monetary aggregates, but I would really suggest that zero may not be desirable "
295,1988-09-20," Are there going to be questions?   Don, we have in the Bluebook, the M2 and other forecasted growth rates What happens in 1989 quarter 1 and quarter 2 with, let's say, alternative ""B"" and what would happen in quarter 1, quarter 2, and maybe in quarter 3 if you put in the staff's interest rate forecast?   Okay, that's fine; that's the most important   1989 over 1988?   Okay  -23-    9/20/88   So that means you need almost a 5 percent growth rate in the second half of the year to get 37?   Okay, so the 28 percent rate that you have for quarter 4 would tend to rebound in quarter 1   If we did not have other increases   And it could rebound to 4 or 4-1/2?   Thank you That's very helpful   Mr Chairman, I can certainly go with your suggestion I, too, believe that we're more likely in the intermeeting period to need to tighten than we are to ease, but I would not take that to mean that there's not some circumstances in which we might be surprised If there's a 60 percent chance that we would not need to make any move at all, and a 30 percent chance we might need to tighten, I think there are some circumstances that might develop--, that conditions might change in an economy with certain kinds of financial bankruptcies occurring and certain kinds of uncertainties But I can--   Okay "
346,1988-11-01," So, in effect, we're making this new term beginning next March run until December 31   Which seems to me is the appropriate way to do    11/1/88   Well, I'm delighted of course to see this impetus to the monetary aggregates because certainly I think all of us have known that our job in regard to long-run price stability has to be related to what we do in regard to facilitating money and avoiding getting too much money in the system The record of this year is of having M2 clearly appear to be running against our upper limits in the first quarter and our taking offsetting actions, and it seems to me that that was indeed appropriate We now have M2 below 5 percent on an annual growth rate basis over a 24-month period for the first time, I think, since 1962 And it seems to me that this does bolster that [unintelligible] and that view I would caution, however, that what I think Manley Johnson has been suggesting in regard to the short run, and that is if we make short-run mistakes and get the economy in a severe recession the problem with that is that you end up then not behaving well in regard to monetary aggregates So, I think this is indeed a very extraordinary development which bolsters those of us who want to see M2 raised [in importance] We just need one more step and that is to be sure to use commodity prices as some signal as to when to tighten the screws   But, Frank, the model doesn't say that   The model says the gap is still the other way "
347,1988-11-01," Mike, would you go back and reread that sentence where you said something to the effect that we've stretched out the acceleration of inflation It's back close to the very beginning You think we've stretched out the period of acceleration of inflation    11/1/88   No, no, I'm talking about stretched out--   Well, that's why I didn't understand why you would have said [what you did] when the Greenbook clearly shows--would you read it please?   Did you find it, Ted?   No, you were talking about price increases I'll go back and read through it   Do you agree that you said that you stretched out the rate of inflation in your forecast?   Yes, that's what I saw in the Greenbook and that's why you have the rate of inflation going down in the Greenbook In 1989 the fixed weight inflation index was down to 42 from 45 percent in 1988, which is lower by 3/10ths of a percentage point And the CPI fourth quarter over fourth quarter is 43 percent in 1989 versus 44 percent in 1988, and that's why I was surprised to hear you say that you've stretched out the acceleration of inflation   Even though your numbers show inflation going down, you said it's going up, that's all  SPEAKER(?) What about 1990?   I think I see an outlook that's every bit as strong as the staff would see it I don't have the slightest idea what interest rates might prevail over the period ahead, but it does seem to me that the economy shows a lot of resilience and a lot of signs of continued increase And it doesn't show any signs that the recent slowdown in money growth is being translated into anything which would be an expansion-ending event It seems to me that our economy has changed rather dramatically in the '80s from the '70s, that we are in a much more flexible wage-price arena than we had been in before Otherwise, it just wouldn't be true that we could have the kind of exchange rate adjustments of the dollar that we had and the kind of monetary growth paths that we had in 1985 and 1986 without it showing through into much higher rates of inflation than the year- over-year 41 percent that I think we're now seeing in CPI And it seems to me that that shows us that the environment has changed globally and that that has tremendous impact domestically  But we've had a lot of industries that have suffered rather severe shakeouts And people's memory gets to be long and so we have more attention in industrial America and in rural farm America concentrating on cost efficiencies than we did before And now given the present level of commodity prices, the present level of finished goods producer prices, crude industrial prices--those prices, it seems to me with this emphasis upon cost efficiency, provide ample profit margins to give us the kind of capital investment and the kind of continued expansion that I think we find is desirable for the economy Now, even though some commodity prices may have shown some response to the slower money growth, we haven't been having commodity prices that just do not show that And it seems to me that the back hasn't been broken in terms of this price cycle so that we can suggest the commodity price deflation such as began in 1984 and 1985 would reach the proportions that it did in, say, 1986  Now, I would agree that the one exception to that is oil, but there again in percentage terms we're not looking at the same kind of reductions they were looking at in that period And I would agree with Roger that the areas of US oil industry that have such difficulty finding oil resources, and where the output of oil is so low, are indeed going to experience some dramatic curtailment But I believe that will be more than offset by the [expansion] under way in agriculture Just the release of all these acres from the acreage control [program] means demand for more machinery; it means demand for more fuel; it means demand for more fertilizer So, we already have  -39-    11/1/88  under way a large acreage expansion of the agricultural industry which I think probably by itself offsets what's happening in oil Now, it just seems to me that a foreign exchange movement of the dollar [associated with] decided weaknesses would undoubtedly cause commodity prices to at least remain at these very, very high levels if not to accelerate And so it seems to me that the economy does have ample strength "
348,1988-11-01," But, Don, real GNP was negative in the second quarter of 1987   You support borrowing of $600 million?   You mean $600 million is the borrowing target?   Okay   I'm very sympathetic with Tom Melzer and Bob Black, and with Lee Hoskins's questions about money growth I think the 2-1/2 percent growth rate of M2 from September to December in alternative ""B"" is just fine I would be somewhat uneasy if we were to get lower growth than that I would not like to see those growth rates get down close to zero over a period of time because I believe that would cause some bounce-back If that low growth were to be the case, then I think we really ought to talk about it before the next meeting; that is, I think we ought to have a conference call On the other hand, if the aggregates begin to snap back faster than the staff is projecting, then I would want to be very alert to a possibility of tightening because I think where we are is just fine Now, I have to admit that what I'm saying is really consistent with symmetric language, not asymmetric And my caution would be that we use the appropriate language here; that is, I would like the market to learn that when we say we're asymmetric that we have a feeling that things are going to change I don't think that's the case here, and so I would slightly prefer--not enough to vote against an asymmetric directive--but I would slightly prefer to have it be symmetric Also, I think that when this directive is announced in December, if we haven't changed policy then the fact that we were symmetric won't even be noticed On the other hand, if we have tightened, nobody is going to care what we were at this point; and, in the unlikely event that we have to ease, we would look a little smarter So I think there's a fair case for symmetric language   Some of the rest of us might, too "
411,1989-03-28," I nominate Alan Greenspan--unless it is already set Do you have someone set to make the motion?   Okay Alan Greenspan and Gerald Corrigan   Would there be some notion as to where we might be going in regard to any one currency? That is, would there be any restraint or any notion that there might be some point at which we would acquire more of a particular currency than might be the most advantageous position for our asset holdings?   So from time to time you would expect to report to the Committee on [individual] currency holdings as compared to what you might think of as some optimum range?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Well, it really isn't an exotic hedging strategy; it's an exotic speculative strategy, I think You really have to distinguish between an exotic speculative strategy and an exotic hedging strategy There's quite a difference   But anyone who finds the hedge [unintelligible] They just have to have more expertise than that So, I think they were taking a position "
412,1989-03-28," My sense is that consumer spending in the United States is rather gradually coming into line with what needs to happen Maybe some of this is interest-rate induced; maybe some of it is demographics; maybe some of it is actually the impact of higher prices and higher interest rates on budgets In many ways that looks like a 1 to 2 percent growth rate of consumption, which seems to me is exactly what we would like to see happen And it seems to me that this happens in an environment that's not very prone to a recession When I look at inventories and at the factors that ordinarily lead to recession I just do not see the economy going into recession in the foreseeable future, and I guess that would take us through the first quarter of 1990 I recognize it's a narrow path to have this slowdown in consumer spending without overshooting and getting a recession out of it But it does seem to me that that's still a possibility Hindsight, it seems to me, would say that some of us who watch commodity prices didn't say as much about it as we should have said, but there is a clear indication that year-over-year rates of change in commodity prices have been moderating But they have been plateauing in a very, very slow manner Of course, we had the November-December spike in which the world food situation began to be somewhat more clear to the people that follow it We saw food and fiber prices [rise] in November and December We've had a year-over-year increase of 42 percent in the price of wheat; the price of wheat is almost 80 percent of its high, which occurred back in 1974 And that's a price that really is very conducive to increased production worldwide The weather situation is, of course, a very clear one; and it gets interpreted into those commodity prices very, very rapidly I suppose some things could go wrong but I guess I'm comforted, Tom, by the 2 percent M2 number Given the price pressures that are there, I couldn't be more satisfied with any M2 growth that I can think of than what we're getting I suppose it does run some risk of being that close to the precipice But I think it would be riskier still if we were going along with growth of M2 at a much more rapid pace  -32-    3/28/89 "
413,1989-03-28," Mr Chairman, I agree with your view in regard to a pause, so I would go with alternative B also I have a slight preference for being symmetric but not for operational reasons It's simply that I believe if we are symmetric and we need to take that next step--and I think there is at least a 50/50 chance that that's the case--we can do it with symmetric language But if it happens that we don't need to take that move, we just look a little wiser by hindsight I don't know whether that impresses anyone or not   We can call it M2t   You say yes "
472,1989-05-16," But the growth rate of the monetary aggregates has not narrowed   Mr Chairman, I would--   I was just going to make a motion; maybe you don't want a motion   Okay   I move it, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, it seems to me this is an issue in which dogmatic views really aren't that helpful It seems to me we're going to deal with questions here as a matter of practicality We are working with the Administration, and I'm somewhat pleased that we have an Administration that's willing to have some kind of exchange rate intervention versus one that says absolutely not Sam, I would like a little better accounting--that is, I believe for our purposes you ought to keep track of the opportunity costs of those balances and not    5/16/89  consider the entire gain to be in a sense out of the blue, because we would have had earnings on US Treasury balances Is that not correct?   So, it seems to me that the opportunity costs should be subtracted out Now, I would say that I believe--as some of you know by my no vote last June--that exchange rate intervention ought never to go at cross purposes with monetary policy I think it's always a mistake because we're going to demonstrate our ineffectiveness in one camp or the other any time we do that It seems to me that there is some merit in going forward with this move because there are some necessary adjustments in monetary aggregate growth rates that will take place That would mean, then, that the deutschemark interest rates would tend to move up relative to our own so the relative opportunity cost it seems to me is not unusually high So, I support the proposal   Well, I'm very sympathetic with President Hoskins' views and yet at the same time it seems to me that there's no particular disadvantage of having an international trade adjustment process in which United States exports grow more rapidly than our imports grow I can't see that that's a disadvantage Consequently, I favor having a bit of a gesture in the foreign exchange market prior to the time in which the needed change in monetary aggregate growth rates will emerge--because I have no doubt that the Bundesbank has a serious problem on its hands in regard to how fast they have been growing the monetary aggregates and that they will have to bring those in check But it seems to me that it's somewhat to our advantage to have a divergence in these growth rates at this time I'm convinced that the real moves will take place in terms of interest rates and their conversion into monetary aggregate growth rates It's in that atmosphere that I don't mind our taking a bigger step   On that $15--   Well, Jerry, if you keep saying it, some day you'll be right! "
473,1989-05-16," Normally, it will start the first of June but this year it's going to be a little later--probably around the second week in June   Well, actually, they start around the south of Wichita first   Yes, and it moves in a line to the northwest   I agree with those who like what they see in terms of the conditions that are out there right now It is good news to have consumer spending running at a much lower level and to have more room for the hoped-for capital spending and for exports It's a little scary to me to see that we're in a place that we'd like to be; it's scary because you ask yourself how we got there And you say we got there by slowing down But I don't think we're that good that we can actually pin it down just exactly as to what we might want to have on consumer spending So, rather than look at the far out [time horizon] I would look at the monetary aggregates at this stage I think they are our best guide in terms of where we may be in 5 to 6 months Restraint is indeed the proper course, but it probably ought to be a measured restraint not an increasing restraint Increasing restraint, if shown by continued deterioration of the growth rates of those monetary aggregates, I think can increase the risks I don't think that exists now but it could be there in the near future I just do not recall, Don, seeing any item like checkable deposits year- over-year being negative I just do not recall the possibility that Ml, if it remains soft for another month, could also be flat for an entire year I just do not recall M2 declining as much as it has declined and then, in a sense, having the bottom drop out of it in the tax-paying season All that, it seems to me, would say that there's a high degree of risk in letting those aggregates deteriorate further And we ought to be mindful of that We ought to avoid extremism on that which we know about rather than worry so much about that which we do not know about It seems to me that declining monetary aggregates in the face of an economy that shows some signs of slowing actually could give you a tightening of monetary policy while interest rates appear to be stable You can have stable interest rates and a tightening of policy in that kind of environment And I think we need to be cautious in that regard because the long-run inflation problems are indeed great and we need to be able to maintain a posture of slow growth into the future But the way to do it is not to get caught up in the extremism of letting the monetary aggregates fall out of bed So that's what I want in terms of caution "
474,1989-05-16," On Chart 11, Don, is the V* your long-run V*?   If you take the short-run V*--   I guess I'm surprised that you used the long run rather than the shift adjusted one From the staff study I thought there was a slight preponderance of evidence on the side of the shift adjusted Didn't the numbers come out a little more accurate on the shift adjusted?   In the monetary aggregates   Yes   Yes   Okay Well, I heard the answer   Thank you The second question, Don, relates to the bounceback in M2 that you're forecasting on Chart A, which seems to me ample, or maybe strong If it did not turn out that way, or if the second half was by and large a continuation of the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range, would you have a different policy prescription than you do with the present forecast?   No, no   But you really expect this phenomenon to begin to show itself in the next three to four weeks, is that correct?   Oh, I understand   I would agree with that Thank you   Well, the Greenbook is ""B,"" ""B,"" ""C,"" ""C""   Yes, I wanted to ask a question in regard to the aggregates I agree with your position You used the word ""evidence"" --evidence that the money growth is coming back I don't think we have any evidence yet and--keying on Governor Seger's suggestion--I'm wondering whether we could make that adjustment from the $500 million to $600 million with some discretion on the part of the Chairman as those numbers come in Would that be a problem, Don?   Well, my view on the aggregates is that the problem with the aggregates is right now If we're ever going to be concerned about the aggregates we should be concerned right now I don't know whether they are going to come back or not come back; if growth does come back I'm going to feel very comfortable If they come back as much as you suggest I think I'm probably going to want to restrain them too But--  -39-    5/16/89   You think the markets would interpret our staying at $500 million as an easing?   But then, Mr Chairman, let me ask you another question Do you believe that under a symmetric directive, if the aggregates do not come back, that you would not hesitate to have a conference call or to act?   Okay; on that basis I agree   What is this new deal you're introducing?   Intervention   Well, Mr Chairman, we did in January of '88   I think the markets don't have to worry that one move is necessarily a great--   ""Somewhat/would""   It seems to me we have never used ""slightly"" with symmetric [language]   So, I suggest that we not introduce that nuance Let's stay ""somewhat/would"" balanced "
534,1989-08-22," Sam, I'd like to get your personal view concerning two scenarios in regard to the exchange value of the dollar Over the next six months, if US interest rates remain largely where they are now, what would happen? Alternatively, what would happen if we had a somewhat substantial decline of, say, 100 basis points over the next six months?   I don't quite understand your answer in comparison with what your report said Your report seemed to indicate that during July and August there seemed to be quite a difference in perception about what direction US interest rates might go Now, you don't think that would be very significant in the next six months if there was--?   No, I don't know of anyone who thinks it's simply the interest rates   I was more interested in the constant interest rate scenario than I was in the falling interest rate scenario Thank you   Okay, that's the response that I was looking for In other words, you think that if the perception in the marketplace were that we would have no further interest rate declines, that would tend to be somewhat bullish for the dollar   Well, that offends my sensibilities   Well, Mr Chairman would it not be possible to have a telephone conference call and do it that way? Then it would be on the record It just seems to me--   Fine   Yes   That satisfies me, yes   But if we take the vote, the minutes published [after] the next meeting would include the vote, then "
535,1989-08-22," I think it's appropriate that we be somewhat pleased with the outcome of policy over the past few years I'm sure it is no surprise to many of you that I had some strong disagreements in the first half of 1987 concerning monetary policy; but since that time it seems to me we have really put it together about as well as we might have expected, or better than we might have expected On that matter [we've met] our highest expectations Now, I've had a running friendly disagreement with some of our staff over some elements in the composition [of the forecast], but I don't disagree with the major impact of the real output numbers as forecast I would say, Sam, that I probably should apologize to you for trying to bring you into the argument so to speak But it seems to me that we should think more in terms of the global economy And monetary policy, it seems to me, works primarily in the global economy in that perspective I just do not believe that being the best Phillips curver does you much good in analyzing the global economy, with more flexibility in wages and  -31-    8/22/89  prices than we would have otherwise In that context, it seems to me that when Mike Prell said that he expects to bring in the inflation forecast lower for 1991 because he believes that's what we want, I think you're exactly right, Mike That is what we want But the way to get lower inflation is not to have the dollar depreciate And I must admit that even though Ted has been wrong for two years in regard to the exchange rate forecast, I've also been wrong on the foreign exchange rate forecast for two years running I've been wrong just as Ted has been wrong in forecasting a declining one   It seems to me that if we truly want to have a stable price level the way to get there is not to get into a period of dollar depreciation I don't understand how we can have a period of interest rate stability and have a dollar depreciation in the forecast That means, then, that I do expect domestic demand to be somewhat weaker on the consumer side I believe we have turned the corner on the household saving rate; I believe there is a difference there But it seems to me that we have to be aware that even though things are working out very well that there is a vulnerability I think the vulnerable areas in our economy that will tend to show up will be in the problem area of housing That is, if housing stays at its present rate then it seems to me that the soft landing scenario is fairly accurate But I think there is some possibility that we may be entering a period in which housing prices nationally are in a much softer position than we realized; and if we have a period of declining housing values, that will show through on consumer spending more than the stock market showed though So, even though things seem just about right now, we ought to be aware of that vulnerability I'm very pleased with the staff's understanding of our wanting [lower] inflation My goodness, 3 percent is not good But I don't understand why we continue to believe that we can get there with a depreciating dollar scenario "
536,1989-08-22," I would prefer asymmetry toward ease just in recognition that not to ease at all during the intermeeting period would at some point in time mean a rollback to somewhat higher interest rates I would be somewhat concerned that in that scenario we might very well end up with a housing market that would be adversely affected by those developments I also think we need to be alert to the fact that M2 growth needs to stay within that cone That is, we are expecting M2 growth to be within one of those--whether it's A, B, or C--between now and September I would certainly not want to see that fall out of bed and I have no reason to believe that it will I also think that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could quite likely come under upward pressure and that exchange rate intervention might not by itself be sufficient to hold that back I believe it would be undesirable to have another serious leg up on the appreciation of the dollar and go through some of the marks we went through before That taking place in a period accompanied by falling commodity prices I think would call for ease Objectively looking at the situation, I think that we're more apt to ease than not; and I don't see any harm in having asymmetric language toward ease, Mr Chairman, because we're not going to do it unless something would develop that would cause us to want to [ease]    8/22/89   Oh yes, so do I!   But it seems to me, Mr Chairman, that if we decided to tighten before the policy announcement came out that people would see that we had changed our mind   Frankly, I would never vote ""no"" over the question of symmetry That means all we do can be done either way   But that's an historical question   That's what we're talking about; that's what we're voting for "
594,1989-10-03," That's the key issue   That is correct   Mr Chairman--   It seems to me that the markets are beginning to recognize the Federal Reserve's commitment to price level stability Mr Chairman, you've certainly contributed to that and I think other members of the Committee have in regard to the one voice that we have in this area But we can't have that commitment to price level stability without having a strong dollar That is, a strong commitment to price level stability [requires appropriate] interest rate differentials and the dollar remaining strong It just seems to me that we need to understand where our commitment is And, Mr Chairman, this discussion seems to indicate a very strong feeling in regard to the direction and the kind of policy we should engage in But I think one can go so far as to say that the Treasury certainly would be dissatisfied to be without us That is, the thought that we might pull out of this is indeed some force; and my dissent is in that vein My dissent is to contribute to an environment in which the Treasury recognizes that it may not wish to go it alone I agree it's best for us not to get out But sometimes we have to act like we might get out in order to [achieve our objective]; and it's to your leadership that I entrust that we do it  -12-    10/3/89   He's done it too well   Yes   Okay, here's what I'm going to do I'm going to vote on the affirmative on this one because this has only to do with what has taken place I dissented in regard to the Authorization, which was a proper dissent So, I'm going to make that distinction, Manley You do what you think   Well, in other words what we're doing now is saying that we did transactions [The question is whether] they were authorized In other words, are they approved?   Do we want the FOMC [to respond]?   I would think we should have one response   The model that works   Well, how about a Wednesday morning meeting with [Wednesday] afternoon?   Well, the model that we're going to use is going to be rather important It seems to me that if you're going to use the Phillips curve trade-off model you're going to defeat the Neal amendment   [Unintelligible] if you want to defeat it, just use that model and you will guarantee a defeat   That's right "
595,1989-10-03," It seems to me that the picture is a mixed picture I'm somewhat on the optimistic side, as are Gary Stern and Manley Johnson, in regard to the output-price tradeoff It seems to me that in the second half we are in a 2-3/4 percent inflation mode as compared to 6 percent in the first half I would agree that neither one of those was sustainable That is, I think we had accidental factors giving us too high inflation numbers in the first half and we are getting some benefits in the second half that are not sustainable But I would tend to expect inflation in 1990 to be within the 3 percent range I don't call that good at all My goodness, we are two years delayed in terms of being at 3 percent and I think we do need to make more progress But I think our ability to make progress on the inflation front can best be done by not creating recession-like conditions And I'm optimistic that that will not occur M2's growth over 26 weeks is now back up to 4-1/2 percent, which seems to me to mean that we have made some progress in that regard Commodity prices continue to soften, but I think it's a rather moderate softening and not a precipitous one It seems to be a softening that reflects the  -32-    10/3/89  monetary scarcity that occurred earlier; and I think that needs to be watched rather carefully as I think money growth needs to be watched But I do believe there's a different tone around in regard to how one can profit by engaging in various economic activities I think profit prospects or speculative gains by holding land or real estate or any investments are probably being diminished somewhat And it doesn't seem to me that this is going to lead to a sustainable level of investment activity in many of these areas I am as bullish as the staff is in regard to exports In fact, I have exports slightly higher with a stable exchange rate, whereas the staff is calling for exports to decrease dramatically--well, I'd call down to 5 percent somewhat of a dramatic decrease I believe that we have had the benefit of having American manufacturers compete in the world markets right here in the United States; I think they are getting better and I think there is motivation to hold costs in check So, I think it's an optimistic outlook; but there are some areas, like the airline business, that are showing some signs of change So it looks sustainable "
596,1989-10-03," Yes, Mr Chairman I also prefer alternative ""B"" with asymmetric language toward ease It seems to me that there is more restraint in place than I think some of the words so far have suggested We have had monetary restraint sufficient to turn the foreign exchange value of the dollar around We have had monetary restraint sufficient to take commodity prices that were rapidly rising and turn them into falling prices We have had monetary restraint that has taken the PPI on a year-over-year rate of change basis from moving up to moving down To think you can get lucky enough in that kind of environment to do that and have no change in monetary restraint and to think that that restraint is going to be just right on the other side does not follow the logic that I know of So, I'm quite suspicious of the fact that we may be getting further into this process than we know We need to be watching very carefully to see what occurs Now, I would be delighted if we could just say Well, we're going to pull the monetary aggregates down and we're just going to have them under restraint; but I think all of us know what happens if you go into that mode The demand for money has to increase during a period of time in which price level stability is much more of a clear possibility So, I think we have to watch very carefully all the signals that have served us so well in keeping this economy going for so long and yet provided the restraint that we needed I believe that it's not so important at this point whether we ease a quarter or not here or there except that I don't want any timing with the dollar But 25 basis points one way or the other doesn't make or break anything You could make way too much of that But it does contribute to the possibility of orderly markets that are so important; the whole housing industry, it seems to me, needs orderly markets I think a very steady, careful, easing ought to be done; it's unfortunate that the G-7 took away what I think may be a time in which we may need to act I think it's essential that we take this time to wait, but I am more inclined, I guess, than some others to believe that an easing is going to be necessary   Do you mean drive the dollar higher?  -43-    10/3/89 "
655,1989-11-14, The Europeans by and large are forecasting that their inflation rates will not peak until sometime in 1990 I was surprised that believe that theirs will move to percent before it turns down on a year-over-year basis So there is some anticipation there that they have quite a stimulus going   At least 1230 pm for lunch  SPEAKER(?) On the 18th or 19th?   We can start the Board meeting at 930 am  SPEAKER(?) It'll be a long day!  END OF MEETING  -35-     
656,1989-11-14," Yes Mike, in Q1 1990 you have producers durable equipment leading business fixed investment up and then it's back down again in the second quarter What gives rise to that?   But that's assuming this strike ends when?   I have the same question My hunch is that the fourth and first quarters are going to be somewhat weak, as forecast But if you look at the more forward-looking items such as money growth, we have had M2 back on a fairly decent pace for about five months now and I've been surprised that commodity prices haven't continued to move down I know they have moved down in certain of the industrial measures, but it seems to me a pretty isolated group of  -22-    11/14/89  commodity prices that are continuing to move down And they haven't moved down very much in comparison to how much they moved up in the 1987-1988 period So, it seems to me that we have a ways to go in regard to restraint on those commodity prices We had a serious drought, which took farm commodity prices up a great deal We have not had what you would call a normal movement of commodity prices down, which you would typically get; that is, going back over the post World War II drought periods, ordinarily you would get more movement down of commodity prices than we have had I'm somewhat [stymied] in my view concerning where we are because commodity price behavior hasn't been what I thought it was going to be I guess that's one of the problems you have when you begin to target something; perhaps you ought not to look at what you think it's going to say I think there are times when you [unintelligible] not see as much; it does not give me the sense of an economic slowdown that I felt in 1985 and 1986 It just isn't there And I think it's crucial that it get there because the wage sector is no longer lagging as much as we would like It's kind of upon us and we probably have some tough periods ahead "
657,1989-11-14," Well, it seems to me that we're at a juncture here where it's time for us to pause and see what happens The fourth quarter and the first quarter are the consequences of the monetary policy that we implemented in the second quarter and the third quarter We are already past [influencing] those Whatever these quarters turn out to be, it would be most unfortunate for us to have a slowdown--or a slowdown near to zero if it's that slow, which I don't think it is--and then not to capture the price level opportunity that you get from being there It would just be such a waste to step up to that point and then not to capture the benefits So, I think it's imperative that we not be too caught up in tuning in on the employment and output numbers that we're going to be seeing I think we have to remain forward-looking Most important, it seems to me that the dollar exchange rate is out there And it seems to me that we cannot go through a period of substantial dollar weakness in foreign exchange markets without absolutely upsetting all the financial markets The only way that I can see us not going through such a period is for us to make some gains on the trade balance in this window [of opportunity] I am more encouraged from talking with central bankers in Europe and Japan concerning their growth prospects We have an opportunity now for them to grow faster than we're going to grow and I guess I'm going to be on the optimistic side, as the Vice Chairman was, in regard to exports It seems to me that our policy ought to be designed to keep nominal GNP in the 4 to 5 percent range and hope that we get a fantastic real GNP out of those numbers If we hold to that kind of a pattern, then I think there's ample opportunity to [get] the exports we need to do or [get] the crowding out of imports I think we're now moving in the period where that has to take place So, Mr Chairman, I also favor ""B;"" but frankly, I'm more of the symmetric mind in the sense that I would like us to be in a position that we not make another move in the near future without having a real concerted discussion of the FOMC concerning that "
710,1990-03-27," There's no problem because they are out of money in their Exchange Stabilization Fund   Where?   Yes, that would be risky for them   It seems to me first of all that the very first principle is that the Treasury, with its official foreign exchange capability, and the Federal Reserve are inevitably linked in an endeavor Even if we did not engage in foreign exchange operations, we could still have the possibility of a conflict between Treasury's    3/27/90  official foreign exchange position and basic monetary policy; and it could become a conflict at the Congressional level if we decided that monetary policy was going to be for a strong dollar and if the Treasury said they wanted a weak dollar So, I don't think we can back away and say somehow or other let's wash our hands of it That won't work I think it is important that the Federal Reserve continue its educational process Now, I'm very happy with what has happened I'm happy on two scores In the first place I'm happy because the Federal Reserve is now, it seems to me, at a consensus position regarding the dollar The problem that I had for so long was that we had so many in the Federal Reserve who saw a foreign exchange depreciation as a technique to resolve the foreign trade balance, which was in conflict with our price level stability goals And I'm delighted, Mr Chairman, that today this organization now seems to be together for the first time, which says that depreciation is not going to be used as a device to solve the trade balance problem We're going to solve that problem some other way So, it seems to me we've made tremendous progress  Now, when the Treasury wishes to engage in dollar depreciation in order to satisfy a short-term political objective, that's very dangerous and we ought not to participate in it We ought to be willing to join in when we believe that the purposes are reasonable and give them some allowance in that regard But when it comes to the point of having it appear to the nations and the capital markets of the world that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve want a depreciation of the dollar, that invites catastrophe and we can't be a part of that Now, it seems to me we've made progress on that score We no longer have that high risk Selling dollars to drive the dollar down is a process that a central bank can engage in without a limit We can create all the dollars we want to create and there's no stopping it Frankly, when it is published that the Federal Reserve did not participate, I think that's going to give the Treasury a great deal of pause; I think they're going to be more careful and are going to listen to us more carefully than they did before The fact of the matter is, Mr Chairman, that in 1989 they continued to the point of building up balances that are unprecedented and those balances subject them to foreign exchange speculative risk and they subject us to that risk And sooner or later, if you stake those kinds of positions, you're going to have a Congressional inquiry and the whole operation is going to be tarred I think it's very [unintelligible] that we're setting out to do When we first did the Plaza Accord that seemed to be somewhat well understood When we first did the Louvre Accord that seemed to be somewhat well understood in regard to broad ranges But we've been asked to engage in the selling of dollars at a time in which no one knew what the down side was in regard to the deutschemark market as we were selling yen, and in this [untenable] position that the Treasury was in I think we had no choice but to separate ourselves from that risk Mr Chairman, I'm delighted we have But I will be more delighted when we get some kind of reasonable plan to deal with the large balances that we now have and some notion as to how they can be worked back down There are uncertainties that really are impacting this market No one understands what's happening to the yen at this point At one time we had some reasonable understanding as to why [exchange rates] were moving But we are now in a period of risk And I think it's just extraordinary that we've made this kind of statement; it's going to be significant when it's announced I think it is going to have an impact when it is published that the Federal  -56-    3/27/90  Reserve stepped back from it Now, I believe in doing this that we ought to be careful not to do it and turn out to be wrong [Unintelligible] then, of course, we would lose credibility But I think we've protected ourselves But I would like to see the next plan, which is Where do we go from here? What is to be done with the balances? When are we ever to sell currencies? That's what I think would be helpful to have your comments on   But by and large, Jerry, if the Federal Reserve had pursued a rigorously tight monetary policy in 1978 we would not have had to go out with our hat in our hand   If we pursue a rigorous monetary policy toward price level stability, the fear of a weak dollar is gone   Oh, I agree with you   But that's why we shouldn't add to our stock of yen at 138 and 142, because then we lose the ability to do it when we need to do it to stop an overshoot   But, Alan, you don't think the Treasury wants to be out there floating in the wind by themselves on this issue They really want us in, don't you think?   All right   Made a difference   You believe that?   Yes   But proper monetary policy is behind the world's willingness to take our claims If the Federal Reserve had not tightened and grown our money stock at a 4 percent rate for two years, the world would not have taken those claims   Not all   Right Some of us said that was not to be--   But the foreign exchange intervention works because it has monetary policy behind it   The possibility that you're gaining time by the Treasury [intervening] without us is a paper floating in the wind They can accomplish nothing   The mistake was that they did not use monetary policy consistent with that  -68-    3/27/90   Mr Chairman, could we vote on these separately? The Exchange Stabilization Fund, it seems to me, is a somewhat different question than the $25 billion   I don't see why that needs confrontation   Mr Chairman, I certainly don't want to put you in a position of in a sense not having the authority you need to go to the G-7 or to the Treasury to work [unintelligible] From the very beginning on this I've wanted to take actions that strengthen your hand, not those that cause you to be disempowered I think that's very important I do believe there's another alternative I believe the first question we need to face is the Exchange Stabilization Fund That was created by an act of Congress Is that true, Virgil?  [MR MATTINGLY(?)] Yes   All right And in a sense there was an appropriation of money, maybe out of another fund?   Nevertheless, it was an act of Congress that made the funds available But it's also true is it not, Virgil, that there is some question in regard [to the warehousing]? That is, our engaging in foreign exchange operations is, we believe, something that we have sound grounds on As our attorney you can say we can go with that one But you don't know whether we have sound grounds in regard to the warehousing, do you? You don't know in a court that we could win on that one, do you?   But I want to understand what the constitutional principles involved here are, or the law   No, I'm not talking about operations  SPEAKER(?) All three   No, I wasn't asking about the history I'm asking you as our General Counsel I don't know the answer to this question I'm asking you as General Counsel Is there a reasonable prospect that if it came to court, that we would win in court? Or is there some doubt on the warehousing?   But it has never been tested before?   Well,--   But my view goes beyond that to say that I believe the Constitution gives the Congress of the United States the power to appropriate I believe for us to do warehousing, which in a sense removes from Congress this appropriation power, is at best a [legally] risky proposition I know that I've voted in the past for increasing the warehousing authority, but I didn't know what I was  -74-    3/27/90  doing in voting for such a proposition But now that I know that in doing that it eliminates the necessity for the Treasury to go to the Congress to get an appropriation, I can't do that as a matter of principle until the courts tell me that we can Now, the courts told me on another issue that I thought was an issue but--   On the SDR certificates?   But, you see, I'm worried that the Shadow Open Market Committee and others are waiting to pounce because when you hold currencies in the size that we hold them, at some point in time you're going to have some losses   And I believe that in that atmosphere at some point in time this is apt to become a political issue And if it becomes a political issue, I believe it is incumbent upon us to protect the Federal Reserve's position, which is not to go around the Congressional appropriation that other warehousing would tend to do   But I do not believe that members of the Appropriations Committee understand this issue I do not think that they know their appropriations power is being subverted by our warehousing arrangement And I for one choose to stand in the more  -75-    3/27/90  pure position which is to say if in doubt, let's ask the Treasury to go to the Congress And when the Treasury goes to Congress and the Congress appropriates the funds or if the Congress passes a law saying [it is appropriate] for us to be warehousing them, then the Federal Reserve's risk is gone   Well, but I don't see that the present arrangement really has proved superior to that We either make some gain here, Mr Chairman--because if that's what we wish to accomplish, we would never have ended up with a $45 billion fund if our view had been very persuasive   Well, it goes beyond that The fund has become so large that it does have a risk; in a sense it puts us in a position of what I would call speculating in foreign currencies because it goes beyond what it seems to me is the demonstrated need as a reserve currency country for us to have this facility [to conduct] our operations   But, Jerry, we are the reserve currency of the world and that's quite different than other countries who [unintelligible] have to look to a dollar exchange standard and historically held--   Well, I prefer to take the cautious view   And yet we would know--   Well, yes But if we're going to surface them, why don't we surface them before we do it? Why are we waiting until it's a fait accompli before we surface them?   If we have a reasonable chance, it's going to be on the Exchange Stabilization Fund in the immediate future If we're going to ask about it, we better ask them now   Now we're claiming that is an open market operation, as I understand it Is that correct?  SPEAKER(?) Collateralized [RP]   Is that what we're claiming? So what we're claiming is that the Exchange Stabilization Fund is a foreign exchange operation Now, do we do that on Treasuries? When we buy do we buy new Treasury issues from the Treasury or do we buy them from--?   In exchange for maturing issues But we never buy new Treasury issues directly because we're not sure we have the power to do that kind of an open market operation, is that correct?   Okay So, we don't have the power to do that open market operation and now everyone tells me we do have the power to do this operation because we've done it in the past and nobody's caught us on it?   But it's not open market operations   Well, Ed, I'm not seeking a confrontation with the Treasury I simply want the Treasury to go to the Congress and get the appropriation power I don't agree with the rest of you who have opinions about the political outcome as to what the political outcome will be   Of course they won't do that   Well, the Treasury is not going to go to Congress over this issue I feel certain they will not   No   An extension of that limit-- "
711,1990-03-27," Models   Mike, one of the interesting parts of monetary policy is that we have options of being sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect on the forecast, but we also can be sometimes bold and sometimes timid I'm wondering why it is that in your forecast you have us being so timid That is, you're saying 100 basis points higher on short-term interest rates toward the end of the year Well, if you're correct in your forecast, why not bring that interest rate increase by and large into the second quarter? Wouldn't that produce a better achievement of Federal Reserve objectives? That would, of course, make Ted's forecast wrong But wouldn't that be the bold thing to do, Mike?   So--   Well, I'm reading into your answer that you're suggesting we be timid because you think you may be wrong That's always the wise thing to do to be timid if you think you may be wrong But clearly what you've shown on the path in regard to the employment gap that you believe is necessary for price level stability is not occurring as rapidly in the 1990 forecast as you had anticipated previously And I guess one [unintelligible] your lack of boldness in wanting to create that kind of employment gap so as to achieve the proper price level improvement for 1991, because clearly the 1991 price level forecast is unacceptable   Well, I may have done you a disservice because you may have been forecasting that we wouldn't be bold rather than--   No further questions   [Unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I don't have anything to say at this time I'll listen carefully to your recommendation "
712,1990-03-27," Mr Chairman, I agree with your assessment I would just as soon have ""B"" symmetric, with our watching it very carefully during the intermeeting period and being particularly tuned to any developments in any of the leading indicators that would help us to know [more] in regard to timing It does seem to me that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is increasingly through the foreign exchange rate and that having a somewhat higher foreign exchange value of the dollar does get us somewhat closer to the effects that we would have had with a somewhat lower dollar and with a 25 basis point increase in [interest rates] It just seems to me, Mr Chairman, that foreign exchange markets at this point would be destabilized by an unexpected move on our part; that would buy us more problems rather than less "
776,1990-05-15," Mike, if you pursued a gradual reduction in the rate of inflation, it's quite likely, isn't it, that the noise may at times obscure any trend of progress? That's more apt to happen in a gradual reduction approach than if there were a significant recession   So, even though in some ways this may not give the Committee a sense of a lot of achievement, you think it would be different than that if we did not pursue this course?    5/15/90   Well, I appreciate very much your laying out the policy options for us that you have   Yes, Mr Chairman, we do have some good news out there that I think we ought to talk about We only did $50 million in foreign exchange intervention during the intermeeting period and I'm most grateful for that In fact, I'm so grateful that I didn't even talk about the ESF after having an antagonizing document in front of me But there's more good news than that I counted out about 15 segments of industries in which expansion seems to be the order of the day Quite often, I think we become somewhat impacted by those that are having the pain; those industries having a slowdown are more vocal than those in which things are looking up I was used to that with farmers always describing things as mediocre or middling during times when we had boom conditions and most of the rest of time describing conditions as poor In terms of the small business outlook, I think we had a diffusion index this morning that demonstrated the same sort of thing that is, if you have as many people saying the outlook is positive as you have saying that it's negative, then it's really boom conditions So, I think we have to steel ourselves to the fact that there is going to be some pain out there And, of course, when that pain involves people getting used to house prices not rising as in the  -22-    5/15/90  past, and in some cases coming down, we're going to feel that and see that But that may be better news in regard to attitudes about money than we realize When people see house prices going up 15 percent per year, I'm not sure whether that in some ways undermines their sense of value for money And when all of a sudden the peak on selling their house passed, a lot of people said ""My goodness! Why didn't I sell it earlier?"" It's sort of an attitude of I want money; I'd like to have dollar balances  So, I think this kind of pain may be a precursor for some better inflation numbers The fact of the matter is, however, that there are some troublesome things on the inflation front Basically, commodity prices are still rather troublesome, as far as I can see I don't care what index you look at, unless you get into some very specialized ones, there does not seem to be the kind of improvement that you'd expect to see Look at corn prices, soybean prices Wheat prices went up because there was an announcement of a large increase But it really is a troublesome indication to see commodity prices move up as much as they did and then not move back down I would agree that at a time when the pain seems to be pervasive in many households, and when M2 and M3 seem to be growing very, very slowly, that information ought not be ignored I'd like to close by suggesting, when we are talking about a soft landing, that in any way the landing occurs it certainly has been soft but there is an element in which an airplane wing as it approaches the ground gets what we call ""ground effect"" Ground effect means that you have an opportunity to have more lift than you otherwise would have because of the proximity of the ground As we're approaching the 90th month of this expansion, we haven't had any abrupt pullups that might result in stalled spins because after a stalled spin the wind does not produce much ground effect as the plane comes crashing in   But the implication is that I think we have to be prepared to understand that our economy may have more ability to operate below 2 percent for longer periods of time without getting into negative numbers To me that's an encouraging bit of news I, for one, do not believe that there are factors out there that are producing a recession in the immediate horizon "
777,1990-05-15," I'm somewhat tempted, Mr Chairman, to counterbalance by having a governor vote for tightness to offset Mr Hoskins' dissent so that we don't continue this issue about presidents versus governors on the tightening side But I guess that really wouldn't be a logical basis for me to cast my vote I would note that of the presidents who are voting only two out of five of them could muster a tightness in their [policy stance] But of the ones who are not voting, four out of five can muster tightness, which I think probably is what gives the presidents the reputation for being hawks You presidents really are hawks when you don't have a vote!   It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that you are correct that there is some uncertainty right now And that uncertainty is such that, even though I'm in the mood to tighten and I was hoping we would be tightening, I do believe that it would be much better for us to wait a couple of weeks and see what happens in that time We could act at that point in time rather than run the risk of tightening and then have conditions go in such a direction that our credibility is lost on the other side and that we would not be able to do what we need to do when we have to do it So, in that sense, I'm very sympathetic with your position, Mr Chairman I certainly understand why prudence is in that direction I would prefer that the directive would read tighten now, but I can vote in the affirmative with the understanding that we're very close together with some consensus here which says that we deem this attack against inflation to be a very high priority; that we think following that priority gives the economic expansion more of an opportunity to develop and to strengthen and to lengthen than not to do it; that we are steeled to be ready to do what has to be done some time in the future; and that that is not to be deterred because there's a little bit of pain [involved] I had been hoping we could get there in a painless way but, frankly, what I have learned in 4-1/4 years tells me it's tougher than I thought I know from the experience in 1986 that once we've eased it sometimes takes a lot longer for us to change direction to tighten than it does to stop tightening and ease, because everybody likes to ease I just have a very strong compulsion at this point to  -32-    5/15/90  be looking for an opportunity to get the fed funds rate up to where I think it ought to be I'd be much more satisfied with an 8-3/4 percent fed funds rate than with an 8-1/4 percent rate I just don't think today is the time to do it I certainly hope we'll be ready to do it when we need to   Well, I don't get credit for it Alternative B, asymmetric "
827,1990-08-21," It does seem that looking at the real economy provides some benchmark that we can use to make our estimates about the future But, certainly, the latest revisions make it very clear that, when some quarters in 1989 that were originally around 3 percent are revised to 17 percent, we have to be very careful about thinking about that kind of precision I am somewhat optimistic about the real economy in regard to the performance of net exports I think the strong current dollar net exports in the second quarter will certainly switch to very strong real net exports in the third and fourth quarters, as the price patterns in the second quarter reverse  The monetary aggregates now have fallen into the category of being interesting I used to think they were much more than interesting, having had four years in which the growth of the aggregates has been down, with M2 below 5 percent Whether you're measuring M2 over four years, three years, two years, or one year, its  -26-    8/21/90  growth is very close to 4-1/2 percent But the fact of the matter is, according to the staff forecast, we're probably going to end up with the highest year-over-year CPI inflation since 1981 That means the results in nine years have been better than the results this year Certainly, for an old fashioned monetarist that gives one pause Now, that doesn't mean that the monetary aggregates are not important; it probably just means that we have to look to somewhat lower M2 growth rates to achieve our objective than we first thought necessary We can also look at real interest rates, which I think are a very crude check in regard to distinguishing between periods in which monetary policy is apparently very easy, as it was in the 1970s, versus the real interest rates that prevailed in the 1980s, which in general were in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range Certainly, it seems likely, given the tax changes with regard to the deductibility of interest, that those real interest rates are consistent with inducing a change in household savings patterns And in a sense, I think all of us ought to be much more enthused than we are regarding the level of consumer spending It seems to me that the saving rate in the United States is not too high and that, consequently, some rise in the saving rate-- which means a diminution in the rate of growth of consumer spending-- is exactly what the doctor would order  Now, it seems to me that a look at forward-looking indicators really can [help one] begin to pinpoint a bit better when monetary policy has been easy and when it has been restrained And those forward-looking indicators clearly show that monetary policy in 1988 and after maybe the first three quarters of 1989 were indicative of rather significant restraint Whether you're looking at commodity prices, the yield curve, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar, you get a confirmation of the fact that the money growth prevailing at that time did not enable enough liquidity to be out there to support upward movements of commodity prices and it supported the exchange value of the dollar But, frankly, it seems to me that over the last nine months we have moved--though not from a monetaristic determined way of looking at monetary policy--from monetary restraint to monetary ease I don't think it has been an abrupt move; I think it has been a very gradual move And we probably have not altered the real interest rates significantly, or so dramatically as to [foster] too much expansion in the period ahead But I think it is quite apparent that the yield curve is indicating that participants in the real market are suggesting that the appropriate rates of interest are higher than we may be providing Certainly, [that can be seen in] commodity prices The staff did me the favor in Chart 7 of indexing these commodity prices to the first quarter of 1986, which is in some way a little embarrassing for me because I talked about keeping those commodity prices within a range of 10 percent up or 10 percent down from where they were in the first quarter And when I look at all commodities, the index at almost 140 means that we had an 8 percent annual growth rate over a 4-1/2 year period All commodities except crude oil show a 5 percent annual rate of gain; and that's not stability in those prices So monetary restraint does not seem to be characteristic of this era When you look at the bottom chart, all commodities except food and crude oil--which takes out some of the variabilities of agricultural policy--it looks like we have had a very significant trend line of rising prices over the last 11 months So, there's nothing there that gives me any indication that monetary policy at this moment is too restrained Indeed, if the foreign exchange value of the dollar continues to fall at the rate it has been falling--since  -27-    8/21/90  really over the last 10 months--it's a rather significant event, which with the recent movements in gold prices I think could be an outright devaluation And that only occurs during periods of monetary ease, not monetary restraint So, I'm somewhat of the view that we have already eased And I'm of the view that that ease, if it takes hold prior to the time that we get a breakout of the rate of inflation from the rut we have been in on the down side, is going to give us one heck of a problem in the years ahead "
828,1990-08-21," I'm encouraged by your confidence in M2 and, Mr Chairman, I want to believe you're right I think [your proposal] is in a somewhat acceptable range and I certainly do agree that we need to have more information to move Although somewhat satisfied with the range that you stated, my preference would actually be ""B"" with a tilt toward restraint But I don't know that that restraint would need to take place by an increase in interest rates I just believe that there's some confusion in the marketplace in regard to what it is that we are about And if there were some way of communicating your call for stability, and that includes price level stability, then I believe that we would have a much better chance to get long-term  -38-    8/21/90  interest rates down My guess is that if we were to move the fed funds rate up 25 basis points that that would be quite a surprise and that it would be taken as an indication of our not accommodating this oil price phenomenon And frankly, I would expect long bond rates to come down as much as short-term rates go up Now, I realize it's a lot easier to suggest that when you're not Chairman than it is when you are, but that's my guess In periods of low growth in which the housing industry is under such a serious restraint that it does make other consumer goods areas vulnerable to the downturn, it is important to have lower long-term rates; and those lower long-term rates come with reduced inflation expectations I believe if the world knows the Federal Reserve stands as the guardian of the value of the US dollar in purchasing goods and services in our market, which also includes a stable value of the dollar abroad, then we would do wonders for interest rates and actually increase the chances for the higher real growth that I think some of you would like to see   One "
879,1990-10-02," Mike, following up on David Mullins' questions in regard to the fourth quarter I note that you have nominal GNP at 26 percent for that quarter If my memory serves me correctly, we hardly had any quarters in the 1981-1982 recession that had nominal GNP that low That 26 percent is an extremely low nominal number I wondered How does V2 on a one-quarter lag basis look with 26 percent? We really have a fair idea, don't we Don, as to where M2 might be in the third quarter relative to the second quarter? We could put that to bed and then take this number [and determine] what kind of a V2 change we would have   Yes   I noticed that   But on the nominal [GNP] there's also a rather significant move back from what looks like a 1990 nominal of about 5 percent That's not for the [calendar] year, but for the Q2-to-Q2 period; then it looks as though it goes from 5 percent nominal to 7 percent nominal But I don't think it needs any more elaboration   There really has not been any money shock that has synchronized all the sectors of the economy and there is no inventory correction cycle underway This is not a recession as generally defined Never before have we had a recession in which monetary policy eased 12 months prior to what somebody says was the likely high point I don't agree that June was, but somebody thinks it was It clearly is a synchronized slowdown in the US economy, but it is more in the nature of an event related to buildings and real estate and, consequently, banks and thrifts We have to be careful if we really want to be forward looking, not to look backward at the real economy If you are trying to be forward-looking, that's always a disaster; you can't get ahead by looking backward  Now, I think there are some considerable risks, but those risks are in the years out ahead, not in the 6 months ahead of us The considerable risk is that we will go through this slowdown event and end up with inflation at a rate of 6 or 7 percent and end up with a set of easings that tips the dollar loose I do agree with the analysis of Sam Cross that there still is a safe-haven effect on the dollar The considerable risk is that we will throw the monetary policy tool away before we have the ability to use it I would not enjoy being in a situation of a declining dollar with all that means for future inflation That could then mean that inflation doesn't peak in the third and fourth quarters of 1990; the peak might be out there further ahead So, it seems to me that the exchange value of the dollar is a real restraint on us, but I don't see any reason to admit that to anyone outside this room But I would hate to see us get into a position where we no longer have any potential to do it because we have a spread of 300 or 400 basis points between the Treasury bill rate and the 30-year Treasury It seems to me that under those circumstances then, the fears that people have about downward risks certainly would be justified So, I think there is considerable risk I do believe the US economy has a lot of recuperative ability [Unintelligible]--and I'm not able to tell as well as David is how each of the parts go--but if monetary policy is  -37-    10/2/90  reasonably steady and stable, then I think the adjustment mechanisms can take place and can take place in an environment in which we get some of these corrections made I must admit that when I first came on board I was pleased that we had engaged in monetary policy actions that I think avoided a recession in 1986 But looking back on it, I have a feeling that what has happened in Boston and in New England and elsewhere would not have been carried to such excesses, if we had let a correction take place a little earlier So, I'm just urging caution "
880,1990-10-02," Sam, what would be the odds of the dollar engaging in a significant downward move if we stand pat on policy-- that is, take the third alternative?   So, we could be somewhat encouraged to believe that it might be stable or even slightly strong again?   For the Federal Reserve and commercial banks it's a scheduled holiday   We don't know how to read M2, and certainly we don't know how to read it disaggregated That's nonsense   I'm arguing that we do not have sufficient knowledge about where the increased liquidity is located or whether or not being located one place versus another place makes a difference  -48-    10/2/90   But we do not know that the motive for holding the assets is what affects behavior   But does anybody believe that if someone has $40,000 in a money market mutual fund that he is less apt to buy an automobile than if he had the $40,000 in--   But when the stocks were sold, someone bought the stocks There's no use going on I'm not going to be convinced! [Laughter]   I agree with the decision that Tom Melzer has expressed and I also agree with what Bob Parry has suggested Monetary policy does its job best when it looks at the price level And this is not a monetary event in terms of its cause and it is not a good precedent to have a linkup with fiscal policy It really is the worst form of fine tuning because it is being made on the basis of the real economy and then it is linked up with fiscal policy And it has the potential of being 50 basis points, so I cannot support this policy action   Could we just be asymmetric and then see what happens in the marketplace after the budget deal and then you simply would have the authority [to call for a move]? Or do you feel you'd be in a position of saying yes or no?   Yes   Okay, in other words we will have asymmetric language and it will be simply the Chairman's judgment   But it's sort of like what we had in July?   Okay That's my point   Mr Chairman, in light of our abilities on the funds rate, I wonder whether it would be a little more accurate to pull that range in a bit The 400 basis points--   Okay   Yes "
939,1990-11-13," Second   You want to devalue also?   Mr Chairman, I agree that the problem you were referring to is ludicrous, but I do believe that we need to make up our mind by the next meeting about what we're going to do It would be better for us to deal with it before there's a crisis I would like to suggest, Mr Chairman, that the Committee be open to your recommendations at our next meeting as to what--   Well, I wasn't really thinking about gold I was thinking about our collateral problem I believe that we ought not to wait until we need to make a loan and then at that time have to deal with this It would be far better for us to make up our mind ahead of time than to wait until we need to make a discount window loan The time we need to make a discount window loan is going to be the worst time to make the changes   Well, I wasn't thinking of anything quite that large, but--   It's the law We would either have to send the letter back to Congress and say we don't mean to do it anymore or we'd have to get rid of some foreign currency holdings Or we have another suggestion--   Mr Chairman, since we have some policy considerations ahead of us, I would support waiting until that is done before we deal with this issue   Well, it does seem to me that there might be one alternative that would get us a little more volatility in the fed funds rate And if we did have more volatility in the fed funds rate, then the 4 percent range specified could be a clear indication of what we were doing Now, it may be unlikely that there will be a majority who would wish to do that   If we are willing to admit we're targeting the fed funds rate   Mr Chairman, I'm sorry I brought it up   Well, all the ""somewhats"" and ""slights"" and ""mights"" in the operational paragraph imply that we might do something "
940,1990-11-13," Mike, on the personal saving rate, how much of that oil tax hike was absorbed by the personal saving rate?  -16-    11/13/90   Our analytics tell us that consumer spending should be weak And consumer sentiment looks like it's in a free fall But the data we have don't yet show it, is that right?   I've been noticing as I've been listening to the comments around the table that in reflecting we quite often use the words symmetric and asymmetric And I've been thinking that there's somewhat of a lack of symmetry in regard to the way we're approaching two quarters of expected growth below where we'd like it to be I have a feeling that if we had [in prospect] two quarters of growth above where we would want it to be, there wouldn't be near the kind of alarm and the wondering about how we're going to get it down three quarters from now so we only have two quarters of boom But you can't have six quarters or seven or eight quarters that are stronger than you want and then turn around and have two that are less than you want and come out with anything like price stability Some of you talk as if the worst case scenario is that we might not get this recession, if we're in one And I'm about as sure as David Mullins is on that; it clearly is very soft But some of you are worried that we're not going to get out of it in two quarters The only recession that I remember that was five or six months in length didn't make a single bit of difference in regard to the underlying rate of inflation This is not an event induced by a monetary shock event It might be a culmination of monetary restraint, but it's not a monetary shock event And if we try to jab our way out with a monetary reaction, we might very well find ourselves worse off than we were before In other words, I think we have to have more confidence that the system will work and that we don't have to have a policy that in a sense is countercyclical; we just have to avoid policy that's procyclical, because I believe that the recovery forces in the kind of economy we have out there will be in place So, I'm a little more worried about balancing our way back out of it before we get the imbalances corrected If we're in a recession and it takes three or four quarters to get out and we get the price level thing together, then it seems to me that we have a much better chance to avoid what we most wish to avoid  I think the question is Can we get out of this situation without having a downside event? And it seems to me a downside event is not now in place It seems to me that we run the risk of having some other events take place which could cause destabilization in  -37-    11/13/90  financial markets, and that's when we're going to be in real difficulty I think That's why I join with those who worry about the foreign exchange value of the dollar We are a reserve currency country that has a good deal of the world's claims that rest with us And the global ability to take one's money and go is much more volatile than I think we've ever experienced before So, to get ourselves in a position in which our rate of inflation is higher and our interest rates are dramatically lower than those of major competitive reserve currency countries--and if we begin to move dramatically on policy in that kind of environment--seems to me is most likely to precipitate a destabilization of markets Now, I agree that the financial situation and financial institutions pose risks and I don't favor interest rate targeting But clearly if we have an end of the year kind of event, interest rate targeting might be exactly what keeps that from getting out of hand in a sense, Mr Chairman That is, interest rate targeting in that kind of environment does mean that we might end up supplying a few more reserves at the end of the year than we may be anticipating doing So, my view is that the foreign exchange value of the dollar will be okay even if it drifts downward in an environment in which price level corrections are evident to all That is, if we see the rate of inflation really coming around and if we have commodity prices that are deflating, then in that atmosphere I believe we can have considerable ease without being disruptive But I think it's pretty risky for us to get too premature with all that "
941,1990-11-13," Mr Chairman, I can live with your formulation because it seems to me that you placed the emphasis upon the tenuousness of the situation And it does not indicate that, except under the best conditions, we would go farther I would comment in regard to M2 that I could very well support a regime in which you announce and thus the whole world knew what we were doing with M2 and would thereby not conceive of it as an easing Because in a sense, if we were on an M2 regime, this would not be an easing And I think the foreign exchange markets might interpret it as not being an easing I have a little difficulty with--   Yes, I know I have a little difficulty trying to blend this formulation of policy with that one because it's hard for the foreign exchange markets to know exactly what it is we're doing But the bottom line is I could live with your formulation   In a sense you didn't want to change the directive; you wanted to leave it the way it was?   But basically, you have a kind of balance in your recommendation, which is a little unusual   Why do that? "
1003,1990-12-18," I think looking at the M2 growth is always a good place to start It seems to me that there is clearly a very significant downtrend over a four-year period in the growth rate of the monetary aggregates But so far there has not been what you would call a classical monetary shock; that is, the rate of growth actually has been brought down in a very gradual pattern It is true that the rate of growth over 26 weeks is now getting close to a level at which I think anyone would be concerned if that were to continue to weaken on a 26-week basis But I would just note that in 1987 and 1989 we had almost identical periods of weakness on a 26-week basis Clearly, we ought not ignore what those monetary aggregates are saying But I would note, as Tom Melzer did to a degree, that the yield curve doesn't really suggest that we have a monetary tightness phenomenon that's being driven by the central bank; that is, the slow [money] growth is not driving short-term rates above money market rates We have just the opposite The yield curve basically shows that there is  -20-    12/18/90  quite a bit of monetary liquidity out there The foreign exchange market also I think shows considerable monetary easing; that is, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy for the United States is increasingly through the foreign exchange mechanism Certainly we've had a considerable, 15 percent decline, of the dollar against the G-10 currencies That is a factor for domestic stimulus Commodity prices it seems to me are showing more money neutrality than they are monetary restraint That is, you have some fall-back in commodity prices, but you don't have the rate of deflation in commodity prices that set in during the 1985-1986 era and that really became pervasive  Of the factors that we have going for us, the two factors I'd like to mention that are difficult to judge are the phenomena of house prices and other real estate Unfortunately, there's no futures market for housing But I think we ought to begin thinking about housing and other real estate more as if they were a commodity, because clearly what has been happening here is really [similar] to what happened in the agricultural depression of the mid-1980s, which was a rather short, sharp depression in agriculture What we see happening is that the forward price is not rising as fast as it was expected to have been rising before Now, if someone has a 10-year horizon and expects house prices to rise at a 10 percent annual rate, that would mean a $100,000 house would be worth $269,000 in 10 years But if all of a sudden you think it will rise not at 10 percent but at a 5 percent rate, then instead of $269,000 you're looking at $163,000 for the 10-year forward price That means that the forward price has to come down about 37 to 40 percent If the forward price comes down faster than long-term interest rates, then of course the present value is also going to fall But that doesn't mean that housing inflation is gone; it just means an adjustment from a 10 percent housing inflation environment to a 5 percent housing inflation environment What makes this so tricky is that houses have so much to do with household perceptions of wealth Consequently, household saving behavior is certainly impacted I think all of us understand that we're seeing a long-cycle event in regard to attitudes here  The other area of uncertainty, it seems to me, relates to the fact that the US economy is increasingly competitive in a global marketplace The international competition just means that there will not be sustained profit margins in any industry such as there were in former times when there was less vigorous international competition Now, the problem that concerns me here is the advent of failure and whether or not we might be falling into a turnaround in an expansion in an international economic order and we turn that into a protectionist world in which international trade stops growing That event then, of course, could lead the world into a most precarious circumstance In that regard I think we should be rather careful about policies that might cause the foreign exchange value of the dollar to weaken further, which in some sense can be a very strong motivating factor in regard to protectionism elsewhere We have enough protectionist forces in the United States And when we start seeing these protectionist forces hit the European Economic Community, as I think is entirely possible where the foreign exchange value of the dollar is right now, it means that we're going to crowd in there at a rate that they're not going to like--not just in agriculture but in other areas So, that's an uncertainty that causes me to think more than once  -21-    12/18/90 "
1004,1990-12-18," Yes, Don, I just wanted to comment Of course, the problem that occurs by the Federal Open Market Committee moving away from the borrowing targeting is that we thereby take away the separation between the discount rate decision, which is the Board of Governors decision with the recommendations of the Reserve Bank boards as a factor If the Federal Open Market Committee really were to choose a fed funds target precisely--if we said we want it to be 7 percent, say--then under those circumstances there is no monetary power left with the Board of Governors and Reserve Bank District boards as we'd normally see As long as we maintain the charade of a borrowing targeting then that separation of function can still be there, it seems to me That is, as long as we write the FOMC minutes based upon the charade of borrowing then the old practice can still be there   Well, I don't want to get into a discussion about the discount rate I can argue both sides of that  -31-    12/18/90   But I do think in this discussion we ought to recognize that it might be desirable--that is, the Committee and the Board may wish to consider maintaining a policy that does not wipe out this distinction we've historically used And I would not be for that kind of a change [unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, but I just want to be sure that we're maintaining as best we can the fine line I wonder if you could accommodate that to mean that we would be voting here for alternative B symmetric toward ease, and then you as Chairman of the Committee would have some discretion over the intermeeting period, particularly as you sat with the Board of Governors in regard to the discount rate   Here again, I'm thinking that the way policy runs and has run over the last several years is that at some period of time the Federal Open Market Committee has the balance of power That is, during periods in which interest rates are increasing, ordinarily the fed funds rate moves up as pressures are put on the fed funds rate In a sense the Reserve Bank directors and the Board of Governors have a standby policy And even [when the rate is] on the way down that's also the case Now, on the way up a point is reached where the distance between the fed funds rate and the discount rate gets so wide that no one is willing to allow that kind of a subsidy, so then the balance swings to the Reserve Bank directors and the Board of Governors And until someone convinces me otherwise, I would favor maintaining that [balance] And I would favor the FOMC saying at this point in time that the direction of interest rates downward now largely rests with the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks and with the Board of Governors In a sense it's kind of a flip-flop I think we ought to hear a debate on that question and see if there's a better way to do it   No, I was suggesting that with our asymmetry toward ease we delegate to the Chairman the decision as to whether or not the full 50 points show through or only 25 show through I'm just trying to keep it technical so that the FOMC is only talking about the so-called pressure or [existing] pressure between the fed funds rate and the discount rate But in the intermeeting period, given the uncertainty in the FOMC about what the Board will do, the Chairman would have the discretionary authority And if the Board chose not to move the discount rate, the Chairman then could go ahead and immediately move the fed funds rate by 25 basis points So, I'm not talking about any difference in outcome in terms of what the Chairman is suggesting; I'm just talking about the technical manner   Well, I think the Chairman has made it clear that he would expect to move the fed funds rate   I'm not talking about any change in outcome from what the Chairman is proposing   Mr Chairman, I think the FOMC ought to talk about the distance between the fed funds rate and the discount rate, and they ought to be advising us along with the boards of directors And I think the Board of Governors should decide this question   Any time we've moved the discount rate, except September 3 of 1987, we've moved the fed funds rate the same amount as the discount rate   I understand that and as I suggested, Jerry, there's another side of that issue In regard to that relationship I feel exactly as you do   Mr Chairman, I would like to comment on the monetary policy question rather than the technical one that I spoke to earlier My position is just about exactly identical with Tom Melzer's We have quite a few more months of rather unpleasant news ahead of us And if anyone is under the illusion that there are not going to be pressures to reduce the fed funds rate and the discount rate in January, and February, and March-- It seems to me that we have at least three more months of rather bad news because in spite of all the manifestations from looking at M2 I really believe that most of the members of the Committee are looking at the real economy And there's always a lag in regard to the information on the real economy That's why the Chairman was suggesting the problem in regard to our overshooting Now, I hope that this time around, Tom, there will be the votes to make the rather dramatic move, which may have to be made if you look at the forward looking indicators--the money stock, commodity prices, and the yield curve We could find ourselves in a position where we have to tighten before we have any real evidence that the economy has recovered And I think that's going to be very difficult to do So, Mr Chairman, I can go along with this, but my decided preference is to go much slower than 75 basis points a quarter And I mean 75 basis points a quarter If we continue to do that, at some point we're going to find out what the Foreign Desk warned us about the problem of the dollar It's almost as if there's a willingness to walk us there and we're going to find that we're  -42-    12/18/90  going to be blindfolded; we're going to walk in the dark and sometime we're going to find it And that frankly scares me So, I'm very uncomfortable voting to do what we're doing I do hope that the votes are going to be there when it is necessary and the time comes to tighten   But, Jerry, my view is that in the last quarter of 1986 everything really took off and we really ignored all those events Every money market watcher knew in March of 1987 what had happened and market interest rates soared and soared twice as much as what we did   Yes   On line 21-- I'm sorry, I may be ahead   I think lines 21-23 as proposed risk the mistake of our saying that the inflation is okay Do I have the wrong one? It is dated December 18th It says ""Consumer prices continue to increase moderately"" My view is that it would be better to say that consumer prices are rising moderately as compared to the rather strong rise that occurred in the first nine months of the year I'm afraid this will be interpreted as meaning that we think consumer prices during 1990 have been okay   That's fine "
1060,1991-03-26," My first reaction is that in the period from 1984 to the present things seem to have worked rather well in terms of the balance that's there Now, that's [using] the assumption that I have, which gives the FOMC certainly decided power If the FOMC uses a borrowing or reserve target of any kind, it in effect causes certain pressures [in reserve markets], and that makes the funds rate move in such and such a way in relation to the discount rate I don't see anything inconsistent with the FOMC deciding that they would like the funds rate to be approximately 50 or 75 or 100 or whatever basis points above the discount rate In that scenario, if the Board with the advice of the Reserve Banks changes the discount rate, the FOMC still has the last word in the sense that they could choose to make an adjustment of the spread between the discount rate and the fed funds rate So, it seems to me that in switching from reserve targeting to fed funds targeting, the fed funds targeting could be seen as targeting that [spread or] cushion of the fed funds rate above the discount rate And I don't see why that infers such new territory   That's right   I'm responding to Tom Melzer's comment because I think Tom is right at the heart of it I turn to the operational paragraph Now, maybe the operational paragraph is not accurate in regard to what we're doing But if it is not accurate, maybe we ought to change it The operational paragraph says the Committee seeks either to maintain or to decrease [or increase] the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions That's what we say the FOMC is doing And if we do that, we then are determining more or less the gap between the discount rate and the fed funds rate rather than the level of the fed funds rate Now, if the FOMC is determining the level of the fed funds rate, the operational paragraph doesn't say that Frankly, I like the operational paragraph as it is I think we can make it work well that way But if that's what it is, then the FOMC is not in a sense determining the fed funds rate; it's determining the pressure   The thing about the discount rate, which doesn't have any notion of the Board of Governor's or the FOMC's posture that's so important [unintelligible] We really have two policy tools One of them is a more subtle one That is, the open market operations can be more subtle and can have no announcement effect if we're not pegging the fed funds rate And I think all of us would prefer to have one tool that was subtle and not announced The other tool is an announcement tool And it has never made much sense to me to hit the gong, to make the announcement, and to say nothing   Mr Chairman, I would move without enthusiasm   Sam, what was the maximum dollar guide on these holdings before we began to pull back on the Exchange Stabilization Fund? What was the maximum you said we--   No, what was the maximum market value of the total Federal Reserve and Treasury holdings of deutschemarks and yen?   All right So, if you want to be able to buy and sell--you feel some handicap in regard to being that close--do you see the $53 billion as kind of a ceiling?   Let me put the question another way Let's suppose in the process of officially determining the US foreign exchange position that there is more of a tendency to want to intervene when the dollar is strong than there is to intervene when the dollar is weak Let's suppose we had that kind of posture officially What would tend to happen to the size of your fund over time if you're operating in that circumstance?   No, I'm asking what would happen to the size; I think you know the answer, Sam What would happen to the size of the fund?   They would accumulate Now, some of us are not quite as purist as Lee is on the intervention issue, although I do understand Lee's position But if we get ourselves in the circumstance where we are selling yen and deutschemarks when the dollar is weak and is very low by any measure of purchasing parity estimations, no matter how bad they are, then how in the world are we going to get the size of the fund down so that when the mark gets to 200 or 220--? I presume you're going to want to be buying deutschemarks then Is that the general assumption?   Well, Sam, I guess I'm really asking you Do you think it's possible or do you know of a way that we can bring more balance to the game in terms of [as much] enthusiasm for buying dollars as we have for selling dollars?   I think I know Sam's answer to these questions   You could have an exchange of puts In effect, you could swap puts and thereby assume that somebody would ultimately want to exercise that added advantage And that would effectively accomplish what you want to accomplish   There's one slight addendum to this discussion We have a reserve holding that costs us more money than what is reasonably in prospect to happen on foreign exchange rates and that is that we really are not a small reserve holding currency country I think we actually have official reserves of $85 billion, Sam, compared to Taiwan's $75 billion And if you mark our gold to the $358 price, we end up with something like $170 billion There are opportunity costs because we don't get interest on that gold as we do on our foreign exchange [holdings] That cost is out there also I would hesitate for us to have foreign currency holdings that have swap puts that just sit there, [which] is now becoming the case for our gold   Peter, would there have been a difference if we had not sent out the signal that borrowings were sort of okay? To what extent is the way we've accommodated to this due to the slightly different signal about borrowing?   Since this has worked in some ways better than some might have anticipated, what might happen if the Committee at some point in the future--I'm not suggesting now, but sometime in the future--wanted to go 25 or 50 basis points lower on the fed funds rate [than] the discount rate and we had at least this generous an attitude about the window? Would that possibly be a workable environment?   What you're saying then is that if there's some reason the Committee at some point in time wished to do that, you would not be alarmed about at least seeing what that's like?   I chose not to call it that  -22-    3/26/91 "
1061,1991-03-26," I didn't intend to follow right after Roger's comments about the wind It is true that the high plains do see heavy winds in March, but we always seem to gain soil rather than lose it   It seems to me that the staff's forecast is plausible But if I [differ] in any direction on the forecast, it is not so much in regard to the timing but that I lean toward a bit weaker view of households' penchant for consumption expenditures My hunch is that this recession has been different from others in regard to the [buildup] of debt and that the saving rate will tend to run a little higher in this recovery period I am slightly more optimistic in regard to net exports--although I know the staff is also optimistic--but maybe not quite enough to offset the difference of  -34-    3/26/91  somewhat flatter consumption expenditures, if there is any difference It just seems to me that this event, even at the manufacturing level or the business level, is going to be one in which recovery in spending may occur prior to that in unemployment So, I would expect the unemployment rate to continue to move up and maybe to approach 7 percent, even though we have this kind of expansion The talk about medical costs just has to be quite a factor [Unintelligible] union collective bargaining power in terms of the desire [of business firms] to maintain somewhat leaner labor costs So, I would expect it to be in the direction that the staff has but just slightly less than that, as I judge it  It does seem to me that the pickup in M2 growth is coinciding with some flattening of the commodity price deterioration And the commodity prices don't look exactly the way they sometimes look in a full-fledged recovery--that is, if a full-fledged recovery were underway right now But at the same time commodity prices certainly are not deteriorating the way they were as we were going into recession So, it looks to me as if we're close together in regard to the outlook, but maybe with a somewhat longer and less robust recovery path "
1062,1991-03-26," Mr Chairman, I can accept your suggestion for ""B"" symmetric I suppose I have a slight preference for an asymmetric directive on the side of tightness in that during periods of recession as we approach the trough it's very important to guard against easing during such a period I suppose the reason that I'm at that position  -42-    3/26/91  is that I notice the staff has a 69 percent nominal GNP growth path from Q2 1991 to Q2 1992, and 69 percent is a pretty heavy dose Now, I guess if I thought it were going to be 1 percent less, at 59 percent, I would feel more comfortable; I'd feel more comfortable if it were going to be at 5 percent because at this stage it's not the CPI or the fixed-weight deflator that counts, it's the GNP deflator that counts in terms of the crowding out [effect] That is, the only crowding out that occurs is on the GNP deflator And if the GNP deflator is at 3 percent and we have 5 percent nominal, we have plenty of room I just feel that 5 percent is more consistent with our progress toward price stability I do agree, Mr Chairman, that there is some bimodal possibility here, but the most likely way that a significant downturn could occur it seems to me is for the bond markets and the capital markets to become discouraged in regard to our progress on inflation And a run-up in long-term rates could be unfortunate in the fragile situation that we're in Now, I also agree with you and Governor Mullins that the exchange value of the dollar is more apt to be strong rather than weak later and I do agree that at some point in time that might be a factor, particularly if the price of gold were plummeting below $330 an ounce or something like that It's always possible that we could find ourselves in that environment, but I think we could take action at that time because the bond markets would be on our side So, I would prefer to be asymmetrical toward tightness I'm not giving much signal that I'm very enthusiastic about that other group changing that other tool "
1117,1991-05-14," There are indeed mixed signs out there But I think we should note that the three major forces that took us into a downturn are no longer there We no longer have any energy/oil price escalation that is eating up purchasing power; most of that price increase is now out of the system, as we've seen The housing price situation, whether it's deflation of disinflation, has changed; whatever it is has slowed down We're in an environment in which we  -16-    5/14/91  have improved affordability of housing, and I think that going from a minus to a plus is a rather significant factor And we're already seeing what is happening in regard to the autos--at least the inventory adjustments that already are there That leaves us, then, with [a question of] what it might be that would take the economy another leg down And I frankly do not believe that the risks of that happening are symmetrical I suppose it certainly is true that if net exports were to falter, having been as strong as they've been, that would be an offset to some of these other areas of improvement But it seems to me rather unlikely that we'd get that much movement in net exports with the time lags that generally exist in the net export sector Now, I think we should note that bond supply always tends to increase during a periods of downturn, which impacts government revenues But what happens to the financial markets is that loan demand generally falls off as much; so during most recessions we get a typical downward movement of long-term interest rates that exceeds what we've had this time We can do all the talking we want about why it is that the financial markets do not see the improvement that we see; and yet there are people who are making bets with real money and I don't think they have any reason to want to be biased As long as we maintain money growth above the [bottom of the ranges] that we have adopted--and certainly we've maintained it around the midpoint--it would be conducive, it seems to me, to an increase in nominal GNP, if not quite as robust as you have it, Mike Nevertheless, I would expect nominal GNP to increase rapidly enough that this improvement in inflation that everyone is anticipating thereby provides that kind of growth It may very well be time for us to be patient with regard to being willing for that phenomenon to take place What is wrong with nominal GNP growing 1 percent less than we have projected if that means that we're going to make that much more progress on price stability? When the bond market really sees that [progress], then I think we'll get the additional stimulus that will come from a normal cyclical decline of long-term interest rates That has not happened in this cycle "
1118,1991-05-14," Mr Chairman, I agree   I guess I'm a little uncomfortable with the conversation The bulk of the conversation is agreement over the M2 growth and that seems to me a very good thing for us to be watching Quite frankly, the stock market has behaved rather robustly and we didn't say that that means the recovery is going to be robust   Oh, I think it did, too That's why some of us were pretty confident about it Clearly, there would be a change in confidence in our [unintelligible] if the stock market turned up at 2450  -26-    5/14/91   Fine "
1160,1991-08-20," Do you want comments?   Well, having been something of an advocate of a different procedure, I must admit, Don, that in going through your analysis I really don't find anything there about which I can say ""I really want to do that right now"" Theoretically, I'm very much impressed with what Al Broaddus had to say in his letter I'm very impressed with the notion that pegging the fed funds rate and keeping it steady does not necessarily mean that policy is in neutral, and I think everybody agrees with that But the recent experience we've had with M2 causes me to have more doubts than I have had in previous years, and I suppose I am not quite as ready as I was four years ago or two years ago to introduce some automatism in the program At one time it seemed reasonable to me that if we erred in our estimates of the demand for money, all of the error should not show up in the money stock and that we ought to let part of the error show up in a move in the fed funds rate Now, I'm still somewhat of that opinion, but I'm not ready to advocate any of those other alternatives, Mr Chairman   Well, when David Lindsey speaks about the present procedures, I think he's correct that none of us really had in mind a year ago that we wanted to get the fed funds rate to 5-1/2 percent No one really seems to have in mind the fed funds rate that is driving us What has been driving us in a sense has been a kind of feeling our way in all of the procedures [on the basis of] all of the information that we have; and we find ourselves with a 5-1/2 percent fed funds rate So, I don't think that the [current] procedure necessarily means that we're really hooking on to some predetermined fed funds rate I think in a way many of us are surprised to find ourselves at this juncture with a fed funds rate of 5-1/2 percent And since we're surprised, then it must be that we have considerations that are driving us other than the fed funds rate   And there may be Federal Reserve Bank research departments that might wish to take on some additional tasks relating to what has been done at the Board   You mean have a separate sentence that indicates our commitment to price level stability?   And then deal with the others Well, I think there's certainly some merit in that approach   What sentence are you talking about, Don?  -11-    8/20/91   Mr Chairman, I like that suggestion If we were to do that, say, at the December meeting, that would be a ""goals"" meeting, which could then precede our establishment of the ranges at the February meeting   As part of the discussion But I think we should leave open the opportunity for some intra-year moves that might take place when events occur during the year "
1161,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, I'm having trouble getting used to a kind of newfound optimism, and I don't quite understand why I should be optimistic when the majority seem not to be I suppose there are two reasons One is that I had the lowest forecast for real growth among the Committee members; and I had the thought that given where Mike [Prell] is now I'd almost be willing to meet him half way So,  -30-    8/20/91  maybe I had a lower forecast to begin with for '91 The second reason may be more strange, and that is that I've been in Colorado, and Colorado seems quite different than it has been for many years during its very long recession When I look in Colorado, I see runways and runways and runways being built; I've never seen so many runways under construction--both in Colorado Springs and Denver But there's a new atmosphere there And it shows some of the ways that our system works When house values are where they are in a place like Colorado Springs compared to California, people start to move from California to Colorado Springs The kind of values there are just rather unbelievable And there's certainly a definite pickup But that's too minor a factor to explain much about the US economy  What is it, then, that gives me more optimism? And this is an optimism for 1992 maybe more so than for 1991 The optimism, I guess, comes from a reluctant realization that I'm closer to Tom Melzer in regard to M2 than I am to Lee Hoskins I'm just not as worried as I was earlier about those M2 numbers Don's paper was an excellent paper; it was very helpful to me to mull over what is going on in M2 And I think there's a realization that M2 is both the outcome as well as the cause It just seems to me that M2 probably is not going to respond as much as the members of the Committee would like But it may not have much to do with the outcome in the real economy  Maybe my optimism is also due to the fact that the real estate price event may be almost over and that should bode well for the banking system, which I see recovering and which I think will give us a different result in 1992 But at the same time commodity prices continue to be pretty weak and rather inconsistent with a strong recovery So, I think that means we should take a little off of our estimates for the third quarter But if the third-quarter estimates are a little softer, that seems to me an environment in which maybe what has happened to long-term bond prices can continue if the Committee is willing to be patient That is, if we continue to get through this quarter and into the next and the PPI numbers are consistent with what commodity prices are showing, then it seems to me that with patience we may have opportunities for additional, perhaps minor, steps to be taken in time, and long bond prices would respond as favorably as they did in this last move Now, we not only have long bond prices for Treasuries down to 810 percent but we've had even more of a gain in mortgage-backed securities; and those spreads over Treasuries are narrowing considerably And it seems to me that that bodes well for the housing recovery--which is a very gradual recovery, but I think it still adds quarter-to-quarter to the kind of results that we want to see  The final reason for my optimism is optimism with regard to the net export picture It seems to me that as Mexico moves more to a market-system economy with more sound monetary policy it earns the right to be a capital importer and, indeed, it is becoming a capital importer Policies they have in place will earn them an increasing right to be a capital importer, which will be very helpful to them in their development But I see also throughout Latin America and South America a desire to follow that mode And if these countries become the capital importers that I expect them to become because of improved monetary and fiscal policies, then it seems to me that that bodes  -31-    8/20/91  better for our export industries So, I look for a somewhat better outcome there than even the staff has forecast "
1162,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation on ""B,"" and the version II [language] is okay I'd have a slight preference for symmetric language but with you at the switch I don't see that the meaning is any different [Laughter]  I would like to suggest that what we're going through here is, of course, painful But it's less painful to me than what I considered to be of some possibility six months ago, which was that we'd be through this event and back out and never get the rate of inflation down It just seems to me that we do have to have a little patience here I think we're entering a period in which we're making more progress toward price stability than during any of the period that I've been here And there's so much joy in that to me that I'm able in a sense to endure a little of the agony But that doesn't mean that I want it to continue into another year I'm very open to the Chairman's suggestion   Mr Chairman, after hearing Mike and Tom, I think I would really prefer version I   Do you want a recorded vote in the minutes, Mr Chairman?   Why don't we just recount? "
1215,1991-10-01," Jerry, I think there are two kinds of responses that we can be involved in One is the response to a firm that has violated the ethical principles in regard to falsifying reports, which is an issue in itself But the other problem that seems to me is very important to the Federal Reserve is that we address the entire question of whether or not a small group, in a sense, ought to have that privileged access And in that vein I'm wondering how far down the road it would be for us to be able to have an electronic ability at various firms to make their bids I presume that takes quite a bit of software as well as hardware   I don't want to debate all these questions at this point, but I do think it's very important that the marketplace and the public perceive that we're very sensitive to an open access bidding system and that we really ought to give a lot of priority to making certain that that option is available so that as the discussion takes place we are not seen as holding up that process   I understand and I'll be very happy at some other time to talk about some of those other problems "
1216,1991-10-01," Yes, Larry, I'd like to ask a question about Japan We understand that just-in-time inventory management seems to be in place in Japan and certainly Japan appears to have rather high short-term real interest rates Is there some possibility that the heavier rate of production in the first and second quarters is an inventory surge that still has to be looked at as a threat to the continued growth of the Japanese real GNP?   I think it's time to remember that we are 28 months into this period of declining short-term interest rates The fed funds rate is 465 basis points lower than it was 28 months ago This was accompanied, of course, eventually by a shift from a flat yield curve to a very positive yield curve That very positive yield curve has been in place for quite a few months We're looking, then,  -16-    10/1/91  at a shift in behavior in the commercial banking system as well as the nonbank public in regard to their positioning of assets The commercial banking system is shifting heavily into US government securities This is quite typical at this stage of the interest rate cycle that we're in Undoubtedly, when commercial banks begin at the margin to add to their holdings of government securities and to offset that by some shrinkage or no growth in loans that, of course, means that the opportunity costs of making a new loan are moving in the direction of alleviating the credit crunch So, it seems to me that we have fully in place the atmosphere that does provide for the kind of forecast that Mike has described To me the one factor that was most noticeable in Mike's statement was that the Blue Chip forecasters have a slightly lower rate of economic growth but a slightly higher rate of inflation And I guess, Mike, that maybe we have inside information But the critical question before us puts me somewhat in disagreement with those who talk about where the risks are The critical risk that we run at this stage is that we do not make the gradual progress in the core rate of inflation as Mike has outlined And if we go past this window and find ourselves with the same basic core rate of inflation we've had since 1984, you can better believe that we will pay for that yield structure and the term structure of interest rates in the future, and that certainly will be a very significant factor with regard to the size of the US government debt and the interest payments that will be there  So, I feel that where we are is just about right I don't see how it could be much better It seems to me that it would be better for us to have 2-1/2 percent real growth rather than 3-1/2 percent real growth and make the progress in [reducing] the core rate of inflation The environment that we're in, if we maintain it, came after a period of patience, which may mean that the rate of inflation, and the rate of [unintelligible] may come down more in the next 12 months Yet we're looking immediately at financial markets that [have yet] to adjust to news in regard to what we think the third-quarter GNP numbers are going to be It's entirely possible that given those numbers--[growth in] real GNP in the third quarter at the 3 percent level--that we could see the long bond yields rising above this nice 779 percent where they now appear to be So, we have in front of us a very delicate matter And it seems to me that the best prospects for growth will rest with further progress in [lowering] the core rate of inflation So, I'm very pleased, but I would be happy to have Mike be 1/2 point too high on this real GNP number "
1217,1991-10-01," I prefer ""B"" symmetric but better than straight asymmetric  I like ""mildly""   I was on edge wondering how you were going to do that!  MR, BERNARD ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the  -31-    10/1/91  intermeeting period The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 3 and 1-1/2 percent, respectively"" "
1265,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, I hope my advice is wanted on this even though it wasn't on the other I do believe that there's an integrity question here Information is scarce and information is hard to come by for the market And I don't feel comfortable for us to deliberately let an auction take place for a 10-year issue tomorrow morning and not let the markets know all that we know I do not feel comfortable with people taking short and long positions on an auction tomorrow while we know precisely what we're going to do It seems to me that the fairest thing to do is to do it as soon as the markets have [closed], which I think for us would be tomorrow morning I would also suggest, Mr Chairman, that there have been times that we've had leaks that are more in the realm of information for [news media] But if we were to have a leak, that would only be seen as an advantage for someone in the market and would do this institution a great deal of harm   At what time, Peter?   You wouldn't do it early? "
1266,1991-11-05," I agree with those who suggest that this is a long-cycle adjustment process I think anyone who saw what happened in the oil producing states and the agricultural states in the mid- 1980s understood that this was going to be an asset price adjustment period Now, monetary policy was sufficiently powerful in the mid- 1980s to be able to abort that adjustment process We are not just at 12 months and 10 small [easing] moves but 2-1/2 years and 490 basis points lower in the fed funds rate than we were in June of 1989 That's a rather significant move Now, it seems to me that monetary policy lags may be increasing in this environment And I wonder about looking at maybe at least two behavioral groups to see how that might be occurring First of all for households, with their reliance on CDs and other short-term investments that we taught them to rely upon in the 1980s, I think that heavy shift really did not involve direct ownership of equities; and a very small amount of direct ownership of bonds by households leaves them rather vulnerable on the income side, [given] the interest rate declines that have occurred The interest gap for the household sector is rather enormous when one thinks about short-term CD rates at 4-1/2 percent as compared to credit card interest rates of 19 percent It doesn't take a great deal of brilliance for households--many of whom learned to have a mix of both short-term liquid assets and also to hold liabilities at the same time--to understand that there's a lot of payoff to shifting out of CDs and bringing down debt That low rate of return for households is undoubtedly driving them into the equity market in a new way As interest rates fall, that occurs And that phenomenon means that we don't get quite the ""bang for the buck"" that we ordinarily would because we're not impacting the rates that households are paying as much as we're impacting the rates that households are receiving  There's also a lagged phenomenon at commercial banks In ordinary recession cycles there is a shift, of course, between lending and investment; but [when] a longer-term adjustment [is under way] that shift might be even more pronounced and longer-lasting and have some somewhat perverse effects It seems to me that the real opportunity cost for commercial banks in lending is not exactly the opportunity cost in what they're paying; as US government securities in the two- to three-year range become a larger portion of the assets  -21-    11/5/91  of commercial banks, the real opportunity cost is the yield on those two- and three-year Treasuries In a declining interest rate market that yield is much higher than the coupon rate And as long as that yield is as high, in many ways commercial banks worried about asset quality in the lending area would naturally delay making the transition to aggressive lending In many ways it seems to me, then, that the impetus to lend is going to come somewhat after interest rates have stopped declining So, to some extent, declines in short- term interest rates may [lead to] a delayed effect as to what occurs  Now, there's another factor we ought to consider and that is that long-cycle adjustments occur because conditions get out of whack And those adjustments--those things that need to be changed--need to [occur] In a sense aborting asset price adjustments doesn't help all that much Asset prices need to adjust to a different level of expected inflation And in some ways the faster those asset price adjustments take place the better the recovery Unfortunately, the RTC and other ownership arrangements that don't cause these assets to be docked may indeed prolong the adjustments  Another fact in the long cycle that we have to consider is that household savings in a sense are inevitably linked to capital inflows to the United States And I think there are some real advantages for household savings to adjust in such a manner that we do not [continue to take] the share of the world's capital that we have been taking over the last 10 years So, that savings adjustment needs to take place, and we need to keep in mind that we don't want to disrupt conditions by trying to create in a sense the typical recovery The typical recovery is not going to be there; and trying to get that typical recovery will run greater risks of upsetting certain markets than if we go in a more steady-as-we-go [manner] through here Just think how serious it would be if we were to upset the foreign exchange market or upset the equity market One concern that I have is that the equity market could be in for a boom and that could involve a speculative fervor; and if this adjustment period is as long as I expect it to be, then a run-up in equity prices [until they get] out of line and then watching them unwind very rapidly is not going to be a very pleasant experience So, the critical question in front of us is What are we teaching the world that we are doing? Are we teaching the world that our focus is on employment and output or are we teaching the world that we continue to have a concept of price level targeting that will enable long-term interest rates to come down in such a way as to continue to get recovery in housing, which I think is essential to get this long-cycle process going our way? Just because it's a long cycle doesn't mean that it has to be an extraordinarily bad long cycle And I think what we do is very, very important "
1267,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, since we might be having a telephone conference call anyway, there's some uncertainty in my mind as to how that would take place if the Board were not to make a discount rate move Wouldn't there be some advantage in going ""B"" asymmetric and then having a telephone conference call after we know what the Board is going to do? That would still mean the FOMC would be free to do what it chose to do, but it would then have knowledge about what the announcement--   That could be an alternative That would be an alternative that would be more appealing to me   Yes  -29-    11/5/91 "
1320,1991-12-17," Unfortunately, any time public officials make comments about taking away the supply of an instrument that the markets have been accustomed to using-- And with the considerable demand for strips that is out there, it does seem to me a bit dangerous to destroy in a sense an entire market system, including that largest commodity of all which is Treasury bond futures That is, I think moderating the supply is quite different from any discussion of taking the instrument away   I can support that position I guess I don't have quite as much enthusiasm as others have expressed It seems to me that Governor Kelley ought to know how hard it is to change it once we've done this And with this language it's just almost impossible to change it, so I think we're back in the same circumstance I do believe there are times that the Committee may wish to give a signal of changing emphasis; it seems to me that during the '80s we had foreign exchange markets that did need some attention And having a way of responding to that which is necessary, I think, was helpful At the same time the movement up in the order of ""price level stability"" was a part of the announcement or the signal of the Committee's determination in that regard, which I think frankly will get lost in this arrangement But I can understand when something is going [to be approved] and so I'm going to vote for it! [Laughter] "
1321,1991-12-17," Yes, Mr Chairman Even though it seems as if the economy is dead in the water--and the forecasts for the fourth quarter and the first quarter certainly suggest that--I think it's better to look at the economy as being balanced by certain sectors and regions in which growth is occurring, albeit rather slowly, and other sectors and regions in which there are continuing adjustments and some retrenchment So, it seems to me that there still is not the synchronization of all of these sectors and regions into a common inventory cycle phenomenon Consequently, it seems to me that the seeds for growth are building even while we're in this period of a pretty flat economy  Secondly, I want to suggest that the pessimism we see associated with this [economy] is a real estate phenomenon It's a  -14-    12/17/91  long-cycle real estate phenomenon and it is accompanied by depository institution difficulties that look just like those that were experienced in the 1920s and 1930s And it seems to me that we are not immune from the sense of pessimism associated with that kind of an event I think it would be well for us to remind ourselves of some significant differences between the current conditions and those that prevailed during that last banking-real estate episode  First of all, I would suggest that the monetary aggregates-- whether you look at Ml, M2, or M3--are growing; they are not contracting And there's a substantial difference between monetary contraction and slow money growth If you look at Ml as well as M2, there's some indication here that we are supplying liquidity to the system And that liquidity, as shown in the steep yield curve, will work its way Now, in the 1930s the banking system did not have the heavy concentration of Treasuries in their portfolios that they hold now At that time, as many of you probably remember, the government debt was contracted from about $24 billion in 1920 to about $16 billion in 1929 So, in that episode, we didn't have commercial banks chasing yield into long-term Treasury securities And the commercial banks had a quality bond problem It wasn't just a question then of having bad loans; it was also a question of having bonds, both municipal and business corporate bonds, that were not marketable And when that quality spread developed, the banking system was, of course, locked in with those securities So, they didn't just have bad loans They had bad loans in bonds as well as bad loans of the usual kind Of course, they did not have something that we have today and that is deposit insurance I know a lot of people have been complaining about deposit insurance systems, but this is not too bad a time to have one, it seems to me! [Laughter] And, of course, that's why we haven't had a monetary contraction If we had had these depository institution failures without deposit insurance, it seems to me that there would have been no way we could have kept the money stock growing  The second thing I would mention is that we are not in a deflation period as measured by the producer price index In the latter 1920s and early 1930s, we had very steeply declining prices that brought the price level down 40 to 50 percent below where it had been before We haven't yet had what I would call a significant producer price index decline And the fact that the PPI for finished goods is now year-over-year at minus 5 percent is hardly an indication of a deflation underway  The third point I would mention is that our system is indeed a transfer payment system that does offer a huge amount of support I mean by that not just Social Security, but Medicaid, Medicare, and unemployment compensation, and also a rather large pension plan program So, that provides a great deal of sustenance  The fourth thing I'd mention--I know one could add more to the list but I'm going to stop at four--is that world trade is expanding It's not expanding quite as rapidly as it was a few years ago, but it's still expanding And in the 1930s, as you know, we were undergoing the threat from the Hawley-Smoot tariff So, this circumstance is so different that to me it doesn't make sense for us to let that kind of fear permeate our ranks  -15-    12/17/91  Now, as to the monetary aggregates, I frankly am not worried at this point about M1's growth rate When I look at Ml and M2--and M2 seems to be dawdling along at a little higher [growth] rate than it was before--it doesn't seem to me that this is a problem at this point on either side I'm not going to join the forces of alarmists in regard to Ml But I do remember, Ed, that in 1986 when I was not too worried about M2 growing at a rate of 9-1/2 percent and some of you were saying that that was a problem, that it did turn out to be somewhat problematic So, I don't know at what point in time liquidity in a sense catches hold and shows up At this point, commodity prices do not show any force of over-liquification as Ml's growth rate might indicate That is, I don't see any upward bulge in commodity prices that says we're putting too much liquidity in the system But neither do I see commodity prices forecasting a significant deflation It does seem to me, though, that the commodity prices are forecasting stable producer prices and some diminution in the commodity price index But I think it's worth noting Bob Parry's report regarding agriculture Civilizations do go through periods in which certain [anomalies] in agriculture show up And it seems to me that we do run the risk that we're in an era in which food prices may be subject to more [unfavorable] surprises than good surprises  In conclusion, it seems to me that the healing forces and the recovery forces--with a little longer time lags than we're used to-- are really underway I don't want to try to do any better at forecasting [than the staff]; I don't have any quarrel with Mike's forecast at all I don't think we've ever been to this place before, and I don't know for sure that that's the way it's going to work, but it does seem to me that this is a time for a little patience "
1322,1991-12-17," Yes, Bob Black I think stated it a little differently, but that's the way I heard you   Mr Chairman, I can vote for your proposition, as I'm sure you anticipated that I would Thanks a lot for giving me a chance not to have to write another dissenting statement! I do want to suggest that during the last six years I've become a bit less optimistic in regard to how easy it is to get the rate of inflation down When I came in, I had the view that inflation could be brought down by gradual and persistent control of the money stock even if unemployment is at its natural rate My experience is that it's very tough to get the CPI rate of inflation down And I don't know why we're looking a gift horse in the mouth Here we have had some unexpected occurrences, which means that the rate of inflation is going to come down a little faster than we thought it was going to But we're committed not to let it turn into deflation We're just not going to let that happen I don't know, Mr Chairman, whether there's more pain doing it this way than there is doing it over a 10-year period I feel quite confident that this improvement in the outlook for inflation will make the recovery that we finally get a much better and a long sustained one I do look forward to the discussions that I    12/17/91  think we might be having, particularly in regard to Governor Mullins's comments, and I guess I get to vote again So, thank you "
1377,1992-03-31," Mr Chairman, it seems to me that it might be somewhat worthwhile at this point to reassure the new members that in [our review of] this issue two years ago most of us who were on the side of not having as heavy a hand and not building up our foreign currency balances have been very appreciative of the fact that the Federal Reserve's position under the Chairman's leadership has been in the direction that we prefer I have a great deal of appreciation for the fact that there's a political question involved here And it seems to me that our being absent from a significant portion of that [intervention] speaks a lot louder than the $25 million participation that we did So, I feel in accord with the direction we're going in and I'm satisfied, but I'm not suggesting that we ought not to have the review Mr Chairman, I'd be very happy to move to ratify the transactions, if that's appropriate   Yes, I would Anything you say, Mr Chairman! [Laughter] "
1378,1992-03-31," I would agree that the staff forecast is a reasonable forecast I would be on the side of slightly lower nominal GNP, if I had any difference, over the coming two or three quarters I agree with Jerry Corrigan that the circumstances in Japan are really close to being super worrisome Asset price deflations once underway may not respond as well as some may believe to a monetary policy adjustment And I think we all know about the run-up in real estate prices in Japan It's not as if it were a magnitude of 2 times or 3 times as high as would seem reasonable, but it might be more a magnitude of 5 to 10 times as high as might be reasonable! I guess all of us have had confidence that they will be able to produce a soft landing a lot better than we could, and yet it does seem to me that their reluctance to respond to rather low monetary growth does indicate that the tide among central banks internationally, including the G-7, is still pretty conservative It seems to me that the European community also has its own problems, and driving European monetary policy by the Bundesbank's particular set of parameters affecting Germany and not affecting others seems to me to [drive fiscal policy in Europe to] equal in some sense the fiscal policy in Germany, which is out of accord with the Maastrich rules That is, they're not going to qualify for being a part of the club if their fiscal policies deteriorate So, even though I expect some change, as Ted Truman suggested, it does seem to me that it will be on the conservative side And when you look at those European economies and the amount of subsidies that are there and the pressures that are on them, it does seem to me that they are not quite in the promised land in regard to the economic growth that one would expect to be a part of the Common Market phenomenon I think we will find more and more that a common economic market without a common political market has a lot of obstacles and they haven't found the way to crawl over all the boulders yet And there seem to be a lot of boulders  This would then suggest that US exports or net exports would be even more of a drag than Mr Truman and the staff suggest And I suppose my optimism shines forth here in regard to my belief that with cost-cutting in US firms, with the exchange value of the dollar where it is and the learning curve that our exporters are on, I  -22-    3/31/92  expect to see us do as well as the staff suggests if not slightly better, even with a somewhat weaker foreign economy  Now, it seems to me that the driving force in regard to monetary growth in the United States is not so much what happens on the liabilities side of the commercial banks' balance sheets but what happens on the assets side When commercial banks have been looking at spreads between loans and CDs and all of a sudden on the margin the assets they are picking up are US government securities, then in a sense the spread that they're chasing is a quite different spread So the only way that they're going to have the kind of earnings they insist on is to have CD rates that tend to continue to run lower than rates on governments, which it seems to me is going to [encourage] disintermediation to some extent and hold up M2 growth as compared to Ml and the monetary base So, in this environment it seems to me we end up with really quite a bit of rope out on the table And, frankly, I don't think it would make much difference in the growth of the monetary aggregates if we had fed funds rates 50 basis points lower than they are So, I would still expect the monetary aggregates to come in at around the midpoint [of their ranges] or below And if the monetary aggregates surprise me and are stronger than that, then I think it's probably getting pretty late in the game My guess would be that once private credit demands increase--and I think the good news we are hearing around the table gives some notion that there might be some increases in private credit demands--if they begin to expand as fast as we would like them to grow, then we would probably find growth of M2 headed toward double-digit rates, though again I'm talking quite a few quarters down the road, farther than I can really see My guess is that we might have to have an adjustment in the fed funds rate of 200 basis points to [rein] that in But I think that's a long ways down the pike "
1379,1992-03-31," Well, Don, they are your seasonal adjustment numbers!  -30-    3/31/92   Mr Chairman, I would prefer to be symmetric It seems to me that the foreign central bankers perceive our policy as being easier than it is And they tend to have this history [of believing] that the United States always sort of leads the way to too much inflation I think we really have a very delicate matter here in regard to the foreign perspective as to where we are, and how those  -32-    3/31/92  central banks feel about us spills over into the capital markets Of course, I can see that there might be some circumstance--if the Bank of Japan made a significant easing move and the yen became extra weak while factors here made it consistent with price level stability-- [where it would be appropriate] for us to make a move I could understand that And I can vote for a policy that's not my preference based upon what I said at the last FOMC meeting Mr Chairman, I also said at that time that I had all the confidence in the world that you wanted to meet the same price level stability objectives I have a great deal of confidence in that, so I can vote for asymmetry [toward ease], but I have to express a little caution when I do   I guess it's the yield curve problem that I consider And [despite] Governor Mullins's careful analysis of that yield structure, I don't quite agree with his view that it's the fiscal [situation] that drives it It seems to me the driving factor is that monetary policy was seen to be eased on the basis of real economy data And the bond markets say that if we ease on the basis of the real economy, then we're going to tighten if the real economy is strong So, I think it's this anticipation of stronger growth that has caused the yield curve to falter So, even though we've got money in the bank, in the real bank, I don't think we have much money in the perception bank "
1433,1992-05-19," I not only concur, but I really want to express appreciation for Bill McDonough's capturing the spirit of the Board and the FOMC position and very well representing that It's very comforting to me to know the direction we're going, and I've had time to worry about other things! "
1434,1992-05-19," Mike, looking back at the chart on page III-3 on M2 velocity Last fall some around here were quite concerned that M2 growth was quite a good indicator of where [the economy was] and yet these first-quarter numbers I presume [raise] nominal [GNP growth] for the first quarter up to somewhere between 6 and 7 percent That makes V-2, with a one-quarter lag, shoot up to 4 percent Doesn't that really cast a lot of doubt on all that concern about slow M2 growth?   I calculated the two-quarter lag also and had the same conclusions Thank you   I've always been very sympathetic to watching the monetary aggregates, and I believe that they really are a very [integral] part of our fundamental program against inflation But as you know, from time-to-time I have looked carefully at other means to determine whether or not there is a shift in demand for any one of the aggregates And I've concentrated on commodity prices as probably being the most sensitive in showing whether or not monetary restraint truly is in place or whether [policy is] characterized by monetary ease At the present time commodity prices, although they have the reputation of being very volatile, seem rather stable to me If there's any trend it's probably slightly upward but not as strong as ordinarily would be seen in a recovery phase So, on the surface that doesn't seem to show great inflation signals out ahead  -25-    5/19/92  Gold prices probably need to be looked at some, particularly since there are those who view the declining gold prices as [unintelligible] into growth rates This thesis holds that M2 growth has been very slow and it shows up by following gold prices I think it's important to recognize that gold is always [unintelligible] in regard to its monetary properties and for a long period of time gold prices were lower than market forces would have dictated due to the fact that many governments wanted to sell out their gold stocks Consequently, gold stayed in the [$340] range a lot longer than it otherwise would have Costs of production in many places in the world were way above that, and so there was no technology going into that industry When gold prices are running up so the optimists believe the price is going to be in the $500 range, then you get a surge of technology into that industry And it seems to me we're experiencing the impact of that surge Indeed, the surge has been primarily a US surge In the United States, we've had during the 1980s over $8 billion of investments in gold mining, just as an example of what technology can do when the price outlook is favorable That has resulted in a very quick [advance] for the United States from nowhere in the park of gold producers to the number 2 position Indeed, production in the United States is now above 60 percent of that in South Africa and very well could exceed South African production before the decade is over A new technology involving heat-bleaching means that the cost of production with that new technology runs closer to $250 an ounce rather than to $350 an ounce When you look at what is happening in Chile and other areas around the world, it looks as if this same technology probably is catching on in other places One would then expect the price of gold to fall closer to its cost-of- production in the marginally efficient areas I give this explanation I suppose partly because I've begun to receive ""hate mail"" [accusing me] of having been unresponsive to falling gold prices and [saying that I] should have been an advocate of monetary ease based upon that   Well, I answered the question by saying that I have never supported $350 an ounce gold; people just think that I do   I see Well, it's all right to be in that direction It seems to me that we ought not let the current information on inflation, disappointing as it is, cause us to move to precipitate action It seems to me that sound money is something we accomplish over a long period of time But it does suggest to me that the level of restraint that's out there is probably not as great as many have thought it to be and that we do need to be in a posture of maintaining constant restraint over time until we get the producer price index numbers behaving better than they're behaving There's no reason for us not to get inflation in the goods sector quickly down to zero And I think if we maintain the kind of posture that's needed, that will occur I do think there will be a time lag between [that and] the adjustment of inflation in the services sector to zero  Looking at the real economy, the Greenbook forecast is one with which I would have no strong arguments I would expect exports to be somewhat stronger than in the Greenbook and I would expect  -26-    5/19/92  productivity gains in 1993 to be more of a continuation of the patterns seen in 1992 I would consequently expect corporate profits to be in range similar to what John LaWare has outlined It's a very disappointing period in regard to those inflation numbers I think we do not stand ourselves in good stead by representing too strong an interest in movements in the real economy from quarter-to-quarter   The average target would be more like 4-1/2 to 5 percent  [Coffee break] "
1435,1992-05-19," You know, it's written as it would be written if we were going to publish it the next day   Mr Chairman, I could support an asymmetric directive if it were toward tightness and I could accommodate myself  -40-    5/19/92  to a symmetric directive as you have suggested It seems to me that we do encounter some likelihood over the coming period that the fed funds rate might need to be closer to 5 percent than to 3-3/4 percent; and money growth, M2, right now doesn't give us any leeway to make that move at this point in time So, symmetric will work for me But I just wanted you to know my leanings and also my inability to support the asymmetric direction   Asymmetric in which direction? [Laughter]   I understand the ""might"" but do you want ""somewhat"" on both sides?   We might take out the words ""a resumption of""   ""With growth of""  SPEAKER(?) That's better "
1486,1992-08-18," Well, even though I really support what you've said, Mr Chairman, I find it unusual for me to be almost on the other side of you on this issue in that I have complained so often over six years regarding intervention I need to make my position clear; I don't think it has been expressed by anyone yet There are many ways that we go about conducting monetary policy In that context, foreign exchange policy is a part of monetary policy Monetary easing domestically tends to cause the value of a currency to depreciate versus other goods that are trading in the domestic market Internationally, monetary ease tends to make a currency less valued against goods traded worldwide and against foreign currencies The full scope of monetary policy then should enable us from time-to-time to use all aspects of this Monetary policy is not the sole province of the Federal Reserve When the Secretary of the Treasury makes remarks, in some sense that creates uncertainties in the market in regard to what US policy is  My own view is that the foreign exchange value of the dollar at this time is in a very precarious spot It's not whether or not the market is very disorderly but whether or not it will become very disorderly We have used monetary policy to take interest rates in the United States very low for domestic purposes compared to the monetary policy adopted by the Bundesbank in pursuit of their domestic policy As a result of [the slope of] our yield curve out to 10 years [versus] the Bundesbank's yield curve out to 10 years, there is an arbitraged 10-year D-mark/dollar forward rate of 170 [Unintelligible] if the Bundesbank seems to be more concerned about inflation than we are, that would tend to make the forward D-mark stronger compared to the forward dollar Now, we are in a spot, it seems to me, where we have to understand that what happens in the foreign exchange market is part and parcel of what happens to 10-year Treasury securities If we were to ignore the foreign exchange relationship in a world with huge international capital [stocks], the international capital flows would occur in such a way as to cause an equilibrium adjustment of 10-year notes in the United States It just can't be that the dollar will fall off a cliff [relative to] the D- mark and head down from 145 to 140 to 135; if that occurs, then at some point in time someone will say ""Hey, how in the world can the dollar get back to 170?"" And there could be a serious breakdown such as what the Chairman suggested happened in [October] of 1987 To me we are very close to that kind of serious breakdown I believe we    8/18/92  have accomplished a great deal of what we wanted to accomplish, which was to create an interest rate environment in the United States that was conducive to US economic growth I don't believe at this point that depreciating the dollar is going to work very much [in the direction of providing] stimulus to our foreign trade It's part and parcel of all that we do, and I don't want to tie one of our hands behind our back at a critical moment in time If someone says that they want us to use the right hand to do one thing and the left hand to do something else, then I will vote ""no"" as I did in the summer of [1989] when we were following an exactly opposite policy in foreign exchange intervention than we were in [domestic] monetary policy Now, I support this program; it's a good program and I think we ought to be prepared to do more of it But I support it because I do not want to take the foreign exchange value of the dollar down, which will cause import prices to rise and will not be conducive to progress on inflation I don't want monetary ease In a sense that could be a drastic kind of monetary policy ease that I believe could upset the markets So, I guess that's a more extreme position than has been heard   Well, I agree that there's no question as to where the call is located legally in regard to exchange rate policy But the monetary policy operations of this Committee can overwhelm any official exchange rate policy That is, if we decide to buy Treasuries or buy deutschemarks--it doesn't make any difference--if we buy in the open market, we will overwhelm other foreign exchange objectives So, this Committee has tremendous power when it comes to determining the outcome of the official position that is [decided] by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Chairman   So move "
1487,1992-08-18," They are interest-bearing notes   I wanted to hear all the news and I agree that Governor Lindsey has summarized it pretty well There is almost a total lack of anyone who thinks the economy really is going to go charging ahead, and maybe that's the best news there is I've had such low nominal GNP forecasts for so long that I'm glad finally to have some company with forecasts the same as mine I think you're right also, Governor Lindsey, in looking at the international arena That's not something we can control Yet the US dollar is still the major reserve currency for the world and the US dollar is affected by activities that take place in the world Even though the goods markets may be very imperfect, with a lot of protectionist devices out there, the capital markets are not imperfect and they do move very quickly When we look at the question of whether or not the disinflation in the United States has gone too far and whether we are moving into deflation, the fact of the matter is that wholesale prices around the world on a year-over-year rate of change basis indicate much more disinflation as do prices in other G-10 countries than do prices in the United States Of course, in Japan [prices have declined] year-over-year; but even in Germany, with the Bundesbank worried about inflation, the year-over-year change in wholesale prices  -34-    8/18/92  is lower than ours and very close to zero It even looks as if the United Kingdom's disinflation rate is such that their year-over-year change in wholesale prices might slide under ours in a couple of months Our year-over-year change in wholesale prices at 18 percent just doesn't show what I would call disinflation turning into deflation So, I don't see how we can build the story that we're in a deflationary environment  Clearly, we're in an environment in which economic conditions are very sluggish To me this is to be expected It seems to me that American households should want to alter their balance sheets and to increase their saving rate And it seems to me that there is some prospect that the saving rate before we get to 1994 might move up beyond 5 percent from the low of 4 percent that we had a few years ago We've seen it move on up to 5 percent and I think it quite likely could move up to 5-1/2 percent before 1994 That would mean then that the source of our growth would not be from the consumer sector as we might expect As we look at the patient, Dr LaWare, maybe we ought not just be patient but monitor a few things as we go along I think we ought to monitor commodity prices and see that commodity prices do not turn downward Gold has quite often led commodity prices; gold has bounced around some and is now in somewhat of a downward mode I don't think we ought to ignore that leading signal which might be more important at this point than M2 in terms of our seeing where we're going Frankly, if the price of gold were to take another strong leg down, I'm not sure but I might join Governor Lindsey in regard to where we ought to go But I do believe that we need to be on a very secure price level stability base before we make the next easing move because, if the world doesn't know that we are committed to price level stability and we ease in that environment, we risk destabilizing financial markets around the world Governor Phillips says What do we have to lose? There's not much danger that the inflation the bankers are worried about is going to come charging back But I do think in the environment that we're in that we could very well destabilize international capital markets and we might understand that the notion of sour is a whole lot better with the DOW at 3320 than if the DOW were losing 200 points a day So, I think there's some strength out there In addition to commodity prices, I want to monitor M2 I think M2 in the coming months is going to be very important because I've had an hypothesis that M2 is going to be guided more by what happens to intermediate rates [unintelligible] "
1488,1992-08-18," I'm uncomfortable with ""C"" because putting the velocity in there makes it seem that the resulting nominal GDP is exactly what our policy objective is, whereas my understanding is that we would like the resulting nominal GDP to be higher than it might be or than we might be able to make it to be So, I would prefer just to do the straightforward ""B,"" I'm presuming with your revised numbers that you might be able to put a ""2"" in there Is that right?   So, I'd prefer ""B"" with 2 percent in it   That's acceptable to me   But if more banks were to choose to adopt the alternative clearing balances, that would alter that prospect, right? "
1542,1992-10-06," I'm glad to have you contribute your part to that!   There seems to be little disagreement in the views that I expect to hear as the go-around continues and the staff forecast It does not seem to me likely that the economy is going to be substantially stronger than the forecast Since I anticipate so much agreement in regard to the current state of the economy, it seems to me it would be well for us to continue the earlier discussion, which involved assessing how well monetary policy is working to accomplish any impact upon the real economy Now, I for one have more confidence, I think, in Mike Prell's forecast than maybe he does   My confidence is based upon the fact that he has produced consistently biased errors in one direction over the last three years That seems to me entirely likely if you have someone who has some motive other than getting the forecast right or if the model is defective And it seems to me it's time for us to examine more carefully the model that produced such biased errors Let me go back to the Humphrey-Hawkins period and the July FOMC meeting I think the pickup in M2 growth in August and September to a very slight 3 percent rate was due more to the declines in intermediate rates, which were almost unprecedented, following the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in July We had dramatic declines in two-year, three-year, five-year, seven-year, and ten-year Treasury rates, and that seems to me to account for the rise in M2 Now, I would hold that lower fed funds rates under some conditions may well reduce aggregate demand and that under some conditions lowering the fed funds rate may very well cause intermediate rates to rise Under those circumstances it seems to me that M2 will grow more slowly rather than more rapidly and we will then end up with unintended consequences    10/6/92  But to me the most important point is not necessarily to look at the [transmission] mechanism through the fed funds rate on M2 but to look at it in terms of its impact upon household balance sheets and on household income statements I believe it's time for us to devote a great deal of attention to the question of the duration of household assets and the duration of household liabilities If households have taken [on] a huge interest rate debt and if the duration of household assets were conditioned by a period of rising interest rates or an expectation that interest rates would rise again and if households then are holding very short duration assets, under those conditions a fall in the fed funds rate is going to result in a substantial reduction in household income Now, I do not know what the duration of household assets might be by looking at their flow-of-funds I don't know whether anyone knows what that duration might be What I'm suggesting is that there may be some conditions under which lowering the fed funds rate is not going to work the way we'd anticipate Since we have watched the fed funds rate come down from 990 percent to 3 percent--that's 690 basis points--and it has had less than the intended effect upon credit and upon spending, then it seems very appropriate for us to look again at this model  Now I'm going to live a little dangerously I think I disagree with Bill McDonough's comment that the foreign exchange market does not in a sense have an implication for our domestic monetary decisions I would agree that a reserve currency country does not take its cues from trying to follow somebody else's exchange rate But it seems to me that the dramatic fall in intermediate interest rates in July and August put the spot foreign exchange value of the dollar on a downward course, unless the implied forward rate of the dollar were rising faster than those rates were falling So, we have to ask ourselves then What will happen if we reduce the fed funds rate at a time when the foreign exchange value of the dollar may be at a precarious point? It seems to me that making a fed funds rate move might very well feed into a weaker dollar I think all of us must understand that we have a very exploding global money market condition; we have almost pure competition in this market--not perfect because information is catching up--but it's exploding also So, with this very perfected money market that is global, we have to look at the feedback loops that possibly exist between the fed funds rate and its impact upon the weaker dollar and its subsequent impact, which could very well cause intermediate rates to rise Indeed, if the implied forward exchange rate is to remain constant, then under those circumstances lowering the fed funds rate [and] lowering the two-year Treasury rate, has to raise the implied forward rate at years 9 and 10; otherwise we're going to be out of adjustment on the forward rates So, I believe we're in a precarious place here One of the good things we have going for us in an economy that needs growth is that the US equity market has not yet taken a tumble But I think most are very leery concerning where we are here  My assessment, then, of our current economic condition is that it is a global-money capital-market-driven relationship We have gone a long way And I am not optimistic about the impact of lowering the fed funds rate at this point in time in terms of stimulating economic growth Now, if we are willing to make our fed funds rate moves based upon price level targeting and if everyone knows that's the basis upon which we're making our moves, then it seems to me that under those circumstances we could very well expect in the future that  -21-    10/6/92  lower fed funds rates will provide us more bang for the buck So, I'm in a mode of saying that there may be lower fed funds rates out there that will be helpful in the future if we are on the path that Mike Prell has suggested toward price level stability But the question for us is How do we get the most bang for the buck?   Mr Chairman, I was hoping we would come into this meeting and be prepared to be patient, be prepared to seize the initiative from financial markets and indicate that we were conducting monetary policy in a deliberative way as Governor Lindsey suggested I think what you've given us, Mr Chairman, is a courageous action in that it does step back from market expectations However, there is a difference between courage and foolhardiness; and no matter how strongly I believe that it would be appropriate for us not to take a step at this time, I do want to see how the markets react to this news because what you've suggested is, it seems to me, news So, it's a courageous step and I think we should see how the markets behave [in reaction to] the step that we're taking If at a point in time the Board of Governors were to decide to lower the discount rate, then it  -45-    10/6/92  would be appropriate under those circumstances to have a telephone conference call Even though my preference would be a straight ""B,"" you certainly accommodate what I believe is appropriate under these conditions   Which votes are you trying to lose? [Laughter] "
1583,1992-11-17," I don't view the idea of protecting individual confidentiality in a discussion as being uniquely different for the Federal Reserve than for other groups I do believe we have a basis that we can argue is unique to the Federal Reserve, and that is that it's really group confidentiality we're trying to protect, not individual confidentiality It seems to me that we have to distinguish very carefully between the discount rate, which does have a clear announcement, and open market operations, which under different procedures really are perceived quite differently That is, it's important for us to preserve the flexibility for open market operations [in cases where] we're not pursuing fed funds targeting For us to say once and for all that fed funds targeting is the real way to [conduct] open market operations ignores the possibility that at some future date some monetary aggregate or some reserve measure, borrowed or nonborrowed, might behave in such a way that we would follow that; and we would once again be in a period in which market forces would be moving the fed funds rate rather than our doing it deliberately as a part of our policy So, I believe we ought not to make announcements about fed funds rate movements; to me that would take away the emphasis of the announcement effect of a discount rate [change] I agree that maybe we ought to move the discount rate more often and thereby make more announcements We could try to lean more toward doing that and not go the long periods as we sometimes do because of our hesitancy to [move] the discount rate  -58-    11/17/92  I also believe there's another important point in the Gonzalez letter to the Reserve Bank Presidents that needs to be addressed His request that the position of nonvoting presidents be ascertained and recorded is one that we ought to resist with emphasis The reason we ought to resist it is that recording the position of the nonvoting members then could have us in the confusing position of announcing that the majority of the members voted one way and the majority of the 19 participants voted another way By doing that we would in effect be overriding the Congressional intent when [the Banking] Act of 1935 [established] a Federal Open Market Committee made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors and five presidents We ought not to fall into that trap of those [nonmembers] being recorded  Now, I do agree with Ed Boehne and others who think that we ought to ask ourselves whether all the delays are necessary I wonder whether or not the delay in the release of the [policy record] for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting until three days after the next meeting could be [shortened to] four weeks after the meeting; if there's a tilt on policy and we haven't moved in the direction of the tilt, then it seems to me there's not much revelation after three or four weeks I don't know how much we really gain by waiting through the last part of the [intermeeting] period I would not want to take away the flexibility that exists by making an earlier announcement than that   But the question is not for us to try to buy something; the question is for us to ask if we are doing what we're doing in such a way that we can defend it I don't know how we can particularly defend waiting quite as long as we wait on the release of those FOMC policy directives   Why? We have tilts on which we don't act and we have tilts on which we do act   But I presume we have some exposure in regard to the tapes; it's just that we think we reduce the time scale of danger, isn't it? Aren't the tapes subject to a FOIA request?   Yes, but I'm saying we do have a period of vulnerability in regard to the tape   I think we have to keep that in mind "
1584,1992-11-17," We have had a rather sustained six quarters of doom and gloom and yet the economy has continued to move along at an average rate of 2-1/4 percent over that six quarters In spite of all the talk about forward and back and double dip or triple dip, we really have not had as much variability in real GDP as normally occurs So, the economy in some sense is doing pretty well given these conditions As for the downside risk, I share the view that Jerry Corrigan has mentioned It does seem to me that the pace of developments--not only monetary policy but other policies and outcomes --in the United States is somewhat out of step compared to developments in Europe and Japan While commodity prices seem to be very subdued in dollar terms--in fact to some extent one might say they are still on a very slight downward trend, with a decline of maybe 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate over the last four years-- nevertheless, wholesale prices in the United States are not responding nearly as well as one would expect under those conditions That is, the rate of change in our finished goods wholesale prices year-over- year has been stuck in the 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent range for some time In contrast, even though they have much higher wage and price inflexibility, the year-over-year rate of change in wholesale prices in Germany is -16 percent and in Japan -13 percent And the Bundesbank is very upset about a 3-1/2 percent inflation rate as measured by their year-over-year CPI Yet, somehow or other, we are at 32 percent and maybe that's [viewed as] okay  I'm wondering with this GATT round--and we all seem to dispute where it [stands]--how much danger we're in with regard to a continuing rollback of trade openness With this kind of slow growth that the world is experiencing--and I think that's reflected in commodity prices--I'm wondering whether or not we really are on a much more dismal path toward protectionism than we may believe I'm wondering if Europe and Japan may be closer to zero in their real growth I'm wondering what that means for world capital markets if the United States is able to achieve 3 or 3-1/2 or possibly 4 percent real GDP growth It seems to me rather unlikely that we could get up to that level of GDP growth with [the economies of] Europe and Japan as slow as they are But I think there is considerable risk that the capital markets, and indeed politicians here, may not be willing to accept a rising trade deficit for the United States If under those  -21-    11/17/92  circumstances we have a restrained US trade position, and if the GATT round does not get done in the next two or three weeks, we could be in a very, very difficult [situation] I also wonder about world competitiveness under conditions in which many countries continue to have an industrial policy And there are those in the United States who I think are somewhat more inclined in that direction What happens to capital markets and what happens to profit margins when we have these kinds of competitive conditions worldwide? Do we find other industries falling [to] the same world profitability level that we've seen at times in steel and coal and ore? Are our airline profitability rates in significant danger of being repeated [in] automobiles? How long can we go on with Boeing and McConnell Douglas and other aircraft manufacturers being in somewhat of an up stage while we're watching these airlines and the major leasing firms have their difficulties? So, I'm not worried as much about a double dip or triple dip as I am about an expansion in the United States that is in some sense unsustainable given world conditions It seems to me we might have to ask questions about a true recovery, a true expansion, but one that is not sustainable in a world undergoing severe trade restraint So, I continue to find things to worry about "
1585,1992-11-17," 9 percent   1979?   I think they were pretty well stuck at 9 percent in '79   Mr Chairman on my preference for the short-run specifications, I agree not only with your analysis but also with your policy, although for me it's a preference for ""B"" symmetric under the conditions that you outlined As you described the risks, it seems to me that the risks are pretty balanced So, I think symmetric language really is more apt to describe where we are  In regard to the ranges for 1993, I agree with you that the technical conditions have changed Unfortunately, we stopped the policy of [making yearly] 1/2 point declines in the ranges that we had been doing a while back I would prefer that we go all the way to 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent Let me tell you why It seems to me that, when we have a forecast calling for 2 percent M2 growth for 1993, starting in with a forecast right [near] the bottom of the range doesn't give us much [room] for errors V2 could be slightly stronger than we expect as well as slightly weaker Under those circumstances I'd hate for us to run the risk of being below the target range when the economy might be performing in such a manner that we believe we're on target in regard to the economic performance, including price level stability The second reason I would favor the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is that I don't think it's going to be easy for us any time to make downward changes in the ranges So it seems to me that when we're making a downward change, we might as well make it what we need to make it at the time rather than be faced with having to do it later on The third reason that I prefer the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is that it gives us a midpoint of 3 percent And if Mike Prell's forecast on inflation is correct, then that 3 percent midpoint might  -28-    11/17/92  blend in to a long-term stable condition that would be conducive to this alteration of expectations I agree with you that a break in expectations that would get long-term rates to move down--think about what the 30-year bond at 6-1/2 or 6 or even possibly 5-1/2 percent would do for us in regard to growth--is very, very important The fourth reason that I favor 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is that what you said about inventories is certainly very applicable If we get an investment tax credit, if we get inventories moving, and the economy turns out to be a little stronger than it needs to be, and we have V2 where we think V2 will be, then we might find ourselves in the position of needing to tighten And I don't think that would be a good idea I would prefer when we need to tighten to have a possibility of [M2 growth] being at least in the upper half of the range So, the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range gives us that advantage  As for timing, with a new Administration coming in I think there's a real advantage to them in regard to their planning process to know what we know On the basis of this study that we now have available, we do not think of this as a monetary policy [issue] as much as we think of it as a technical adjustment to the changing way that M2 works and responds to short-run opportunity costs that we control So, I think it's very important that we provide the information when we know it and give ample time I agree that there's a slight disadvantage in not having the testimony immediately [But] the members of the Banking Committees and their staffs will have good memories and will give you ample opportunity to be heard on this question come February When I envision your answering their questions at that time, I see it as easier for you to be answering them saying ""Well, this is what we told you as soon as we had the study in on what we knew and this is what we told you as soon as we knew about the third-quarter GDP and third-quarter V2"" So, to me, it's easier if we do it now   Well, I'm certainly agreeable to that!   I don't disagree with that  -31-    11/17/92   You favor 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent? I didn't hear   I agree it could very well be off 2 percentage points or 4 percentage points either way!   But I would prefer to have [the projected rate of growth] closer to the middle [of the range]   Saying that we expect to make a cut in February is really a good two-stage approach to that--   --because, after all, we're only dealing with a tentative choice now anyway   We still have to make the choice in February   So, there's a consensus, then   The minutes would read that there was a consensus?   And the Gonzalez letter is the vehicle for doing it?   Sure   It's purely technical It would be a policy move for us not to make the technical move   How do we make it soft asymmetric? I counted six who preferred symmetric and then you said either way   I've got Corrigan--   He said symmetric but he could accept   Right, you said symmetric but could accept asymmetric   Sure   Right   I would admit that it's 6 to 6 I think the Chairman can decide!   Well, it really is a moot point; when the fed funds rate is on top of the discount rate it is a moot point   So, I'm not going to vote ""no"" either way--   --because it's not that big a deal "
1653,1992-12-22," Let me run this by again You mean a country owns gold and has it stored in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and if they ship it out, that's an export?   That makes sense!   But that again depends upon the elasticity of demand for the products   But it seems to me it's quite different if it occurs in a period of sustained monetary restraint than if it occurs in a period in which that monetary restraint is not in place   It seems apparent that the economy is stronger than we had anticipated I think the question we should be asking ourselves is why Now, it may be that this is a normal cyclical surprise, but I doubt it because normally we get a monetary aggregate like M2 growing at a fairly rapid rate in a recovery period and normally we get some upward movement in commodity prices as recoveries begin This recovery doesn't have those features and yet we have surprising growth in the midst of a period in which pessimism was the predominant view If we ask why, I think we may ask ourselves whether we have underestimated the short-run growth stimulus of getting the rate of inflation down We have decreased the tax rate on capital goods by lowering the rate of inflation, and that may have been in place long enough now to be giving us some real lift We're also seeing a labor productivity rebound which has been as strong as it has been in a normal cyclical [stage] in which employment and output both were growing So, this is something that we ought to keep in mind The one awesome worry out there is the external situation Will slow growth abroad and will the penchant for protectionism through either tariffs or subsidies or whatever cause the world's economy to be derailed? That's still a worry even though the US economy does seem to be well on its way to sustained expansion Now, it seems to me that the price level in the United States is still rising but at a decreasing rate And it seems to me that the price of gold may be falling at a decreasing rate Somewhere in here, if the rise in prices levels out at 3 percent, we may be missing a wonderful opportunity If short-run growth does respond as well as we might believe to lower inflation expectations, it would be unfortunate if we lost sight of the goal of monetary policy at the very time in which the field is most fertile for achievement of our long-term goal "
1654,1992-12-22," Well, nominal GDP targeting is really not as bad as it might seem in that it does have a heavy price level direction to it That is, the advantage of using nominal GDP as a target versus using real GDP is that we are saying to other policymakers that if they in some sense gear up activities that tend to cause wage rate pressures or other price pressures to take place, then they are voting for lower real GDP So, nominal GDP targeting is not that far away from what I think is price level targeting I think price level targeting is better, but we'll see   Take the supply-side shock we had in 1973 That supply-side shock with nominal GDP targeting would have produced about the same kind of monetary restraint we would have had if we'd pursued a price level target A very severe monetary restraint would have been induced by that kind of supply-side shock   Yes, but the problem is that the FOMC in the 1970s did too much of that   If you had chosen the monetary base, your voting record would have been more conservative than Tom Melzer's!   Mr Chairman, I strongly support ""B"" symmetric I have no appetite for asymmetry toward tightness at this point, first, because I think there still are some weak spots out there But more importantly, I see no signs that in this intermeeting period we are likely to need a tightening immediately I just don't see that need right now Also, I have the feeling that if we do need to tighten, 25 basis points is probably not going to be enough; that is, when we hit the point where we need to tighten, we may need to go 200 basis points in one nice move [Laughter] That would help the markets get out of this habit that they get into every time we have this kind of circumstance and we move 25 basis points and then 50 basis points and the markets say Well, this is the first of a series and the bond market really takes a big hit It seems to me that we can't be so lucky that a 3 percent fed funds rate is just exactly right, but I see nothing now that would cause me to believe that a move is imminent "
1703,1993-03-23," Mr Chairman, you're exactly right The authority is Robert's Rules of Order, newly revised Let me read [the description of] minutes ""The record of the proceedings of a deliberative assembly is usually called the minutes or sometimes, particularly in legislative bodies, the journal In an ordinary society, unless the minutes are to be published, they should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting, not what was said by the members"" So, Robert's Rules of Order clearly suggest that these are minutes and that we are doing them the way they suggest they should be done "
1704,1993-03-23," I'd like to take a few minutes to review the economy's performance in the monetary environment that has prevailed six months before earlier troughs in economic activity As you know, we've eased the fed funds rate from 990 down to 300 basis points What struck me when I reviewed this was that we only had the fed funds rate down from 990 to 8 percent six months before the [latest] trough So a fed funds rate of 8 percent six months before the trough seemed to be conducive to blunt the downward momentum that the economy had at that time We know that we had some head winds that occurred around the trough and after the trough And yet monetary policy seemed to be succeeding in overcoming the head winds and getting economic activity up to a somewhat lackluster 1-1/2 percent annual rate of growth in the second half of '91 through the first half of '92 Then, I think it's important to note that we lowered the fed funds rate In some sense we were trying to buy insurance as you will recall We kept saying that we must be sure that we don't [falter] because this recovery is pretty tentative and the outlook is pretty precarious So, we continued to buy insurance But at the time when the recovery was beginning to take off in the second half of 1992 with a 41 percent growth rate, the fed funds rate was 4 percent Over the first three quarters of the recovery, the average rate of expansion was 12 percent; the real growth rate was then 22 percent in the  -27-    3/23/93  first two quarters of 1992 and up to 32 percent in all of 1992 And all this was occurring in an environment with a fed funds rate of no lower than 4 percent--that is, unless someone believes that monetary policy works faster than it seems to me that it works Now, we know why we bought the insurance And as we were buying the insurance of taking the fed funds rate lower we said that there seemed to be very low downside risks to taking the fed funds rate lower just to be sure But there was all this talk about when the time comes, of course, we will pull that rate back up The tough thing always is to know where we are on the monetary ease/monetary restraint path It seems to me that monetary policy ordinarily needs to be in a slight restraint mode and ought to avoid having to be in a severe restraint mode That is, we have made a mistake if we have to go to a severe restraint mode Now, let's look at the indicators of monetary ease It doesn't surprise you that I would use rising commodity prices Let me give you some of the numbers Our ex-food, ex-energy experimental index is up 20 percent year-over-year It's up at an 87 percent annual rate for the first quarter I put the numbers in my machine this morning to [include] yesterday's commodity prices so I'd have them almost into the first quarter and it was an 87 percent annual rate Now, if lumber prices in this quarter are up at a 1000 percent annual rate, let's take lumber prices out and see what we have left If you take lumber prices out then it's ""only"" a 33 percent annual inflation rate in the index and I would agree that lumber prices alone ought to be discounted as being a monetary phenomenon--   It's always so easy to take something out so one can say ""I don't need to be worried about this"" Our total index is up 26 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, given a very favorable energy price environment with energy weighted at something like 55 percent of the total Then there are food prices, and I look at food prices because when we see these favorable unit labor cost factors there for us I think we have to know that that's really quite a positive But we also have to know that when food commodity prices start moving upward as rapidly as they now are And food commodities in our experimental index are now up in the first quarter at a 50 percent annual rate Now, gold prices are no longer falling In fact, gold prices are only 17 percent lower than they were one year ago Gold prices have been on a downward trend for a long period of time as the world adapts to a different monetary policy environment But gold has had a particular kind of technological evolution that is taking the United States from among the also-rans in gold production to the number two producer in the world with the new technology That, of course, is unlike an equilibrium price for gold that would have occurred in an earlier period That is, when we saw the price of gold get to $280 an ounce in the last decade, that was not in this environment with this new low-cost technique of producing gold So, we're in an environment now in which US gold production [incurs] variable costs somewhere between $220 and $250 an ounce And naturally in this environment gold prices tend to move downward relative to other commodities But gold prices have stopped that downward move Now, I don't know that this 12 percent annual rate of increase in gold prices in the last six weeks is all that meaningful Frankly, if it had not been for gold prices moving down, [I would have discussed this sooner] That's kept me quiet on this subject for longer than I otherwise would have been  -28-    3/23/93  As for the second indicator of monetary ease It seems to me that we're at a somewhat tepid foreign exchange value of the dollar in the face of the relative strength of the US economy versus economies abroad With our economy so much stronger and the other economies so much weaker and interest rates abroad coming down and interest rates in the United States being fixed, I'm asking myself Why isn't the dollar stronger? That seems to me an indicator that we may have more dollars out there than we realize The third thing I would suggest-- Governor Lindsey already mentioned this prior to the meeting--is that short-term real interest rates are approximately at zero, and that seems to be an indicator of monetary ease The fourth thing we have is an unprecedented steepness of the yield curve, which indicates that short-term rates have been pegged below the Wicksellian natural rate of interest I may sound very eclectic today but I guess that's how I am I suppose another perspective on that would be that a 3 percent pegged fed funds rate when the economy was moving at 1-1/2 percent is different from a 3 percent pegged fed funds rate when the economy is expanding at a faster rate Even I remember the IS-LM analysis! We have to have disappointing PPI and CPI numbers It worries me a little to be trying to run monetary policy based upon the CPI and PPI because those are not forward-looking enough, and the dangers that Governor Mullins mentioned are certainly apparent Now, in this environment I think we have to recognize that the favorable employment cost numbers continue to be extraordinary Also, commodity prices and steel scrap prices are rising--and by the way, Mr Chairman, steel scrap prices are up 89 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, though annual rates, of course, tend to get exaggerated But I think all of us know that if labor costs are being restrained and if prices are moving forward, indeed isn't that a wonderful opportunity in regard to profit expectations So, that causes me to believe that the economy may be stronger; and I continue to stand with my forecast, which is 1 percentage point stronger than the Greenbook's Now, if the Greenbook [forecast] keeps creeping up, at some point in time it may get closer to mine But I haven't moved mine up any since my Humphrey-Hawkins [submission]  Now, let me also look very briefly at three historical periods of concern My first concern is Where are we? I feel that we are in a position that is very similar to where the William McChesney Martin Fed was in 1967 The inflation rate was still in the 1-1/2 to 2 percent range and yet I think they ignored what they needed to look at and instead set the stage for that decision that had to be made to scrap Bretton Woods, in a sense turning the Fed's money printing machine loose as it was in the 1960s But, clearly, when Arthur Burns became Chairman, we already had launched into an era in which some very severe choices had to be made I'm talking about over-restraint Those severe choices, of course, were not made and the US economy suffered gravely from that era at the last of the Martin period and the first of the Burns period  I'd also like to look at a more favorable example from history, the Volcker Fed in 1984 Now, I think that anyone knew [the Fed had] to do what was done in 1981 and 1982, but to do what was done in 1984 was really unprecedented because the Volcker Fed at that point of time--and some of you were here--in a sense began to tighten up before they looked at the CPI and PPI numbers They didn't wait until they had bad PPI and CPI numbers I think Paul Volcker was always a closet commodity price watcher! [Laughter] And clearly he took the  -29-    3/23/93  steps that needed to be taken in a preemptive way And what that did was to lock in the progress on inflation It meant that the double- digit inflation came down to 4 percent and they locked it in It also meant that we introduced a period of rolling recession adjustment sector by sector rather than having the whole economy synchronized, and that prolonged the economic expansion  The last period in history I want to look at is one in which I participated--early 1987 I knew in January and February that I should be voting ""no"" to accepting a status quo monetary policy I knew we had over-extended ourselves in regard to lowering the fed funds rate in 1986 and we did not correct it But somehow or other in the mood of the time I went along Now, I think we're at a very dangerous crossroads We are pegging the short-term fed funds rate, and pegging the fed funds rate is a very dangerous exercise We have to recognize that the fed funds rate may not stay in neutral very long, pegged as it is I agree at least with Jerry [Jordan] that we shouldn't peg the fed funds rate, whether or not we agree on the direction it ought to go Now, it seems to me that we ought to enter a period here in which we let ourselves in for a little trial and error, [moving] the fed funds rate in response to the outlook for economic activity At this stage I don't believe that it is necessary to accelerate [our move to] the natural rate for fed funds--that has to be higher than the 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent range I just say that now is the time to say that monetary policy is working and we need to [begin to adjust] it before the time comes to do something drastic because doing something drastic is always very disruptive to the US economy  So, I think we're in a dangerous period I don't know that inflation is going to rise to 4 percent; I think not I don't think we have 4 percent inflation on the horizon What I do think is that our progress to get inflation down low enough so that it [isn't a factor affecting] any business decision is now in jeopardy And I think we have to bring restraint on board which gives us a chance to realize a continued diminution of the rate of inflation because 3 percent is really a very, very bad inflation rate The newspapers say inflation is gone; they mean 3 percent Three percent is terrible, and we have to keep on our course If we don't keep on the course to get it to 2-1/2 and then to 2 percent, I'm quite certain we'll lose it on the other side "
1705,1993-03-23," I agree with everyone on the issue of symmetry You've got that right I hope I'm wrong on the other score I hope that I'm worrying about something that doesn't need to be worried about I guess I'm also engaging in a confessional; I'm sort of apologetic for my past criticisms of the Martin and Burns Fed because [the job] really is tough It's very easy to sit there and look backward and say Why did they do that? The signs are very clear when looking backward; they are not so clear when one is looking forward I certainly recognize how tough this kind of call is But a few of the things you've said convince me even more of my position I hear the Committee being satisfied with 3 percent inflation I hear the Committee targeting 3 percent inflation I hear the Committee saying if the rate of inflation doesn't go up, we are all right Now, stop and think about this a minute What that means is that the Committee is confining the periods of diminishing inflation to periods of economic slowdown and recession, which is just the opposite of what our responsibility is, it seems to me Our responsibility is to apply the pressure that brings the rate of inflation toward zero continuously and gradually and consistently That's what our job is And I hear you saying that if the rate of inflation doesn't go up--and maybe it won't--we're okay I'm not more pessimistic on the rate of inflation going up than the rest of you I'm just very pessimistic about inflation staying at 3 percent, and [I'm concerned that] if it stays at 3 percent, somewhere in this expansion it'll go higher The minute it goes higher than 3 percent, then we're going to put the brakes on and we're back to a stop/go policy It really is very painful for me to be a part of this kind of operation So I thereby step aside from so many people I respect And I am willing to say that I am only the fool who sees it correctly! [Laughter]  Choosing a fed funds rate is quite different from changing the fed funds rate by increments If all of a sudden we dropped into the room and none of us had anything to do with where the fed funds rate is and we looked at the US economy, at the world economy and at interest rates around the world, what rate would we choose for the fed funds rate? I wish, Jerry, that I could rely upon M2 I always wanted to rely upon the Ms And I only left the Ms when the Ms left me! [Laughter] So, what we're doing here is that we're caught in an incremental creep You see, in the Martin Fed it was those eighth of a point changes in the fed funds rate that they belabored over; in looking backward with hindsight we see that they were clearly out of the ball park in terms of what they should have been talking about But we have the benefit of looking at that history and knowing that history  As for the bond markets, what I hear you saying is just setting the bond markets up for a real spill If we act now, some of the people in the bond markets will say ""What in the world are the people at the Fed doing?"" But they'll think about it, and I don't  -44-    3/23/93  think that the bond markets will react by saying ""Well, my goodness look what's coming"" Incremental creep, of course, gets the bond market participants to believe that the fed funds rate is not a random walk Consequently, if we get behind and they make the first move, the bond market will say ""Here they come"" and then anticipate all the moves that are there because they will also see those price numbers that are going to cause us to act I believe the fed funds rate ought to be set at such a rate that we would have just as strong a chance that the next move would be down as that the next move would be up Otherwise, we're going to do the bond market in But if we ask what should the fed funds rate be and say we should set it high enough that we would think the next move may be down because we really are in a fiscal mode change here--that I'm certainly very well aware of--it's possible that the fiscal drag in 1994 would be such that lower interest rates may very well be called for But if we start off into this environment with the fed funds rate at 3 percent when we may need to be easing, I think we'll be lost  Finally, I guess I have only pretended to be thinking the way many of you think because I really don't I really do believe in price level targeting I really do believe that our job is somehow or other to mimic that wonderful golden era, the gold standard, in which money is restrained in such a way that people have confidence in money and its purchasing power, and thereby I'd like to see credit growth right out of the roof in an environment in which people know that they can depend upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the purchasing power of the dollar So, Mr Chairman, as no surprise to you, I choose alternative C And I really don't care what you people do with your alternative language "
1759,1993-05-18, But that would be more restriction on you than you normally have when we have [an asymmetric directive] 
1760,1993-05-18," Jerry, your comments are very much along the lines of my thinking I learned to fly an airplane very early in my life; I had a father who was my flight instructor who taught himself back in 1931 He spent his life teaching me that the best way to be a general aviation pilot is to find out what mistakes people make And even though I don't fly very much, I do read very regularly about airplane accidents to find out what mistakes pilots make And it's interesting to me that the major mistake that amateur pilots make is that they get in bad weather and they don't feel the gauges are right Somehow or other they think the gauges are wrong It feels as if the airplane is doing this and the gauges tell them the airplane is doing something else We're at the place, in the murky weather, where the old monetary aggregates don't give us much help In this environment, we have to look at the gauges; we have to look at the instruments And the instruments tell us that inflation is rising Clearly, inflation is not going to go down to the 2-1/2 to 2 percent level that I thought was doable as recently as one year ago I think the Chairman is correct when he says that it's not a question of money or credit that explains this phenomenon Clearly, as others have said, it is an attitude question Now, in December I made some comments about a 200 basis point increase in the fed funds rate and, Mr Chairman, you [went further] when you said that 300 or 400 basis points really wouldn't work to change the attitudes Well, I guess I don't quite agree with that   The result   Here's what I think would happen I don't think we should increase interest rates by 300 basis points but, if we did, I'm quite certain the price of gold would immediately begin a [sharp], quick [drop] It would happen so fast you'd just have to go and watch it on the screen If we made a 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, the price of gold surely would turn back down unless the situation is worse than I anticipate If we made a 50 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, I don't know what would happen to the price of gold but I'd sure like to find out! [Laughter] Now, I want to remind you that monetary policy cannot do anything about growth except harm it Monetary policy can't fix growth; monetary policy can only harm growth; monetary policy can only cause growth to be worse I agree that there are some attitude problems out there and some significantly held belief by the American people and foreigners that the US government budget deficit is out of control And they believe that because it's out of control the Federal Reserve will not be able to stand firm They believe that we'll have to give in and that we will have to inflate our way out of this problem Now, I don't believe that But the American people do believe that, including, I think, your daughter, Jerry Maybe she doesn't even understand that; she just knows that inflation is going up  We cannot make growth better in the period immediately ahead We just can't do that Now, when I look at the first-quarter numbers in the Greenbook, nominal GDP was 52 percent Mike tells us that if the trade numbers come in [as projected], if real GDP goes up, then nominal GDP may go up also Now, we only had two quarters of the eight in the current expansion when that 52 percent was exceeded; one was 62 percent and one was 71 percent Of the eight quarters, the 52 percent is [the third highest] and everybody is sitting around wringing their hands about what kind of growth we're [experiencing] Pardon me, but every time I look at GDP quarterly data I see variations quarter to quarter I don't know what is going to happen right now, but monetary policy can't fix it Monetary policy can harm it Monetary policy is about credibility; inflation is about credibility Now, if the American people believe that we are not going to act, then this phenomenon of inflation attitudes we have will get worse; if attitudes get worse, that means the tradeoff gets worse We can fix the attitudes about the Federal Reserve very quickly And if we fix those attitudes, we will gain stature for our institution and our political system Our democracy respects proper decisionmaking If we do what we need to do, [inflation] attitudes will improve  At the last meeting I was very concerned about what commodity prices were doing And as you know, they got lucky again and told us that the rate of inflation was higher than we thought it was Now, I know there's nothing to it but they did get lucky I've had plenty of econometric studies tell me how lucky commodity prices can get I told you at the time that the reason I had not been upset before the March FOMC meeting was that the price of gold was well behaved But I said that the price of gold was moving The price of gold at that time had moved up from 328 to 344, and I don't know what I was so excited about! I guess it was that I thought the price of gold was going on up Now, if the price of gold goes up, long bond rates will not be involved People can talk about gold's price being due to what the Chinese are buying; that's the silliest nonsense that ever was The price of gold is largely determined by what people who do not have    5/18/93  trust in fiat money system want to use for an escape out of any currency, and they want to gain security through owning gold Now, if annual gold production and consumption amount to 2 percent of the world's stock, a change of 10 percent in the amount produced or consumed is not going to change the price very much But attitudes about inflation will change it  The longer we go with this situation, the more we'll have to increase rates and the higher long-term rates will go The sooner we move, then the sooner we [will remove] the uncertainty in intermediate and long rates that comes with an increase in short rates I hope Bill McDonough is correct that a rise in short-term rates will mean that the 10-year rate will fall Whether that's the case or not to me is a little uncertain, as I think it was to you That is, I don't know whether people will say ""Oh my goodness, the Fed is worried about inflation"" If the market's reaction to the first move is that the Fed is worried about inflation, then in that environment I would expect long bond prices to improve But every 25 basis points we give away on long bond yields--and we've already given 25 away by not acting when we should have acted--is lost When we act, when we let the American people and the capital markets around the world know that we care about price level stability--that's our mission--then we will be well ahead and we will return to falling intermediate- and long- term interest rates, which will help get growth higher A monetary policy step at this time is a win/win I don't know what is going to happen for sure I hope Mike is correct that the rate of inflation will move back down to 26 percent for the remaining 8 months of this calendar year If we make a move and Mike is correct, we could take credit for having accomplished this and the price of gold will soon be down to the 328 level and we can lower the fed funds rate at that point in time and declare victory But if what some of us suspect is true--that the Greenbook is a little optimistic on inflation--then it seems to me essential that we take a [firming] step I don't feel very strongly about it! [Laughter] "
1761,1993-05-18," I'd like to ask you a question also When you mentioned where we are, if the dollar were to weaken somewhat on foreign exchange markets do you think it would be appropriate in that circumstance to surprise everyone and not sterilize the intervention?   I know, but it seems to me that the timing would be--   You think a $200 million change in reserves would cause the fed funds rate to move definitely?   Yes   But what I meant was that if we change a path by $200 million, that's quite a few basis points, right?   What other meaning can you give to non- sterilized intervention than a change in the target?   You could demonstrate the $25 million of foreign exchange intervention--   We haven't raised it since February of '89  -42-    5/18/93   It seems to me important that the Chairman's powers not be diminished to require a vote I just don't think we want to do that at all   I think the Committee should remember that the reason for having [an asymmetric] directive is that sometimes the deliberation/decisionmaking process is facilitated by having the Chairman be free to make the moves that need to be made based upon what the Committee has said I guess I thought that's what you were after   Maybe I'm haunted too much by late 1986 and early 1987 At that time a lot of regions of our economy really were pretty sick You could put a football over the map of the United States and put one end on Phoenix, Arizona and the other end on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and lay that football out and the economy would really [unintelligible] Talk about pessimism and talk about depression and talk about the fall in land values from $1700 an acre to $900 an acre and in Iowa from $3100 down to $1400! That pessimism was strong It was hard to see then, but we knew what was there if we looked at commodity prices and gold And yet when we got ready to act, we were so incapable of acting because events got in our way This speech is about events that may get in our road One event was the Louvre Agreement When the Louvre Agreement [existed], it didn't seem appropriate for us to make a move because in some sense that was a part of what some of us thought was a deal And then we got into May of '87 and the dollar got strong; and I remember Paul Volcker saying ""Well, is this the day we want to increase rates?"" And I felt that the dollar was strong on that day, [so] maybe we didn't want to do it then We didn't do it; events got in the road and all of a sudden we found ourselves with the wrong fed funds rate in the fall when you came on Board, Mr Chairman So, of course, I want to act today I want to raise the rate today I'd be satisfied with 25 basis points That's crazy when I want 50, but I'm a compromising person [Laughter] I would recommend to you--in a sense I've taken myself out of the decision--that you stay with the Chairman's recommendation on an asymmetric directive I think it's very important that you do that "
1812,1993-08-17," Si, the late start on planting Is that pretty universal throughout your District all the way from Iowa to Michigan?   And Indiana had ample moisture?   And Illinois, I presume, is like [the others]?   In the global economy, prices and interest rates do adjust depending upon conditions that exist throughout the entire world market The one price that doesn't really move based upon global economic conditions is the fed funds rate because we at the Federal Reserve decide exactly what it will be And the question can be whether or not the rate that's chosen is in equilibrium with other rates throughout the global market system Six months ago it did appear quite likely that the rate of inflation for [1993] would be just exactly where it appears it is today I think those of us that made [forecasts] around that median for the group of about 32 percent inflation [thought] that didn't look too bad then [and it] doesn't look too bad now I never believed at the worst of the conditions in March that the rate of inflation for [1993] was going to accelerate It just seemed to me that we were in a circumstance in which global forces were somewhat favorable in regard to a decelerating inflation rate in the United States and that the United States in [1993] should have been poised for a continued disinflation I thought that we  -27-    8/17/93  should have ended up in [1993], conditions being ideal, with an inflation rate around 2-1/2 percent December-over-December That has not happened and we now find ourselves in a position where, unlike March and May and maybe even July, it just would not make any sense for us to make an immediate change in the fed funds rate given the market conditions as they are today  Certainly, I would agree with Al Broaddus and Bill McDonough and others who expressed the view that our posturing, particularly summarized by the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, has indeed worked very well for those of us who have a pragmatic inclination That is, look at the bond market and see what has happened It has really been an ideal arrangement, one which I think all of us have been concerned about as we brought rates down during the recession and slow recovery period The reason we wanted to be slow in bringing rates down is because we understood that bringing rates down as fast as the market wanted would give us adverse effects on long-term and intermediate interest rates, and recovery would be slower rather than faster So, I think it is always good news when things work out better than one might have expected I think that posturing was beneficial and I share Bill McDonough's view that if it's not broke, maybe we ought not try to fix it  But I do believe that there are some out-of-equilibrium risks that exist for us and that we ought to be conscious of them as we go forward First of all, most of our studies of commodity prices show very clearly that the true pass-through effects in regard to the CPI and the PPI were clearly driven by oil; that is, using US consumption weights to determine the right weighting on commodity prices gives us something like a 55 percent weight on oil prices on our commodity experimental index Not all is due to monetary policy; we're in a favorable period in regard to oil prices and that provides a wonderful window for possible further disinflation That window may not be open forever; just as oil prices sometimes get down toward the $16 or $15 range, we've noticed they tend to shift back up So the prospects of somewhat higher oil prices could be somewhat upsetting in regard to future inflation, but I don't think that exists for the remainder of [1993] Another probably more immediate worrisome out- of-equilibrium condition would be seen particularly in the dramatic change in the exchange value of the yen versus the dollar over the last year Think about a 20 percent appreciation of the yen It's sort of like when [a team] gets down to the final four It doesn't make much difference how well it performed against the also-rans; it doesn't make much difference how it performed in December when it was playing those state colleges that almost paid money to come and play at your university We are in competition, of course, with the Japanese yen as a reserve currency We certainly lead the way in that regard But if we take the G-3 countries plus Switzerland and look at their PPIs year-over-year, all of these countries but the United States have negative PPIs year-over-year That is, Germany's PPI is lower than it was 12 months ago; Japan's PPI is lower than it was 12 months ago; Switzerland's PPI is about exactly where it was 12 months ago; and our PPI--I didn't look recently but I assume--is around 13 percentage points higher than a year ago So there are some questions And it seems to me that if there's any kind of edge of a cliff, it's the edge of a cliff in regard to the prospect for the soundness of the dollar versus the yen whereby the world not only doesn't know what the price of yen in terms of dollars might be next  -28-    8/17/93  month but many might say, if asked what it would be 5 or 10 years in the future, that there is a general expectation that the rate might favor being in yen assets versus being in dollar assets Clearly our short-term interest rates do not provide reasonable compensation for that expectation and that kind of change  Productivity has been a real puzzle for me Clearly, if your forecast gets really thrown awry you say it's a puzzle; and part of my real economic forecast for [1993] has certainly missed the mark I really just don't understand productivity I don't understand how we can have a decline in productivity for the business sector of 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 percent two quarters in a row when productivity in manufacturing has been rising at 4-1/2 to 5 percent! Somebody really is doing very, very poorly; and if anyone knows who it is--who is really snuffing on the job--they haven't been spotted yet So, that is indeed a real puzzle  Over time, the battle against inflation is sometimes a battle of technology; whether technology will keep up is a question in the very, very expanding world I [don't] want to sound too Malthusian because Malthus I think forgot or did not really understand how equilibrium price adjustments can take place to forestall what he would call such dismal outcomes But when we noticed that the world's oceans finally produced less fish last year than they did the previous year, we knew something was going on We have a lot of technology in regard to harvesting fish and that technology has been used by a lot of people And it has interested me to note that fish prices of some of the good fish catches--I mean cod, salmon, and so forth--are relatively high at the grocery store And yet I thought it was interesting to note that the value of all the fish harvested in the world was less than the cost of production, which is a rather interesting phenomenon This doesn't tell us that we're going to run out of fish because we do know that aquaculture and other techniques will enable us to provide the demand that's there But we will not do it at the same price that is occurring when we're doing some harvesting I noticed that with all the attention paid to the floods in the Mississippi Valley and the entire region, there has been a lot of talk about corn production and soybean production, which I think is probably a pretty minor event, but very little talk about all that soil that went down the river  Now, over the years as China enters [the global economy] and continues double-digit economic growth with a billion people and as the world makes more and more demands upon resources, we will have an adverse inflationary environment to look at in the long haul And we have pegged the fed funds rate at a level that can't be changed right now, but it does need to be changed Since we missed the March and May opportunities to get that rate up, I think we do want to be fully conscious of the opportunity whenever forces are such that we can get the rate closer to what I think the Chairman indicated would be more of an equilibrium rate; we ought to be ready to do that "
1813,1993-08-17," Don, I guess I always thought an asymmetric directive could [mean] two things One is an indication that the Committee in the intermeeting period wants the Chairman to be alert to a possible move in one direction only But I presume there's also another aspect of it and that is that with an asymmetric directive the Chairman wouldn't feel very comfortable, unless there was a very unusual circumstance, moving rates the other way without a conference call; that would not seem to be appropriate I didn't hear anyone today talk about the need to lower rates during this intermeeting period What I'm wondering is, if we went to a symmetric directive, whether there is any likelihood that rates would really be lower without a telephone conference call   Yes   Right   Okay   That's a good idea! [Laughter]   I'm concerned that the Committee is becoming a little over-attentive to symmetry versus asymmetry Certainly, in May, as you know, the fact that we went to an asymmetric directive didn't convince me that [it was an appropriate alternative to] increased rates And if we continue to battle over symmetry and asymmetry, then we're back in the day and age in which the Committee groaned and moaned over an eighth of a point change in the fed funds rate, a change that really didn't amount to much So, the issue of symmetry and asymmetry is not very great, given the Chairman's statement that he does expect us to be in an asymmetric mode in the long run That is certainly more appropriate than acting as if we're going to tighten immediately I recognize that the price of gold has come down from $400 to $371 and that really is a factor that parallels the move that took place in the bond market; and that has worked very, very well And even if the fed funds rate is wrong, it would not be appropriate at this time to increase the fed funds rate I'm very  -41-    8/17/93  disappointed that we went past that window of opportunity and did not get it done, and I am very concerned that, with the Japanese yen/dollar exchange rate being where it is, we put ourselves in a position in which the rate of inflation actually is going to be higher than it would be if we had the fed funds rate at the level called for by alternative C That is, if magically we could go to ""C"" right now --we can't get there but if we could get a 3-1/2 percent instead of a 3 percent fed funds rate--the exchange value of the dollar versus the yen would not be so precarious and we would not have the window that is going to be there for price action by the automobile companies [They will raise] wholesale prices but that will show through [to consumer prices and], we're going to have a higher inflation rate at a 3 percent funds rate than we would have if we had 3-1/2 percent I also am concerned that a 3 percent rate provides lots of liquidity in the financial markets and it provides an opportunity for certain bubble events because money is scurrying here and there At a 3 percent rate, we're chasing people out of M2 accounts to elsewhere And all of that chasing may not be in the interest of long-run stability So, I'm very uneasy with the fed funds rate where it is I recognize, Mr Chairman, that this is not the time to increase it But more important than going back to asymmetric toward tightness would be for us to look for windows to get the fed funds rate up whenever we can "
1865,1993-09-21," Ted, did you have a NAFTA [assumption]?   I have two questions for Mike Mike, when I look at those interest rate forecasts that you have in place and then look at the ECI numbers on page I-14 of the Greenbook, I'm wondering what happens to the pension contributions For any period in which interest rates behave as you have them forecast, assuming that before the end of 1994 there might be some upward pressure on short-term rates, would that make much difference in regard to the impact on the ECI if pension plan fundings come under pressure--that is, given some of the assumptions on rates of return that are built in?    9/23/93   At the same time, for persons who are retired or approaching retirement and are counting on short-term funded investments, is there likely to be current and continued downward pressure on consumer spending from this segment due to the fact that there is a perceived reduction in investment income?   The last question has to do with your statement in regard to substantial fiscal restraint Substantial wasn't exactly the word you used but you had some--   --adjective regarding fiscal restraint Yet when one looks at the Congressional Budget Office forecast and I think even our own, the budget deficit doesn't change very much over this forecast period I recognize that a deficit staying around $250 billion would [constitute] a declining percentage of GDP, but I'd like to have you explain why you call it ""substantial"" fiscal restraint   Looking back over the last 18 months, the data seem almost unbelievable In fact, no one talks about it because it's really hard to believe The fact that we got to a 39 percent increase in real GDP--which no one talks about and I would admit wasn't 4 percent--and then had that cut literally in half! In some ways it doesn't seem that way That is, during 1992 no one really felt that good about things and in some ways during 1993 no one feels that bad about things [But] that's really quite a significant step down to be operating at that level and then to fall back What makes it more disconcerting is the fact that in 1992 December over December the CPI was up 31 percent and we've still got the CPI running at 31 percent Now, we're forecasting 1994, Q4 over Q4, of 2-1/2 percent, and I don't think anyone knows how to change that number No one seems to have any real good suggestions or real good alternate numbers that they've been advocating To make it even worse, the revisions seem to show productivity trends higher than we thought they were We've got productivity trends very, very high; we've got the ECI very well behaved and yet we're not getting the kind of combination of output and price level response that certainly seems desirable I wish I could say just why it is that the economy has faltered so badly, and yet I can only guess I think corporate rationalization certainly has been a factor Certainly, the FASB rules in regard to post-retirement health care benefits undoubtedly gave some impetus to  -27-    9/23/93  downsizing employment Certainly, the pension plan underfunding that seems to be there probably already is impacting large corporate employment plans And I think all of us are very well aware of how disconcerting that is Apparently, many people who have jobs in this environment are much more aware of the fact that jobs are not necessarily permanent So you'd think maybe we'd be getting a higher savings response or somewhat more conscious spending response and yet the numbers don't show that at all We don't see any budge upward in the saving rate So, all in all, from the domestic scene it seems a very strange combination  When we look abroad, certainly [we see] the impact of the economies in Europe and Japan; I guess the Federal Reserve staff and members of this Committee have all agreed that those economies are going to be weaker than they were generally thought to be by the governments and the central banks of those countries When we look at the stock market, I guess we would think that if all this downsizing and rationalization efficiencies are going on, the profit numbers ought to sustain the kind of equity prices that we see And yet ironically we don't seem to be having any inflow from abroad to US equity markets Indeed, in terms of diversification, mutual fund investors in the United States seem to be the only ones that are buying equities in Japan So, all of this gets to be pretty confusing and maybe I better stop before I get in worse trouble "
1866,1993-09-21," I can go along with ""B"" symmetric I would simply note that if you're looking at real output, the recognition lag may be longer than we would wish it to be So I agree with you that we need to remain alert "
1912,1993-11-16," Don, when you outlined your alternatives you mentioned releasing the raw transcripts with, I presume, a warning label on them as well as a warning label on the [MOD] Then you [discussed] separately the release of lightly edited transcripts You then gave us some advantages and disadvantages Did you consider an alternative of releasing both a lightly edited and the raw transcript?   But one of the disadvantages of the lightly edited transcript is that someone might say that it really wasn't [accurate], that it was really a rewriting of history   And one of the disadvantages of the raw transcript is that someone says ""Here's what happened"" and isn't very careful--   But you didn't visit with the Archivist or get impressions as to which [he would prefer], if he had both a lightly edited and the raw transcript I would think that most people would find it much easier to read the lightly edited one   I know, but it would be somewhat more expensive, I think, to do that back [in time]   It's desirable that we appear more intelligent than we are?   It seems to me that we do need to be somewhat forthcoming to Mr Gonzalez in addition to the three- and five-year proposal As we go to the hearing it seems to me important that we come forward laying some [proposal] on the table [to the effect] that we would expect him and his staff to maintain the privacy [of FOMC materials provided] I think we should make a deal before the hearing so it doesn't appear that we're fighting everything and then explain why it is that we're asking the Committee to keep [the materials] private  In regard to the future, the Memorandum of Discussion is acceptable to me with a three-year [lag] I think there's some advantage of having the organizational improvement [of an MOD] as compared to the lightly edited transcript I think a Memorandum of Discussion is unacceptable going backward because we don't have all the members [available] to concur I would prefer for the past that we have both the lightly edited and raw transcripts Now, when I say raw, I mean raw redacted according to the General Counsel's  -23-    11/16/93  privileges And I would presume, Virgil--tell me if I'm incorrect-- that references to individuals by name that in a sense weren't necessary could be left out Even in the raw transcript could names be left out?   Thank you   And what's the form going forward?   Do we have current minutes?   With attribution?   I agree with the thrust of your arguments This Committee has a lot of capability to maintain a deliberative process even if it doesn't seem exactly ideal I can't imagine, whatever happens, that we're going to let ourselves change that much   But we can go in more directions than one and [the differences in] one alternative versus the other alternatives are not that significant And I agree with you that changes can be made if they need to be made But I do believe that we need to decide today what we're going to do The longer we go without deciding, the more it's going to appear that somebody else is pulling our chain   No  SEVERAL No   And both   No one mentioned MODs going backward, did they?   Well, by only two people I believe   My first choice is releasing both [lightly edited and raw transcripts] with redactions   Right So my first choice is both; my second choice is the raw transcripts   Well, I guess in terms of the count we have a multiple choice here and we ought to boil it down to the two highest and have a vote-off on the two highest   Well, why?   I mean multiple choice voting-- You really need to find out among the two highest choices--   Listen, Robert's Rules of Order provides for always determining a majority; you can't do anything without a majority   But you don't have a majority first choice for light editing   Well, what was the count?   First choice?   Well, I sure didn't-- I heard a lot of raws and I heard a lot of boths as first choice How many raws were there for first choice? Were there three?   Okay, so it's the voting members I see All right   Well, that's fine if there's a majority   You have to annotate unless you put the original out   I hate to tell you this but the reason you want to do both is because if you have both of them there; that solves that problem   No, because somebody is free to interpret as they wish and say ""Look, here's the way the experts thought it should be""   Once you've edited, you've doctored it   And [for] some member of the Committee who is no longer living, I just think it's better to have some doubt in regard to whether the [editor] fixed it or not   I don't understand the first and second choice How do you count the first and second choice? Are you counting both choices?   You're just counting the first choice?   This is on the future?  SEVERAL The past   The past All right Five is first choice; three is second choice   But the emphasis is upon light and we must define what light means   Does that mean non-sentences become sentences?   You can't change the substance and I presume every sentence that's there has to be left there   Just solve it by the Archivist standards?   MOD first choice; lightly edited second   What are enhanced minutes? I thought the current minutes were enhanced minutes   What was the count on the MOD?   I thought that was your proposal--the MOD   Well, how did you vote?  -50-    11/16/93   Can we vote for lunch?  SPEAKER(?) Is that one of the choices?   Does either one of them have seven votes?   Then I think we really have to go around a second time   Well, then it seems to me that someone needs to move some motion and see if it passes or gets amended or something   Does enhanced minutes have attribution in it?  SPEAKER(?) No   Yes, we do that now   Mr Chairman, maybe that's what we need to decide Some of us want to have attribution and some don't Maybe we need to decide that first That's either a yes or no   Rather than discussing this, Mr Chairman, I would move that we have attribution first of all And then we'll decide what form the attribution will take afterwards I think that's the disagreement here   Does yours have attribution in it?   I thought we did that   We did it Now what?   Absolutely   It is essential that we go forward I don't know what the majority is on this attribution/non-attribution issue I don't know what the majority is on keeping the tape recorder on But let's find out Let's vote   That's fine Mr Chairman, I would move that we leave the tape recorder on All right?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Yes That's what we're moving Vote it down if you don't want it   But, Mike, one person thinks one way and one thinks the other A motion has been made and seconded Now, if you want to make a substitute motion and reverse the order, that's your privilege   That we leave the tape recorder on   But when the discussion doesn't lead to determination as to where the majority is, a motion is a very handy way to find out where the majority is   Of course All votes are--   Well, Mr Chairman, I don't care which we vote on first I'm open to voting on--   Okay   No, not unless-- Are we doing this as voting members or are we doing it with everybody?   Delay?   Six or seven?   Okay   Mr Chairman, my confusion here is this We had a discussion, which seemed to be much more in one direction than I anticipated it would be Then all of a sudden we had a discussion about, well, we can do it this way or that way, or we can make it work Many of us--I can go several different ways--can be satisfied with more than one [approach] I don't feel strongly about which way we come out But I do feel very strongly that this Committee is going to be disadvantaged if, after you've written your letter and you say you can't answer his letter about these tapes until the [next] FOMC meeting--   Is that all he requested?  -59-    11/16/93   To every part of his letter?   I don't think I understand what you're saying What decision have we made?   Yes But what decision have we made in regard to his request to give [the raw transcripts] to him? I thought that was a separate question   Virgil, is that a separate question?   So what is our decision on that?   Oh, I just didn't think that had been discussed and deliberated and voted on   I thought we were voting on what we were releasing to the public and we decided to do [lightly edited transcripts] with a five-year delay   Well, what I'm wondering is whether or not there would be a possibility of your going to him and asking him if we could make them available to him as a Committee Chairman and keep them private and still have our five years Do you think that's an option? I thought, Virgil, we had to deal with the fact that he's the Chairman of the Committee and-- Are we saying ""no"" to him? Is that what we've [agreed]? Okay   I see   Well, I do want to dissent from that decision   Could I ask you this question? Do you think there's any chance that he would be open, after you've told him we're releasing these lightly edited transcripts with a five-year delay and that means we're going to get out the-- Are we following the suggestion that we start with 1988 first? Is that the order?   Yes Now, after telling him that--that we've been forthcoming and the Committee has voted--do you think there's any chance that in negotiation with him he would be open to proceeding in the direction of having them himself with one staff person to review them and not go the subpoena route?   Well, I just would prefer we not get caught in a subpoena if we can negotiate our way out of a subpoena   Well, my fear is that we will have kicked and screamed all the way, and he will end up getting all of this [despite] our kicking and screaming and it will really put us in a very bad light with the public I at least wanted a discussion of the alternatives to going that route   My approach would be to authorize the Chairman to release to [Mr Gonzalez] whatever FOMC materials he wants to see, if he will agree that only he and one staff person will look at them and that they will return them to you within a reasonable period of time--   So that's impossible?  SPEAKER(?) That's impossible   Wonderful  SEVERAL Is it lunch?   Well, I agree with the Vice Chairman of the Committee that there are not likely to be issues here [in terms of] the Committee wishing to make this kind of change It seems to me that we've already expressed sentiment in regard to careful and judicious use of these instruments But I would tend to favor their being retained as a part of the arsenal under the arrangements in which we're very careful as to how they're used So I don't really see that much benefit, Jerry, of the Committee engaging in that study   Yes, it was about 1989 or 1990 when we had our last-- "
1913,1993-11-16," For the first two-thirds of what John was saying I was almost exactly in agreement and thought maybe I didn't need to talk very much, but then it turned out that--   It seems to me that the sentiment expressed around this table is surprisingly strong That is, there were those of you who were somewhat concerned on the down side who now seem to lack that same concern And certainly some of you who had a more placid outlook now seem to be reporting more vigor in regard to the rate of economic activity I think some of us--particularly I do, having had such a bullish view a year ago--have to ask ourselves Well, what about this year? Will there be another downturn? First of all, this recovery statistically does not have more variability than any previous recovery There aren't any fits and starts in this recovery; there are fits and starts in people's perception of it But the quarter-to-quarter variability is really just about right on Industrial production, which is a somewhat independent measure, indeed seems to me to be on a pretty steady upward progression  But economies don't get into difficulty because it gets to be January This January we do have this significant tax phenomenon, but  -83-    11/16/93  I've decided that maybe the impact of that tax phenomenon is mis- measured It's true that some people underwithheld in [1993] and they have to make it up in their actual 1993 tax payments and will have a significant increase in their estimated tax or withholding in 1994 But it seems to me that the people for whom that occurs are people with high incomes and they are well educated, and I just can't imagine that there's any surprise of fact Indeed, I think the political rhetoric--that is, the American people's dissatisfaction with government--continues to cause in some sense an over-assessment of the tax impact so people even in high income tax brackets probably are over-reacting and have already taken those tax effects [into account] in regard to their own permanent lifetime income notions and wealth present values Many Americans are not going to have tax increases The political rhetoric has been that they will; consequently, maybe we'll have a little surprise People will find out that [the new tax] isn't as bad as they thought it would be, and only a surprise, it seems to me, is apt to alter the activity level And it seems unlikely to me that we're going to end up with the same inventory condition in that we do not have the year-end boom this time, which subtracts out of the first quarter because of [efforts] to get [expenditures] in one tax period as compared to another So I think we ought not take it for granted that the economy will do a little dip next year  I'm not disagreeing with Mike Prell's forecast in regard to GDP; it's a very reasonable forecast But it seems very unlikely to me that the economy will be softer than what Mike has outlined I think there's a considerable chance that the economy will be somewhat stronger, or maybe surprisingly stronger, than that forecast But none of us has a crystal ball to be able to see that and to know for sure that that's going to happen The Federal Reserve has a great deal of credibility at this time We have quite a bit of esteem There are people who believe we're the only game in town because those who have such a disdain for their government tend to look to us as being somehow or other the people who get it right So we're in a rather preferred position and yet our responsibility is to continue to pursue a monetary policy that continues this disinflation If we [lose] that--that is, if bad news or an unanticipated shock effect cause the rate of inflation to zoom upward without any action on our part--there will be some penalties  As for the inflation forecast--and here again I'm not quibbling with that because it does seem somewhat reasonable--I would point out that it [shows] very, very meager [progress] And it's very meager [compared with other countries] in the world I was looking at the G-10 group and I believe we are only slightly ahead of the United Kingdom and probably a percentage point and a half ahead of Italy Other than that, all other G-10 countries have a better forecast, according to our staff, than we do This to me produces some vulnerability because as long as there are expectations of continued disinflation then I would expect good bond market behavior The bond market does have more potential for stronger bond prices and lower interest rates at the intermediate and long levels But that's not guaranteed; that's very difficult at this stage of the cycle And we have to be very conscious of the fact that if we are perceived as moving before people thought we should move--indeed if there were some notion of ""What in the world is the Fed doing?"" in such a move--we would probably get a very good long bond response and thereby not  -84-    11/16/93  damage the growth prospects On the other hand, if there were a pickup in activity and if world growth were to pick up somewhat and world commodity prices were thereby adversely impacted and we were seen as moving in a laggard fashion, then I think we could have a very significant upward movement in interest rates in the intermediate and long areas And that could [induce] some vulnerability in the markets I am somewhat bullish in regard to the equity markets I think the equity markets probably haven't had that last boom and bubble that often accompanies such moves The opportunity cost of being in the equity market is very, very small So if the economy is a little stronger and inflation about as we expect, the equity markets may have a somewhat supportive upside potential World growth has to be a very significant factor for an economy with our trade balance and its impact on us I'm not optimistic about Japan I'm not optimistic about Europe, but I'm not that pessimistic either; it seems to me that they may very well have reached bottom and we may have seen the worst of the impact on our exports in that market Mexico does provide some downward risk due to the monetary tightening that is inevitably accompanying the difficulties there, and that will have some adverse effect But China and other Asian countries and parts of Latin America may offset that to a great extent That about summarizes my view It is that the economy has the potential to be much stronger, but I think hardly any chance of being weaker than we've forecast "
1914,1993-11-16," My preference in this situation, in which the fed funds rate is at 3 percent and it really ought to be at 4 percent, is to be at a permanent symmetric position I would agree that this isn't exactly [the time]--I'd like to have a little better opportunity for timing than doing it today--but that's my preference A 4 percent fed funds rate just seems to be much more likely to be associated with stability in commodity prices, the price of gold, and a more neutral monetary [policy] position away from the accommodative [policy position] that we're in And I just doubt very much that we have an adequate ability to call the turn at the time So, I'd just feel a lot more confident with 4 percent but, Mr Chairman, I don't know how to get there "
1978,1993-12-21," That means send it up there?  -42-    12/21/93   Mr Chairman, I support your proposal I wonder whether there's a pre-step that might be taken which would set the context a little better, and I'd like to have Virgil respond I'm wondering whether previous to that [review by Banking Committee staff] we should state categorically what we think the tape will show   In a letter  -45-    12/21/93   Yes, so you state it And if there's any ambivalence there, I think I would approach the ambivalence before so there's no news value in the actual looking at it   Right, because of the vulnerability that [emerged], what many of us thought about as we began [preparing] our own testimony was What notes did I take and what did I do? And then even for those of us who had knowledge of what seemed to be the Committee's [procedures] and what the Secretariat was doing, when you said what you said it was clear and unequivocal that you had a responsibility as Chairman to reveal that information So the question that was raised by individual members was Should I put it in my testimony? Of course, for me, I had independent knowledge and it had to be in my testimony But there was a discussion, as I recall, of members saying Well, do I need to put it in my testimony? And I think we need to set [the point] out clearly that the individuals in asking that question never had any doubt that you and the Secretary were going to reveal fully [the existence of] the tapes So no one, as I recall, had any view of not wanting the tapes to be out there We knew they had to be "
1979,1993-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman When we look at this process, it does involve a lot of attention on the real economy; that is, each of the twelve Presidents naturally has a responsibility to speak about economic conditions in his District It wasn't too long ago that various groups were unified--well, unified or crossed--in their analysis by the role of M2 When V2 was stable, those who wanted to use the output gap approach to inflation found the stable velocity of money to be very helpful in regard to achieving a policy conducive to the level of output that would provide the kind of gap approach that would either restrain inflation or produce gradual disinflation Robert Black and Frank Morris certainly had different perspectives; both of them crossed in the sense of recognizing that M2 was information of importance In the [1970s] I suppose we talked about disappearing money With the V2 one-time step we were confronted with, in a sense, disappearing money in regard to its role in policy formation Many who looked at money did not look at it on the basis of predicting the output gap But the steady growth of money is to be seen as a prelude directly to price level stability So that the Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz background said If you do the right thing with money, you end up getting stable prices and you don't need to worry about the real economy The market-system economy is so efficient that if you provide stable money, then output growth and employment will be allocated very efficiently and we'll have very good end results But when V2 becomes totally unreliable--really it became unreliable in 1982-1983 and was unreliable many other times--then those who want to follow the output gap approach are left without a forward handle in regard to creating the output gap that's critical for monetary policy That's because monetary policy, as we know, works with a very significant and variable time lag So this concentration upon the output gap I think is somewhat exaggerated by the very good work that Mike Prell and Ted Truman and their staff do in the Greenbook because the Greenbook is an attempt to say ""Well, what's out there?"" And I think all of us know that the very best forecast is not really all that good in regard to knowing what is out there; the forecast has to be not only with regard to the growth rate but the forecast has to have the correct level of productivity to know where we are  -19-    12/21/93  Now, in this atmosphere it seems to me that it's very, very important that there be around the table those who continue to follow very closely the output gap because the statistics are clearly supportive of that view That is, the best predictor of the rate of inflation is that output gap And yet it seems to me that following that approach, even if it's economically advantageous, has a very strong political disadvantage That is, the very notion that we might take away the punch bowl when growth gets going is a position, it seems to me, that the central bank ought not to be in Since so many follow the other approach, I prefer an approach that tries to target the price level directly but I also don't have any help from M2 in regard to doing that And if we don't have help from M2, then I think we have to ask ourselves What is the current condition of monetary policy? Is monetary policy at the present neutral or is it accommodating or is it restraining? If M2 doesn't tell us by itself, then I think we have to ask if we're providing too much liquidity and what signs we will see as to that extra liquidity Now, I suppose the oldest approach would be the approach of Knut Wicksell, which says that there is a natural rate of interest And I think those who want to follow that--whether you want to concentrate on real or nominal rates--can look at the five-year Treasury and say that's what the market is saying the natural rate of interest is And if you pull the rate of interest too far away from its natural rate, you are going to be engaged in constraint or ease [depending on] which direction you go But you can't tell by moving interest rates up or down or leaving them the same as to whether policy is consistent  Now, I've done a lot of work--and many of the people here have been very helpful--in regard to commodity prices, because if money is rather plentiful then it should show up in commodity prices And that's a mixed bag There is no panacea here When you look at commodity prices today, you see a mixed picture You see a picture in which the price of oil has been declining and the Federal Reserve's experimental index of 21 commodity prices has about a 21 percent weight on oil in terms of its passthrough effects So when the price of oil has been coming down, as it is now, we know that we are in a very favorable immediate CPI arena Now, how well the CPI performs compared with being in this favorable arena may be another question But if you look at the best evidence of commodity prices now, it seems to me that they are not quite as robust as the price of gold But there is some picture there that we do have ample money on the table And if that ample money is on the table and we leave it on the table long enough until the CPI responds, then in some sense it's too late And it's too late in terms of stable money because sound money doesn't simply aim at price level stability; sound money is stable money and aims not to have any monetary-policy-induced cycles It seems to me that most of the cycles that we've experienced have been monetary- policy-induced And that's why we have to be somewhat in the forefront by not asking ourselves what's going to take place in the second quarter of 1994 but what the price level effects of what we do today are in 1995 and indeed in 1996  So, under these circumstances, I tend to be about where Al Broaddus is and to believe that [maintaining] the fed funds rate at the current level at some point in time will catch up with us And when it does catch up with us, we won't know how much of a move it will take in the fed funds rate to correct the situation That is, at 3 percent we've had a kind of head winds phenomena but we've    12/21/93  particularly had a household sector that has been very duration mismatched Now that duration mismatch is much less than the duration mismatchwas three years ago as money was flowing out of 6-month CDs into longer-term bond mutual funds and into equity mutual funds So for that reason alone monetary policy is more accommodative at the current level of rates than it was 17 months ago I checked, and it was 17 months ago, not in September, that the Treasury bill rate reached its low level because the market anticipated that level; so the Treasury bill has been really in this current range for about 17 months now And over this 17 months, monetary policy has become increasingly accommodative Now, I do not know when this accommodation will have gone on too long The US economy and the world economy have had a very significant real asset deflation, which has altered the behavior of the commercial banking industry in regard to making loans and has altered the behavior of people in regard to wanting to make loans So we're on new ground and we really don't know how soon such a change might take place So I would prefer to say the price of gold at $389 an ounce is too high And last spring I think many of us thought that the price of gold would never go above $400 But if you leave policy alone the opportunity cost of [holding] gold will be conducive to the price of gold going above $400 And the longer you let it go and the higher it goes, the greater will be the tradeoff cost of bringing inflation back to where it ought to be So in my narrow view, I can't see any choice but to say Let's try to move closer to neutral I don't think any of us knows where neutral is but I would certainly think it is closer to 4 percent than to 3 percent [on the fed funds rate] If we can do this before the bond markets tag us with a reluctance to move, I think we will get more output and more growth than we will if we, in a sense, get in a lagging market I'm very envious of the Swiss's 4 percent 10-year rate and the tremendous increase in output and growth that can occur If I thought that pursuing price level stability directly gave us more output and more growth and more employment, I don't know how anyone who cares about the quality of our labor force could ever foster and favor policies that lead to people being unemployed or people being bankrupt So I think it's a commitment to stable money; stable money gives us more output because we don't have to have those recessions Thank you "
1980,1993-12-21," Don, at what meetings in '87 were we asymmetrical? When did we first go [asymmetrical], at the March meeting?   Right   Mr Chairman, I certainly feel I'm in good company here There is-   But, John, if I'm correct, I think the minutes of any conference call we might have would be published February 9th Is that correct?   In other words, if the Committee made a decision-- So, who knows?   There's so much that has been said that I agree with, but I won't emphasize all that I think it's correct that it isn't right to go to an asymmetric directive We need to act at a meeting I think we all agree to that And many of you made some very fine statements saying ""Don't react to strong employment and growth numbers"" And the Chairman's statement was really very, very helpful in that regard I'm going to add one other tough deal, all right? And that is Don't make a 25 basis point move And here is the reason If we are as far away from neutral as I believe we are, it's much better to wait a week or two and get 50 than it is to do 25 because 25 could be [misaligned] by the time the bond market reacts to that So I strongly believe that when we act--or when you act--that it should be 50 basis points Remember the 1970s and this jiggling along with moves of 1/8th of a percentage point; it just didn't work It's so hard when we start moving rates up; in '87, Don, I believe we [initially] raised the funds rate by 25 basis points Did we move it at a meeting or did we move on an asymmetric directive in March?   But I think that we put the rate up 25 basis points and then the bond market [went up] another 50 basis points and of course that wasn't enough And it wasn't until Alan Greenspan came in that we really said ""Hey, wait a minute,"" and then we were caught in a very bad timing situation Now, not only do I think we ought do 50 basis points but I really think we ought to do 50 basis points now And the reason that we ought to do it now--or whenever the next opportunity is--is because unexpected bad things happen You go along and you get an employment number, or you get this or you get that, and it just doesn't seem [to be the] right [time] to do it We were caught with that in May of 1987 I remember Paul Volcker called Manley [Johnson] and me in and said, in effect ""Look, you guys have been wanting to increase rates; I'm now telling you when you want to do it, just let me know"" Every day we looked at the markets, including the foreign exchange value of the dollar which was strong, and we found an excuse every day not to do it, so we didn't do anything And that made it more difficult So, do 50 and do it now "
