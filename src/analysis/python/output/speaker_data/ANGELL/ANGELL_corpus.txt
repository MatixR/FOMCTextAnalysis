 I hesitate to make Governor Seger incorrect on that point I feel as if I am the boy from the farm After listening to all of these big city reports, it makes me aware of the fact that places like Boston, St Louis, and even Minneapolis are big places when you come from the farm There is a different perspective in the rural areas that [stems from] the immediate emotional impact of all that has happened and continues to happen Those forces tend to affect people's willingness to take on debt because the entrepreneurs all have run for cover and besides that the lenders don't want to lend So a really different mix is occurring and I suppose that gives a different perspective However, I must admit that I have been very impressed by Jim Kichline and Mike Prell and their staff and the reports they gave Looking at my forecast and comparing it to theirs, I come back with a question that I want to be sure that I am right on before I proceed Jim, I understand that your projection has built into it a decline in interest rates over the year of what--75 basis points?   With that kind of projection on interest rates, then, I guess my forecast wouldn't be so different from yours I must admit that I made my forecast based upon a continuation of the present level of interest rates If we get that kind of movement in interest rates, the timing of that certainly would have something to do with what the forecast might be I admit to having probably the lowest inflation prediction of anyone here; I'll claim the 2-1/2 percent inflation number I don't mind doing that because I've been around economists for some time and they all told me how inflation was going to be higher than it turned out to be; so I don't mind having been on the right side of this issue for the last five years and continuing to be on that same side  I think Governor Seger is correct in analyzing the foreign sector in regard to the competitive level there Their economies are very price and wage flexible and, consequently, they are going to take the steps necessary to continue, or maybe to add to, their position in our markets But the impact of the deflationary environment is certainly there, and I just don't see any signs of any change in inflation psychology Now, I see the expectations there; but if the inflation expectation remains above the actual rate of inflation it seems to me that we are going to see that in such areas as inventories The forecast of the inventory accumulation that might occur is not going to be very plausible if the actual rate of inflation is lower than the anticipated rate In the area of oils and chemicals and farm products, it seems to me that with the declining price scenario one would want to hold fewer inventories, not more inventories So I have some questions in that regard  I am also somewhat hesitant to believe that equipment is going to do as well in this kind of environment as some might expect, but that might be influenced in part by my own perspective in regard to equipment in the farm sector I don't know when John Deere has their wage negotiations, but they probably coincide with the auto industry and it seems to me that they are a long way from re-entering that market My last comment is in regard to the natural rate of unemployment I don't know what it is, by the way; but whatever it is, it seems to me that it's falling faster than unemployment is falling In fact, it may be dragging the unemployment rate down so that any margins that we had are still there I do not see any wage negotiations that indicate we are getting closer to the natural rate of unemployment than we were   I prefer to keep M1 as a target I think the range should be maybe 3 to 9 percent With velocity at a negative 3 percent, the staff's dollar nominal GNP forecast gives a 97 percent rate of growth in Ml I believe the marketplace would have a better understanding if we really communicated the range that we think is plausible That would give us the opportunity on the quarterly short- range targets to specify [our objective] more clearly as economic events develop and as the velocity of M1 becomes better known I keep being reminded of the events of 1917 to 1946 when Ml's velocity fell from approximately 4 percent to approximately 2 percent So it seems to me that it is entirely possible that velocity may not always have a long-term rising trend and we should accommodate that [possibility]   Mr Chairman, my preference for the 9 percent was strictly in response to your query That is, it seems to me that if we raise the limit and don't mean anything by the new limit, we haven't accomplished much We've increased market uncertainties I would prefer to go to the 9 percent because I think that's enough room I do not believe as much financial innovation change will occur in 1986 as we had in 1985 So, it seems to me that 9 percent will provide us reasonable opportunities to stay within the range and then we could take the language out, which I believe is confusing and could have adverse effects upon [market] views of the dollar I would prefer [providing] some more certainty to the market If a real emergency occurs and is recognized, that would have to be dealt with   You really get tied to it But if we want to express to the markets what we mean, it seems to me that that is the least risky path for us But it would be a mistake--    2/11-12/86   Well, I think velocity like last year is rather unlikely I don't see why money demand would be apt to increase at a rate faster than last year, and it would seem to me that financial innovation changes ought not to contribute as much as they did last year Mr Prell, do you have any idea what proportion of our growth rate last year was due to the deregulation?   I agree with Mr Corrigan   Yes, I would prefer that   There seems to be a consensus   There is no economic incentive   I am afraid I am with the consensus in regard to wanting us to stand still, provided that stand still means standing neutral Unfortunately, we are in an environment in which we don't have M1 targeting that can really be a policy guide as it was in periods in the past Since we don't have M1 targeting, we don't have any way to let interest rates respond to economic forces So it seems to me that we have been pegging the federal funds rate When I try to factor in a change in the price of oil from $28 to $18 over a period of time when the funds rate has been pegged at 8 percent, I do not get the same responses in the real sector that I would get if we had some other way of running monetary policy I'd note that the market's judgment during this period of time has been that interest rates ought to come down Market forces have brought rates down other than the rates that the Federal Open Market Committee controls It seems to me that unless Messrs Axilrod or Kichline or Prell can tell me otherwise, I would tend to view actual policy as being pegging interest rates Now, I don't mind pegging interest rates temporarily during a period where the income velocity of money so misbehaves that we don't know what we are doing But to run through a period, for instance, of a $28 to $18 change in the price of oil, natural gas, coal--the entire [unintelligible] of the whole economy with pegged interest rates seems to me just to be repeating exactly what happened in the 1970s when we had oil price increases and largely had a pegged and somewhat discretional policy--an adjusted pegged policy It scares me, and I do not have enough foresight to be comfortable in this environment If Messrs Axilrod, Kichline and Prell can tell me that my concerns are unfounded and that the model really works--that the real growth occurs with no interest rate responses--I will feel much more at ease because I have a great deal of respect for their judgment   I don't have more confidence in my ability to set the peg I am expressing--   Well, would you explain to me what it is? I just don't understand   But it seems to me that--   If oil prices were to move up from $18 to $28 and interest rates stayed the same, I would--   It seems to me that it's a very big factor   I would guess so   The models that I have run and can think of-- unless someone can point out another model to me--would suggest to me that the path toward expansion in the real sector is through a reduction in interest rates When you run a model of oil price changes and keep interest rates the same, then in that model I don't see how any real analysis is going to operate   Well, I never use such models   But I don't subscribe to popular views that we should have been accommodative during periods of price increases for oil I would have thought we should not have been accommodative   I cannot be satisfied with standing pat if it means that we peg interest rates at the current level   I would hope that we might be able to have some reemphasis of Ml targeting and that we might be able to watch commodity prices and see how they behave If commodity prices behave by moving upward due to the exchange value of the dollar, and with the commodity price impact of the oil price change, I would want to take cognizance of that   I think I've expressed my view   Mr Sternlight, what would happen to the fed funds rate if economic growth came in somewhat weaker?   So, lowered economic conditions, lowered inflationary pressures, provide ample opportunity--   And in view of this policy that we're looking at, under those circumstances the members of the Committee would accept the market's sense of adjustments in the fed funds rate and the other rates that might be relevant?   Well, I can accommodate to that kind of policy if it would appear that the fed funds rate would be sensitive to market forces, particularly if the oil price decline turns out to be as great or greater than we anticipate I lack understanding as to how the fed funds rate has remained as stable as it has over the past seven months, given even some wording of a slight change in pressure   But I haven't seen two-week averages in the 9 percent range nor at 7 percent   It seems to me that the uncertainties certainly outweigh the facts we know in regard to the future It's important that we look at the day-to-day numbers; we may not want to believe them, but we ought to look at them and keep track of them The monetary aggregates certainly have rebounded in March If those aggregates continue to move at the March pace, I think that might tell us something different than if growth falls back to the January- February level I think it's very significant that in the global economy and the domestic economy as well we have dramatic price changes We end up with winners and losers Before one concludes too quickly regarding the impact of these kinds of changes, we have to recognize that sometimes the marginal propensity to consume for the winners isn't always the same as it is for the losers And it seems to me that we do have a severe danger of encountering a world trade contraction in this kind of environment If that occurs, that's going to impact the export markets and undoubtedly put more pressure on the deflation of international commodity prices Commodity prices are moving sideways to slightly downward with oil excluded If those commodity prices pick up speed on the down side, I think that is a very risky pattern It's a risky pattern not just for agriculture and oil interests in the United States; a lot of the third world countries are commodity sellers And if we continue to thrust the third world into a position of not receiving any kind of a return on what they have to sell, they're not going to be buying as much as we might expect them to buy But it seems to me that if we don't stumble, eventually these real balance effects will take place I'm somewhat concerned that oil prices at some point in time might not do what we want them to do I suppose all of us would prefer that they move up a bit and stabilize But we don't have any guarantee of that  It seems to me that we might need some rather dramatic moves if oil prices were to rebound sharply So, I think we have to watch things very carefully I would indicate that I'm much more optimistic--I like to be optimistic about something--than the group now [and] as much as six months ago with regard to the inflation front It seems to me that it's imperative that we get our inflation rates down in the 2 percent or 1 percent range during this oil price move If we end up with our staff forecast of inflation, I think that's very bad news for the dollar and our future So, I'm somewhat optimistic that if there's any indication that prices are going to move in another direction, we could be in for one heck of a deal  -16-    4/1/86   Have you taken into consideration any change in desired inventory levels due to a period of falling oil and energy prices?   Over a period of time, the inflation rate in the services sector is going to be much slower to adjust to monetary scarcity than it is in the commodity sector because we have too many established techniques for maintaining these rates of inflation, not the least of which is government There continue to be areas in which, unless you put pain on government, you don't stop the wage increases in government   The next step is that, over a period of time, the private services sector is going to adjust those rates of inflation to the others, as soon as they believe them But how are they going to believe them when our own staff and our own FOMC don't believe the rate of inflation is down? I don't understand how we can lead the way to lower inflation when we keep saying it's going to be higher   There just isn't any basis for an easing policy right now Alternative B clearly is in the right ballpark I am a little concerned about the 7-1/2 percent [Ml] number It seems to me that velocity may be on a different path than we anticipated In previous periods of history it has been on a downward path for many, many years and changed inflation expectations may very well mean that we've got negative velocity I'd anticipate negative velocity of more like 4 percent for the second quarter And if we have 4 percent, I don't know that 4 percent nominal is too high, so I would be much more comfortable with an 8 percent than a 7-1/2 percent on "B" I am not concerned about the reserve positions as long as the Desk is astute, as they have been during the time that I have watched them, in regard to managing that account   Would you want that even if that meant that fed funds rates tick back up?   Most of that seasonal borrowing may not recur this year simply because there is liquidity there and the seasonal borrowing privilege has not been used At least that has been our experience   It seems to me the most likely event that might necessitate tightening would be an oil price move; that probably would be more likely in this quarter than robust growth   Well, yes And it seems to me that if we had an oil price move upward and it appeared to some that a cartel move might be effective for a while, with the money the public seems to want to hold in transaction balances we might have some wider shift in expectations that might require some tightening It seems to me we should be prepared for such a policy if that were to occur   Yes   Yes, that's why I'd like to have 8 percent on the Ml I just think that if the economy gets weak in the second quarter we're apt to see the March M1 numbers go the other way   Except that it intends to imply a range And I don't know whether that's--   That's what I'm saying   But with the staff's estimation of a negative 3-1/2 percent velocity, that means we want a self-fulfilling prophecy of 4-1/2 percent or 4 percent nominal and that's not much   What comes out at 9 percent?   Okay   Well, it seems to me that if Ml and the other aggregates were on a higher path than we anticipate, we could accommodate some upward move in the fed funds rate If it's lower than we anticipate we ought to accommodate some downward movement I don't think we should pinpoint the fed funds It seems like--   Yes   Put "together with"   Together with   Are these data coming in or are they a forecast?   Is it the number? He should have the number on the US residents--   Consequently, if you had an increase in foreign holdings, that would result in a reduction   The world economy still seems to have a fairly high saving rate I keep thinking about the fact that the economies with the higher saving rates over the last 4 or 5 years have also been growing the fastest; they have gotten larger In addition to that, if you take the exchange rate move in dollar terms, the Japanese saving rate gets to be a lot larger than it was when you translate it in yen terms And then when you add the oil recycling and redistribution, that seems to redistribute income to areas where the saving rates remain high At the same time, I keep thinking about all the investment spending that was spurred in the 1970s when oil prices were rising Everyone was building tankers and pipelines and nuclear plants and hydro-electric facilities, and these are all long-term kinds of investment demand It was not just one country; it was a world-wide phenomenon But we don't have that left anymore; all we have left to do is build buildings and aircraft So it doesn't seem to me that there's much to indicate that the world economy is going to be moving forward with all that much vigor World prices seem to be dominated by the fact that there are people out there, particularly in the Third World, who are trying to get hold of dollars and want those dollars I think the world may see enough supplies in agricultural commodities that I don't see much of a bright outlook in regard to the US share of the agricultural world in time to do much help in this decade So it seems to me that what Jerry Corrigan and Manley Johnson talked about in regard to the exports is rather doubtful The United States is still the largest exporter in the world And I think it's going to be a very difficult market to compete in The people that had those trade surpluses aren't going to give them up very easily because they don't want to take the employment drops that would occur if they gave up their balance of trade surplus positions So, I think there's going to be a very significantly competitive market Maybe we will make some gains in regard to reducing our imports, but not everybody can do that and a lot of countries are trying So, [the foreign sector] seems to be a drag as far as I can see  Corporate profits released this morning seem somewhat disappointing again That indicates that the stock market may be more interest rate driven rather than anything else I don't know what that has to show I would note, when you look at housing prices in Boston and Tokyo, that it really is rather difficult in a mobile world for housing prices to get too high in one area compared to another because it does translate, eventually I presume, into higher wage rates We hope you'll pay higher rates in Boston and drive those firms out of that area and into other parts of the United States; it would be really welcomed I don't know that we necessarily have to move Texas to Boston, but it's really difficult to go a long time with one area of the country having a rather significant revival and other areas of the country having very bad [times] If market forces work, we can expect land prices to adjust and housing prices to adjust and wage rates to be more attractive somewhere else So I'm really pleased to see that  My real difficulty at this moment is that the staff forecast for the 1987 inflation rate just scares me to death Maybe it's wishful thinking that it's not going to be there But if it is, it's way too high If we're going to do anything about it, we ought to do    5/20/86  firms, even in manufacturing, are doing reasonably well to quite well But the very, very large firms--mostly ones headquartered in New York with operations all over the country and the world--still are stumbling, with one prominent exception and that bears on the point somebody else made earlier We do get reports from  that their consumer-related appliances--refrigerators and that kind of thing--are now really very strong "Full-out" is the way it's being described to me So that bears on this feedthrough effect from the housing side In New York City itself, office buildings are very strong In the suburban New York areas, I think we have precisely the same situation that Frank mentioned in Boston in that there is something close to an outright boom going on in terms of the housing market and housing prices particularly Some of that unquestionably is a reflection of the fact that for better or worse, and I guess it's for better, the financial side of the economy in New York City itself--not just banking, but the whole ball of wax--is throwing off just a tremendous amount of income Wages and salaries in that area are growing very rapidly, but the standard wage bill doesn't begin to capture it People will tell you about salary increases of 6 to 7 percent, but what has happened is that various forms of incentive compensation and bonus compensation are now widespread They were once largely the domain of the investment banks but now they are everywhere And the payouts under these various plans are truly enormous And as I said, there's no question that in a major way that is feeding the frenzy that we see in the housing market in particular  In terms of a longer-term outlook, there are a couple of concerns that one hears about One is the one that I think Gary Stern and Tom Melzer mentioned that while the inflation outlook right now and for the foreseeable future is terrific, what might it be out somewhere in 1987 in a context in which the economy is very strong, import prices are feeding through, and the beneficial effects on prices of the oil situation are largely behind us? The other concern that one hears more and more about--and I guess this is a bit of a problem coming out of the closet--is a concern that basically says that maybe these go-go financial markets have gotten a little too much go-go in them The concern is not just in terms of prices but in terms of all the exotic activities and the implied uncertainties and risks associated with these various patterns of behavior; it's a kind of nagging feeling that there are vulnerabilities there that perhaps are not fully understood And that uncertainty, as it can bear on this financial marketplace broadly defined, I think is getting a great deal more attention  In closing, one anecdotal comment I was poaching in Mr Parry's territory Saturday at the [unintelligible] meeting and two things surprised me One was that there was an article on the front page of the Phoenix paper that said that four of the highest paid executives in Phoenix were bankers and that two of them were making over $1 million a year I then had occasion to visit one of the new communities developing way up north of Phoenix And there around a golf course, Desert Highlands, were 70--seventy!--houses under construction And they start at $1 million   Do you have any hard data?   Well, it is true that in Kansas they are shutting wells that are coming in under a half a barrel a day But I find that--   I also favor alternative B and I prefer draft II I would want to be a little clearer on the fourth line of draft II to say rapid M1 growth and weakness in M1 velocity I am not sure that M2 is rapid when it's right in the middle of our range and expected to be in the middle of the range I do believe, however, that there is another immediate policy move that needs to be made to reflect the weakness of the dollar and the undesirability of further weakening of the dollar at this point I would think it would be just ideal if the Chairman could negotiate with the Secretary of the Treasury so he would be willing to have intervention on behalf of the dollar, provided the Japanese and Germans cut their discount rates 1/2 point So, I would like to see something take place in this environment; and I think that would be a step that would be helpful to everyone   I think that's pretty close to the truth   Isn't there some point in time that the Ml growth path in and of itself gets to be fast enough? Particularly if we are moving down the demand curve due to the interest rate declines, I would expect that at some point in time--that is, if interest rates don't drop--we ought not to be getting that kicker any more, so we would expect M1 to decelerate It seems to me that it's more logical that M1 is going to decelerate The question is How much? I guess I would like to have Jim's comments on that How long after we bring interest rates down do we expect to get the quantity demand response just due to the lower interest rate?   Let's say you estimate that 5-1/2 percent of the M1's recent path might be explainable simply by the interest rate response That response is going to disappear at some point in time   I want you to understand that if Ml begins to grow slowly, [unintelligible] if we get it down to the 5 percent path after we have been at 15 percent and we don't see any evidence We can do all the talking that we want to about the economy's growth path, but the hard evidence is that the economy is still on a 2 percent real growth path That's all the hard evidence we have If we don't have any evidence and we get into the third quarter and the  -37-    5/20/86  third quarter still looks like 2 percent or drifting to 1-1/2 percent or slower growth, we've got to ease   It seems to me that we could make some progress if we decide which draft we want to alter Draft II has the aggregates mentioned and I slightly prefer to have the aggregates mentioned If we start from draft II, then let's make the changes If everybody wants to start from draft III, okay, but I don't think we can work from both of them at the same time   Yes   That would be fine   Alternative B says 10 percent; it would have to be 9 to 11 percent   That's all right   12 to 14 percent   Yes   You had that happen in 1980   "Unusually rapid growth"   No, 12 percent; it was 119 percent   12 to 14 percent   There is no use denying it; it's there   I am not sure of that   That is right That will be fine I don't see what is wrong with the way that is stated It says about the same thing Slower monetary growth than unexpected, especially of the broader aggregates, and sluggish economic performance   "And pronounced sluggish economic performance"   I like that better--"sluggishness"   And a period after "performance," right?   5 to 9 percent   Well, it seems to me that we are just not certain at this point what is going to happen It seems to me as likely to be in one direction as another direction If the economy does grow slowly--does not pick up from the 2 percent path--the bond market is going to know as soon as we do   Two weeks makes sense   Sounds appropriate to me!   It seems to me that we might have some doubts about the US economy, but there is a lot out there that tells us that the Third World is [unintelligible] debt [Given] Japan's and Germany's growth rates, it seems it would be very desirable to have some further easing of monetary policy in Japan and Germany, and I just don't think we ought to give up I don't think we ought to give them what they want, which is a little help on intervention, without getting a step from them I am not willing to do it unless they make the move we want them to make   The foreign exchange market may have been somewhat dominated in recent months by market uncertainty as to whether or not our policy leaders in the United States would prefer a lower dollar It seems to me at this point in time, [given] the time lags that we have in regard to knowing what we have accomplished, that it is not a desirable move for us to have an appreciably lower dollar and [we should] take away that question of uncertainty Right now someone thinks someone is going to try to push it lower Just taking that away might create a more stable climate, which would give us more options   I think that's [unintelligible] maybe   Roger, I remind you that we don't have a great big stock of yen We don't have as many as I would like us to have; I thought we should have bought more in 1984, but-- So, we are not going to intervene a whole bunch because we don't have that many yen to take profits on But it might come time to take a little profit--   Well, at this moment in time, if the Japanese were to cut their discount rate 1/2 point, and the Germans cut theirs and we didn't cut ours and we said [unintelligible] at the same time, I don't think you'd have to worry about an impact I think the markets would take note of it   Oh, you might make the gesture I'm not sure; you might change the psychology slightly for a bit, but--   [Unintelligible] an impact   Your insurance goes to those people who want to take comfort in being short in the dollar  SPEAKER(?) You're underscoring too many risks in the market   Well, of course, I have some concern here that intervention ultimately is a monetary policy decision I'm very sympathetic with Bob Parry in regard to that I don't like to lose anything Whenever you start off and do something you prove you're going to lose, I don't think that helps you Personally, I would tend to prefer not to intervene on a sterilized basis unless I were willing to make a monetary policy adjustment relative to the two other countries It just seems to me that the Secretary of the Treasury has been the person carrying the ball here on this topic And it's somewhat of a monetary policy topic, so I think maybe it's appropriate for the Federal Reserve to have the Chairman speaking on some of these issues from time-to-time I'm somewhat encouraging him in that direction   Well, Bob, it may be worse than you did! That's one way to look at it   It seems to me that a midyear change in the range would make more important what we do not want to make more important The markets have already understood very well; they haven't had to have any guidance from us that we are permitting Ml to grow faster than the 3 to 8 percent range So I think the less said, the better Leave 1986 as it is I would strongly endorse Mr Corrigan's position that at some point in time--when, we do not know-- inflation might once again return You understand I say "return" And if it were to return, then velocity would behave in a manner consistent with those periods when inflation was a factor and it would be very important for us to have the M1 tool ready to go My particular preference would be for 1987--well, you don't want to talk about percentages But I do think it is important for us to have Ml in there I don't think we need--   Well, my vague statement would be that I would prefer for 1987 what you may remember I preferred for 1986 a 3 to 10 percent range because we do not know at this point in time how velocity is going to behave in the deflationary environment that we are in  -15-    7/8-9/86   We're probably going to make big mistakes on both of them   No, 3 to 10 percent   Are you arguing for 1987?   That could be a real problem   It seems to me that the most significant factor we face is that the world economy is not really going much of anywhere; it's stagnant And I think it's behaving about like we would expect the world economy to behave in a period in which international credit had been on one path--on a 20-25-30 percent growth path--and then entered a period of much slower growth Adjustments get to be very difficult And world trade is no longer [moving in] an expansionary fashion I think maybe we are beginning to find out why it was that protectionism got to be such a significant movement in the 1920s and early 1930s In this environment it's only natural that everyone will worry more about their market share than they will about a growing market And in this environment I think it's very difficult for us to expect to make as much gain on our balance of trade as we would like to make I think it's going to be very difficult for those who enjoyed huge balance of trade surpluses not to have pretty slow growth economies unless they do something about the deflationary impact on their economies  Apparently, I see inflation somewhat differently than others do I have come to see it less as a set of numbers that behave in such and such a pattern than to see inflation laws and attitudes I see an attitude that says that prices rise and prices don't fall And during such a period, individuals are anxious to restructure their portfolios away from monetary assets to real assets During inflationary periods, you see, people are rewarded who are good at making portfolio shifts like that In such a period you find--whether you're in the farming business or in the oil business or whatever business you're in--that you make more money depending upon how fast you borrow money and how fast you buy equipment and how fast you spend money  But a deflationary environment is really quite different A deflationary environment is one in which people begin to see that prices can fall as well as rise It seems to me that John Maynard Keynes in his Treatise on Money gave some really good indications about what one might expect to happen during such periods And it seems to me that what is happening in the world's economy reflects the actuality of inflation being less than anticipated I might suggest that if we're to do our job in economic analysis--of course, we cannot always forecast without any errors But whenever we as a profession begin to forecast the rate of inflation over a 5- 6- or 7-year period and all the errors are in one direction, then I think one could make some case for the fact that inflation expectations are misplaced And those with time lags in production find out they can't sell their product at the price they thought they could, so people's behavior changes It seems to me that we're finding that kind of behavior change under way And in this behavior pattern more firms are going to devote attention to cutting costs than they are to trying to buy a lot more equipment The adjustment process is really rather significant So, even though I used to be more pessimistic than others in some ways, I turn out to be somewhat more optimistic in a sense We have undergone such a significant deflation in many areas    7/8-9/86  of our economy and we're still kind of hanging on and I think that's a real plus  I believe we have to recognize [changed conditions] in agriculture, and Jerry may have been somewhat of a stimulus there But when direct government payments to farmers and price support activity and direct payments for compensation for [unintelligible] differences are moved from a $12 billion annual rate up to a planned $24 billion annual rate and it is missed so badly, as I believe this last agricultural bill has missed it, that the actual expenditures [unintelligible]--they are going to run more like $32 billion than $24 billion--that puts a lot of support money out there And eventually that's going to hold up  If we can continue to try to have some patience and be cautious and make careful moves so interest rates adjust to changed conditions in the world, it seems to me that we have a chance to continue along on what some may think is a rather slow growth path The only disadvantage of that slow growth path may be that it makes it very difficult to get the government budget back in shape As you know, when things happen in agriculture as they have happened, then those Gramm-Rudman targets get out of kilter So that adjustment process may be very, very slow But it seems to me that we have a good chance to keep expansion going for some time in the future I'm not going to be too pessimistic on the basis of the numbers coming out right now; I'm going to be optimistic as long as we respond with interest rates to market perceptions in regard to these world economic conditions I would certainly have a different forecast if I thought we were going to peg short-term interest rates and prevent them from responding to market conditions So, I'm in a position of saying that my forecast is exactly the way it was in February I'm not sure that is all that good but it may not be all that bad, if we can avoid any major deflationary or financial market disruptions that [brinkmanship], I suppose, runs a risk of encountering   Yes, I would agree with Frank I think we just don't know at this point I don't see any reason to change; I don't think the gesture of a half point means that much at this point   Our 6 to 9 percent won   We had 7 or 8 votes for 6 to 9 percent   Well, it seems to me that even if we had 6 to 9 percent, we would have plenty of room to be at the bottom end If we find that we can get growth at the bottom end, then I think that's the time for us to lower the ranges, rather than bring them down a half point and then have to take them up half a point some time I would rather demonstrate that we can do well within that 6 to 9 percent range But it's no big deal   Bob, I share your sympathies And there will be a point in time that I would like to be able to play that card of reducing the ranges I just believe there will be another time when we will need that emphasis, whereas today we would almost be giving it away I would rather use it when the time comes that we need to say we are going to plant our feet [against] any reinflation That's when I want to play that card   Well, we [concede]   Yes   Yes   My view on M1 is that when you go back and look at the data on velocity of money, historically, 6 is a very, very fast velocity V1 fell from over 4 for 1918 to under 2 for 1947; that was a 29-year period that velocity dropped And, of course--   From 1918 to 1947 V1 fell from over 4 to under 2, and I don't know where--   Yes   Yes, but I believe that there is some evidence that we've entered another period like that [earlier one] And the reason I want 3 to 10 percent is because I don't know when this    7/8-9/86  [policy] accommodation we've been implementing for some time might take hold If it does take hold, I'm not going to be satisfied to have an 8 percent M1 growth path   Well, I think that would be a good idea, too I'd be glad to postpone the debate until next January or February, because at that point in time we will have more evidence as to what velocity might be If we tend to get a decline in velocity throughout this year, then I think a case could be made for that adjustment   Well, I'll switch to the 3 to 8 percent real fast then, because I want it in; I want an M1 range   I like the very way you said it first, with the brackets and the asterisk and leaving it in That gives a signal that we are going to look at it again in February   Leave it and say we will run above it   If the Chair wants it in, I think we ought to have it in   --"the overrun"   "Faster growth"   Overrun describes it   Instead of saying "and potential inflationary pressures" I would put "price movements" I think we want to look at price movements whether they are up or down   Well, inflationary or deflationary It seems to me that we run the risk that someone could look back and say These  -51-    7/8-9/86  guys don't realize that they have a deflation going on I just think we ought to have a balanced approach here   And price pressures   We rely upon you to explain it   There might be some sentiment for just dropping it   M1 is a sacred cow   [That's why] they pass sunset laws   I think we ought to leave the sentence that is already in there with respect to M1   That does it   Because you rejected my 3 to 10 percent   That's just perfect  SPEAKER(?) That's great   It doesn't only help us with 1987; I think it also does something about 1986   We might say "in view of the anticipated reduction in interest rates"--it wouldn't have to be the discount rate--in order for the $300 million borrowing number to make sense   Absolutely Japan is going to be in there intervening and, of course, whether or not that does any good remains to be seen But if they don't do any good with intervention--if they sterilize all of their intervention--they will end up having some very low yielding returns in the United States So, we put some pressure on them It seems to me that the elasticity of their exports in regard to their exchange rates is much more sensitive than ours, [unintelligible] improvement of our balance of trade So it seems to me that Japan eventually will have a jolt if they do not take action   That's correct   But it seems to me that with a cut in [our] discount rate at this point, when the market finds out that Japan and    7/8-9/86  Germany haven't cut theirs we could expect some real pressure on the yen to appreciate further I don't see how that can be avoided But that does put pressure where it belongs; and I think that they will be rational people and, in that environment, that they will move   But I will go with alternative A   It means the $300 million; I don't think we ought to change the degree of reserve pressure If we lowered that to $200 million, I think it would be a little more difficult to run the Desk than keeping $300 million   So to me it would make sense for us to keep the $300 million--maintain the same pressure that we have had--and do what we want to do with the discount rate   Yes   Because we are decreasing it from where it was   Well, we could say "maintained [the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions], consistent with lower patterns of interest rates"   The reason we would have the same borrowings would be because after we voted to decrease reserve pressures somewhat the Board lowered the discount rate That would make it necessary to go back and--   We said ["maintain"] in December   That is fine That hits the spot It is not quite the level of writing you did earlier, but--  -66-    7/8-9/86   That's fine   Yes, with a cut in the discount rate--if the elasticity of the demand for money is anything like it has been--we are probably going to get another boost   We've been wrong before   This will take us down to 6 percent to--   Let's say 4 to 8 percent   That combination does not apply with the world [unintelligible]   So just leave it the same, 5 to 9 percent    7/8-9/86   I don't think we ought to tell anybody what we are doing!   Second   I think you've answered part of my question by indicating that you generally buy the traded security rather than at the auction   Yes, but when you've been buying, I presume you buy the actively traded issue   So, by buying the less actively traded issues then you get a higher yield than you otherwise could get?   I have some hesitation in seeing us buy the actively traded issues, then holding them when they become inactive, and taking what I would call a loss in liquidity that occurs when an active issue becomes inactive But it's--   It isn't always true that you can gain liquidity cheaper Your give-up cost isn't always lower by selling bills; sometimes you can have a give-up cost that's lower selling coupons than selling bills But you don't sell coupons   It seems to me that we ought not to be in coupon issues unless we have a policy of also selling coupon issues That is, I would prefer that we manage the account in the same way that one might manage other kinds of accounts I hesitate for us to be in    8/19/86  coupons without fully playing both sides; I think if we're going to be in coupons we ought to have the alternative of selling coupons   It seems to me "bills only" is a lack of flexibility But coupons when you can only buy and can't sell is a lack of flexibility   If you put out such a release, the bond markets are going to be immediately affected by that release And you probably are not going to want to have that impact   If we put out a release and said that we're going to buy more coupons and we're going to sell more we might get by with doing that and not affect the market Yes   I would like to see the weighted average maturity over time The data we have doesn't give us that It would be very helpful to have a history of the weighted average maturity   Gestate  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] just this month   I think we not only have the normal J-curve effects here, but we also have to look at this in terms of the deflationary environment That is, the J-curve effects in an inflationary environment could be quite different than in a deflationary one We've already seen the impact of oil prices in terms of wanting to hold inventories during a period of declining prices And we've now gone through a period with declining agricultural prices because of a US policy change We're now seeing a period of falling agricultural prices with a huge feed-grain crop, corn crop, coming on this fall You tend in those circumstances to expect to find people delaying their purchases because they expect prices to be lower; so inventories will tend to be drawn down I think our agricultural exports are probably not going to be picking up very much very soon    8/19/86   Does that mean that vacancy rates will once again enter into the picture?   I, too, would like to respond to Bob's question; it's a very good question It's easy to say somebody's forecast is wrong without trying to do your own I would tend to put off by maybe up to two quarters the improvement in the net export picture The staff has a $26 billion improvement shown between Q3 and Q2 and a $28 billion improvement of Q4 over Q2 It seems to me that that could be very difficult to accomplish, particularly because oil prices might be causing people to want to have higher oil inventories--and higher oil inventories don't come out of US production, they come out of more imports If that export picture doesn't improve then it seems to me somewhat difficult to get quite as much improvement in the US government budget deficit as shown So, I would just tilt a bit in that regard I think there is a reasonable chance of getting the [staff's] 1987 growth rates in the export sector; if we don't we're in trouble   But it is something of a problem, it seems to me, to assume that we know that at the current level of the dollar the trade will work when that J-curve is fully operational If we were to make a stand on the dollar at this point and turn out to be wrong--   That hurts us, not just with regard to our exports to Japan, but it hurts us with regard to our exports to many of the [unintelligible] and the Third World countries where Japan is going to try to make up for their lack of growth in [exports to] the United States They are going to try to beat [us in] those other markets   But they don't necessarily repo them    8/19/86   Because, otherwise, they wouldn't repo them The reason they repo them is because we didn't put the funds out   We have a bit of double counting here; last time we changed the fed funds range a full point with a half-point change to the discount rate I would think we wouldn't want to change the fed funds range from 4 to 8 percent I don't see where that is warranted   I am very sure that monetary policy does matter That's why it's such a difficult call here I don't share the notion that it doesn't make any difference; I think it makes a great deal of difference It seems to me that we have more balanced risks to worry about this time than I [saw earlier] I don't like easing in the face of the monetary aggregates being where they are I don't like easing  -47-    8/19/86  when I have a sense that commodity price developments suggest another outlook At the same time, I think there is a greater risk that this [economy] could deteriorate further on us and compound government revenue [problems] by growing at a rather anemic rate I think that's a pretty dangerous risk I think there is a dangerous risk in that the world trade pattern is still stagnant, not expanding I think that Tom Melzer and Gary Stern are right when they say that inflation expectations have changed But that's what worries me on the other side, because I see inflation expectations rising and the rate of inflation not rising And that tends to cause me to believe that output is going to be slow, not fast So, given this severe difficulty, I am very hesitant about being on the side of an easier stance which could best be accomplished by a discount rate cut and leaving borrowing at $300 million But I do believe that we are in a place where if we do get some indication that prices are moving too high that we then have to be prepared to take the next step--which would be to say that discount rates can go up as well as down I have very little faith that we are going to be so accurate as to get this thing tuned just right without overshooting, but I am afraid not to take the steps So I am reluctantly for easing   Well, I certainly would have put a different context on it If the discount rate were cut and if the dollar were under more pressure than we wanted and if we thought we wanted to make a gesture of intervention, I think it would be appropriate in that context also to go for a higher borrowing target I don't want us to make an exchange rate move without in a sense backing it up a little But I would not prefer cutting the discount rate and then just as the  -51-    8/19/86  market gets used to a lower discount rate, boom, hit them with an increase in borrowing and knock the fed funds rate up That's the part I don't want, but I--   In the context of that I support your proposal   The one you suggested or Frank's?   No   I prefer leaving the borrowing at $300 million as an initial part of the approach If the circumstances are such that we don't cut the discount rate I don't want to take the borrowing down to $200 million If we do cut the discount rate, I prefer that borrowing be at $300 million but I would want there to be latitude that if developments then require a higher borrowing level that we would do that If we ever got ourselves in a position of wanting a discount rate increase we probably would precede that first by taking the borrowing from $300 million up to $400 million and $500 million and then we would condition the market that we think it's time to increase [the discount rate]   Mr Chairman, I think that if you put that out as a proposal it will pass   I'd leave it   But that also might mean that you would sell at times when--   It might have an announcement effect   It seems to me that if we do not want to sell, and that presumably is the consensus, we ought not to buy as long-term as we've been buying That would maintain more liquidity If you can never sell then there is merit in shortening the maturities that you do buy   That's not [unintelligible] three years   Yes, I don't think they are being sold I don't think there's any reason to be in the 10- and 30-year issues if you're not going to be able to sell   I certainly welcome all the comments about market commodity prices I would review just a minute by suggesting that we have a severe commodity price deflation on our hands and I think it is encouraging that our accommodation of the world's demand for financial assets has, in a sense, blunted this deflationary move It seems to me that there are ample signs that the accommodation of this demand has worked But it is very difficult to stop the deflationary move without creating some changes in expectations, which are most apt to show up in precious metal prices And any index that has those precious metals in it is going to show that kind of movement, which I think is what you might expect But the index numbers that I look at do not show any appreciable change I think it would be appropriate for us to recognize that there is a tremendous supply side force out there in regard to commodity supplies worldwide I don't think that has changed I would agree, however, that we are undoubtedly somewhat vulnerable to any outside force that might create a particular kind of shortage that might produce a price rise It seems to me that Si Keehn had it exactly right when he said that this is probably the time to wait and see what happens I am very impressed by the fact that the United States and Canada now have the best record in year-over-year wage changes That is, our 3 percent wage increase, year-over-year, is only beaten by Canada's 29 percent A couple of Scandinavian countries are very close, whereas many of our major trading partners are running much heftier wage rate increases I am somewhat encouraged by those wage rate movements, which may provide some stimulus abroad That is, those wage rates along with their low inflation rates, it seems to me, are going to provide some real substance to better final demand in Germany and Japan So I think that is encouraging I am in tune with the staff's forecast both for GNP and prices I think there is a grave variation in terms of accuracy of these forecasts dealing with the inventory numbers and the export timing change; but I feel--   Productivity in the service sector is low but I don't think we know how to measure it Productivity in the goods producing sector remains right at the 32 percent level that it has been at for some time   I think we should note these prices are not [unintelligible]   It must have been per   Alternative B   I certainly believe if commodity prices were to make a move upward by a significant amount, [precipitated] by some unforeseen event, that it would require us to look more carefully at the monetary aggregates and to tighten slightly; and I would take the borrowing up to $400 million I don't know how likely it is that that event is going to occur, but I think it would be appropriate for us to have an understanding that a move would take place if it needs to   I am not sure that we want to have greater reserve restraint I don't want greater reserve restraint right now I would only want it under certain spelled-out conditions   The markets would interpret that as more than a trickle--  SPEAKER(?) If the yield curve steepened, policy would be tighter   We had 7 to 9 percent the last time   I would think so   I think 7 to 9 percent is fine   Yes, it refers to M2 and M3   7 to 9   You could take the "about" out, if you want to be more specific We put "about" in there for fuzziness at one time   If we are looking here at 9 percent, with about 9 percent you are going to stay on there   But the 9 percent stays on the cone   That's right And M2 is slightly under it   This is splitting hairs over something that we know nothing about   Yes, let's stay with it until we--  SPEAKER(?) We can put it lower in the--   I would suggest we add international credit and commodity markets   Or the dollar depreciates   Suppose the Japanese stock market went down dramatically and suppose oil prices started heading lower dramatically and we got some other kind of movements there and a pessimism prevails--if M2 was growing at 5-1/2 percent and M1 was at 6 percent, I think you might want to have lesser restraint   I don't think there is any reason to make it appear in the minutes [for this meeting] that we know what's going to happen in this atmosphere I think we ought to leave it balanced, but we can imagine in our minds what is likely on either of these or what might be   Yes   Of course, what this means--and I've had several conversations with our staff over this--is that, with productivity in manufacturing doing what it is and the way we go about measuring it, we have to have negative productivity in the service sector And that raises the question as to how we measure productivity in the service sector; the fact of the matter is that we really don't So there is some kind of strange averaging process going on there I think there's really grave doubt as to what our productivity in the service sector is But if productivity in the service sector is stronger than we're measuring then that means, of course, that our economy is doing a little better than we are measuring So there are those two aspects that are very interesting   No   I think the most unusual development is that we haven't had anyone around the table who has taken exception with the staff's inflation forecast This is the first time that I remember that someone hasn't suggested that inflation is going to be higher than the staff forecast That may be good news if that is shared around the producers; it may very well be that we don't have those deflationary and disinflationary forces that may depress the economy I am getting somewhat optimistic because even though I have stayed with a 2-1/2 percent [forecast] in regard to real growth, it is getting close enough to the staff's forecast that I see very little difference It seems to me that our economy is rather recession resistant in the sense that the proportion of population of elderly-- retired with social security and retirement income--is kind of a nice    11/5/86  floor Farm programs do provide a safety net, and certainly, the service sector tends to produce income flows to a large portion of the US economy that tends to make it not too susceptible to a dramatic downturn Certainly, there have been no indications of any inventory accumulation based upon price expectations, and so there is very little danger of any typical inventory-lagged kind of recession I do think there is quite a bit of risk, of course, of those sectors that the staff is forecasting to increase just matching in very nicely with those that may have been decreasing So there has to be some risk of that [not] occurring But I would be at a loss to suggest which way the risk is the greatest It would seem to me that if we avoid any dramatic alterations in the money growth path downward-- You know, we have been running Ml at a 16 percent path and I think we all find it surprising to look back and see that If we had it to do over again I am not sure we would have chosen a lower [path], given the way velocity turned out; but if there is any downside risk, it might show up in a rather quick change from a 16 percent growth path to a 6 percent growth path If that were to occur, we ought to look at that I don't know whether it is occurring or not; I think there might be some evidence as one might expect We are getting to nearly three months without a discount rate cut and that's almost unheard of this year; probably in that environment we might expect the M1 growth path to show a change The leading indicator that I run says that may be happening So it seems to me that we do have a fairly good outlook  I agree with Roger Guffey that the meat producing segment of the farm economy, which at times can account for half of net farm income, has profit margins or spreads that are about the best we have seen Even though we haven't seen a trend toward higher numbers, the feedlot operators know how to keep them in the lots a little longer and have them go at higher rates; consequently, we do have some opportunity for some good food price news, perhaps with regard to some continued downward news in poultry and hogs and finally beef prices Let me end by suggesting that all is not well on the price front I think we have a danger I think it's quite likely that the President will receive on his desk a trade bill before next spring has passed and I think that might pose the first warning sign of a danger on the inflation front   In dollar terms, but not in yen terms You see, in yen prices--   Yen prices are lower and volume is lower, so the yen value of exports is down   Well, I think it's important to realize that what's in the bag is a cessation of the worsening of our trade balance That is going to show up in the GNP numbers rather substantially just because we have stopped worsening our position But it remains to be seen whether in a sense we are substantially narrowing that trade deficit   But the point of it is that there is outsourcing in the United States as well as outsourcing abroad A lot of this is outsourcing right out of the boundaries   Ditto   I would prefer symmetry   "Woulds"   No Symmetry would be "woulds"   Well, this is a very significant issue   Use the September   I would like to make a case If the monetary aggregates came in exceptionally weak, I would hope it would not be a "slight" and a "might"   Well, we should But how abruptly?   So we continue to learn to live with the worst of both worlds   Jim, how much different does productivity look if you differentiate between the service sector and the goods producing sector?   Then it is possible that we really don't measure productivity in the service sector and don't measure the value of output in the service sector We just assume productivity is going to be zero in the service sector, and lo and behold it is    12/15-16/86   Do you have import prices moving up this year by 5-1/2 percent?   And you have import prices moving up in 1987 at 10 percent Now, let's posit that they would turn out not to be that strong Let's suppose that import prices were to move up next year more like they do this year; I presume that means that the real trade doesn't improve as much   Real GNP isn't as favorable, which would also mean slightly better on the inflation   On balance it deteriorates If you do that, then in the scenario in which the foreign exchange rates remain about constant, rather than depreciating 10 percent, that together weakens the entire--   Do you have any interest rate assumptions for the United States vis-a-vis--   The interest rate assumptions are built in or are not built in?   So US interest rates--   I didn't quite understand you   Are there any corporate profit assumptions that are explicit in this forecast?   Ted, thank you   You assume this interest rate sensitivity works both ways on the same demand function?   [Unintelligible]   If it did have symmetry, that would mean that if we were ever to get back into a higher inflation scenario and the need for higher interest rates one might argue that the correct path for Ml might be zero This thing works both ways   It would be relatively [more] comfortable than living within an M1 pattern for 1987 of between 2 percent and, say, 16 percent   Yes, it certainly does It seems to me that Frank wants to throw away too much During a period of accelerating inflation, from even very low levels, it seems to me it's the case that there is still a rather stable relationship There may be a stable relationship during periods of disinflation, but we may not be willing to admit to what that is That is, we may not be willing to admit to the negative velocity that would entail What I think we know is that when you shift from an inflating [unintelligible] economy to one of disinflation and outright deflation, then those relationships are unstable And I think that every such period in history would demonstrate that to be the case   Maybe we should call it a monitoring range   What kind of velocity would you have if you had a 5 percent nominal GNP and a 100 basis point decline in interest rates?   So that would mean an 8 percent--   I don't see how the crunch can occur, Jerry, without [interest rate] ceilings Deregulation shouldn't mean that you are going to price so that the quantity demanded--   Well, then they have negative margins, don't they?   That is always the case   If you want to focus strictly on Ml, you have got to give up interest rates   [Unintelligible]   It seems to me that there are several ways we could go here But one thing I feel is very important is for the market to understand that if inflation were to reemerge as a threat we would move quickly to a monetary aggregate targeting--we would make that our primary responsibility I don't know whether we have it out there--    12/15-16/86   It also has another feature and that is that it is somewhat more controllable in regard to altering its opportunity costs, I would presume Do your studies show that to be the case?   Ml is not going to go away We are not going to keep a chart out of The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times I presume we are going to continue to release weekly figures, four-week averages, so it's there I think too much attention has been given to  -30-    12/15-16/86  it I prefer that we keep it as a monitoring range I would prefer not to change it; to tinker with the numbers is like tinkering with M1A We are not going to tinker with the numbers and have them be large enough that we have a chance of being within them So, I would like to have a monitoring range, a historic range that we have been using, and simply indicate to the market that there may come a time when M1's velocity will return to this more historic relationship   But, of course, without a change in interest rates now for four months, where we normally have an interest elasticity problem, it seems we also may have an increase in demand for financial assets that may continue even in a period of stable interest rates   One thing we might do is, without any monitoring range, to suggest that the Federal Open Market Committee might reinstitute quarterly ranges at any time that it deemed appropriate That would give us the chance, in case circumstances changed whereby we believed that we had an inflationary tension that needed correcting, we could then institute a quarterly target without setting up an annual target   Even though I asked for a monitoring range, I am happy to join this consensus   What kind of depression?   I thought you said great deflation   It seems to me that we have no evidence that 1987 is going to be substantially different from 1986 I look at the 1986 M2 and M3 target bands and see that in January and February we were running a little below And if we want them as targets I presume that means that when they run low we ought to be easing; and hindsight, I think, would tell us that it would have been okay to have some accommodation in that [early 1986] period But we also found a period of time when we ran up to the 9 percent range Now, if we wanted to be at 8-1/2 percent--if the targets mean anything--we would have to say that we should have screwed it down a little tighter in July and August and September I am not sure that there is evidence of that [being desirable] I would prefer not to get into wishful thinking about bringing the M2 and M3 [ranges] down until we have evidence I might be persuaded at the February meeting that 8-1/2 percent and 5-1/2 percent are satisfactory, but hindsight might suggest that 9 percent may not have been too bad   But if you went back a year ago and asked the FOMC what its interest rate forecast was, some of what has happened may have been unexpected It may very well be that we do not know whether the economy, for sure, is going to be growing at a 4 percent real path--or 3 percent, or even 1-1/2 percent   Well, because I am not so sure that the economy will be growing at a 3 percent real path or a 6 percent nominal path    12/15-16/86  It may very well be that we will have been inaccurate or not have been able to foresee that We might be on a path that is conducive to lower interest rates; if so, would we want to have an M2 target that restrained us and caused us to tighten in an environment in which the economy was growing at a real path of, say, 1-1/2 percent and a nominal path of 4 percent?   My view is very similar to Mr Johnson's and many others around the table, and that is that the staff forecast seems to me the most likely event I would have a slightly lower CPI number But I must admit that I only overestimated the rate of inflation one time in the last seven years; so I put my CPI at 3 percent, hoping that I'll have another overestimate in here sometime   37 isn't it?   37 percent on the CPI, 27 percent on the fixed--   Yes   Basically, my view is that taking food and energy out in an attempt to get a baseline is just not a very accurate way to go, because when you take food and energy out then you have the services sector, which is such a large portion of what's left So I  feel uncomfortable with any inflation forecast that takes food and energy out because then we have what I call a measurement problem I think many of you see that measurement problem in the service sector, and I think that just keeps our baseline inflation rate a little too high So, I am a little more optimistic on inflation, but I certainly appreciate what I would call the staff's "within the range" forecast there My concern is that even though the fourth quarter seems to have some strength to it, it seems to me a very vulnerable strength;  we could end up the quarter in a rather fragile and vulnerable position I see that in terms of world imbalances We continue to have these huge saving rates in Japan and western Europe and we have other countries that are almost synonymous to farmers and oil people in the United States that have these huge debts There's nothing  really happening internationally, it seems to me, to cause that basic structural position to improve So we're kind of patching together an international problem which is of grave concern It seems to me that we have a fragile circumstance in the import sector I'm looking for import prices not to rise quite as fast as others because the Japanese automobile industry seems so attuned to doing what they need to do on the wage and price front in order to remain competitive, and I don't think we're going to see price increases there And it doesn't seem to me that we're going to have much chance to lower our imports with our staff's projected real GNP path  So, I think we do run some risks that the first and second quarters could cumulate to a lower level of output than we're forecasting And if that happens, I don't know what's going to turn it around If we get off to a weak start, I don't know what will lift us up because it seems to me that the pattern of consumer spending may worsen as fast as we get any export side improvement I think there will be export side improvement, but I think it's going to be very slow and it's going to come only to industries that are very attuned to keeping costs low Also, of course, if we end up with a lower growth than estimated, then we're not going to get quite as good a government budget outcome If we achieve 3 to 4 percent real GNP growth, government spending as a percent of GNP has a chance to take a noteworthy downturn I'm kind of uneasy but, like many of you, I  -49-    12/15-16/86  share the priority of maintaining stable prices, and I guess I'm willing to run a little risk here in order to achieve price level stability But I think we have to be aware of how vulnerable we may be and we have to be ready for some unexpected events It may not come out just like the forecast   And food prices could be even lower than that given the fact that the red meat industry has the highest profit margins it has had for many, many years and given the fact that we had weather that adversely affected poultry prices So we do have some possibilities for food being better and we have an underlying wage structure change in the service sector that's rather noticeable for next year compared to this year   It seems to me that if the price pattern is stronger we will then get more desire to hold inventories and the economy could turn out to be stronger than the staff estimates   Yes   It just seems to me, Ted, that we do have quite ample capacity at a lot of these manufacturers in basic industry areas worldwide The evidence seems to point to increased determination to be competitive by one means or another, whether it's by subsidy or some other event And I tend to feel that the world prices are continuing on a moderate plane But much of it would be--   But it might not be so bad for us to go back to 4 percent CPI and get a little stimulus in here and then have to go back when M1 starts behaving well and tighten up interest rates--run them up 150 basis points Maybe that's not too bad; I don't know    12/15-16/86   Four months   "B" and asymmetric If we use symmetric language, I prefer "would" and "somewhat" to "might" and "slightly"   I would like to be asymmetric because it seems to me that when the minutes are released they should be the best reflection we can provide at this time as to the general outlook And asymmetric is a better reflection of what I heard around the table than symmetric   "Viewed" makes a lot of sense   "Appraised" works pretty well   But on the other hand--   Yes   But I think what we've written here--   I only remember one person--   Because that would take the dollar quite a ways from the staff forecast and might have some implications   I would much prefer to say "slightly greater reserve restraint"   That's what I would do I think that most accurately reflects the discussion There was only one individual that I recall who said [the economy] might be stronger and yet it didn't appear that it would be strong enough to require some action There were quite a few who said it could be weaker   It would be nice to have the economy perform better than we expected That would be--   I move we approve it   Peter said he was playing it by his gut I understand that, but my reaction is that you didn't do too badly, Peter Given all the forces, it seems to me that you follow directions very well   It increases the demand for excess reserves   No, I think it's pretty bad I think my forecast for the CPI is 100 basis points higher than it was last year after I had been here 7 days So I got worse on that   Yes, relatively worse, right In a sense, I suppose my forecast, at 19 percent real GNP, is optimistic in that the non-US world output would seem to be hardly higher than 2 percent and it would seem appropriate that we would be a little less than the rest of the world So I guess I feel very comfortable that if we can do it that wouldn't be bad at all As I looked at the export side, I noted from St Louis' recent publication that US export prices over the last six years have risen a total of 11 percent, which would be less than 2 percent a year Our staff forecast has an 11 percent increase in export prices over the next two years In the world that I see, it is somewhat unlikely that that kind of increase in export prices would occur On the import side, I also noted in that same study that US imports as a percentage of GNP have been so constant; they just don't change very much So I just don't hold much hope for any reduction of imports by relative pricing That is, the price elasticities seem to be such that we are not going to make much gain there Frankly, I don't see that we are going to make quite as good a move on the trade side as even the staff forecast, and that's not very good  When I look at dangers, I suppose there are two kinds of dangers I tend to set aside the stagflation scenario; I don't see that as very likely On inflation, my estimate is only 1/2 of a percentage point different from the staff, and I don't see that to be very large But if we both missed, if there was higher growth and more inflation, I guess that would provide us a very decided monetary policy option which would be, I presume, higher US interest rates; and that would be good for the dollar If we had higher growth, it would be good for a lot of sectors of the domestic economy So I assume that if we missed in that direction we would have a response that would be appropriate both domestically and internationally The problem I see would be if we get too slow and the world gets too slow And if the US gets too slow, then I wonder what the policy response might be because that might put downward pressure on US interest rates I'd hate to see that happen with equity prices maybe going even higher than they are today, which might be an unsustainable path So that's the kind of worry that I have that we might get too slow [economic growth] and get declining interest rates This would put the dollar in a precarious position, and we might not have good policy options So, I guess I do worry some   Yes, and my inflation [forecast] was also too high last year   I prefer alternative II also It would seem to me that the accommodation of 1986 is not as apt to occur; so 8-1/2 percent, even under a declining velocity scenario, does give us an equal opportunity to snug up a bit But I do think, as we proceed with alternative II, that this year we should be aware of the fact that market forces are even more important That is, if long-term bond rates and intermediate bond rates were to rise, it seems to me that, given the problem with the dollar, we ought to be particularly sensitive to those interest rates--on the down side also I want alternative II with a proviso that interest rates ought not to be managed by the Fed much differently than the market forces would indicate   I think that's an excellent way of doing it It seems to me that in a reemergence of an inflationary environment in which interest rates were trending up the range should be as low as maybe 2 to 6 percent On the other hand, if deflationary forces were to pick up speed again and we had this demand for financial assets it might very well be that 8 to 13 percent would be right Whatever the case, I think it ought to be less than last year But I like the suggestion I think it would be appropriate for us to suggest that since we've had a period in which M1's growth has been very, very strong, we realize that there must be another period in which M1's growth path is indeed going to be below what we would ordinarily expect it to be   If M1 growth were to be low and deflationary forces were to pick up again and the dollar was not weak, that's another matter   But under some circumstances it might be way too high because if we come down the demand curve for money with interest rates falling, if interest rates were to rise it has to hold that our growth path would have to be much, much less than we normally would have thought   Yes Or, if we had not accommodated last year and the discount rate were still at 7-1/2 percent, it seems to me that we would have had a macroeconomic result of a lower real GNP growth path than we had and we still would have had dramatic declines in velocity   But I thought Tom Melzer was saying that 2 to 6 percent under certain circumstances might be the right range, but 7 to 13 percent under other circumstances might show restraint compared to what happened in 1986   Tom, doesn't that say more precisely that if we return to a period of inflation actually being there--and with the behavior in regard to preferences for financial assets waning--that we would then expect to come in with some rather conservative numbers?   That's right Zero would be appropriate   It also supports what President Morris has been saying, and I think he's right that we haven't seen all of the reshuffling that will take place under the deregulated environment that we're in But at some point in time, those savings accounts are going to get reshuffled with the transactions account to the extent that they're going to be And I think that--   Would you want that check list to be in there?   Yes, it seems to me that we do need to draft that [unintelligible] because we need to indicate what might occur in that check list that would bring back these M1 targets in a meaningful way The market has to expect that, if those things occur, we will act Of course, if the market believes this and those things start to occur, then we're going to have a market forced interest-rate response based upon that expectation, and we will have achieved our objective   Well, I think we should create that expectation   And I think a continued depreciation of the dollar should be included among those   And it avoids this problem of where we would start off the year if we used any M1 range Where we would start off the year when we're so far behind in the cone? We'd have that problem to look at   What we'd be saying, I presume, is that at a future FOMC meeting we might announce a short-term target range for M1 It might be the case that that would even be announced prior to the next FOMC meeting, in some circumstances   But the language should be changed The language should be changed to say that and [to indicate] the circumstances under which M1 will be established rather than that we're not establishing it   But under those circumstances M1 is going to slow down later Bond buyers are not going to be very pleased by that circumstance and rush into long bonds until they think the recession is tightly--   I always wished that the bond buyers would behave that way, Manley, but I never found that they did Once interest rates start up on the short end bond buyers get scared that it's going to continue So it takes a while before that response--   It might be better to say January to March than it would to say November to March   Well, it seems to be that there's a lot that we don't know I hate to look that far ahead It seems to me that we're going to know more about what we would want it to be in June when we get to March than we do now   We can call it January to April, which would be under the control of this--   I hate to get us in the position of having to back off or of having to change that What we were saying previously would indicate that conditions might be such that what we say now would need some adjustments So, I'd rather not stretch the time period out and then have to alter it In the past we've found that once we set it and then needed to alter it that that created expectations--   I know   That's good   Sounds like alternative C   There is a scenario that could develop in the next month that I would feel exactly like you do, Tom, but I would hate to think about releasing the minutes six weeks from now with that scenario in there after it didn't develop I would rather have alternative B, as Manley specified, but with an understanding that our symmetric language would cause us--   --asymmetric language, which would give us a little flexibility over the six weeks if that were to turn out to be the real scenario   That's right The $300 million is what we aim for and I would not expect the funds rate to go below 6 percent with that, given the preference for excess reserves and given--   Gary Stern is saying that he would like us to take action to stop it from occurring in the face of weak business news   Mr Chairman, it looks to me like maybe we need a vote   That's narrow   6 to 7 percent?   Or January to March   I think that makes the best choice   Don, are you expecting February to come in as high as you have here now?   Yes, but that seasonal problem doesn't affect the three-month growth rate that much, does it, Mike?   There's a high standard deviation, you mean   "Should" is stronger than "expected" I think "expected" is a little better   I thought "substantially" went with "chiefly" but--   The nuances   That's what we just did   Ever done what?   Well, let's suppose oil prices broke down; let's suppose Germany announced that they were going to grow at zero You could--   That's plenty   Did the markets ever pick up broadly our intervention before?   But another low-key move like that, if it worked as well, together with heavy Japanese and German [intervention] wouldn't be too bad an environment   But isn't there a case that could be made that, for the foreseeable future, that is about as high as the yen ought to go?   Whether you would want it that high--   How about 150 to 160   But is a Japanese discount rate cut likely?   Well, that certainly would make a difference regarding the spread between capital flows, I think   I know, but it will make a difference in regard to capital flows   On page 2 is the word excessive--?   I think it very well reflects what we suggested On page 2, I wonder if the word "excessive" in front of weakness of the dollar is a little strong Would it be better to leave the word out or maybe use the word "continuing" I wouldn't want to indicate to the markets that it really has to be pretty bad before anything happens   Yes, that would be better, I think   Well, it seems to me, since that is an "and" list, that you could take "excessive" out and just say "weakness in the dollar" If all those other three--   I think it is better as it is with the "and"   But "and" answers that question   No, I think it is okay I think you just have that clause there in front of the--   Do you want "accompanied by increased price pressures" or "signs of"?   Yes, it seems to me that there could be some circumstance in which the dollar, given strong economic growth-- Frankly, I just don't quite see how the inflation is going to come about unless we get a further [decline in the dollar] It seems to me that the whole inflation scenario is dependent upon the dollar's position   The fact of the matter is that if economic expansion slows to a negative rate, it does limit you somewhat   But with the "and" there, can't we take the "excessive" out before the "weakness of the dollar"?   [Unintelligible] sounds like a bit of weakness doesn't bother us If it doesn't, it's okay   I like that   Would it be appropriate to have continuing sizable increases in M1 with the continuing weakness in the dollar?   I know I would just like to have it be--   That is right   Now we are on page 2?   I like that   That's pretty wide But that is all right   Yes, I like that better than not having it in there at all   I am afraid that is what it is    2/10-11/87   Good   But what would we do if were disturbed?   Is anyone suggesting that that is what we should have done during 1986?   But any time a preference for financial assets explodes like it has during this deflation, as well as every deflation in our history, you can't have financial assets expanding without debt expanding   I understand the monetary aggregates and I understand the validity of monitoring But once those explode, the other side is going to explode too The other side's problem is based upon the quality or the ability to pay It is a microeconomic judgment, company by company   But, Jerry, it almost seems to me as if we are saying we've got a danger out here, so what should we do? Well, we should tighten We are afraid people can't pay, and if we tighten then we guarantee they can't pay   I don't know what handle we have There isn't any margin requirement handle that would work I don't know where we would begin   Well, our tax law changes help because in the past it paid to not pay dividends, and to pay it out in the form of leveraging out and--   It should be less I think the tax law will reduce debt growth   And people who have learned to benefit from the other one will continue to behave that way as long as an economic incentive is there   Second   I move it   While we are making increases, why would we not want to allow more room than that? What reason is there to keep the limits that close?   Yes   Yes   There does seem to be a growing consensus about the world economy, so I don't think I need to elaborate much more on low world economic growth rates That's certainly not good news, as all of us know, in regard to the LDC's debt and to many other things that are very important to us Unfortunately, in the news on the US economy it is hard to see any bright spots, because if we do get any rebound--and if it is rather significant--in view of the world economy that may very well overwhelm the exchange rate effects So we would end up having a bad world even if we meet US growth projections So that is somewhat of a negative  I tend to be sympathetic with the staff's view on the inflation rate because I think a global perspective is very, very significant I noted here today that I haven't yet heard a president of a Reserve Bank who has come in with an inflation rate that is lower than staff's I hear a lot that are higher I am about up to the staff's level now on inflation because there has been a development in  -27-    3/31/87  regard to the spring storms that might have an adverse effect on food prices That is, this blizzard in the Midwest occurred at a rather unfortunate time with regard to calving and there is a lot of livestock damage--anecdotal at this point We don't know what the numbers are but the situation could be somewhat severe I guess there is some benefit in that we have moved a lot of that cow/calf operation to Florida and that works pretty well for reasons I have not quite understood You feed cattle, or start them off, on a very poor grass diet--I am not trying to draw aspersions to Florida--but then you transfer them to the good blue foothills grass and you get marvelous kinds of changes So we don't have as much of the cattle exposed as we did before, but that undoubtedly would have an adverse impact  I would second what has been mentioned about agriculture We are now beginning to see farmers who are having prosperity and ranchers who are having prosperity come forward For quite a while farmers who were making any money tended to be very quiet about it in this kind of environment, but they're beginning to come forward It does appear that most of the land purchases are being made by farmers, not by out-of-farming interests It may very well be that our agricultural banks are going to get through this year to a period where in 1988 we may have some better news I wish we could say the same thing about banks with LDC debt   It seems to me that no change, or alternative B, is the right place to start because we have so much uncertainty in regard to the direction our economy is going We just don't have the facts out there that tell us exactly which move we ought to make And the last thing we ought to do is to make a move in one direction and have it turn out to be the wrong move I think we need stability when we don't seem to get too much stability from other Executive branches of this government We need to stabilize here; we need not do something dramatic The only certain thing I can see is the dollar's downward momentum; it just doesn't seem to me that that's apt to turn around At some point in time, we're going to have to be willing to give that high priority or top priority In fact, at some point in time, we're probably going to have to be willing to make it the dominant priority in order to change this momentum that exists I do believe it would be very important for us to get West Germany and Japan and other G-10 countries also to recognize that this is a critical juncture and that at some point here we are going to have to  -34-    3/31/87  be willing to [unintelligible] monetary policy It would be most important that we have them prepared to make steps at the same time we might make a step So, we really ought to be sure that any upward pressure on interest rates in the United States in this environment calls for downward pressure on rates abroad I think the world economy dictates that It seems to me that the transition for us ought to be to look at the monetary aggregates I don't think we ought to announce anything different about the monetary aggregates now, but I do think we ought to look carefully at the M2 and M1 growth paths If they are within this 3 to 7 percent range and conditions remain as they are and the dollar continues to move downward for some time, that might be acceptable But at some point--   Well, there's no number like that in the Bluebook but it seems to me that a 3 to 7 range gives the path for the dollar--   I just made that up, right Given the path of the dollar, we want monetary restraint more than we otherwise would have wanted; but we don't want to have an abrupt movement there, and we want to negotiate with our--   Well, M2 and M1   That is in this current environment of dollar weakness   We can reduce the supply of reserves enough to get the dollar to be stabilized but we don't know what rate of interest that might entail   It may become so destabilizing that the international situation may come to the front no matter what we do It just seems to me that we must be prepared for rather decisive actions at some point; we may have to draw the line and say it, because once markets become destabilized--   But, Bob, the time--   But does the behavior of the aggregates at this point imply the ranges we've already announced? I don't think we--   At this point in time, that's the best alternative   But since the world economy would not be adversely affected by some increase in US interest rates if we had an offsetting decline in rates [abroad]--   Maybe this is the time to think about publishing our minutes   No, it wasn't a motion I don't think there are enough votes to make a motion   That might be appropriate at some point in time   Yes, we might say $300 to $500 million, consistent with a federal funds rate and--   We don't have any guarantee at this point that these negative velocities will not return That's why I want to go slowly   Right Economic conditions could make what I think is now [unintelligible] at the lower end of the range--to be at 5-1/2 percent--seem wonderful If the economy were to deteriorate--   It's pretty slow final demand isn't it? Isn't US final demand almost zero, fourth quarter to fourth quarter?   Right   07?   But you have state and local, which is a little higher than that   Adding them in would make what?  -44-    3/31/87   That's not a very--   That's right That's exactly what we'd like to have happen   I think "somewhat" is a little more decisive in this environment   Yes, but you need "somewhat" for reserve restraint   3 to 7 percent   But whether we want the upper or lower would depend upon developing conditions and portfolio preferences and the dollar   But the trouble with--   Bob, the problem is that if we don't specify someone might assume that growth of M2 and M3 below the present target path would be unacceptable Right now we have a target path that we have announced What I am suggesting is that in light of the conditions in the international foreign exchange markets we need a lower band That would give us some options between--   But I would suggest that if the dollar were to be under increasing downward pressure, long bond rates would move up on us anyway We would have the worst of all worlds   We have to show that we have control over what's happening--that we are not sitting here without acting when action is needed   I thought there was some feeling that the dollar should move up to the--   But how do we deal with the growth of M2 and M3? Suppose M2 and M3 continue on the 4 percent path and then go below the--   It just means that we are rebasing   But they are not precise   But it's not really tightening It just indicates that we may be going to tighten It sets the parameters out for tightening   Then there is a substantial difference of opinion here, because in the environment of a weakening dollar and the commodity price effects that are associated with such a weakening dollar, I really do not want to go above, say, 7 percent I really would want to tighten in that environment So I think there is some policy difference that's cropping up  -50-    3/31/87   The only reason I don't want reserve restraint right now is because it seems to me that we've got a very low money growth path right now I don't know whether that's going to continue or not, but in light of a very low growth path to put restraint on right now runs a risk I am not willing to take But if this growth path proceeds along the bottom edge of our target--   Assuming that the dollar continues on its present path and assuming that the growth rate of M2 were to return to a 9 percent rate or an 8-1/2 percent rate, would you want any restraint?   I believe that a continuation of M2 along a 5 percent path would be consistent with the dollar stabilizing   We all agree but that's--   There is some advantage in having us know what would precipitate a conference call   That's why we moved the aggregates down--so that would be less of a problem   It sure does I am trying to understand why it was I used to enjoy Manley's persistence when he was on my side   There does seem to be a bit of a policy difference here   If it's 9 percent, I think we better get excited   And the long bond would go to 8-1/4 percent   I am, too   I would hate it because they are coming in at 3 percent and I don't want to ease when they are coming in at 3 percent Aren't they coming in at 3 percent?   We can say somewhat less I think Bob Heller doesn't want to say somewhat; he would rather say 4 to 7 percent than somewhat less   The Chairman has given three alternatives   That's the Chairman's prerogative   6 percent or less is all right with me    3/31/87   Mr Chairman, you get to vote if you like It's 6 to 6   And the word "approach" is better   Second   Non-oil import prices were up over 10 percent in the first quarter   I am very much of the view that inflation is a real problem for us at this point in time If we wait until the GNP deflator and the CPI show a problem, we will have waited much longer than I think historical evidence would suggest we should wait I recognize that a lot of the commodity price movements look like they are extra-sensitized to circumstances, but it's this sensitivity, surrounded with the attitudes concerning the dollar and commodities that are linked hand in hand, that is so worrisome I have watched many times when a drought was actually underway and wondered why commodity prices didn't move; now commodity prices move based upon the forecast of a drought I think that is an indication of how sensitized the players are to expectations Some of you seem to believe that those people who are participants in the market--whether it be Wall Street or New York or Chicago--somehow or other may just have their own self interest at hand and that that's not a true test I would be much more inclined to look at those who are putting money down than I would those who are making forecasts that are not backed by money, because it is really the shift in preference between holding financial assets and real assets that is involved We have a phenomenon that is emerging that is significant, and it seems to me it will continue until there is marketplace realization that the Federal Reserve plans to follow a scarcity path for the monetary aggregates that will slow down So I am somewhat of the opinion that we had some gains out of this because, certainly, it does give real sector stimulus any time you have commodity prices move upward Our economy I thought was weak enough going into 1987 so that a little stimulus wasn't a bad thing But it seems to me that we now have to face the test as to whether or not we really mean price level stability I think that the Greenbook puts it very well that if we choose not to do that, then that's consistent with a continuing decline in the exchange rate of the dollar Over time, I think that will not give us any better improvement in our nominal trade balance than we would get if we dealt with it, because we will just incorporate a rate of inflation into the US economy that I think matches this falling  -22-    5/19/87  value of the dollar So, I am of the opinion that we have given this plenty of opportunity to see that it's a real phenomenon   I am very sympathetic to the point made by Ed Boehne, and seconded by Tom Melzer, that there would be more clout from a discount rate change if it were to occur prior to moving to, or confirming, a $600 million borrowing level I think it would have more impact But since the Governors of the Board will be the ones voting on that, I belong in camp "C"   Well, it seems to me that a $400 million borrowing assumption should go with the discount rate move to give you "C" And then if conditions changed, that would call in the rest of our directive as to the room we would have later   Well, Mr Chairman, you haven't voted yet   Yes, let's do that Put inflation in front of the dollar Let's go with variant I, but put inflation in front of the foreign exchange   Yes   No Let's leave it out   With inflationary pressures highlighted, I think the credit market conditions might be reflected by that same phrase If it is, we don't need--   Well, I think we ought to leave it out   I still like 3 to 7 percent   Well, because M2 does run a little low; on M3--   I don't think that--   It looks to me like you are apt to get double- digit rates for the quarter What do you think, Don?   Say below its pace in the first quarter It was 13 percent in the first quarter I think it is safe to say it will be below 13 percent   The first-quarter average over the fourth- quarter average   I can give you the December 31 to March 30 With the hump taken out, it was 5-1/2 percent But with the hump on it was--   That's all right You may have to ease policy a little to achieve that, but that would probably be very appropriate   Yes, that would be fine That would be appropriate restraint   Saying "expected" is--   The problem is it is more influenceable than M2 and M3--that is, if you really want--   You're taking the second-quarter average compared to the first   Yes, but April comes back off It is not measuring April It is point to point   Just leave it the same as we had the last time   If you want to be vague, that does it   I think it should say "increased somewhat" Because from the last policy directive--   Assuming that there is no great tidal wave here to release the minutes earlier than the next meeting, it would seem to me that what should be in the record is increased reserve restraint   It is increased reserve restraint relative to the position   Well, it seems to me that we have already decided what we want the policy to be What we now are doing is discussing what we want the minutes to say when they are released in six weeks It seems to me that the minutes should say that we have somewhat increased reserve restraint   Well, let's use the word "sought"   No I thought the Chairman said 4 to 8 percent   I don't think we need to mention the discount rate   Well, I thought that was assumed by everyone  -38-    5/19/87   I'm against it I prefer not--   So, you have more votes to have it in   We are not going to hear of any huge [unintelligible] gains of a type that we are unable to offset   On the way   I like that It gives us a little more option than a discount rate change   I think that is what we want to avoid   What happens if we decide to do the discount rate cut earlier?   I mean increase Wouldn't it also be possible to do a discount rate increase and go back to $400 million?   Are you suggesting that if we were to move on the discount rate today or tomorrow that going to a $400 million borrowing assumption would be--   Well, that's what I--   Yes, I understand   No it won't You're going to have all the expectational effects that go with a discount rate move and the federal funds rate is going to tend to move   Yes That would mean more tightening   It depends on what the expectations are about the discount rate   I don't want to see us get to interest rate targeting and I would favor--   I would favor the pegging of the nonborrowed, adjustment borrowings But I would like to see us agree that we could sell coupons so that if we ever get into a situation like this again, we would thereby have enough coupons so as to let the markets know what our target was If we have bought the coupons--  -44-    5/19/87   I want to be able to buy bonds when there are not enough bills out there for repos   No   You can decrease the uncertainty as to what the borrowing target is What we've ended up with--   We've ended up with a lot of participants and market watchers believing that our borrowing target is $500 to $600 million It seems to me that it would be better to conduct policy in such a way that there would not be as much uncertainty as to what--  -45-    5/19/87   We have not   But the problem is--   The problem is that if you take seasonal borrowing out, it is no longer under control the same way that open market operations are You have to ask yourself Are seasonal borrowings more like adjustment borrowings or more like open market supply credit? And I think it's--   The answer, it would seem to me, is that it's more like adjustment borrowing than it is like open market operations   In other words, you'd like to have the seasonal borrowing have a seasonal influence; thereby, if we had a $500 million seasonal target, then it might be adjusted seasonally to be $540 million or $470 million?  -10-    7/7/87   That would tend to give you--   I think it would be better to leave it in and put a seasonal factor on it than it would be to take it out and treat it like extended credit   No, I don't feel compelled   No, I thought you were stopping the process Right now I understand you want to eat lunch   It seems to me that there's more assuredness, as I read it, in the 1988 numbers than I quite feel I'm somewhat more optimistic in regard to the rate of wage pattern change than the staff forecast But I hasten to add that I believe that if you wait until you do get the wage inflation change that accompanies the staff forecast then it's too late not to have a price impact from that So I have a very strong resistance to creating an environment in which those wage patterns might develop as the staff and some of the rest of you seem to be indicating It seems to me, if you look at the wage patterns over the entire decade of the 1980s, that you do see a rather slow, gradual, moderation of wage patterns And when you look at the kinds of interest rates and unemployment rates that have existed, it seems to me that it takes more of a movement of the actual unemployment rate compared to the assumed natural rate to jar wage patterns out of the existing mold So I would expect there to be somewhat more delay; consequently, it seems to me that there is some window of opportunity to bring price pressures more in line before a  -28-    7/7/87  wage adjustment takes place But I am grateful to the staff for continuing to indicate to me the danger of this because I don't want it to happen   Right   I would favor leaving the target for 1987 the way it is It seems to me that it's better to perceive the targets as    7/7/87  being what you are trying for and subsequently, if reasons cause you to miss, to miss I would rather explain the miss than have new targets Having a new target almost gives you the notion that it is more important And if you choose that new target of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, it is entirely possible that conditions would be such that 7-1/2 percent would be too fast a growth path So I think it would be confusing, non-helpful, and unnecessary   No, I would not at this point, unless developments in the economy gave us a clearer signal than we now have I would not try for the 7-1/2 percent [second-half] growth path it would take to get there   I would not try   I would consider it the best target we knew how to come up with in February of 1987 To try to adjust the target [unintelligible] the targets in my view It was the best indication at that time of what we should have And I think we've learned with M1 that there are conditions under which one better not try to alter--   That is correct   Well, I would prefer that we would have something in our language As you may remember, in March we chose the words 6 percent or less [for the March through June period] We can have a short-run range as an appropriate signal in the market that does not necessarily have to move growth back within the long-run target range   Finally, I would say if we choose to change the target, why 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent? It would seem to me at this point that that might be a higher path than we would want to use I am not positive but perhaps a 3-1/2 percent growth path in M2 should be tolerated under certain conditions So, I don't want to change it If we changed it now to 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent then I would feel more--   That is right   No, alternative II is 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent   I'd vote with Governor Johnson and President Forrestal for the 5 to 8 percent because it does send a signal And it does give us a chance in January or February, when we reconsider this, to come back to the lower number I would be very happy if conditions were such next winter that we would want to go ahead and take the range down another half point But I would hate to take it down a full point now and have to bring it back a half point next winter   Bob, you see, I just want to leave room for selecting the range next January I don't want to do it now Why not make the gesture that we have always made, which is a half percent again? And then we have room to go further in January The last thing I want to do is to go [down] too far and then end up having to back up I might be ready to take the 4 to 7 percent, closer to alternative III, next January   I don't want to build in a possibility of an easing signal that is inappropriate because we got the number too low now   Make it 4 to 8 percent, Jerry, did you say?   If you took one of these--the 1987 or 1988 ranges--and you changed one, which one would you prefer to have lower?   But let's suppose there is one chance in five that the economy in the third quarter and the fourth quarter will be lower than our estimate Now, I don't think that's what is going to happen But I don't feel certain enough that I am willing to make a big stand over a 1988 target range at this point, have the economy come in weak, and then have to reverse That is, with 6-1/2 percent nominal, one can have very modest inflation--less than 4 percent; that's very plausible   Paul, I very strongly share your view on what, in my view, is the most important issue and that is whether or not we are ready to have the dollar sustained   Because it seems to me that we will quite likely have another period in which the testing of that will occur But I would prefer not to have to test the dollar declining in an economy that is particularly weak It seems to me that if we have an economy that is particularly weak and then we have a declining dollar, that is indeed the worst of all worlds And so, I feel strongly and sympathize with you in regards to the dollar But I want to be ready with ammunition to do the job when that needs to be done I am not sure whether this is that significant an issue--  -44-    7/7/87   I don't want us to lower the ranges for this year and then say we mean it Because then we get into a situation that requires another move   No, I said this year   Of course   I would say that the price level pressures became such that it was appropriate for us to undertake policies that resulted in coming in under the range because of our high priority on price level stability   "Tolerate" is a good word   It just seems to me that commodity prices and the dollar this year might once again be a problem And in that circumstance, that 3 percent might be a better growth path for M2 than any number that we are willing to put out there I would prefer to send a signal that we have decided to come down in a systematic manner--we want to come down a half a point per year I would fit  -46-    7/7/87  that in with what Tom Melzer had to say that that is gradualism regarding the long run In the short run, the short-run variations in velocity may cause us to tolerate growth occasionally below the rates in the ranges   We found with M1, with the interest rate sensitivity of its velocity, that under non-normal conditions we were not able to forecast what its target path would be and we had to end up abandoning it It seems to me that we don't want to force ourselves into this preciseness for M2 that might later cause us to say Well, we just can't hit it at all   Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that explaining this is an opportunity for us to say something about the    7/7/87  recent actions that we took in order to provide for more price level stability The dollar was under pressure and that resulted in market forces taking interest rates higher than they otherwise would have been And that increased the probability that we might undershoot the lower boundary somewhat   That is what I was seeking the way we can explain it the best   That's not too bad It doesn't make the monetarists angry It doesn't make anybody angry   I don't know I would rather have a word slightly less emphatic than "substantially"; I'd rather leave "substantially" out Is that page 16?   "Around" is a good word   I would prefer 4 to 8 percent over 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent It seems to me it gives you more flexibility which [unintelligible] And then if we wanted to become more precise in January, as long as we didn't change the top of it, and I don't think we will--that is, we may want to increase that bottom range some--I don't think it would be that damaging   But we might have a condition next year, like this year, in which we might need fuller--   Let's ask the question to you How do you feel about it? Do you feel that 4 to 8 percent helps you much?   No, I agree with that   Or we could say 5 to 8 percent and the Committee is going to look at it again in February in terms of possibly lowering it again We want to send signals   I agree I don't know what to fight about now   Let's not reverse it I don't want to send any other subtle signals   That seems to me to be somewhat expansive but that's-- I can imagine circumstances in which 5 to 7-1/2 might be--   Yes   That's fine   How about that [wording within the] brackets?   I'd rather put a period after "appropriate"   Yes   So you want to take the whole sentence out?   I don't either   That's better   Or inflationary expectations   No, but-- Well, I think we might   I think there might be some circumstance in which we would want to bring it back   That's better, yes   Apparently, we could put M1 back in tentatively   Tentatively   But I think we might have some language--   I just wonder what, tentatively, we might think about Although we may not want to put it in, what would we have in mind? If at this stage you had to suggest M1 ranges for 1988 what would you suggest, Don?   So, you'd want a range at least 3 percentage points wide?   Or more?   So, you think 3 to 8 percent would be--  SPEAKER(?) 3 to 15!   3 to 9?   I know, but I just want to have some notion in case we're going to discuss this seriously in January I want to have some notion about how well we might do between now and then as to whether or not we will be able to redo it Otherwise, I don't want to say we're going to discuss it seriously You think it would take 3 to 9 percent?   Then it would be--  -62-    7/7/87   Yes, but it just doesn't--   I'm just suggesting that sometime we will run out of ability to continue to say that   You know, ironically, we took away M1 the year that we would have hit the target range if we had set one   But we want to continue to ratchet a longer period of time--   Just vote no   In other words, just like last time   I guess the question is Why not ask for enough? If $10 billion might not do it, why not ask for $12 billion?   My question is Is there any real danger of erring on the side of having too much leeway to be able to manage the account the way we want to manage it?   And I guess the answer is yes [Laughter]   Do you want to formally recommend?   In many ways, Manley, you've made my speech, because I think what I hear you saying is that there is more uncertainty than some of the comments might indicate It does seem to me that it's appropriate for us to assume that inflationary pressures need to be dealt with, and that it's appropriate for us to have a monetary aggregate growth path such as we have been having To me, a 4 percent M1, M2, and M3 path is, in itself, a rather significant antidote for these inflationary pressures that exist Even though those inflationary pressures are there, and we are far from having turned the corner in abating these price increases, there might be some possibility that we will be successful if we are willing to maintain a monetary aggregates growth path such as we have And there's something that I notice when I get out in the country and I talk to farmers and people in the oil business and realtors there is a sense of unease that's in our country that really goes against what you were suggesting, Si, in regard to farm income It is true that 1986 was a record year for net cash farm income; and 1987 is going to be another record above that record But what I notice is that there is a conservatism, or even a super conservatism, that exists Those  -16-    8/18/87  people who are the survivors, and those businesses that are successful, are the ones that kept their borrowing down I notice no rush to borrow; I notice no stories from the entrepreneur types about how it makes sense to borrow money to do this or to do that I notice instead that the fast-food business is not quite what it was, and that owning houses doesn't seem to be quite the way to profit And I notice some unease and a scare out there that moderates behavior  So, it might be that this growth path of the monetary aggregates could bring a stop to the commodity price rises that we've seen during the last year, beginning last August And if these commodity price rises do abate and the inflation expectation goes away, there is some possibility that deflationary forces could once again return I think what we need to do at this point is to be open to look at the various possibilities and to see if we can do the trick of getting commodity price rises stopped in sufficient time before they feed back into the wage/price cycle If that can be accomplished, then it seems to me that a 41 percent GNP deflator and a 45 percent increase in the fixed-weight index for 1988 is totally unacceptable We just must not let that occur But having said that, let's not get ourselves too ready for an overkill   Sometimes he's hard to influence   It seems to me that we need to remind ourselves that these minutes will be published six weeks from now, around the time of the next meeting It just seems to me that we ought to be somewhat careful about making asymmetric statements when there is this much uncertainty I think the real question is what do we do, not the question of symmetric or asymmetric I would prefer a symmetric "B" Now, that puts me at the far end of those who have been speaking so far I do believe that the monetary aggregate growth paths are quite different from those we had in the period that led to the price pressures we are now seeing; and I think it is a mistake for us to react with the monetary aggregates behaving in this nice 2 to 4 percent growth range, which might very well be the right path for the long run Yet, as you anticipated, Mr Chairman, and I would agree with you, we do have this change in velocity It would be a mistake for us, then, to go to $600 million on borrowing, because $600 million will certainly be a vote for a lower monetary growth path The members of the Committee know that I have not favored returning the monetary growth paths back to within our target ranges for the year; I have favored coming in below the ranges But, just as a year ago, we were undoubtedly somewhat careless in not recognizing the 15 percent  -27-    8/18/87  monetary growth path when we made that discount rate change last August, I think it could be just as much a mistake for us to move now before we see the need I am prepared to make adjustments as might be needed if commodity prices and the exchange value of the dollar were to move in such a direction as to make inflation and our worst fears realized I would want to move at that point, but I am not willing to take a hard position now for minutes to be published six weeks from now based upon our feelings   The people who don't vote don't have to be responsible   I wasn't quite certain what the vote was in regard to the dollar's position I would be among those who would like to leave the dollar as being an important indicator, somewhat more prominent But I may be out-voted, I'm not sure   I would really favor making that broader and going 3 to 6 percent It seems to me that you could have a circumstance in which the aggregates were growing at 3 percent and, for other reasons, you still might want to tighten  -33-    8/18/87   I guess I'd want to hear Don Kohn's comments on that   How about going to 4 to 6 percent then? It just seems to me that 5 to 6 percent is so narrow   You're going to leave it at 5 to 7-1/2 percent?   If we're changing the top one, why is there any harm in changing the bottom one?   About 5 percent would be fine   4 to 8 percent   --the federal funds rate I think it would be the wrong signal, in light of the 1976 experience   I thought there were seven votes for five hundred; that was the way I counted   I don't think anybody will know it's $525 million; you don't tell anybody   We already have that in the tilt of the directive, anyway That is, you can go firmer, based upon developments, without calling a Committee--   I think that would be appropriate Change that   In regard to long bond rates, I think what we are seeing has something to do with the development of an exchange rate policy that no one thought out that carefully ahead of time It's unfortunate that there can't be some median ground between recognizing that monetary policy needs to be adjusted to take into consideration foreign exchange developments and trying to pinpoint and draw lines in the sand in regard to foreign exchange rates If we had been willing to make monetary policy adjustments before we drew the lines in the sand, we probably would have avoided some of the difficulties we are now in Nevertheless, the line got drawn in the sand And when that happens, it is very difficult to unhitch during a period in which inflation expectations are on the increase-- particularly, I think, when you have some commodity price pressures that would require stable exchange rates in order not to have commodity prices rise So, in that environment, it seems to me that  -25-    9/22/87  long bond buyers are mainly anticipating what monetary policy and future short-term rates are going to be, and it's kind of a win-win situation from their perspective, because they think that we might have to raise rates to support [the dollar in] foreign exchange markets or we might have to raise rates to resist inflation; and either one works in the same way Second, I think the long bond prices are affected today more strongly than they were ten years ago by a kind of speculative cycle That is, at one point in time, long bond buyers really intended to keep the bonds But we have developed an environment in which we have investors and fund managers whose success is based upon their performance; and there are times when it doesn't pay to be owners of bonds and, consequently, you're going to have long bond rates move a little too far In some ways, it doesn't bother me to see long-term interest rates high I think it would bother the US Congress I hope it would bother them, and I hope it would indicate to them how much opportunity there is to help there by controlling spending  In regard to the Greenbook forecast, I really have no significant disagreement over the 1987 forecast The staff has been lowering their inflation rates for the second half of 1987, so I don't see much disagreement there I do have three areas of difference in regard to the 1988 forecast I disagree, I guess, with Martha and some others who took one position with regard to real exports I'm taking another position I believe real exports will maintain a longer sustained growth path than is assumed in the forecast I believe that we have many producers in the United States who have never learned to be involved in international markets But once the United States became such a huge importer, we began to change the whole nature of the opportunities that exist So, we have many, many small and medium-size businesses that have never taken that international market seriously, and now they are learning that they do have to compete in international marketplaces at home and abroad And so I think we have a long learning curve involved here We have a lot of financial institutions that have not done very well with regard to recognizing export lending But I think that learning curve also will occur Therefore, I expect that these present exchange rates will give us a wonderful opportunity for a long period of export increases  As for my second disagreement with the 1988 forecast--and I know that Mike, or maybe Ted, mentioned the GNP deflator and its strange behavior--I would point out the staff's numbers on the CPI In July, the staff had forecast a 60 basis point increase in the CPI from the third quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988 Now they are projecting a 150 basis points increase in the CPI Now, that really is making things get worse rather rapidly I think that's not likely, first of all, because businesses have found that the environment is one in which you do not make profits by being able to increase your prices but you do it by learning to control costs So, I think we are in a different environment than we were Second, we have already gone through the big oil price increase, which the staff is telling us should have occurred earlier About the second half of 1987 is when it should hit us, and I think that has kind of passed us Third, I think foreign exchange rates are not likely to fall by the amount [indicated in the forecast], because I would presume that the majority of this Committee would not believe that the inflation forecast that we have is acceptable and they would be willing to take the steps that are necessary to not have those inflation rates  -26-    9/22/87  materialize Consequently, the dollar should behave quite well in that environment  The third disagreement [with the forecast] is in regard to tax receipts I think everyone is underestimating the effects of the Tax Reform Act, which is our first tax reform act since 1963 It is the first time we have broadened the base while decreasing the rates All the evidence shows that the tax receipts are coming in higher than anticipated We are going to have tax receipts that are going to be the largest percent of GNP in any peace-time year in our history Not all that goes away with the one-time capital gains move, so I am somewhat optimistic in that regard I am certainly willing to take whatever steps are necessary to make certain that the forecast for 1988 isn't correct because, if it is, then it is absolutely essential that we have policies that would lead to a tremendous slowdown in this economy   I am with the Chairman   I like "around" 4 and 6--   I know, but, Don, you have a different number for M3 than you do for M2, don't you?   See, really, around 4, and around 6   But you're actually anticipating 4-1/2 percent and you're anticipating 6 percent   I still think you could miss quite easily with a between 4 and 6   I just asked him--   But quite often we really attempt to kind of keep it centered, don't we? We don't like--   But, I do think it is somewhat important that we follow that suggestion of easing in to the $600 million so as not to cause the markets to believe that we have made a policy change at this meeting   Yes   Yes, we have watched him before, and he just knows how to do that   [Should we retain] the $600 million [borrowing assumption] for the two-week period until the next FOMC meeting, or would we want some leeway here for a somewhat lower possibility, given the day-to-day watch?   But I presume that there's at least an acceptance by the members of the Committee that the $600 million on borrowings is not necessarily in place in the coming two weeks as well as in the reserve maintenance period now ending   If we were to go back to 1983 and 1984 and have people look at it in terms of where the dollar should have been at    11/3/87  that point in time, the dollar didn't stay within what anyone would suggest was a workable US balance-of-trade level When the market could go to the extreme on the upside and run the dollar up to 161 on our index--when any careful analysis would say that that didn't make any sense--why do you have such confidence that somehow or other on the downside true market forces will prevail in the midst of political whims and a political climate that could be devastating? A truly floating exchange rate environment is really quite different than an environment in which you have political posturing and then it appears that [the floating exchange rate environment] is gone It seems to me that there is extreme danger that at some point in time the dollar could become a serious problem Given the Treasury's policy, I think we have only one choice we have to make domestic price level stability our primary objective and, if the world believes that, then I think the dollar will be okay   Of course   But instability breeds instability, and that's something we have to be very careful of   Being in such a position, with our fiscal deficit and our balance of trade deficit, as a net debtor nation, I don't understand how we think we ought to blame all these problems on someone else To me, that's naive We have to run policy in a manner that is consistent and sound And what's appropriate for our domestic economy can very well be appropriate for the others, if we consider price level stability important    11/3/87   It seems to me that the economy was headed for a box in a corner and it wasn't going to work the way it was [earlier] We had really slow money stock growth for a nine-month period But we had something else going on that it seems to me has been missed somewhat--that is, the dramatic improvement in labor productivity Now, I know you wouldn't expect me to mention the manufacturing sector of the US economy, but it is much larger than agriculture Manufacturing is 24 percent of our economy and we have a 4-1/2 percent growth rate in labor productivity in that sector And that improvement is running faster than any edging up of wage rates, so we have unit labor costs falling in a dramatic way while the dollar exchange rate is adjusting That leads, of course, to what I think we expected to have happen--dramatic increases in real exports 179 percent in the second quarter and 168 percent in the third quarter And it seems to me--and here's where I differ somewhat with the staff forecast--that that is apt to continue I see no reason why that won't tend to continue as far as the eye can see, because there are just so many adjustments underway, given the wonderful new opportunities of labor productivity That, of course, carries with it a need to have higher capital expenditures in the Rust belt, the manufacturing sector; and so that makes our economy stronger than it otherwise would have been Then, on top of that, instead of reducing government deficits by $73 billion, according to the staff forecast we  -22-    11/3/87  have a $16 billion increase in the deficit So that's an $89 billion [swing] and it just seems to me the economy wasn't going to work The stock market event seems likely to bring some relief in that it might be expected to slow consumer spending enough so that there is room for this other rather rapid expansion to continue But this doesn't give us a bad inflation environment at all; it indicates, of course, with this productivity going the way it is that you have less inflation In fact, it seems to me that the inflation rate in 1987 is just unbelievable, in view of the oil price rebound and the import price adjustments To have the CPI, which should have more imports than other measures of inflation, peak out at 62 percent in the first quarter, and move down to 46 percent in the second quarter and 36 in the third was just unbelievable So, in a way, everything was going all right except that expectations were bound to derail the train; and those expectations came out of the lack of understanding as to how inflation wasn't going to return; it wasn't there in spite of the fact of a falling dollar I don't know that there's any appreciation of the way in which the Federal Reserve's commitment existed in that environment So, we have a rather unusual occurrence With regard to the forecast, the one item that I think seems like a rather rapid reversal for the fourth quarter would be the income velocity of money The income velocity of money spurted up to about a +4 percent annual rate in the third quarter from zero in the second quarter; and then it looks to me like it falls at about a 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, which would be a swing of velocity of 10 percentage points That seems a little stronger than I might expect The real trick is how can we maintain confidence in the domestic value of money in a period of declining foreign exchange rates for the dollar?   Yes, Mr Chairman I'm delighted to have you take that position I support you and alternative "B" and borrowings of $450 million But I'd like to suggest somewhat of a variation on that in regard to the fed funds range Ordinarily, we would leave it at 5 to 9 percent; but it seems to me that there are about three reasons why we might lower that to 4 to 8 percent under alternative "B" And in part, this speaks to how that would be interpreted as people read these minutes In regard to President Morris' comments about upward movement in interest rates, a dramatic movement upward to the 9 percent fed funds level seems to me very unlikely; that probably would be destabilizing in financial markets So I'd really rather have that upward bound down a point I'd also like to have the lower bound down a point to 4 percent because, while we are not anticipating it, there might be some circumstance between Open Market Committee meetings that would give us the flexibility [to move] downward, and that might be appropriate So, 4 to 8 percent on the fed funds range, even though it would maintain the policy stance about where we are, would give us a slight variation Frankly, I would prefer staying with variation II of the language [shown in the Bluebook], which is the more normal expression It just seems to me that the additional language shown in variation I could pose difficulties The very nice thing about the statement that was released by the Board Tuesday morning, October 20th, was that it was very simple and short And I would prefer in variation II to have the words read "slightly greater  might" and "somewhat less  would" be acceptable   That's where "B" would be   No, no   Mine also would be [current policy] I would presume that bringing the wide range for the fed funds rate down to 4 to 8 percent would be more consistent, in the short run while we are in this period of greater flexibility, with a short-run policy in which we would really hold it and not let it go to 7 percent and not let it go above 7 percent   Well, I would certainly be opposed to our going to an announced narrow fed funds target It seems to me it is very important that we do not have the semblance of returning to the 1970s style, which would really require frequent consultations to move it,  -37-    11/3/87  and would give some the impression that over the long run we might be willing to allow whatever reserves might be consistent with that I would much prefer to have the wider range but with a temporary understanding, as we have had in these recent weeks, that we expect it to be in the 6-1/2 to 7 percent area   What was your first your sentence again?   Recent days or recent weeks--either one?   I think that would; that would indicate 6-3/4 percent I wouldn't do it   You want what on the fed funds rate?   Could I ask a question about the Corrigan--   Yes, I'd like to look at the Corrigan language Where it says "may call for a special degree of flexibility" I think that's that first sentence where he added a phrase Would it be okay to say "may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility because"  -43-    11/3/87   Well, I understand, but I'm just looking at the amendments   That's all I'm asking, yes   Would our transition borrowing be expected to be $450 million or $400 million?   Okay   The words that I wanted to look at here would be to continue to call for a special degree of flexibility, which would be an indication of continuing what we have been doing rather than of some new policy And then I have trouble with that sentence the outlook for monetary growth over the months ahead is subject to unusual uncertainty I'm not sure what that means; it seems to me that the only uncertainty when you look at Don's new figures is that it looks as if we have had a liquidity bulge But certainly we don't expect uncertainty in regard to the downside do we?   I'm just not sure what that sentence says It seems to me that the uncertainty is somewhat directed at one side   No, somewhat, slightly   Would or slightly greater restraint might   Oh, it's not-- I think the way it is now changed would [unintelligible]   Yes   You're not voting on that?   Somewhat   Yes, that word respectively isn't needed is it? The word respectively should be out?   Right  -46-    11/3/87   [You could] use coefficients of variation, but it would seem to be smaller for the funds rate   Don, there was one thing that surprised me It seemed to me that after the first few weeks following October 19th banks would have had some excess reserves which they could carry over to the next period But with $150 million to $250 million, I would presume that quite a few banks were running very heavy excess reserves and that the carry-over period for those excess reserves is lapsing, so that it's a financial cost Is that true?   So behavior will not necessarily be modified from these very low levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowings then   Okay   But that reserve estimate being off can have information in it   Mr Chairman, Vice Chairman Corrigan expressed it just exactly the way I would If there is, as I sense, a desire to return to a borrowing target, then it seems to me that the question is How do we best get away from this situation in which the market is in danger of interpreting our actions as pegging the fed funds rate?   Of course they are   Having them think that means that getting off of it is somewhat problematic because, in the period following this meeting, if we begin to read things differently they may assume that we have made a policy change when we don't think we have made a policy change   It seems to me it has been very predictable; borrowings have been very close to a $200 - $250 million range and in these weeks we have had a federal funds rate very close to 6-3/4 percent So, it seems to me, it is somewhat predictable   If banks are saving up to have free access to the window, would they be most likely to choose the two-week period ending the 30th or would they choose that [next] four-day period?   So, if that's the case, then you might expect a very large jump in borrowing--   That might also mean that borrowing could be at lower numbers during the period that begins the day after tomorrow   But, Bob, people in the marketplace are making that assumption and have been positioning themselves for over a month   That's right   Then, the fed funds rate would tend to drop rather dramatically in that period   That's right   It's the 1970s all over again   Well, this market is going to get just as fragile as we cause it to be and the longer we cause it to believe that the fed funds rate is 6-3/4 percent, the more fragile it's going to be about getting away from there It seems to me that we [unintelligible] variance in the fed funds rate and yet have a 50  -12-    12/15-16/87  basis point limit on it if we want If we would like to have a 50 basis point limit on it this week, and we want it to be in a range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent, then we could do that But at least we would get the market used to some variation Then when we get to the first of the year the transition is not going to be nearly so abrupt   That's right   Today is the next to the last day of a two-week reserve maintenance period, and the fed funds rate is locked on 6-3/4 percent If it locks on 6-3/4 percent through tomorrow, I think we would have told everyone that's where we are   It comes in at 9-1/8 percent   People then say, well, it's the last day   If you don't want to go to 9 percent, then put a ceiling of 7-1/2 percent on it or put a floor if you want to I just want to have more variance than we have been getting   That's alternative number (3) as a transition back to where we want to be   Well, of course It is because people out there are saying, "My goodness, 6-3/4 percent is the rate I guess maybe I'll sell funds I'm not going to sell for less than that if that's what the rate is"   I'm not going to get more   So-called seasonal borrowing, it seems to me, is simply adjustment borrowing without a time limit on it for those institutions that qualify It has all the characteristics of adjustment borrowing and it's not taken unless there is an ability to utilize the funds That is, if banks could lock up that seasonal borrowing and sell it in the fed funds market, then it would be like extended credit So, it seems to me, it's more like adjustment borrowing, as the statistical tests suggested   No, no   "Get"--that's right   Just a bit of populism peeking out   That's right   How many Johnsons on the head of a pin?   I hope you wouldn't let the public know!   It seems to me that the important thing that has been mentioned here is that even if we don't find something to stay with forever, it is certainly true--and we all recognize it--that price levels and inflation do have some long-run relationship to the money stock, however we define it And I guess that's why I would    12/15-16/87  depart a bit from Frank's observations It seems to me that it makes some sense to stay with some [unintelligible] I get a feeling that the monetary base reflects a lot of the other, but it has a little of a true believer element to it and it may not be all that helpful at this point The question I want to direct to Don would be this Since the Humphrey-Hawkins Act does require, in a sense, that we think there is a long-run relationship, those long-run income and price level elasticities were very impressive, I thought   Well, there's just no doubt; I think everyone accepts the fact that in the long run the rate of growth of the money stock is related to the rate of change of the price level   And that is important The Humphrey-Hawkins Act, as Roger Guffey mentioned, does not require us to target M3, and we have not been talking about M3 here, yet we continue to target M3 If we are going to target two aggregates, would we be better off targeting M1A and M2 or would you suggest targeting M1A, M2, and M3? What is there to be said for targeting M3 over targeting M1A?   Well, I'm not all that impressed by the fact that we can hit it; I'm more impressed with the fact that if we have a money stock target that we are aiming for and we miss it, we ought to be able to explain why we are missing in the direction we are missing I suppose commodity prices might help to explain some of that   What was the question?   Well, that very well may be due to the fact that we're so sensitive to any increases in the fed funds rate above the 6- 3/4 percent level and we're not sensitive about it moving below that   Well, my view was that yesterday we had a need to take reserves out of the system and we didn't because funds were trading at 6-3/4 percent So, we said we won't take the reserves out of the system that policy would have called for; we, in effect, put a ceiling--   If that was the policy, then this morning I presume we should have gone in immediately, acting to keep it at 6-3/4 percent   How did the fed funds rate get to 6-1/4 percent this morning?   Well, I know, but if we had a fed funds policy, what would you have done if it got to 6-1/4 percent?   My view is that we did have some notion about the amount of borrowing that would be associated with a 6-3/4 percent funds rate and the need came yesterday to drain reserves And we didn't drain reserves, it seems to me, because we were sensitive to having the rate go above 6-3/4 percent Is that right, Peter?  -45-    12/15-16/87   Okay, Peter says that's right   My outlook and the staff's are very, very similar There is only one modification and that is that I see as strong an economy as the staff sees only without the 1 percentage point decline in interest rates I guess that would mean that I see an underlying strength of capital spending that would be able to accomplish the contribution that the staff has laid out even without getting the interest rate decline That adjustment, I think, can still give us strength There are three uncertainties that we are all faced with consumer spending; the impact from net real exports and the dollar; and the foreign exchange rate/capital market adjustment problems Let me mention, first of all, consumer spending It seems to me that the consumer spending effect of the episode of October 19 and the days following is less than the impact of the exchange rate and interest rate changes that have occurred since then That is, consumer spending is not apt to be affected in a worrisome way, given what has already happened If we do not have another event, it seems to me that, of course, we will have employment effects in some of the financial service industries and that would be consistent with some slowdown But I would note that personal consumption expenditures for the third quarter 1987 over the third quarter 1986 contributed about 15 percent out of a 31 percent economy So, Jerry, I think this adjustment you're talking about is really already under way My view, Jerry, is that it's helpful to lay out before us, as you did, the kind of adjustment scenarios But it seems to me that there's just no question that these adjustments are going to take place We are not going to be able to operate with the kind of imports of capital and the kind of balance of trade deficits that we've had; the market is going to bring some adjustments The question is whether the adjustments come in the way we would like them to come or in a way that would be very unfavorable and maybe close to disaster I was very pleased to hear Tom Melzer, Bob Parry, and Lee Hoskins all mention the fact that inflation of 4 percent is not satisfactory Of course, if we have low wage rates and high inflation rates, that's one way we could get an adjustment I would join them in saying that's not a satisfactory way of getting an adjustment  Our real net exports, as you know, have been increasing in a rather dramatic way I guess, Martha, I'd be on the side of calling the November numbers a fluke or a one-time occurence I'm not willing to rely on that as compared to twelve months of movement in the other direction When we look at third-quarter rates of 18 - 19 percent on real exports, it seems to me that one of the problems we are faced with is that real exports are growing at such a dramatic rate We pick a high [unintelligible] exchange value of the dollar and we say we don't want to tie monetary policy to that I understand why, but we may have overlooked the fact that that foreign exchange value of the dollar is producing a real export role and a crowding out of manufactured imports at a rate that's going to be difficult to maintain, even given the heavier capital spending taking place there So, it seems to me important for us not to make any gesture in the direction that would tend to exacerbate that problem I tend to  -66-    12/15-16/87  think, as Jerry Corrigan and Sam Cross and some others do, that that's the real factor that could give us the recession that everyone is worried about I don't think it is going to come because of slow money growth The money growth path that we've had, it seems to me, is not a Federal Reserve starvation growth pattern It isn't because we shut off reserves If that were the case, I think we would see some other factors occurring I'm sure that the foreign exchange markets would show more evidence if we really were being that stringent on reserves; that the Treasury yield curve would show it; and that we would be getting some declining commodity prices But I do believe that the real risk that we face is a foreign exchange rate upset that could, in a sense, give us another financial market episode in equities I understand why the monetarists argue for floating exchange rates, but you just don't get something for nothing If we have floating exchange rates, then we'd have to accept floating interest rates also And it would scare me as to what a precipitous move in exchange rates might do to US interest rates Frankly, I think that the stock market episode and the recent oil price move have simply given our bond markets some opportunity not to face the real consequences that a continuation of the dollar on this course would mean It's in that context that I've been, I suppose, oversensitive to any tendency on our part to peg the fed funds rate I'm just afraid to peg the fed funds rate in an environment in which we would not have interest rates responding to those real forces I share the view that letting the dollar go is a recipe for disaster We're not getting the kind of help we ought to be getting on Capitol Hill, but it seems to me we either have to take some steps in that direction, or we're going to get an experience that none of us wants   Mr Chairman, I have a question If we specify what we want the level of the fed funds rate to be will that then go into the minutes? I'm assuming that if we come up with a fed funds level that it would be appropriate for that to be in the minutes   Okay   I agree with you   I wouldn't agree with that If we do (1), it seems to me that we would have to report that in the minutes   Okay And then we'll look at that question  -70-    12/15-16/87   I'd take "B" and I would want the normal borrowing, which I guess would be $400 million after the first of the year I will not mention any fed funds rate I want no tilt and I want (4) just like Tom Melzer But I do think if we're going to do (4) that we might consider an announcement Someone mentioned yesterday that we might make a very simple statement indicating that we were reemphasizing adjustment plus seasonal borrowing so that the markets would not assume that we had made a policy move   I want no tilt   But, you could say it symmetrically both ways You could say that if your weakness--   Do you want a tilt to tightness?   But all of us who favor symmetry would have that   Well, we can get the directive   No   Correct   Right   We could take the "still sensitive" out and leave the "uncertainties" in It seems to me you might leave in the reference that uncertainties may call for a special degree of flexibility; that would be consistent with (3) rather than (4)   Well, I didn't mention it and I would like it out   You were correct, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, if we're going to (3), and that does involve a transition, it seems to me that we do not know at this point how the $300 million on borrowing that we've specified will turn out Would it be appropriate for a telephone conference call to take place at the first of the year to get a better feel of that so that we would not have eased inadvertently in going to that number   In other words, if the fed funds rate were moving down decidedly, you might not pursue the borrowing objective as precisely as you did before October 19?  -82-    12/15-16/87   But you would be pursuing the borrowing as your primary operating strategy?   Yes Now, my question relates to the transition from where we are to that If the transition entails an acceptance of $300 million of borrowing and that turns out to be easier than we thought, would it be appropriate for us to have a conference call?   No, it hasn't been changed   Okay   Well, it does; and if it goes below it, it goes below   That wasn't a majority though, was it?   Let me ask a question I thought we had assumed it to be $300 million before the end of the year, but would assume it to be maybe $400 million after the end of the year Is that right, Don?   Well, I think Tom Melzer has a very good point that the FOMC has not voted at any time to take an easing step and we ought not to get a translation of this into an easing step without a vote to ease   I feel satisfied that with the $300 million to $400 million that we not go through the process of mentioning it in the minutes I would not have felt satisfied before because there are people in the market who do read these minutes on a belated basis very carefully, and I would feel a responsibility that if we ever make such a move that we should let the markets know I believe the markets work best when people have accurate information   No, I feel satisfied that it's not the end under this specification  -85-    12/15-16/87   Do you mean specifically the use of monetary policy to add to exchange rate stability?   You're just talking about what the minutes say then?   You're not talking about the minutes?   Okay   I would like to associate myself, as you probably understand, with the remarks that Vice Chairman Corrigan just made I believe it's a high-risk approach And I also believe that a very clear-cut policy on the part of the US Government and the Federal Reserve would not require as much interest rate cost as we otherwise will have to bear It would be more consistent with lower interest rates and faster money growth than our ignoring the exchange value of the dollar   It seems to me that that would be an appropriate change In fact, that's not really very far away from what we anticipated when we were doing it I think it makes it a little more clear And it seems to me, at this point, that it would be unfortunate for us to give a wrong signal to the market that we either have attempted to ease or have attempted to tighten I think this restatement gives us a continued ability to be flexible in that regard until the next FOMC meeting and yet not over-encourage the notion that we are pegging the fed funds rate   That will show up in the minutes   So, what we're doing here is making a change in the directive which does not amend the original What we have is the directive up to now; now we have a new directive from here to the end of this FOMC period   But the minutes will show what we did on December 15-16?   And the minutes will now show what we're doing now?   Well, but you don't want any statement in the minutes to that effect   Just to be sure I understand these words we have adopted now will be shown as substitutes for the other words?   Right But we're not going to put the whole directive back out again?   Okay   Yes   Yes Since President Hoskins mentioned the monetary policy objectives, I guess I'd like to make even a stronger statement in regard to that The way you stated it was somewhat different than it's written The way you stated it was less offensive to me than the way it's written The way it's written is so contrary to everything I believe about what our job is, that it causes me to wonder Have I missed something all these two years or have we had this stated before?   Whatever it is, it seems to me that if that's what our objective is, we are always going to be on the edge of a disaster And I don't know how else to put it Back on chart 19--and here again I want the Presidents to realize that I'm very impressed with the scholarship of this forecast, and I indicated that to the staff--but I haven't yet seen what happens on chart 19 if we have an unchanged dollar and tighter US monetary policy Now, I presume that means that money growth is about like it was in 1987 Is that approximately correct?   In other words, M2 growth for '88 under this scenario would be 4 percent?   And what would it be for '89?   Oh! I see That is quite a restrictive path But what bothers me is the outcome I disagree with you in regard to the sign of the result in interest rates It would seem to me, if you adopted a smaller money growth path and if you had the lower real GNP as detailed here, that the fed funds rate might be 2 to 3 percent less than, rather than 2 to 3 percent greater than Would you comment on that?  SPEAKER(?) I think the exercise involved moving from interest rates to the impacts on the economy and then back to money demand, as measured by standard money demand equations That is the way it works, and there are lots of ways of cutting this But, essentially, the slowdown in nominal GNP, which was about 1-1/2 percentage points this year--a little less, 1-1/4--is associated with this kind of interest rate rise on the one hand, and you get the sharp reduction, too, partly because of what Don and his colleagues have been saying for quite a while--because of the considerable interest elasticity in the money numbers   Well, apparently it's the model And I guess from time to time that bothers me The model that you use is not close to the model of the way I would assume the economy works   I guess that depends upon how soon you expect expectations to be realized The model that I would be using would have a different chain of events It would seem to me--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, but just so you could see that in the consumer prices measure here in 1988 If you thought that there was a big expectational component in the rate of inflation, then with slower, or deliberately slower, monetary growth--of course, it is something very difficult to capture in the model--you would get much    2/9-10/88  less nominal GNP You would then have some feedback effects; in fact, you would have lower interest rates   I consider this to be somewhat important, because if I believed that a fast growth rate of the money stock would result in lower interest rates, I would be very inclined to choose such a policy  SPEAKER(?) In the short run   But you would admit, wouldn't you Mike, that "C" isn't a very pretty picture?   Well, it just seems to me that the sounder money policies that we've had in place tend to result in intermediate-term interest rates coming down and some confidence in regard to this institution And it seems to me that it's been very beneficial for us and will result in the higher growth path of the monetary aggregates  SPEAKER(?) The 300 basis points tagged on to that scenario --it really does stretch one's macroeconometric credibility   The staff forecast, it seems to me, is in the ballpark, although I have very little confidence in our ability to see quarter-by-quarter That is, I would tend to look at what happens for the year, and appraise that The staff probably does better than I would in regard to calling these quarter-by-quarter changes; anytime I try I can't get it right I think there are some extreme circumstances that make forecasting much more difficult, and some of them have been mentioned We have had sectors of the economy in and out of recession; now we have a dramatic switch in the net exports area at the same time that, clearly, consumer spending is altering its path--the data we have in regard to the use of cash rather than plastic tend to indicate a different kind of behavior It seems to me that the Chairman's point on the saving rate--that a 1 percent difference there is a large number and makes a lot of difference-- should be emphasized I think there are many, many special difficulties  I would point out that I did have a chance to go to an area I thought would have the most dismal [economic conditions] in the United States, so I decided, with Bob Forrestal's permission, to visit the branch at New Orleans I was really quite surprised, Frank, to hear the number of stories about firms that are headquartered in your region that are locating plants in that region And I guess that's what we would come to expect, given the labor market conditions there versus labor market conditions in your area So, I think it's very hard to know how the expansion areas match out; I think we have to be careful to watch it on a week-by-week basis But I don't think that we should let ourselves get scared by those who use some rules of thumb to tell us about when recessions occur  I think I'll mention commodity prices so that I don't have my reputation damaged in that regard The precious metals make up a part of what we call reflective indices on commodity prices--that is, they tend to reflect more quickly changing scarcities in money And there's no question that we had some indication there that would seem to me to call for less extreme slow growth in the monetary aggregates'  -25-    2/9-10/88  growth path So it seems to me that it would be more appropriate for us to target growth above the 35 percent or 4 percent range of M2 last year But I would point out to you that even though industrial metals seem to have gone through their cycle, we do have some evidence of upward price movements in the nonoil portions of our experimental index, which is designed to measure the flow-through effects That incudes a lot of food and fiber, and my concern is that wage rates seem to be more sensitive to discretionary food and fiber prices than they probably are to many other prices I'm becoming worried that we have been in a period of exchange rate adjustment, with some import price increases, for long enough that it's going to be very difficult for us to go much longer without having a permanently higher inflation rate--one that's just not acceptable It seems to me that it is important for us to be on guard in that regard   Well, I do think that monetary growth targets are important, and I would like to have them even if the law didn't require them There are conditions that exist or occur during a year that are unforeseen that may warrant from time to time accepting growth outside the target ranges But I think the advantage of targets is that they do, in a sense, hold us accountable for those deviations--that is, whenever we have faster growth than the targets, if it turns out to be a policy mistake, it seems to me we have to bear that responsibility And there isn't any question that we are somewhat on the line right now because M2 has grown outside the target ranges Our year-over-year growth rate bottomed out for M2 at 3 percent--that is before the revisions The numbers showed 3 percent in the week of January 11th; and 3 percent is quite a way below the 5  -32-    2/9-10/88  percent It seems to me that it is important, as we go through this period of adjustment of exchange rates--which we know brings pressure on import prices--to make it clear to everyone that our long-run objective is to get to price level stability We know what we experienced with the rebound in oil prices; there is no question that we couldn't keep the rate of inflation at a long-run desired level while going through that adjustment But it seems to me that we should have these target ranges, and the Chairman's testimony concerning them should make clear our long-run objective of price stability It seems to me that we ought not to have M2 growth as low this second year as we did the first year In some ways I think to miss two years in a row, or to plan to miss two years in a row, on the downside becomes somewhat unacceptable That is, we have had an experience of a year in which certain commodity price pressures and exchange rate pressures and conditions in financial markets caused us to believe on a week-to-week basis that monetary policy needed not to be eased in order to achieve those growth rate targets But I think now we ought to say to ourselves in the second year What bottom on the target range can we go with, where we really do mean that we expect to ease if we go below it? And that bottom of 5 percent, frankly, is too high for me to feel comfortable pledging that I would want to ease if we were at 4-1/2--even though financial markets might be somewhat under an adjustment problem, exchange markets might have a problem, and inflationary fears might be there I guess I don't want to put myself in that position of pledging myself to ease under that condition So, I would prefer alternative III Frankly, as many of my colleagues know, I've been flirting somewhat with even 4 to 7 percent as the proper range But I do believe that there are uncertain conditions on the other side and it might be helpful to have a somewhat higher boundary So I would join the Vice Chairman in being willing to go with alternative III  Now, I did do some playing around with the year-end adjustment problem From time-to-time I have been concerned that seasonal adjustments at year-end give us a last-quarter base that seems to be somewhat out of kilter And I think as a long-run policy I would be happier basing on the last 6 months of the year and beginning our cone on October 1 rather than basing on the fourth quarter and beginning the cone on November 15th That would have the subtle tendency, of course, to cause the cone to be wider, and by year's end that extra width would be about $11 billion But it would still give us the narrower 3 percentage point range that we have talked about I've kind of flirted with [the view that] maybe 4 to 8 percent ought to be right, because that would give us a 6 percent midpoint; but anything that gives us some move in that direction I could go with So, I guess I'll summarize by saying alternative III   Peter, I guess it seems to me that there's some appearance at the Desk that when we need to drain [reserves] and we are perceived to need to drain, we are still somewhat more interest rate sensitive about draining earlier in the period It seems to me that's conveying to the market that we still continue to have a more narrow interest rate tolerance Would you comment on that?   I guess it would seem to me that when we had that change from $300 million to $250 million, that would have given a little more opportunity for us to make another step towards more emphasis upon the borrowing target and a little less concern about interest rates That didn't seem to show through to me; and I think it didn't show through to a lot of the marketplace   Well, I understand that But we knew earlier in the period that we needed to drain, and it seemed to me we didn't drain because of the fed funds rate It seems to me that that continues to have the market's attention and that doesn't seem quite in keeping with what I understood we were expecting to do on that as we ended out this intermeeting period I thought, as we got away from the first of the year, we had thought that adjustment process--   I know, but I'm concerned that the markets may exaggerate what it is that we have done--that there might appear to be a slight tightening Interest rates may be running a little lower this week than we would expect, midpointwise, because of that surplus; and it seems to me that we now run the risk of having people think we have snugged back up after this meeting, which I think is unfortunate   Well, I just want to indicate some slight difference [of opinion] with regard to how that was done   I know It's so late in the period   What I'm saying is we waited so late in the period   Jerry, if your objective is the federal funds rate--   I know; mine isn't either But if it is, I think you can pinpoint it, if that's your objective   My goodness! We sure did in the '70s   Well, Jerry, I just don't understand If the Desk has the message that it's below, buy and sell fed funds   No, I'm saying if the Desk has the objective of buying and selling 1/8th of a point off of the fed funds target, that's going to be realized   Now, I don't agree with wanting to do that; I'm just saying I agree with Manley that it can be done   I share your view, Mr Chairman, that the financial markets do have some fragility to them Given the circumstances we are in, I think it's rather dangerous to be in a position of tightening credit at all I'm not comfortable with even a small step towards tightening That's why I believe what we've done has been not so well thought out, because I think we have set  -63-    2/9-10/88  ourselves up in the circumstance in which we are apt to find it necessary to tighten--and tighten after the fact--and that poses a dangerous problem I don't mean to be insensitive to the problems that we have had and I don't want to make too much over little, but when we have hardly any opportunity to go in the other direction, every step we lose on the downside gets to be, I think, rather significant  I think this talk about borrowing targets and then the fed funds rate, frankly, has become a kind of zigzag step which never ends I vote with the majority and I end up losing And, Governor Johnson, I just have to congratulate you--I mean you voted in the minority and you've won! And I just want to admit that to you; it was really very, very well done I hope everyone understands the sensitivity that I have at this point I would not make any moves other than what I thought was exactly right for the US economy and the world economy I think we are running some severe risks of other factors blowing up and I don't understand why that is good from any perspective In the spirit of wanting to go along, I'll try to go along But I would like some assurance that we are not going to just keep doing this, Mr Chairman  On the long term, my first choice is alternative III, but I can go with 4 to 8 percent I can go with "B", if that's not easing from our present position And I would like to have us mention the borrowing targets in the directive I'd like the borrowing target to go in the directive I would like either to lose with the fed funds targeting issue and have it be fed funds, or I'd like to win, Mr Chairman, and have borrowing be in the directive And if we can work in that spirit of cooperation, I'll try to cooperate   My borrowing preference is $250 million; that's the deal we made We talked about going from $300 million to $250 million and we did it And then I see the Desk operating in such a way that it puts us in jeopardy--having to tighten to go to what I agreed to do I seem impatient and I'm sorry   But I want everyone to know I do understand they are just differences in opinion and not--   I think I could compromise at $200 million if we can be symmetric But to go to $200 million and then also be asymmetric--   Let's not argue about that   Well, I thought we were taking a position that we are not easing today; we are maintaining existing conditions   It's just that I think--apparently most think-- that the $200 million borrowings is consistent with the existing conditions   Yes   I guess I want to second a little what President Corrigan said in regard to the degree of flexibility I'm perfectly open to having alterations in policy when the data show something different I'm very open to that   You are not authorized to play for the System; it's just restricted to New York?  SPEAKER(?) That's right  SPEAKER(?) Are there implications for the exchange markets?   Yes, I'm interested in the discussion I'm really interested in Governor Heller's point; he made the point that I'd like to make, but on the other side I'm arguing his side--I think that he's saying that the system really isn't broke and let's not fix it It's working better than you expected that it would work, or theoretically would work, and that's enough  It seems to me that we have really three kinds of alternatives you can target the fed funds rate, and if you choose to do that, we've had experience with that and that can be accomplished; or you can target the money aggregates; or you can target reserves to target money aggregates I prefer the present position because we, in a sense, are in between This would permit us, when we believe we can, to emphasize once again the monetary aggregates more forcefully It seems to me to go in the other direction, and to go back to fed funds targeting, would be seen in the markets as an abandonment of the kind of sound money policies that came out of the policies that resulted in this nation's double-digit inflation rates being brought under control So it's a very symbolic issue And the markets, I think, would respond very adversely if we were to move in that direction  In regard to the political consequences, it seems to me that our experience in 1987--after the October 19th crash and all of these people predicting recession--was that we actually did become very fed funds oriented, and that that was the political incentive If the fed funds rate didn't respond properly to what we thought was the lowering of the target, then we got all excited So it seems clear to me that having a fed funds relationship does put you closer to the political situation I believe that it is so important that money be restricted over a period of time to maintain some scarcity And this [reserve] pressure approach that we are under is one that enables us to proceed toward a somewhat restrictive monetary aggregate targeting in the future All of us know that that's important for price level  -16-    3/29/88  stability So I would consider a move to fed funds targeting to be a wrong move and to result in inappropriate policy choices Now if --   Now, if Governor Heller suggests that $200 million or $300 million doesn't make much difference, I ask you How much difference does it make to change the fed funds rate from 675 percent to 650 percent? I would suggest that in doing that, we're more tempted to make that move I would suggest that we would not have made the move we made in February--which I thought at the time was an incorrect move and I still think it was an incorrect move--if we had not been concentrating on the fed funds rate It was only because we thought that someone might see that very slight change in the fed funds rate that we were encouraged, it seems to me, to accomplish it  So I would go back, Manley, to the period in 1986 and 1987 I agree with you that we did not strictly follow in an unbiased manner the borrowing targets during that period It seems to me that we not only had some misses, but there were times that we accepted the actual outcomes that were different I'm not suggesting a return to that period; I'm suggesting that the Desk follow more closely the adjustment plus seasonal borrowing targets early in the two-week period We start off following those very closely and we let the fed funds rate move It seems to me that there's no need on the last day, with contemporaneous reserve accounting, to try to make everything fit and hit the borrowing target on that last day If we have our average in there early during the two-week period, then I don't mind letting the fed funds constraints be more important on the last day to prevent those spikes So, I share your frustration concerning the earlier procedures and I don't want to return to them I really want to follow more precisely adjustment plus seasonal borrowings as an interim policy that will enable us later to return to closer monetary aggregates targeting   But I think all of us know why that took place; I don't think there's any need for us to go into that I think we can pursue borrowing targets and have deviations of borrowing around those targets be unbiased   You mean when you have strong deviations? You have--  -17-    3/29/88   But that bias is brought in because of the choice of a borrowing target closer to zero If we would always choose a borrowing target somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion, then we would have more leeway to have fluctuations on both sides   Well, then you can change the discount rate If you don't like the monetary policy that goes with $500 million adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, you lower the discount rate   But you said that we're all strong men and women who can stand up and be counted, and I would suggest to you that there's no better way to stand up and be counted than to change the discount rate   I guess it's a surprising development here for the members of the Board of Governors, for the most part, to be arguing that they want the FOMC to have more say, and for the Presidents to be arguing that they want the Board to have more say, which is what's involved   Manley, analytically there's no--   There's no disagreement, analytically; you're correct, analytically It's a question of emphasis; it's a question of stance Of course, you're going to get the one; you're going to get the other   I think we all do   Mr Chairman, from your perspective did we have a policy change the first of February?   Okay; that's what I was assuming--that we didn't But then, when you went before the Congress, I thought there was an indication that there was a policy change   I think that focuses on the point that if you're looking at adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, then that small change might have been consistent with, what, a $50 million change?   A $50 million change Clearly, it seems to me, if you make a $50 million change in borrowing, it's so slight that you wouldn't consider it a policy change and you wouldn't announce it   But I think that's Jerry's point that targeting the fed funds rate may put you in a position of having to make a statement more often than would be the case otherwise Do we really want that?   It's because the market was able to discern [a change in the desired funds rate] Under the adjustment plus seasonal borrowing procedure, the market wouldn't have known, on an 1/8th of a point move   So this takes us back to pre-October 19th?   It seems to me that our economy has some very bright spots in it I am not quite as concerned as others that we are going to move from somewhat slow growth to very, very robust growth Even though I had a forecast of 3 percent real growth fourth quarter to fourth quarter at the February FOMC meeting, there are still some areas in our economy that have weakness It is my belief that price pressures may not come because of output pressures but because of some of the developing notions about our policy response in a period in which the foreign exchange value of the dollar could come under serious attack It seems to me that commodity prices, which at best are mixed, have never really had the fallback that generally is accompanied by their leveling off Some commodity prices have moved up and some have moved down, and I suppose, on aggregation they seem not to be posing a tremendous problem But it seems to me that they are high enough to motivate a lot of productive activity and a lot of capital goods orders, so that the producer durable goods orders could very well be higher in the second half than we have projected  I also share the view of Bob Parry and about five or six others of you about the inflation forecast for 1989 Frankly, I am not as complacent as I would like to be in that regard In the past I felt that we have been overpredicting the rate of inflation a little; yet it seems to me that we are now at a crucial point where price rises could become rampant and could explode That's why I am worried about the broader aggregates growing at almost double-digit rates in January, February, and March Knowing, as we found out last fall, that it takes quite a bit of time before changed opportunity costs of holding money seem to affect the growth of those aggregates, it seems to me that we are in a precarious position here where we could have a  -48-    3/29/88  breakout on the price side that would be most unfortunate So I, for one, believe I would like to join the 4-3-2-1 club That is to say How in the world can any of us be policymakers and not want to get the rate of inflation, as Lee Hoskins says, down to a zero rate? If we are going to get it down, we really have to begin And it seems to me that 5 percent doesn't do it; it needs to go the other way My preference would be to start with four percent on the CPI in 1987, be down in the 3 percent range in 1988, and proceed lower [thereafter] But I would invite anyone to join the club who would have a different timetable; I wouldn't care if you wanted to start in 1988 rather than in 1987 But for those who really care about price level stability, I would think that we have to make some changes at this point   I believe that forecast would [unintelligible] one large thrift almost $1 billion   Bob, you and I are talking about the same institution   And that's fairly easy to do All you do is just let people borrow from the discount window without asking a lot of questions on whether they have collateral   Does whole hog mean "C" or--   I think the question that was asked for those who want to wait is What are you waiting to see? I think it is a good question I'm very sympathetic with the notion that we can give misleading signals in regard to what it is that it appears we are focusing on when we make the move It does seem to me that if the staff forecast is accurate, at some point in time the discount rate change would be a part of such a move And I point out that if that were to take place, of course, it could take place at any point in time between Open Market Committee meetings If there are factors that would make us think that we would need that much of a change, it seems to me we ought not rule that out So, I don't see that today is necessarily the time to move But I would have a strong preference as to what kind of signals we use I happen to like something in alternative C very, very well And what I like in alternative C are the M2 growth paths Frankly, I would like for us to look at those very carefully, and, if I thought we could wait, do nothing now in regard to a borrowing target move That would be acceptable to me because I don't think we know at this stage what has happened on the money growth that would be anticipated from the moves we have made Certainly, April was a month we knew wasn't going to give us very clear readings on the monetary aggregates; May looks like it might be consistent with "C"; and if June doesn't follow that path, frankly, I'd like to have that be the factor that would cause us to make a move I say that in keeping with my view that we will be able to achieve our movement to price level stability if we do not allow the exchange value of the dollar to fall further I believe that an alternative C growth path of the monetary aggregates would be consistent with a stable dollar in the short-term horizon, and I'd like to have that kind of restraint But I certainly feel comfortable in having the Chairman--he has shown already that he is responsive to these forces and that we could make this move as we see some more alternatives So, it's okay with me to have a strong tilt in the directive and to have no change today in the borrowing target, provided there is some assurance that we will be ready to act if those monetary growth rates do not return to what I thought was the very good path that we had in 1987 Hindsight says that wasn't too bad   It seems to me that 5 to 9 percent would be more appropriate   So you have a preponderance of a move and a tilt  -12-    5/17/88   Majority   It seems to me that that's a very appropriate response And as I understand it then, that almost means that we would expect maybe a telephone conference call if we don't do it   There would be a telephone conference   But, Ed, the count was four people who favored an immediate tightening   No, no I'm just talking about a count of the voting members   There were four members   Sure   No, no   That's right, so it could be $100 million now and $100 million [more] before the next meeting   Let's take the "C" numbers   I know, but that's--   March to June?   Why do we use March to June rather than May to June?   Well, I know; but it seems to me that what you already have behind you, you can't alter I thought maybe--   How about May to July?   Really Because otherwise you convey a mistaken impression   Why not May to July?   Yes   I know But what we do in June--   But what we do in June can't affect June's growth rate or even July's growth rate   So I'd prefer to say 4 to 6 percent from May to July That would give some indication here of what we're--   Yes, April Right; that would be a quarter   I'm very appreciative of the fact that there are so many members of this Committee who place price level stability in such high regard that they want to find some way to accomplish that [objective] This proposal, it seems to me, is somewhat deficient in that regard in that it does not have within it a proposal that, in a sense, gets you to price level stability I guess I see it as a way to live with 5 percent or 4 percent inflation, because 4 percent inflation can occur while maintaining this kind of constraint, so--   Yes Second, even though I call myself a monetarist, I've always been a discretionary monetarist And I believe that there are some circumstances--anyone who has read Irving Fisher, I think, would be aware of the fact that once you begin targeting money, and you cause money to be more scarce than it otherwise would be, you can alter the expected rate of inflation And when you do, you get a shift in the demand for money Now, it seems to me, that's exactly what occurred in 1986, with the worldwide deflation in commodity prices led by the plunging price of oil Certainly, many of us were mindful of the fact that during that period of time we were getting some extreme numbers And I remember in July, August, and September of that year looking very carefully at the commodity prices, which had turned around, and saying that we ought to put more restraint in place And yet there were some who felt--and I think quite rightly so--that those countries with balance of trade surpluses were not engaging in action that was sufficient in regard to the survivability of the third world And we thought it was essential, in some ways, to push the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank to more expansionary programs And we did this, with some risk, which made it necessary for us to follow a very different course of monetary policy in 1987 And there were those who were the strict rulemakers who told us at that point in time how disastrous it was going to be Now, as it turns out, it wasn't disastrous for us to follow a very low growth path for the monetary base during 1987 It turns out that that seems to have been exactly the right thing to have done So, I really can't find myself in a rulemaking camp versus a discretion camp If you want to be discretionary, then you have to ask yourself what you want to use for discretion And I've made it very clear that commodity prices are very good signals in regard to money growth rates   But what would be the money market response if the money market knows that we have these guidelines and then we decide to violate them? Don't you think there would be an expectational impact upon the money market?   Yes, but you see, by March or April of 1986, or by May at least, I presume we already were running up against that constraint And if the marketplace had seen that out there, then the path of interest rates in April and May would have been affected by market expectations of the fact that that was there   Well, not to the target range; I think that's right   Well, Tom, would you object to paying more precise attention to M2 right now? Is there anyone here who believes that 8 percent growth of M2 is consistent with our price level stability goals?   I cannot tell you   October 6th   Sam, you didn't mean--and I presume President Corrigan didn't mean--when talking about the fundamentals, that there isn't a change in fundamentals when for 18 months the monetary aggregate growth rates in the United States have been approximately 1/2 of the growth rates of other major G-10 countries You would call that a fundamental that might be showing through, would you not?   So you would include the fact that the trade balance does seem to be moving in the right direction as a change in the fundamentals, wouldn't you?   But you would also conclude, I presume, that the interest rate differentials that are necessary in a period of sustained dollar depreciation would be quite different from the interest rate differentials necessary if market expectations [changed] in regard to either the rate, a change of depreciation, or perceptions of stability, would you not?   I did not mean my questions and accompanying comments to indicate that I did not believe that there cannot be an overshooting in regard to a rebound from a previous situation It would seem to me that one would expect that such sustained rates of depreciation of the dollar against other currencies over such a long period of time would not be followed by a period of everything stabilizing, but by some period of volatility So I don't mean to suggest that I am out of step with the notion that maybe it would be appropriate to accumulate some balances if one can do that without creating the impression that the dollar's upside potential is very, very low--which could recreate this one-way bet that we've seen for such a long time I think it's a very delicate matter   Indeed, you've done that And my comments are not at all a criticism of the Desk's actions I just couldn't quite sit still with some of the comments I heard   It seems to me that in the last 6 months we've had a rather noticeable shift, at least on the part of the staff I felt that 6 months ago the staff were not sure about the Board's and the FOMC's resolve on inflation And I'm very appreciative of the fact that the staff have read this resolve of the FOMC in regard to inflation and that they have given us a monetary policy projection that's somewhat consistent with that As I look at the Greenbook numbers, I don't focus on the number you focus on, which is real GNP targeting I'm somewhat like Lee Hoskins and Manley Johnson in that  -29-    6/29-30/88  regard But there is one number here in the Greenbook that I do believe is a very desirable forecast, and that's nominal GNP And I point out to you that our nominal GNP numbers in the forecast show the kind of decline that seems to me is consistent with our ultimate goals It just seems to me it's somewhat dangerous for us in a policy context to be focusing on real GNP when we can focus on nominal GNP When you look at the numbers there, you see that after 1984 we've only had one year in which the nominal GNP has been in the 7 percent range, and that was 1987 All right, we have in the staff forecast a 67 for 1988 and a 60 for 1989 It seems to me that if we can have a forecast bringing nominal GNP back down to the 45 percent that we had in 1986, that the right medicine is the monetary policy that brings that nominal GNP on down I don't see how we get into trouble if we bring the nominal consistently down So I'm somewhat satisfied with that kind of a policy background  I'm going to hand out some charts here in regard to commodity prices I do that somewhat reluctantly because I do not believe commodity prices are as good a signal as exchange rates are I just believe that it's more politic to talk about commodity prices than it is to talk about exchange rates And I think in some ways we're talking about the same thing But, since the staff did get the experimental index into their chart show, I thought at least we ought to have a little background in regard to that experimental index Now, first of all, the experimental index was designed to show the flow-through capabilities of commodity prices to the producer price index and to the consumer price index And this index is a consumption-weighted index Now, the chart that you have is a chart of the index without oil A consumption-weighted index has oil very, very high; whether we're doing it or the IMF is doing it or anyone else is doing it, we end up getting very high weights for oil  What our staff work has shown--and there has been some excellent work on the part of the Board's staff in this regard--is that year-over-year rates of change in commodity prices have been successful in leading changes in the rate of change in the CPI on the same year-over-year basis, and that most commodity indices tend to do that with a 7- to 9-month lead time, which seems to be superior to what the leading index does for the real economy So, the first page that I've shown you there is this commodity index without oil in it As you can see, this index has shown a downward movement and now is showing an upward jag That upward jag is the drought effect Now, I don't know what this index would have looked like without the drought I can only suspect what it might have looked like The second page shows the full index--I mean the index as it was designed And the year-over-year rate of change clearly shows a turning point in this index which would be consistent with the CPI year-over-year rate of change peaking about September of 1987 If this proves not to be the case, then this constitutes a clear false signal I don't know; it may very well have constituted a false signal because we have the full index saying one thing and the index without oil saying something else So, I think it's a very uncertain case  Ed Boehne gave us some data on the CPI and the PPI; and there again, I tend to look at the year-over-year rates of change The CPI year-over-year peaked out at 46 or 47 last fall; it was down to 44 in December; it crept on down to 39 and stalled I'm somewhat suspicious that the index may move back up above 4 again With the  -30-    6/29-30/88  drought effects on food prices, I think that's quite likely Now, the last page shows the commodity index, the full index with 1982 consumption weights This one just happens to have a strange base of January 1986 in it But for those of you who would understand what that might mean for some of us, that index gives some indication that monetary policy was successful in holding the deflationary environment that was occurring in 1986 It seems to me it does give some evidence of that, although the recent trend in 1988 is very suspicious; if you're a chartist and you draw the lines from 1988, you can say we have a problem And, of course, I think we ought to lean against that wind by [adopting] the monetary policy prescription that the staff has outlined  Now exchange rates, it seems to me, are showing something else in regards to the scarcity of money I will not dwell on that item, but I would point out that even the staff, who apparently believe that the exchange rate in December '88--if I read the report correctly--will be about the same as it was in December '87-- Is that correct, Ted?   Well, I thought we had had a 7 percent rise from December and you're projecting a 7-1/2 percent fall from June to the end of the year So it's approximately--   Okay, I'm just saying--   Well, okay Whatever your projection is, I'm comfortable with the decided change that that shows It does seem to me that exchange rates do respond to real monetary scarcities And I think the automatic gold standard always worked if everyone wanted to make it work because it did alter the monetary growth paths for countries with balance-of-trade deficits  I don't know about the drought Some people seem to think that the drought is going to add to inflationary forces I think there's a danger there that has to be guarded against But I think the drought can possibly have deflationary impacts in the long run if we get past these first 6 months of it What Gary Stern said last night struck me that for those people in the Midwest where that drought is concentrated, there is a feeling that does have something to do with expectations  -31-    6/29-30/88  One other thing I would mention is in regard to defense spending I picked up anecdotal evidence which says that there are many small defense contractors around the nation who are not permitted to make any bids for any government contracts or to engage in any new projects of any kind due to the fact that they're dealing with a representative or lobbyist in Washington who is tainted And I understand this to be a rather widespread phenomenon  The final comment I'd make is in regard to the money markets It just seems to me that in the last five months the money markets and bond markets have responded so well to the policy moves we've made Some of you may not think they were policy moves, but it does seem to me that we've been attempting to lower the growth path of the monetary aggregates, and I would consider that to be a policy move I think the bond markets have behaved so well because they have seen us responding in a pattern that they didn't expect and I think they believe that our timing has been appropriate And I think it's important that we keep in mind the kind of timing that we've had It seems to me that the Chairman has indicated a very [unintelligible] in carrying out the FOMC's views in regard to the tilts we've placed in [the directive] And I guess I'd expect that to continue Thank you   Yes Don, in some ways my question arose and you partially answered it [in your report] The lower [projected] inflation, with a 14 percent M2 growth rate in 1989, followed by 24 percent in 1990 and then a Treasury bill rate in 1990 of 92 percent, is so inconceivable to me I just wondered is it conceivable to you?   My comment would be that your model doesn't fit the financial world that I've learned to experience, and I would think that a Treasury bill rate of 52 percent would be more consistent in 1990 with that kind of M2 growth   Yes, but the yield curve in that situation would be so inverted   It has to be an inverted yield curve unless the-   Unless inflation is accelerating   Yes   You probably haven't yet incorporated a commodity index inflation movement within your model, have you--with a feedback?  -35-    6/29-30/88   Okay   As for alternative II, I don't like quibbling with half a percentage point in these numbers So the question is alternative III versus alternative I I come out this way I prefer that we do alternative III, but I prefer to make that decision next February Just like a year ago, I preferred that we make the decision closer to the time because I believe it's important to have credibility And I would certainly want the language of the Humphrey- Hawkins report to indicate that we anticipate doing that But I really prefer that we not announce one now because I believe there is something in the neighborhood of a 20 percent chance that we will be back into a commodity price deflation prior to the beginning of 1989 And if that's the case I wouldn't want to make the move So--   We have to announce the preliminaries Well, I'm going to vote for alternative I, but there's an 80 percent chance that I'll want to be at III next February   Yes   Well, Mr Chairman, in fairness, you have 6 people who have clearly shown that they favor alternative III Even though I don't, I can vote for it; I'm not going to vote no On that gesture, I think it would be a mistake   It seems to me--   I think there's just a little loss in credibiliity in doing that   I like Don Kohn's second suggestion best of all I would prefer that we not make it seem as if we are really all that uncertain about these I don't like the qualifications that might make it seem we are not going to stick with them I prefer to have something very simple, like Don Kohn's second suggestion   Borrowing of $550, $600 million--how important is that? Borrowing of $600 million with a 7-1/2 percent fed funds rate is a return to what we decided not to do I just don't understand how we could do that We voted to follow a borrowing target, and the present level of our borrowing target is $550 million And if we tighten, we tighten Now of all the times to choose to tell the markets we're tightening, this is the lousiest time I have ever heard of I mean, the markets have received so well what we've done It has been an immaculate arrangement of achieving objectives And I don't see how we're going to go in here and do this I'm reluctant to have to vote "no" But in the past I've gone along, and every time I've been sorry We did this last September We had a deal; we said  -56-    6/29-30/88  what we'll do is increase the borrowing But we didn't do it And then the markets discovered it 3 weeks later and the timing was just as bad as it could be I just don't understand why we can't maintain present borrowing pressures; then we will know what we're doing There will be no misunderstanding Why not have a conference call in the meantime if something happens? I don't know what the dollar is going to do, but if the dollar rises and continues to rise--sometimes if you're in the financial marketplace and you want to go bet against what the market's doing you can go ahead and do it if you like This dollar might have more [room] to run up than it has to go down If it does, it would seem to me that it could very well get that much more top heavy, that much more over where the trade requirement is And I want to have some ammunition to do it when it's time to do it   I'm saying that going to $600 million is either going to cause us to abandon borrowing targeting and make it be 7-1/2 percent or--   Well, if it's not a problem, then there's no problem leaving it at its current level If $50 million isn't important, there's no problem leaving it at $550 million; and then when we have our conference call, let's go to $700 million if we need to   Oh, I believe it is I believe the long bond market is poised; I think it has accepted what we've done so far in a marvelous way--   But I think to tighten at this moment in time with nothing out there--   But I see the inventory thing just the opposite It seems to me that tightening is going to accumulate more inventories, not less inventories   Because you're going to slow down final demand   But it has occurred because our tightening has made sense to the markets   And this week is not the time to tell the markets we're tightening   That's right In other words, if we really went to $600 million and the existing fed funds rate reflects $600 million, I have no problem But my understanding is that Peter and Don have been following a $550 million target And if you change a $550 million target to $600 million, the best Fed watchers know that we've snugged Does anybody disagree with that? The best Fed watchers know we've snugged   They do   They already know we did The best watchers know we snugged And then [do we want] to do it again and to have them say we did it again with this timing and possibly the dollar where it is? I'm ready to go to $700 million when we need to or I'm ready to go to a discount rate change if we need to   You mean to say that staying at $550 million, which would maintain the existing arrangement, and having a telephone conference call in 2 weeks, or 1 week if we need to, is different from going wherever you want to go at that time--whether it's $600 or $650 or $700 million?   But, Peter, the question that I have here is If we stay at $550 million, will any reputable Fed watchers say we've loosened?   No, if we stay at $550 million, will any--   No, I want the answer to my question   Okay, I agree with your answer   50/50   15 percent   That's why I want to have a tilt policy   Well--   That's the reason we have a 12-member group-- because some people might see it differently   Well,--   Well, Frank, what are you going to do when the dollar is falling and the price of gold is soaring? And those things are there; then what do we do? Increase the discount rate?  -61-    6/29-30/88   I don't agree with that  SPEAKER(?) We have in previous meetings   We've always done it We've always done it slightly on this, on that, on a $50 million change   Slightly   Well, now, I could go with that   Say "about"? About what? How's that read?   But you're not going to like my explanation of my vote if you do it that way, because I'm going to say that the maintain wasn't what we did Otherwise, I can't explain my vote   Unless I tell something you don't want me to tell   Well, let's go to $565 million then   Slight is the proper word to go to $600 million   I would certainly support the Chairman's position, which is that the dollar strength may very well be a matter of days or weeks And it would be much better for us to make a move later if another move is needed It's really a long summer and it's a long year; we don't have to gain our credentials every day And it really isn't quite appropriate if we're going to have a borrowing target to let misperceptions concerning what we might do be validated It seems to me that we ought to be in charge rather than the markets being in charge And if we simply let ourselves get caught up in doing what the market might think or some participants might think, I believe that's unnecessary So, I'd support the Chairman's view of seeing where we go on the international front, and then if we need to, make some moves there We may need to make even more decided moves than we're thinking about now if the dollar were to come back off It    7/19/88  seems to me that once the dollar is seen as peaking, and having some downward vulnerability, it might gain quite a bit of potential there So, I'd prefer to follow the Chairman's view of waiting and staying with the $600 million   Well, I'm not a purist on intervention I think there are times when that certainly is constructive But I would believe that to intervene all the time is a good way of demonstrating that you have very little power and, thereby, you are not affecting in any way this perception of a two-way risk It seems to me that if central banks are willing to alter the basic scarcity of their currency they can do a great deal to influence its exchange value And if intervention is trying to coincide with central banks' willingness to do that, it can indeed give a perception of a two-way risk I find it particularly dissatisfying to have intervention to the level and the extent that we have done during this intermeeting period while at the same time we clearly wanted to decrease the scarcity of dollars in world markets I see no point whatsoever in demonstrating that we were unsuccessful They might find it out anyway without our so clearly making it evident   It seems everyone wants to comment about the drought Let me mention one item of caution, and that is that a drought has an impact not only upon the supply side of production, but also on the demand side And no one really knows whether or not the demand side effects are less than or greater than the impact upon the supply side So, I think I'd have to caution that there is a much larger segment of the US society that is affected by agriculture and the loss of rain It may affect behavior in regard to consumption as  -23-    8/16/88  well as durable goods expenditures So, I think there's some uncertainty here that needs to be kept in mind  In the second place, I think you have to remember that just as we have the drought-adjusted GNP figures for 1988, you're going to do the same process for 1989 We are looking at agricultural production in the grain area that is only at 73 percent of capacity; and that's going to go to 97 percent of capacity next year And you're going to have a dramatic move forward, because when you change the acreage reduction to qualify for government programs from 27-1/2 percent to 10 percent, you're getting more than that change in plantings because the higher price will induce some people not to play the game That is, there will be farmers who will leave the program restrictions altogether So there'll be an impact for GNP that is not a capacity or inflation induced impact that does need to be considered And the final thing I might mention about the drought is that no one really knows how much that bill they passed is really going to cost It has a lot of complexities in it, in regard to $50,000 and $100,000 limitations and whether the $100,000 encompasses other payments So there will tend to be, in some sense, probably less actual outlay than may have been anticipated   It could very well be less than $39 billion because no one has really done a microeconomic analysis regarding how many of the people who are supposed to receive the payments will be restricted by the caps And there will be some farmers who will reject the payments because they do not want to commit themselves to two years of crop insurance So, there are a lot of uncertainties there  I think that all of us would recognize that we have more strength [in the economy] right now than we would like to have And I would agree with Jerry that certainly the rate of inflation currently going on is unsatisfactory But it seems to me that that's an indication that our policy wasn't exactly what it should have been in previous periods Certainly, in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we did not have the monetary policy in place that in hindsight we would like to have had in place  I think we can learn something, however, by the impact of this discount rate increase and looking at the bond markets Now, I have looked at key markets because I think there's a lot of instruction there The bond market weakened, of course, as it always does when the discount rate increases It almost didn't for 30 minutes this time; the bond market almost tried to remain strong in the face of a discount rate increase, because there were some people there apparently at first who thought that the Fed's going to be tighter, so that improves the outlook for inflation   But it didn't take long for the normal stance to develop, which was that, after all, if the Fed did this drastic thing which wasn't expected--and, of course, it makes the markets a little angry for us to do something that they don't expect us to do--then things really must be worse than they anticipated And so we have a kind of feedback that, if we are not careful, impacts the bond market Now the equity markets, it seems to me, also reveal some indication about how monetary policy affects perceptions And I think the rate of real investment is not unrelated to equity market behavior It seems to me that in spite of the fact that you can't see everything you want to see, Lee, there's some evidence there to say that there's some restraint in place I think the foreign exchange markets also certainly can be expected to operate with feedback loops--from the bond market particularly And when the US bond market has a difficult period of time, then I think you'd expect foreign exchange markets to react to that My own view is that the foreign exchange markets will probably continue to be stronger than anticipated, and indeed, that's our primary policy mistake--that we did not stand against the foreign exchange depreciation which in a sense is behind [our having] a heavier growth path than we should have had  I think commodity prices also are showing some effect of monetary restraint And I don't know whether the rest of you have noticed it or not, but to me it's kind of pleasing to have M2 be on a 4 percent growth path; and maybe we'll get it down to 3 percent When you get ready to do your report, Don, I guess I want to find out what impact a 9-1/2 percent fed funds rate and a 10-1/2 percent rate will have on M2 growth Certainly, that seems to me to be a difference And I guess it's pleasing to me to see that when M2 growth got up to 8 percent and right above our target range that, policywise, we were able to turn that around and bring that down to an acceptable level Now I don't know whether 4 percent is right or 3 percent or 2 percent, but I guess I'm more confident than others are that if we stay with 4 percent or 3 percent or 2 percent on M2 growth that things will work out so that we'll all be happy with the inflation results down the pike   It depends on which index you're looking at   The Economist index is the highest year-over- year rate of increase of any index   Don, I appreciate your--   Well, fortunately, I get to ask the questions   Don, for the fourth quarter of 1988 and the first quarter of 1989, M2 growth was, I think you said, 4 and 3-1/2 percent Could you give me some confidence intervals on those estimates?   Do you want to give me the standard error of the estimates then on--   Well, give me just sort of a range   Oh, that's pretty narrow Okay   I don't mean to cast aspersions on your forecast, but that's pretty tight   Thank you   M2   But Don, you've got built back in some rebound in those   And you've got weakening in the reserve balance, so that's still accounted for in the forecast  -32-    8/16/88   The political perspective is quite different If someone said well, the Chairman moved the fed funds rate--   Absolutely    8/16/88   I agree with you that the markets, particularly the equity markets and to some extent the bond markets, did react in such a way as to indicate that a discount rate change is more than a $200 million change in borrowings It really shouldn't be, but it  -38-    8/16/88  does seem to be I would favor the $600 million I favor the increase in the fed funds trading range, that is 6 to 10 percent, to go with that I would also be most appreciative if there was support here for moving the behavior of the monetary aggregates up in the order [of the factors listed] in the operational paragraph I would prefer having it go to first place I could certainly settle for it being in second place In fact, if we said something like "the behavior of the monetary aggregates consistent with reductions in the rate of inflation"--that combination would seem to be very appropriate for me By that I don't mean that the growth rate of M2 in any one month ought to be a cause for a dramatic move What I would mean would be that if the 26-week rate of change of M2, for example, were to get below 3 percent, I suppose that to me would be significant   Asymmetric would be fine I would prefer symmetric, but I'd accept asymmetric If I can get monetary aggregates, I'll take it   Okay, so you mean you want to go to $700 million now and then to $800 million by the next meeting?   He's going to take it above, into number three   Yes   I think your resolution is fair   Yes   Well, it's close   We already have you down   Yes, Mike, I'd like a follow-up question to Governor Seger's questions Apparently, you have an optimum growth rate in mind, let's say, over the next four quarters What would that optimum growth rate be?   But, Mike, precision is helpful in communication I can take the time to pry the number out of you by asking you a series of questions, but it would save some time if you'd simply tell us   What would you think would be the optimum adjustment process? I mean, do you like 1-1/2 percent better than 2-1/2 percent?    9/20/88   But, Mike, there's a policy assumption involved in the interest rate forecast and I am just not sure whether you'd prefer 1-1/2 percent real GNP growth or a 1/2 percent GNP growth or a negative 1/2 percent I'd like to have some better understanding of what you think it would take in order to get this best adjustment   Thank you The last statement finally answered the question   Bob, it sounds like quite a bargain, doesn't it?   I'm very pleased with the present state of monetary policy and conditions in the economy That doesn't mean I like the 4 percent rate of inflation I just didn't believe that we could make the exchange rate adjustments that were so necessary to make--[along with] the rebound of oil prices from those lows and some rebound in wage rates from what I would call somewhat unsustainably low nominal rates--without having some temporary bounceback in the rate of inflation I have no reason to think that the staff's real economy forecast is not within the range of that which is likely I would tend probably to have a slightly higher net export figure, Ted-- closer to what you had in the June Greenbook than those that you have in today--but there's not enough there to argue much about I think if anything is different, consumer spending might be slightly softer, but it's very difficult to predict  The pleasing aspect of policy at this point in September 1988 is that, as far as I can see, we've returned the growth of the monetary aggregates to the pace that was occurring in 1987--and I thought the rate we had in 1987 was appropriate to provide a soft landing for the dollar And it's very encouraging to me to see that, after the monetary aggregates responded to the somewhat easier stance we maintained during the fall and winter, the aggregates have responded the way they have to our attempts to be serious about not letting M2 rise above the top of the target at the first of the year, even though we had a somewhat distorted base level And now it looks as if M2 is going to end the year in the fourth quarter below the midpoint and could very well be as low as 4-1/2 to 5 percent at the end of the year Don Kohn shakes his head a little bit at that I think we have to keep in mind the time lag between interest rate changes and response in those monetary aggregates  In June, as you may remember, I talked a little bit about the hint of changing commodity prices, and I think I was kind of reading tea leaves at that point But we've had further evidence that the monetary restraint in place is having an impact on commodity prices-- and even though we've had, it seems to me, a peaking of commodity price rises earlier in the year, the drought gave us a kind of a double-peak effect But the commodity price picture does look much improved I believe that the fight against inflation is a long one and one that we must sustain over a long period of time; and I would be willing, of course, to accept very low growth rates in the monetary aggregates, but I would really suggest that zero may not be desirable   Are there going to be questions?   Don, we have in the Bluebook, the M2 and other forecasted growth rates What happens in 1989 quarter 1 and quarter 2 with, let's say, alternative "B" and what would happen in quarter 1, quarter 2, and maybe in quarter 3 if you put in the staff's interest rate forecast?   Okay, that's fine; that's the most important   1989 over 1988?   Okay  -23-    9/20/88   So that means you need almost a 5 percent growth rate in the second half of the year to get 37?   Okay, so the 28 percent rate that you have for quarter 4 would tend to rebound in quarter 1   If we did not have other increases   And it could rebound to 4 or 4-1/2?   Thank you That's very helpful   Mr Chairman, I can certainly go with your suggestion I, too, believe that we're more likely in the intermeeting period to need to tighten than we are to ease, but I would not take that to mean that there's not some circumstances in which we might be surprised If there's a 60 percent chance that we would not need to make any move at all, and a 30 percent chance we might need to tighten, I think there are some circumstances that might develop--, that conditions might change in an economy with certain kinds of financial bankruptcies occurring and certain kinds of uncertainties But I can--   Okay   Mr Chairman, I certainly support the policy and would support the Open Market Committee agreeing to a release in this language I am reluctant to have us make as strong a statement as we do on devaluation It seems to me that it would be far better for them to pay the interest rates necessary in order to avoid the devaluation, which ultimately then can lead them to a position of falling interest rates because those interest rates coming down have to be in their long-run interest And I hesitate for us to get involved in the recommendation of a devaluation which once again simply rewards those who have held their money-capital outside the country and I think will reinforce that behavior So, it seems to me that interest rates in Mexico will have to be as high with devaluation as they will without   Well, I feel better, but I'd feel better yet if you said that the second part would be a further rise in interest rates   Well, if it gets to the place where the terms of trade problem becomes acute, then I would grant that that's a step that has to be taken I do not agree that devaluation as a technique of stopping capital outflows is a desired solution--   So, in effect, we're making this new term beginning next March run until December 31   Which seems to me is the appropriate way to do    11/1/88   Well, I'm delighted of course to see this impetus to the monetary aggregates because certainly I think all of us have known that our job in regard to long-run price stability has to be related to what we do in regard to facilitating money and avoiding getting too much money in the system The record of this year is of having M2 clearly appear to be running against our upper limits in the first quarter and our taking offsetting actions, and it seems to me that that was indeed appropriate We now have M2 below 5 percent on an annual growth rate basis over a 24-month period for the first time, I think, since 1962 And it seems to me that this does bolster that [unintelligible] and that view I would caution, however, that what I think Manley Johnson has been suggesting in regard to the short run, and that is if we make short-run mistakes and get the economy in a severe recession the problem with that is that you end up then not behaving well in regard to monetary aggregates So, I think this is indeed a very extraordinary development which bolsters those of us who want to see M2 raised [in importance] We just need one more step and that is to be sure to use commodity prices as some signal as to when to tighten the screws   But, Frank, the model doesn't say that   The model says the gap is still the other way   Mike, would you go back and reread that sentence where you said something to the effect that we've stretched out the acceleration of inflation It's back close to the very beginning You think we've stretched out the period of acceleration of inflation    11/1/88   No, no, I'm talking about stretched out--   Well, that's why I didn't understand why you would have said [what you did] when the Greenbook clearly shows--would you read it please?   Did you find it, Ted?   No, you were talking about price increases I'll go back and read through it   Do you agree that you said that you stretched out the rate of inflation in your forecast?   Yes, that's what I saw in the Greenbook and that's why you have the rate of inflation going down in the Greenbook In 1989 the fixed weight inflation index was down to 42 from 45 percent in 1988, which is lower by 3/10ths of a percentage point And the CPI fourth quarter over fourth quarter is 43 percent in 1989 versus 44 percent in 1988, and that's why I was surprised to hear you say that you've stretched out the acceleration of inflation   Even though your numbers show inflation going down, you said it's going up, that's all  SPEAKER(?) What about 1990?   I think I see an outlook that's every bit as strong as the staff would see it I don't have the slightest idea what interest rates might prevail over the period ahead, but it does seem to me that the economy shows a lot of resilience and a lot of signs of continued increase And it doesn't show any signs that the recent slowdown in money growth is being translated into anything which would be an expansion-ending event It seems to me that our economy has changed rather dramatically in the '80s from the '70s, that we are in a much more flexible wage-price arena than we had been in before Otherwise, it just wouldn't be true that we could have the kind of exchange rate adjustments of the dollar that we had and the kind of monetary growth paths that we had in 1985 and 1986 without it showing through into much higher rates of inflation than the year- over-year 41 percent that I think we're now seeing in CPI And it seems to me that that shows us that the environment has changed globally and that that has tremendous impact domestically  But we've had a lot of industries that have suffered rather severe shakeouts And people's memory gets to be long and so we have more attention in industrial America and in rural farm America concentrating on cost efficiencies than we did before And now given the present level of commodity prices, the present level of finished goods producer prices, crude industrial prices--those prices, it seems to me with this emphasis upon cost efficiency, provide ample profit margins to give us the kind of capital investment and the kind of continued expansion that I think we find is desirable for the economy Now, even though some commodity prices may have shown some response to the slower money growth, we haven't been having commodity prices that just do not show that And it seems to me that the back hasn't been broken in terms of this price cycle so that we can suggest the commodity price deflation such as began in 1984 and 1985 would reach the proportions that it did in, say, 1986  Now, I would agree that the one exception to that is oil, but there again in percentage terms we're not looking at the same kind of reductions they were looking at in that period And I would agree with Roger that the areas of US oil industry that have such difficulty finding oil resources, and where the output of oil is so low, are indeed going to experience some dramatic curtailment But I believe that will be more than offset by the [expansion] under way in agriculture Just the release of all these acres from the acreage control [program] means demand for more machinery; it means demand for more fuel; it means demand for more fertilizer So, we already have  -39-    11/1/88  under way a large acreage expansion of the agricultural industry which I think probably by itself offsets what's happening in oil Now, it just seems to me that a foreign exchange movement of the dollar [associated with] decided weaknesses would undoubtedly cause commodity prices to at least remain at these very, very high levels if not to accelerate And so it seems to me that the economy does have ample strength   But, Don, real GNP was negative in the second quarter of 1987   You support borrowing of $600 million?   You mean $600 million is the borrowing target?   Okay   I'm very sympathetic with Tom Melzer and Bob Black, and with Lee Hoskins's questions about money growth I think the 2-1/2 percent growth rate of M2 from September to December in alternative "B" is just fine I would be somewhat uneasy if we were to get lower growth than that I would not like to see those growth rates get down close to zero over a period of time because I believe that would cause some bounce-back If that low growth were to be the case, then I think we really ought to talk about it before the next meeting; that is, I think we ought to have a conference call On the other hand, if the aggregates begin to snap back faster than the staff is projecting, then I would want to be very alert to a possibility of tightening because I think where we are is just fine Now, I have to admit that what I'm saying is really consistent with symmetric language, not asymmetric And my caution would be that we use the appropriate language here; that is, I would like the market to learn that when we say we're asymmetric that we have a feeling that things are going to change I don't think that's the case here, and so I would slightly prefer--not enough to vote against an asymmetric directive--but I would slightly prefer to have it be symmetric Also, I think that when this directive is announced in December, if we haven't changed policy then the fact that we were symmetric won't even be noticed On the other hand, if we have tightened, nobody is going to care what we were at this point; and, in the unlikely event that we have to ease, we would look a little smarter So I think there's a fair case for symmetric language   Some of the rest of us might, too   What would be the pros and cons for choosing a $500 million borrowing target? What rate do you think might be associated with $500 million borrowing?   Would that be a real disadvantage from someone's point of view?   No, it's here   Well, it's been an interesting discussion over the years, and I've always said that you are analytically correct and it's good to have you and Don agreeing on that But there's a very important point that I think we have to keep in mind, and there's a very important reason that we do not want to target the federal funds rate explicitly The discount rate is now an announcement instrument And if we explicitly choose a federal funds target and we change that by 25 basis points, or change it by 12-1/2 basis points or 50 basis points, then that part of open market operations becomes an announcement target just like the discount rate is And I believe it's [unintelligible] to have two kinds of instruments, one instrument that we use that's subtle, that's not quickly understood and has the camouflage of market forces at work, and another policy instrument that's very clear and has an announcement effect So, I would never favor going to explicit federal funds targeting even though that is a way to accomplish exactly what we wish to accomplish It carries an announcement effect with it that I would not prefer What I would prefer doing, Don, is to examine quite a few options other than the existing options to accomplish the same kind of program and maybe some that might be able to accomplish it with some more regularity I've talked from time to time with you about a total reserves [target] and a scheduled total reserves which could give you whatever elasticity you choose A variant that we sometimes refer to as the [unintelligible] would in a sense give you a total reserve [target] with a cap on it on both sides But I think there are other ways we might explore without going to explicit federal funds targeting   Well, if we were to give the Desk, let's say, an explicit 8-5/8 percent funds rate to shoot for within a specified range, once you change that rate it's going to be known immediately in the market--as it was previously when explicit funds rate targeting was used   Are you suggesting you can have an explicit federal funds target--and nothing else--and that's the instruction in the directive, and not have the market perceive precisely that we have a fed funds target, and the market wouldn't know when we have a 25 basis point change?   Well, I'm saying that I prefer to have some arrangement to keep us from having explicit fed funds targets become apparent to the market and having some announcement effect whenever we change a fed funds target   What I'd like to see are some alternatives I'd like to have Don present us with some alternatives that give us means of accomplishing what we wish to accomplish in ways that might to some extent be more explainable between meetings without having to use exceptions quite as much   Of course, you're getting a 45-degree slope [unintelligible] function in there We do that in part   You're observing part of the variance in the funds rate and part of the variance in total reserves   Yes, and we could have whatever elasticity in that function we choose to have   Well, it seems to me that we should leave our present procedure in place until we decide on a better one  -17-    12/13-14/88   But we have a system for fixing it   I think your response to Governor Johnson's question is really a most interesting one But as I understood your response to the Chairman earlier, you did not indicate the dynamic of the exchange rate adjustment And so I presume you believe that if the interest rate increases were to come somewhat earlier and if possibly the economic slowdown that you have in 1990 thereby might occur, that the exchange rate adjustment might possibly be more inclined to occur during the period of slowdown than in a period in which we might have a disinflation or some commodity price deflation scenario Would you agree that that's one possibility?   So if the Committee, as the staff has interpreted it, is very serious in regard to inflation prospects and if that would then cause us to move interest rates somewhat more in the earlier portion of the two-year period, then it would, it seems to me, be possible that the exchange rate adjustment might take place in an environment that would be much different than for an exchange rate adjustment to take place in the current environment in which inflation is such a potential   But, Mike, you also have some adjustment on the food side, though, that offsets that do you not?   And that's why the change in oil doesn't then show as much worsening effect this time   I can understand the advantage of that, but it seems to me the disadvantage is that puts staff in a position of almost telling us what our job is And I think being that explicit has its disadvantages for the work of this Committee, even though I can understand why it would be helpful to Reserve Banks   It's appreciated; it's appreciated   What would happen in 1990, just taking the opposite view, if mortgage rates rose only 50 basis points while short-term rates were rising 200 basis points?   Well, what would that do to 1990's path?   Well, certainly, we wouldn't be in control of those rates Now, I suppose the manner and the timing in which rate increases might take place might affect [the outcome]   Thank you   I've been somewhat surprised that the slower money growth hasn't shown through in auction markets, both foreign exchange and particularly in the commodity markets M2 in the last four weeks over 24 months previously has grown I believe at a 47 percent rate which is the slowest growth rate over a 24-month period since 1961 I'm somewhat surprised that that hasn't shown through in auction makets, both foreign exchange and particularly commodity markets But it seems to me we clearly have had some upward shocks in those commodity prices, some of them due to the more rapid money growth that took place in 1985 and 1986, and I suppose the most recent round based somewhat on a weather-related condition But the fact of the matter is that commodity prices have plateaued; there have been some ups and some downs but there has not been a retrenchment from those levels that have given ample profit margins to induce we would hope further output But it would seem to me that the real key question here is whether we maintain a posture in which the profit margins are expected to be obtained by maintaining restraint on costs and getting cost reductions through economic efficiencies by the use of some new capital and new techniques, or whether some of these higher commodity prices that have not yet passed through it seems to me to the entire consumer-price structure are going to be maintained at this level long enough until that takes place So, it seems to me that given the fact that inventories are not in a position yet where there has been any inventory holding based upon price expectations, at least it doesn't seem to be clear there that we do have extreme vulnerability at this time to foreign exchange rate adjustments that might I think translate immediately into an inability to bring those commodity prices into line as to where they ought to be I don't mean to put too much emphasis upon gold, and yet it's just somewhat representative of what I think happens here As you know the price of gold did move down from $500 to $400, but there certainly has been ample evidence that the price would have the tendency to move back to the $420 range It just seems to me that as the first of the year moves along for us and we get some return of growth in demand deposits, Don, that the opportunity cost changes that are already in place may not be sufficient to give us the further restraint on monetary growth I'm still going to continue to believe that if we do get that restraint on monetary growth that we will get a better solution than some anticipate But it's far better for us to be in tune to these problems at this point in time than to wait and get behind the curve   Bob, it seems amazingly warm to me   Please don't [unintelligible] suggest outside this room   I won't use all my arguments about a discount rate increase now because I've already made them to the Board And the Board members understand my view very well on that I would comment, Ed, that it seems to me in the environment that we are in now that there is a substantial difference between a discount rate increase and an increase in the federal funds rate through open market operations   And the difference is that you are indicating you want rates to be higher and one reason to have a higher discount rate is that you would encounter I think increasing difficulty of managing borrowing at the discount window at $600 million, given Don's surveys of where banks' reluctance to come to the window may be I think that we have a somewhat more stable borrowing target at $300 million or $400 million than I think we would have at $600 million or $700 million And I would want the discount rate to be high enough not to have to have what I would call a more unpredictable borrowing target Now, my view is that whatever we do is going to have some announcement effect We are not going to make a move after this meeting and have everyone say they didn't understand what the Federal Reserve did By next Tuesday or Wednesday, no one will ask whether we have moved or haven't moved In this scenario we are talking about, everyone is going to know that we moved So, there is going to be an announcement effect And the discount rate is not ringing the gong; the discount rate is a regular procedure that you use when you want to tighten policy, when you want higher interest rates And those higher rates will be consistent with slower money growth So, I'm clearly in camp "C" Now, I'm in camp "C" because I believe very strongly that the chances of our getting into recession are much less by taking the action that needs to be taken to give us some chance to have some scarcity of money which will show up in some commodity prices and in exchange rates and show up to give some expectations The thrift  -57-    12/13-14/88  industry is going to be much [unintelligible] for us to deal with this as the Board dealt with it in 1984, and it's more difficult to deal with it now than in 1984 because the economy is further along But if we wait until the end of 1989 or the middle of 1989 to get into this and if Jerry's staff is right in their inflation forecast and if inflation gets away from us, that's the recession scenario, that's how you're going to buy the recession I'm convinced that there's no immediate danger to the real economy at this stage And I think it's a little more above board and will be clear in everyone's mind as to where we are if we do it in a very solid manner So, I favor "C" and I, of course, would prefer to do it with a discount rate increase rather than doing it with a $600 million borrowing target   That's "B" without any change in borrowing?   It would seem to me the Chairman said either then or before then as I heard it   The Board meets regularly   Oh, okay   I think that's a satisfactory solution   It should be 7 to 11  SPEAKER(?) We are going to be up 50 basis points   Well, we've never done that We've had successive moves   Why narrow the range?   Well then, we are going to have to do that every time we have a move,   Well, I know it, that's why--   Bob, I think the reason you have trouble with that is the same reason that I have trouble--because there is a basic inconsistency in the whole process, which makes all the results backwards to me And that is, the faster money growth that you have there should be associated with a higher value of the dollar rather than the opposite In other words, what we have here is the use of a construct that says in order to keep things the same you grow M2 at a faster rate And by strange reasoning if you grow M2 at a faster rate you'll have a lower value dollar   So, that makes everything backwards for those of us who had seen that relationship as the [unintelligible] one   Mike, I guess I'm a little surprised at the food inflation in '89 and '90, given normal crops and normal weather, because with the decrease in set-asides ordinarily food price inflation in the year after the drought should be lower than in the year before the drought   I would have thought that somewhere there should be a downward move in food prices--offsetting the '88 upward move--in order for that historical relationship to hold true   I'm sorry, I thought it was 4 percent but maybe I'm wrong    2/7-8/89   Well, because of this discussion, I now hope that the rainfall is normal so we can find out who's right But that's my only reason for wanting normal weather   It seems to me that the most noteworthy development in the US economy has been the slow growth of the money stock--no matter what measure you use--over the last two year's time Having watched those figures for many, many years it seems rather unusual to have--if you take the staff's forecast through February, for example--the growth rate [of M2] over a two-year period at an annual rate of about 43 percent The growth rate over the last full year was about 43 percent and the growth rate over the last half year was about 3 percent I just have never seen such stable money growth of M2 in years of observing it I recall that in 1986 there was considerable talk about whether or not the fast money growth was actually going to offset the deflationary experience that we had I think there were quite a few of us who believed that it would Maybe it took a while to do it but when it did, it did it with a clear impact upon both exchange rates and commodity prices This time around it seems to me that the flow of money growth is being reflected in exchange rates much more rapidly, of course, than it is being reflected in commodity prices It has been a very puzzling experience As Don and Ted very well know, my own view is that if we continue with growth of the money stock as we are forecasting, the problem we may have in that environment--with regard to exchange rates--is too strong a dollar But I would think that that dollar strength, in terms of overall economic developments, might provide the slack needed; that might very well be the antidote that is needed Even though the drought maybe added not so much to the grain prices but somewhat more to the vegetable and fruit prices, it seems to me that the impact of the drought on commodity prices has delayed any turning point signal by commodity prices It looks to me as if we're now getting a leading signal in commodity prices in that we're finally getting a declining rate of change I don't mean by that that I think monetary policy ought to be adjusted because, indeed, unless commodity prices come down from the level where they now are I think we're quite likely to build in a much higher rate of inflation in the wage patterns that prevail The only way to escape that is probably by having some decline in commodity prices But I guess I'm somewhat encouraged by the trend of substitutes, such as ownership of other  -15-    2/7-8/89  currencies or ownership of gold Frankly, I would feel still better if the price of gold reaches $350 an ounce   Don, I noticed and was pleased that your long- run strategies really were based on M2, with hardly any discussion of M3 or nonfinancial debt Have you and your staff given specific thought to dropping the M3 targeting?   Mr Chairman, I think I should stop now; otherwise, it probably wouldn't seem like a question   But that would be nice   Martha, this is the first time I've ever heard anyone here act as if Mr Greider in The Secrets of the Temple has the right notion   I also favor the 3 to 7 percent, although I think one could make a case in the other direction The reason that I would stay at 3 to 7 percent is that it seems to me there is some chance--I don't know whether the probability is 20 percent or what, but there is some chance--that we will encounter a commodity price deflation during 1989 or 1990 If that occurred we might very well have short-term rates of 9-1/2 percent and long-term rates of 8  -33-    2/7-8/89  percent And I don't know how the monetary aggregates would respond in that environment Don, do you know what would happen? We would get a slightly faster growth if we had that kind of twist, would we not?   Well, I don't know when and I don't know whether; I'm just suggesting that possibility And it seems to me that it's very important that we not get in the position of having to increase those ranges I do believe that long-run price stability does require us at some point in time to move down to 2 to 6 percent and maybe eventually to 1 to 5 percent But I really believe we [should] get there by a slow and progressive, sound, patient stance-- not by one which in a sense tries to whipsaw the events So, I believe there's a great deal of merit in our staying with the 3 to 7 percent I would remark in regard to M3 that I believe that the 4 percentage point range that we now have provides ample room for the Committee to engage in its monetary policy actions As far as I'm concerned, having multiple aggregates is simply a way of not being accountable I can understand why the Federal Reserve at first did not want to be accountable in regard to having too narrow a focus But I think it's misleading because I don't hear anyone who says that they believe M3 is all that superior to, say, Ml I do believe that we watch and monitor M1 and I'd prefer just to monitor M3   Here comes M2a   But don't jump to the conclusion that all the $100,000 money is going to go, because with the present spread between $100,000 jumbo CDs and the others it is still lower cost money for institutions who really look at the brick and mortar costs of raising the other kind of CDs So it's not all going to go in that--   Mr Chairman, I would also like to be included among those who prefer a kind of strategy "II" with a 3 to 7 percent range That is, it does seem to me that it's important for us to create expectations that--if conditions unveil as the staff has forecast--we do anticipate staying very close to the bottom of the range   Yes, I think that's a good idea   Well, we could say "The behavior of all the monetary aggregates will be evaluated"   But do we want to say "The behavior of all the monetary aggregates will be evaluated in"   Right   I guess I wonder why we're saying "establish" We've never "established" Why wouldn't it be appropriate to say that we lowered the ranges?   We don't say we've lowered the ranges, do we? This is the first time that we've really officially lowered the 1989 ranges   Well, those July ranges were just tentative   I like that   Mr Chairman, there's one other phrase that I'd like to call to the Committee's attention--the very last phrase that Norm read--"and the nature of emerging price pressures" That statement, it seems to me, is a very defensive statement I would prefer that to read "and progress toward price level stability"   "And progress toward price level stability"   I think it has the finishing--   I buy that, too   But that's not a commitment to fed funds rate targeting is it?   I've never gone last   I've never gone last yet   Yes The staff's forecast, as I understand it, is for a funds rate 150 basis points higher in the fourth quarter of 1989 than in the fourth quarter of 1988 Is that about right?   A year from now If that does turn out to be the path that we end up on, it seems to me that it would be somewhat desirable somewhere in there to have a discount rate move I would not share Roger's enthusiasm for a discount rate move not showing through I tend to prefer to have discount rate moves really show through the full amount when we do them So it seems to me that's an alternative that ought to be looked at I do not favor that now, even though I favored that in November and December; to me it's a question of timing And I just don't quite understand how matters of weeks are that significant in regard to the long-run impact on inflation Most of what we know about inflation suggests that it takes quite a while for it to show through Indeed, if our analysis of commodity prices is correct at all, we really can expect the CPI turning point some 7 to 9 months after we get a turning point in commodity prices And any turning point in commodity prices at this point is somewhat tentative; it is not in the bag So, I think we have a period ahead of us that's going to be a period of some travail I don't know where I'm going to be at the end of the month I would prefer, Jerry, to tighten when we  -59-    2/7-8/89  have some lack of super-strength in the dollar It seems to me that it would be somewhat more desirable to get our economy, in a nominal GNP sense, to slow down by domestic [factors] rather than to get it done by a lack of improvement of the external [side] So, I believe it's important that all of us keep something of an open mind as to where we are at the time of the telephone conference call I know I'm going to And if the conditions are such that we can make a move at that time--and we're getting closer to impacting the second quarter's money growth rather than the first quarter's money growth--and it would appear that we're not running the risk of driving M2 to zero, then that's the time to do it I believe it's a long-term patience struggle It is clear that I am more confident than some that the monetary restraint, if in place, is the real measure I just do not know when interest rates are high or when they are low; I do feel very confident about our maintaining a 3 percent growth path for M2 And I'll be prepared under those conditions to vote restraint if it appears that is what's necessary to keep M2 growth at the bottom of the range Thank you So, my vote is yes for "B"   Two? I thought it was the end of the month   Look, I don't think we ought to be trying to pin [the Chairman down] If something happens and the Chairman agrees we ought to have a conference call before the end of the month I think he ought to call one before the end of the month It seems to me this is asymmetric language and asymmetric language should give the Chair some freedom between now and a conference call   I nominate Alan Greenspan--unless it is already set Do you have someone set to make the motion?   Okay Alan Greenspan and Gerald Corrigan   Would there be some notion as to where we might be going in regard to any one currency? That is, would there be any restraint or any notion that there might be some point at which we would acquire more of a particular currency than might be the most advantageous position for our asset holdings?   So from time to time you would expect to report to the Committee on [individual] currency holdings as compared to what you might think of as some optimum range?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Well, it really isn't an exotic hedging strategy; it's an exotic speculative strategy, I think You really have to distinguish between an exotic speculative strategy and an exotic hedging strategy There's quite a difference   But anyone who finds the hedge [unintelligible] They just have to have more expertise than that So, I think they were taking a position   My sense is that consumer spending in the United States is rather gradually coming into line with what needs to happen Maybe some of this is interest-rate induced; maybe some of it is demographics; maybe some of it is actually the impact of higher prices and higher interest rates on budgets In many ways that looks like a 1 to 2 percent growth rate of consumption, which seems to me is exactly what we would like to see happen And it seems to me that this happens in an environment that's not very prone to a recession When I look at inventories and at the factors that ordinarily lead to recession I just do not see the economy going into recession in the foreseeable future, and I guess that would take us through the first quarter of 1990 I recognize it's a narrow path to have this slowdown in consumer spending without overshooting and getting a recession out of it But it does seem to me that that's still a possibility Hindsight, it seems to me, would say that some of us who watch commodity prices didn't say as much about it as we should have said, but there is a clear indication that year-over-year rates of change in commodity prices have been moderating But they have been plateauing in a very, very slow manner Of course, we had the November-December spike in which the world food situation began to be somewhat more clear to the people that follow it We saw food and fiber prices [rise] in November and December We've had a year-over-year increase of 42 percent in the price of wheat; the price of wheat is almost 80 percent of its high, which occurred back in 1974 And that's a price that really is very conducive to increased production worldwide The weather situation is, of course, a very clear one; and it gets interpreted into those commodity prices very, very rapidly I suppose some things could go wrong but I guess I'm comforted, Tom, by the 2 percent M2 number Given the price pressures that are there, I couldn't be more satisfied with any M2 growth that I can think of than what we're getting I suppose it does run some risk of being that close to the precipice But I think it would be riskier still if we were going along with growth of M2 at a much more rapid pace  -32-    3/28/89   Mr Chairman, I agree with your view in regard to a pause, so I would go with alternative B also I have a slight preference for being symmetric but not for operational reasons It's simply that I believe if we are symmetric and we need to take that next step--and I think there is at least a 50/50 chance that that's the case--we can do it with symmetric language But if it happens that we don't need to take that move, we just look a little wiser by hindsight I don't know whether that impresses anyone or not   We can call it M2t   You say yes   But the growth rate of the monetary aggregates has not narrowed   Mr Chairman, I would--   I was just going to make a motion; maybe you don't want a motion   Okay   I move it, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, it seems to me this is an issue in which dogmatic views really aren't that helpful It seems to me we're going to deal with questions here as a matter of practicality We are working with the Administration, and I'm somewhat pleased that we have an Administration that's willing to have some kind of exchange rate intervention versus one that says absolutely not Sam, I would like a little better accounting--that is, I believe for our purposes you ought to keep track of the opportunity costs of those balances and not    5/16/89  consider the entire gain to be in a sense out of the blue, because we would have had earnings on US Treasury balances Is that not correct?   So, it seems to me that the opportunity costs should be subtracted out Now, I would say that I believe--as some of you know by my no vote last June--that exchange rate intervention ought never to go at cross purposes with monetary policy I think it's always a mistake because we're going to demonstrate our ineffectiveness in one camp or the other any time we do that It seems to me that there is some merit in going forward with this move because there are some necessary adjustments in monetary aggregate growth rates that will take place That would mean, then, that the deutschemark interest rates would tend to move up relative to our own so the relative opportunity cost it seems to me is not unusually high So, I support the proposal   Well, I'm very sympathetic with President Hoskins' views and yet at the same time it seems to me that there's no particular disadvantage of having an international trade adjustment process in which United States exports grow more rapidly than our imports grow I can't see that that's a disadvantage Consequently, I favor having a bit of a gesture in the foreign exchange market prior to the time in which the needed change in monetary aggregate growth rates will emerge--because I have no doubt that the Bundesbank has a serious problem on its hands in regard to how fast they have been growing the monetary aggregates and that they will have to bring those in check But it seems to me that it's somewhat to our advantage to have a divergence in these growth rates at this time I'm convinced that the real moves will take place in terms of interest rates and their conversion into monetary aggregate growth rates It's in that atmosphere that I don't mind our taking a bigger step   On that $15--   Well, Jerry, if you keep saying it, some day you'll be right!   Normally, it will start the first of June but this year it's going to be a little later--probably around the second week in June   Well, actually, they start around the south of Wichita first   Yes, and it moves in a line to the northwest   I agree with those who like what they see in terms of the conditions that are out there right now It is good news to have consumer spending running at a much lower level and to have more room for the hoped-for capital spending and for exports It's a little scary to me to see that we're in a place that we'd like to be; it's scary because you ask yourself how we got there And you say we got there by slowing down But I don't think we're that good that we can actually pin it down just exactly as to what we might want to have on consumer spending So, rather than look at the far out [time horizon] I would look at the monetary aggregates at this stage I think they are our best guide in terms of where we may be in 5 to 6 months Restraint is indeed the proper course, but it probably ought to be a measured restraint not an increasing restraint Increasing restraint, if shown by continued deterioration of the growth rates of those monetary aggregates, I think can increase the risks I don't think that exists now but it could be there in the near future I just do not recall, Don, seeing any item like checkable deposits year- over-year being negative I just do not recall the possibility that Ml, if it remains soft for another month, could also be flat for an entire year I just do not recall M2 declining as much as it has declined and then, in a sense, having the bottom drop out of it in the tax-paying season All that, it seems to me, would say that there's a high degree of risk in letting those aggregates deteriorate further And we ought to be mindful of that We ought to avoid extremism on that which we know about rather than worry so much about that which we do not know about It seems to me that declining monetary aggregates in the face of an economy that shows some signs of slowing actually could give you a tightening of monetary policy while interest rates appear to be stable You can have stable interest rates and a tightening of policy in that kind of environment And I think we need to be cautious in that regard because the long-run inflation problems are indeed great and we need to be able to maintain a posture of slow growth into the future But the way to do it is not to get caught up in the extremism of letting the monetary aggregates fall out of bed So that's what I want in terms of caution   On Chart 11, Don, is the V* your long-run V*?   If you take the short-run V*--   I guess I'm surprised that you used the long run rather than the shift adjusted one From the staff study I thought there was a slight preponderance of evidence on the side of the shift adjusted Didn't the numbers come out a little more accurate on the shift adjusted?   In the monetary aggregates   Yes   Yes   Okay Well, I heard the answer   Thank you The second question, Don, relates to the bounceback in M2 that you're forecasting on Chart A, which seems to me ample, or maybe strong If it did not turn out that way, or if the second half was by and large a continuation of the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range, would you have a different policy prescription than you do with the present forecast?   No, no   But you really expect this phenomenon to begin to show itself in the next three to four weeks, is that correct?   Oh, I understand   I would agree with that Thank you   Well, the Greenbook is "B," "B," "C," "C"   Yes, I wanted to ask a question in regard to the aggregates I agree with your position You used the word "evidence" --evidence that the money growth is coming back I don't think we have any evidence yet and--keying on Governor Seger's suggestion--I'm wondering whether we could make that adjustment from the $500 million to $600 million with some discretion on the part of the Chairman as those numbers come in Would that be a problem, Don?   Well, my view on the aggregates is that the problem with the aggregates is right now If we're ever going to be concerned about the aggregates we should be concerned right now I don't know whether they are going to come back or not come back; if growth does come back I'm going to feel very comfortable If they come back as much as you suggest I think I'm probably going to want to restrain them too But--  -39-    5/16/89   You think the markets would interpret our staying at $500 million as an easing?   But then, Mr Chairman, let me ask you another question Do you believe that under a symmetric directive, if the aggregates do not come back, that you would not hesitate to have a conference call or to act?   Okay; on that basis I agree   What is this new deal you're introducing?   Intervention   Well, Mr Chairman, we did in January of '88   I think the markets don't have to worry that one move is necessarily a great--   "Somewhat/would"   It seems to me we have never used "slightly" with symmetric [language]   So, I suggest that we not introduce that nuance Let's stay "somewhat/would" balanced   Mr Chairman, I understand your desire to have some consensus but I'm bothered by a principle that I hope we don't have to be caught with It seems to me that historically the Federal Reserve tends to be slow in terms of changing the direction of policy It's always easy, it seems, to get policy [continuing] in one direction, and I don't like the principle that if we have four people who don't want to move that that means we can't move If a minority can prevent a change, then that stacks the deck exactly in the wrong direction in regard to previous Federal Reserve errors   Mr Chairman, I understand your wishes and I accede to your wishes I do suggest, however, that for some of us having to wait until we have an employment number before making a monetary policy move is just-- I just find it impossible to associate myself with a monetary move that seems to have to wait until an employment figure comes out   Oh, I see   All right, fine   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your move It seems to me that we do not always know whether the given level of restraint is in place or not And when we begin to have undershoots in regard to money, it just seems to me that it's the prudent thing to do to let some of that show through on the interest rate side so that all of the miss doesn't show up on the reserve side I have never    6/5/89  seen a clearer signal in regard to money growth--also incorporated by turning commodity prices and foreign exchange auction markets as well as the action of the bond market--that would indicate such a clear view as to what seems to be happening Now, I will grant that these money numbers may change, and commodity prices may change, and foreign exchange markets may change But if all of these were to transpire, Mr Chairman, I would be just as eager to be out front in supporting a reversal or a continuation of what was there as I am to support this I believe this is an appropriate move   Sam, to what extent did you use banks to execute the orders in such a manner that the market would not have immediately recognized it as a central bank order?   Do you think you were able to buy more cheaply by buying discreetly than if you had bought openly? Did you buy the portfolio--   Well, Mr Chairman I would make a comment I just do not agree that it's appropriate for us to act in ways that are intended to confuse the markets or mislead the markets I believe that markets work best when all participants have information as to what's going on I am not a strong believer [in the view] that it made the difference because you did it in a discreet fashion lately My guess would be that if you had operated discreetly during the previous period and you operated openly during this period you'd have found out that an open way would have worked in a better fashion I just don't hold that these kinds of moves make that much difference But even if they did, I do not believe it's appropriate for a government agency in a market society to be acting in such a manner It's not appropriate for us; I believe it opens up the possibility for the charge of someone privately benefitting from what we do So, Mr Chairman, I would register not a dissent from the actions but an indication that if that were to continue I think I would have to object   Well, when we operate in securities transactions at the foreign Desk in what I would call the normal manner that we use at the open market Desk we would be indicating to a group--to more than one participant--what the Fed is doing And they could all have a chance to participate When you start choosing one bank to be your agent it seems to me it opens up possibilities   Well, yes And we have--   I prefer to be operating in markets in which self interest is assumed to be the motivating factor for the parties we're dealing with rather than to be operating under the assumption that someone is going to be behaving in the manner that suits our interests and that might be against their own self interest   Well, in addition to the possibility of something occurring that would give an impression of being inappropriate--in regard to a favorable opportunity for one bank or one trader--I still would hold that it's always best to let markets know what it is we're doing and to try to buy at the best price And it seems to me that buying at the best price--   Well, I realize that a bully has more clout at times than does someone who plays according to the rules But central banks have considerable power And it seems to me they should operate in an open and clear fashion that gives participants access to information in a timely manner and does not seek to confuse My view, Mr Chairman, is that operating as we did tended to disrupt the normal market processes, including the price of gold And I think it was unnecessary and undesirable That's all I have to say   Very similar   And certainly we don't want to do that   Of course, Mr Chairman, my comments had nothing to do with any displeasure whatsoever in regard to the size of the intervention Even though I'm willing to talk about Mr Hoskins' point, I fully support our objectives in the sense that I support them as a part of the market stabilization effort as distinguished from a market disruptive effort   Yes, I want to express appreciation to both Mike and Ted for the chart show Whether anyone agrees or not, I thought it showed very well the total package of what you're expecting It was particularly helpful to me to have those alternatives that both of you presented I found it very helpful  -14-    7/5-6/89   In looking at the current situation, it does seem clear that there has been some change of patterns Of course, a lot of this is very, very good Those of us who would like to see the trade balance corrected without a depreciating technique would believe  -28-    7/5-6/89  that that's the only way that we're going to get to our primary [objective] of stable prices We're going to have to have a stable dollar to do that And certainly the slowdown in consumer spending is an integral part of that success The only problem is whether anyone believes that you can take consumer spending from a 3 or 3-1/2 percent range and cut it in half and somehow or other just automatically stop there; I think there's some uncertainty about that I don't know whether Mike will be pleased to note that there is at least one individual on the Committee who is on the other side in regard to the consumer spending issue Mike, I'm looking for decidedly slower real consumer spending than the Greenbook And I note that I'm the only one, I guess, who is on that side You've heard a lot of others on the other side So, it helps to get you closer to the middle, Mike, for me to take that position The reason that I believe consumer spending was slow in the second quarter and had slowed below what we had in the first quarter and below what I think the Greenbook says for the second quarter relates to a very logical follow-up of a set of developments One is that we have had extremely slow money growth over such a long period of time that there is not the kind of liquidity out there to support what has turned out to be inflation in the discretionary consumer spending area If you only have 10 to 15 percent of consumer income that is discretionary spending, you don't have to [unintelligible] to begin to make a decided difference When we have reports that we not only have the unexpected estimated income taxes in April but we also seem to think the money stock was showing that, then that seems to go along also with some adjustments in terms of consumer behavior It wasn't so long ago that during April tax paying times it was somewhat more noted as to how much borrowing might be utilized to facilitate the income tax effect rather than some sense of drawing down money balances Stop and think about marginal tax rate changes and the lack of deductibility of some interest rates, including the lack of deductibility of borrowing money to pay your income taxes; that causes the after tax interest rate to be decidedly higher than it had been before It seems to me quite logical, then, that you'd get some differences in this kind of environment in personal household saving rates And that, together with certain maybe overpublicized demographic factors, it seems to me leads us to a different kind of behavior--which of course is exactly what we've been wanting  So, I don't think we need to grieve too much about getting the exact same results that we were after We wanted to slow money growth down because we didn't want to revive the liquidity that would be necessary in a sense to accommodate these inflation pressures that I think all of us knew would be forthcoming--given the import price side and the energy price and the other commodity price effects, some of which stemmed from last year's drought So all in all, it seems to me it's very logical for consumer spending to be low and for it to stay low Now, when you add to that what's happening to housing, there are enough communities in the United States where the housing market has changed so that the wealth effect of this change in housing must necessarily, it seems to me, show through in regard to spending patterns for consumers So, I'm bold enough to have consumer spending growth rates only about half of those the staff is projecting And yet I end up getting, I think to Mike's embarrassment, almost exactly the same real GNP numbers that Mike had   Oh, you welcome me! Well, [unintelligible] we're both probably wrong, but for different reasons Nominal GNP, it seems to me, is not going to be able to be as expansionary as has been predicted I just so believe that the monetary slowdown will show [unintelligible] on nominal GNP So I tend to be optimistic in that regard; that's why I have [forecast] what I would call a rather nice expansion But if I'm wrong on that and inflation runs about as Governor LaWare thinks it will, then I don't think there's any room, and I think there are considerably more downside risks But I'm going to remain somewhat optimistic   Yes, I would not want to change the '89 ranges   Second   I'm very sympathetic to Bob Black's perspective for the long run It seems to me that we do want to get those ranges for M2 down to 1 to 5 percent A 1 to 5 percent range is where we have to be in order to be even close to credibility in regard to price level stability If we mean that, it just seems to me that's where it has to be I do believe, however, that we ought not to back up That is, I want to see us only lower ranges and never raise them And, with Don's report, I believe that it would be prudent for us for 1990 to keep the 3 to 7 percent range It seems to me that we will once again have a period in which the expectation will be for rising interest rates, and that's when we ought to go down another leg to 2 to 6 percent So, Mr Chairman, I prefer the long-run strategy II, which is very conservative But I prefer alternative II for 1990, because I'm not willing to go down and then exceed it on the top side If there's one thing that I feel very strongly about after 3-1/2 years here, it is that whenever we have erred on the extremes on M2 growth,  -35-    7/5-6/89  with 9 percent M2 growth and 2 percent M2 growth--even though we may say M2 growth, V2 doesn't give us precision--we have been buying a little lack of stability So, my preference is alternative II with a commitment to getting to 1 to 5 percent before my term is over   Alternative II lowers M3 and debt   The fourth quarter to December would be what?   Well, it'd probably be about 4-1/2 percent on alternative A to December Is that about right?   If you maintain that you're going to get more kick   But, Don, there is a possibility that the sucking down of those balances was abnormal in April and May and that there was some bounceback effect So, it seems to me that there's some uncertainty as to whether or not that 6-1/2 percent [growth] will be maintained   But you expect that to be consistent with [a funds rate of] 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent?   Yes, I concur with that policy; I believe that a borrowing range associated with a 25 basis point move at this point in time is the most prudent We really have been very fortunate, it seems to me, that the market has given us so much credibility that long-run rates have moved to where they have moved And it seems to me that we should have the objective of somehow or other getting at least the soft landing in the housing industry and that's most clearly done with long rates, not with short rates It just seems to me that fixed mortgage rates need to be in the single-digit area in order for us to have the soft landing Now, for those who may wonder how this fits with price level stability, I will share with you the commodity price annual rates of change charts that I've been following very, very carefully As you can see, those smooth rates of change have had a very flat top on them; so I've been hesitant to call what I would say is a forecast of a downturn in the CPI year-over-year rate of change But unless I'm totally wrong, the CPI year-over-year rates of  -52-    7/5-6/89  change between now and October are going to be declining And it's encompassing that that would permit me to want to--   I'm aware of those technical changes and that's why I have such a low forecast for the CPI in the second half But I did want [others] to be aware of the fact that some of that is a one- time deal and will not necessarily follow through But the work that Peter Von zur Muehlen has been doing--and he will have a working paper for the American Ag-Econ Association and the US Department of Agriculture meeting in Baton Rouge, Florida later this month--has shown that these smooth commodity prices have been very significant in regard to forecasting changes or peaks in the CPI And that's what I guess I'm staking my reputation on that the CPI will respond   I never stake my reputation without some other help like that!   No, I don't think--   Yes, I feel confident that that will take place But we have to understand that changing the growth of the money stock does show up in these commodity prices It took a while for those slow money growth rates to show up but now they are showing up And I think that's encouraging What we want to avoid, it seems to me, is the risk of too severe a slowdown, which would then be followed by overdoing it in regard to money growth rates on the up side So, I think caution is the right word And I expect the markets to be stabilized somewhat by less than maybe the markets expect And then I think we need to take another look Now, I would prefer asymmetric language just because--as you know, in March I thought we should have been symmetric and in May I thought we should have been asymmetric-- remember, these minutes are released 6 weeks from now So, I think it's better to have the 6-week release make us sound a little smarter than it does when we're so reluctant to move in a direction on the symmetry that I think is needed It's not going to show up now,  -53-    7/5-6/89  anyway; and if it turns out that we are wrong we will have demonstrated that we didn't make any moves But I favor your proposal   Mr Chairman, before you go to the go-around I'd like to have reactions to another suggestion, and that is It seems to me that "indications of inflationary pressures" is a defensive posture that was appropriate during the period that we knew we were going to be giving ground on inflation I would rather have a more positive  -56-    7/5-6/89  statement in the wording such as "progress toward price stability" rather than "indications of inflationary pressures"   Well, Mr Chairman, the reason I raise it now is because you're about to prepare your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony And I was thinking in terms of that testimony as well as this directive, which is going to be published six weeks from now At this point in time the chances of our avoiding too significant a turndown, I think, depend upon our credibility; and I think that stronger language to a price level commitment will help the long-bond market more That's the reason I raise it now   Well, I guess I don't understand what you object to in terms of progress toward price stability   Well, can someone think of some other language that somebody doesn't object to?   "Indications of inflationary pressures" seems like a resistance approach In other words, if inflation pressures don't get any worse it seems like maybe that's what we're after   That's exactly what we've done   But I would hold that when you look at the M2 growth path over the last 30 months this is an unprecedented M2 growth path for 30 months in the history of M2 We have never had a 30-month period of growth this low and this stable And we've got time [lags] So, it seems to me that we are going to have the burdens and the pain is going to show You don't get there cheap I guess I'm somewhat more optimistic in regard to what the record is than you are   I'll be satisfied to do it next meeting   You want to take it to two, then?   How many did you throw out on both sides to get the central tendency?   Three on each side?   Sam, I'd like to get your personal view concerning two scenarios in regard to the exchange value of the dollar Over the next six months, if US interest rates remain largely where they are now, what would happen? Alternatively, what would happen if we had a somewhat substantial decline of, say, 100 basis points over the next six months?   I don't quite understand your answer in comparison with what your report said Your report seemed to indicate that during July and August there seemed to be quite a difference in perception about what direction US interest rates might go Now, you don't think that would be very significant in the next six months if there was--?   No, I don't know of anyone who thinks it's simply the interest rates   I was more interested in the constant interest rate scenario than I was in the falling interest rate scenario Thank you   Okay, that's the response that I was looking for In other words, you think that if the perception in the marketplace were that we would have no further interest rate declines, that would tend to be somewhat bullish for the dollar   Well, that offends my sensibilities   Well, Mr Chairman would it not be possible to have a telephone conference call and do it that way? Then it would be on the record It just seems to me--   Fine   Yes   That satisfies me, yes   But if we take the vote, the minutes published [after] the next meeting would include the vote, then   I think it's appropriate that we be somewhat pleased with the outcome of policy over the past few years I'm sure it is no surprise to many of you that I had some strong disagreements in the first half of 1987 concerning monetary policy; but since that time it seems to me we have really put it together about as well as we might have expected, or better than we might have expected On that matter [we've met] our highest expectations Now, I've had a running friendly disagreement with some of our staff over some elements in the composition [of the forecast], but I don't disagree with the major impact of the real output numbers as forecast I would say, Sam, that I probably should apologize to you for trying to bring you into the argument so to speak But it seems to me that we should think more in terms of the global economy And monetary policy, it seems to me, works primarily in the global economy in that perspective I just do not believe that being the best Phillips curver does you much good in analyzing the global economy, with more flexibility in wages and  -31-    8/22/89  prices than we would have otherwise In that context, it seems to me that when Mike Prell said that he expects to bring in the inflation forecast lower for 1991 because he believes that's what we want, I think you're exactly right, Mike That is what we want But the way to get lower inflation is not to have the dollar depreciate And I must admit that even though Ted has been wrong for two years in regard to the exchange rate forecast, I've also been wrong on the foreign exchange rate forecast for two years running I've been wrong just as Ted has been wrong in forecasting a declining one   It seems to me that if we truly want to have a stable price level the way to get there is not to get into a period of dollar depreciation I don't understand how we can have a period of interest rate stability and have a dollar depreciation in the forecast That means, then, that I do expect domestic demand to be somewhat weaker on the consumer side I believe we have turned the corner on the household saving rate; I believe there is a difference there But it seems to me that we have to be aware that even though things are working out very well that there is a vulnerability I think the vulnerable areas in our economy that will tend to show up will be in the problem area of housing That is, if housing stays at its present rate then it seems to me that the soft landing scenario is fairly accurate But I think there is some possibility that we may be entering a period in which housing prices nationally are in a much softer position than we realized; and if we have a period of declining housing values, that will show through on consumer spending more than the stock market showed though So, even though things seem just about right now, we ought to be aware of that vulnerability I'm very pleased with the staff's understanding of our wanting [lower] inflation My goodness, 3 percent is not good But I don't understand why we continue to believe that we can get there with a depreciating dollar scenario   I would prefer asymmetry toward ease just in recognition that not to ease at all during the intermeeting period would at some point in time mean a rollback to somewhat higher interest rates I would be somewhat concerned that in that scenario we might very well end up with a housing market that would be adversely affected by those developments I also think we need to be alert to the fact that M2 growth needs to stay within that cone That is, we are expecting M2 growth to be within one of those--whether it's A, B, or C--between now and September I would certainly not want to see that fall out of bed and I have no reason to believe that it will I also think that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could quite likely come under upward pressure and that exchange rate intervention might not by itself be sufficient to hold that back I believe it would be undesirable to have another serious leg up on the appreciation of the dollar and go through some of the marks we went through before That taking place in a period accompanied by falling commodity prices I think would call for ease Objectively looking at the situation, I think that we're more apt to ease than not; and I don't see any harm in having asymmetric language toward ease, Mr Chairman, because we're not going to do it unless something would develop that would cause us to want to [ease]    8/22/89   Oh yes, so do I!   But it seems to me, Mr Chairman, that if we decided to tighten before the policy announcement came out that people would see that we had changed our mind   Frankly, I would never vote "no" over the question of symmetry That means all we do can be done either way   But that's an historical question   That's what we're talking about; that's what we're voting for   That's the key issue   That is correct   Mr Chairman--   It seems to me that the markets are beginning to recognize the Federal Reserve's commitment to price level stability Mr Chairman, you've certainly contributed to that and I think other members of the Committee have in regard to the one voice that we have in this area But we can't have that commitment to price level stability without having a strong dollar That is, a strong commitment to price level stability [requires appropriate] interest rate differentials and the dollar remaining strong It just seems to me that we need to understand where our commitment is And, Mr Chairman, this discussion seems to indicate a very strong feeling in regard to the direction and the kind of policy we should engage in But I think one can go so far as to say that the Treasury certainly would be dissatisfied to be without us That is, the thought that we might pull out of this is indeed some force; and my dissent is in that vein My dissent is to contribute to an environment in which the Treasury recognizes that it may not wish to go it alone I agree it's best for us not to get out But sometimes we have to act like we might get out in order to [achieve our objective]; and it's to your leadership that I entrust that we do it  -12-    10/3/89   He's done it too well   Yes   Okay, here's what I'm going to do I'm going to vote on the affirmative on this one because this has only to do with what has taken place I dissented in regard to the Authorization, which was a proper dissent So, I'm going to make that distinction, Manley You do what you think   Well, in other words what we're doing now is saying that we did transactions [The question is whether] they were authorized In other words, are they approved?   It seems to me that the picture is a mixed picture I'm somewhat on the optimistic side, as are Gary Stern and Manley Johnson, in regard to the output-price tradeoff It seems to me that in the second half we are in a 2-3/4 percent inflation mode as compared to 6 percent in the first half I would agree that neither one of those was sustainable That is, I think we had accidental factors giving us too high inflation numbers in the first half and we are getting some benefits in the second half that are not sustainable But I would tend to expect inflation in 1990 to be within the 3 percent range I don't call that good at all My goodness, we are two years delayed in terms of being at 3 percent and I think we do need to make more progress But I think our ability to make progress on the inflation front can best be done by not creating recession-like conditions And I'm optimistic that that will not occur M2's growth over 26 weeks is now back up to 4-1/2 percent, which seems to me to mean that we have made some progress in that regard Commodity prices continue to soften, but I think it's a rather moderate softening and not a precipitous one It seems to be a softening that reflects the  -32-    10/3/89  monetary scarcity that occurred earlier; and I think that needs to be watched rather carefully as I think money growth needs to be watched But I do believe there's a different tone around in regard to how one can profit by engaging in various economic activities I think profit prospects or speculative gains by holding land or real estate or any investments are probably being diminished somewhat And it doesn't seem to me that this is going to lead to a sustainable level of investment activity in many of these areas I am as bullish as the staff is in regard to exports In fact, I have exports slightly higher with a stable exchange rate, whereas the staff is calling for exports to decrease dramatically--well, I'd call down to 5 percent somewhat of a dramatic decrease I believe that we have had the benefit of having American manufacturers compete in the world markets right here in the United States; I think they are getting better and I think there is motivation to hold costs in check So, I think it's an optimistic outlook; but there are some areas, like the airline business, that are showing some signs of change So it looks sustainable   Yes, Mr Chairman I also prefer alternative "B" with asymmetric language toward ease It seems to me that there is more restraint in place than I think some of the words so far have suggested We have had monetary restraint sufficient to turn the foreign exchange value of the dollar around We have had monetary restraint sufficient to take commodity prices that were rapidly rising and turn them into falling prices We have had monetary restraint that has taken the PPI on a year-over-year rate of change basis from moving up to moving down To think you can get lucky enough in that kind of environment to do that and have no change in monetary restraint and to think that that restraint is going to be just right on the other side does not follow the logic that I know of So, I'm quite suspicious of the fact that we may be getting further into this process than we know We need to be watching very carefully to see what occurs Now, I would be delighted if we could just say Well, we're going to pull the monetary aggregates down and we're just going to have them under restraint; but I think all of us know what happens if you go into that mode The demand for money has to increase during a period of time in which price level stability is much more of a clear possibility So, I think we have to watch very carefully all the signals that have served us so well in keeping this economy going for so long and yet provided the restraint that we needed I believe that it's not so important at this point whether we ease a quarter or not here or there except that I don't want any timing with the dollar But 25 basis points one way or the other doesn't make or break anything You could make way too much of that But it does contribute to the possibility of orderly markets that are so important; the whole housing industry, it seems to me, needs orderly markets I think a very steady, careful, easing ought to be done; it's unfortunate that the G-7 took away what I think may be a time in which we may need to act I think it's essential that we take this time to wait, but I am more inclined, I guess, than some others to believe that an easing is going to be necessary   Do you mean drive the dollar higher?  -43-    10/3/89   Do we want the FOMC [to respond]?   I would think we should have one response   The model that works   Well, how about a Wednesday morning meeting with [Wednesday] afternoon?   Well, the model that we're going to use is going to be rather important It seems to me that if you're going to use the Phillips curve trade-off model you're going to defeat the Neal amendment   [Unintelligible] if you want to defeat it, just use that model and you will guarantee a defeat   That's right   And how about BART?   The Europeans by and large are forecasting that their inflation rates will not peak until sometime in 1990 I was surprised that believe that theirs will move to percent before it turns down on a year-over-year basis So there is some anticipation there that they have quite a stimulus going   Yes Mike, in Q1 1990 you have producers durable equipment leading business fixed investment up and then it's back down again in the second quarter What gives rise to that?   But that's assuming this strike ends when?   I have the same question My hunch is that the fourth and first quarters are going to be somewhat weak, as forecast But if you look at the more forward-looking items such as money growth, we have had M2 back on a fairly decent pace for about five months now and I've been surprised that commodity prices haven't continued to move down I know they have moved down in certain of the industrial measures, but it seems to me a pretty isolated group of  -22-    11/14/89  commodity prices that are continuing to move down And they haven't moved down very much in comparison to how much they moved up in the 1987-1988 period So, it seems to me that we have a ways to go in regard to restraint on those commodity prices We had a serious drought, which took farm commodity prices up a great deal We have not had what you would call a normal movement of commodity prices down, which you would typically get; that is, going back over the post World War II drought periods, ordinarily you would get more movement down of commodity prices than we have had I'm somewhat [stymied] in my view concerning where we are because commodity price behavior hasn't been what I thought it was going to be I guess that's one of the problems you have when you begin to target something; perhaps you ought not to look at what you think it's going to say I think there are times when you [unintelligible] not see as much; it does not give me the sense of an economic slowdown that I felt in 1985 and 1986 It just isn't there And I think it's crucial that it get there because the wage sector is no longer lagging as much as we would like It's kind of upon us and we probably have some tough periods ahead   Well, it seems to me that we're at a juncture here where it's time for us to pause and see what happens The fourth quarter and the first quarter are the consequences of the monetary policy that we implemented in the second quarter and the third quarter We are already past [influencing] those Whatever these quarters turn out to be, it would be most unfortunate for us to have a slowdown--or a slowdown near to zero if it's that slow, which I don't think it is--and then not to capture the price level opportunity that you get from being there It would just be such a waste to step up to that point and then not to capture the benefits So, I think it's imperative that we not be too caught up in tuning in on the employment and output numbers that we're going to be seeing I think we have to remain forward-looking Most important, it seems to me that the dollar exchange rate is out there And it seems to me that we cannot go through a period of substantial dollar weakness in foreign exchange markets without absolutely upsetting all the financial markets The only way that I can see us not going through such a period is for us to make some gains on the trade balance in this window [of opportunity] I am more encouraged from talking with central bankers in Europe and Japan concerning their growth prospects We have an opportunity now for them to grow faster than we're going to grow and I guess I'm going to be on the optimistic side, as the Vice Chairman was, in regard to exports It seems to me that our policy ought to be designed to keep nominal GNP in the 4 to 5 percent range and hope that we get a fantastic real GNP out of those numbers If we hold to that kind of a pattern, then I think there's ample opportunity to [get] the exports we need to do or [get] the crowding out of imports I think we're now moving in the period where that has to take place So, Mr Chairman, I also favor "B;" but frankly, I'm more of the symmetric mind in the sense that I would like us to be in a position that we not make another move in the near future without having a real concerted discussion of the FOMC concerning that   At least 1230 pm for lunch  SPEAKER(?) On the 18th or 19th?   We can start the Board meeting at 930 am  SPEAKER(?) It'll be a long day!  END OF MEETING  -35-       It truly is   Well, I want to echo Chairman Greenspan's compliments to you Even though you [prefaced] your remarks by saying that it shows how little we know, I still think it has been a very fruitful exercise and certainly fulfills what it was that we were asking for in terms of this kind of a presentation One interest that I have is in terms of the base case You were suggesting that there could be a continuation of this impact into 1996 and 1997 that might involve an outright deflation Consequently, it was nice to look at that earlier tight money phenomenon because it also brought the rate of unemployment down to its natural rate And what I'm asking is Since we're already getting something we don't know about, maybe we might as well go ahead and do another five years because we're only doing more of that which we don't know about; and thereby, we would have a base case movement to zero inflation in 1995 and then [we    12/18-19/89 -5-  could] look at the adjustment to the natural rate of unemployment And that would also give us an opportunity to look at the current account deficit That's because I presume that taking the base case [up to] 1996 will cause an interest rate adjustment, which I presume would [work] through to both the budget deficit and also the current account deficit because of the interest rate effect And [we could] see how that might follow through for the next five years Would that involve too much more?   But you could suggest that the adjustments would not necessarily be that we would let deflation occur but that we would make adjustments in the direction that I've indicated And that would then be pluses for the federal budget deficit and pluses for the current account in the ensuing period after 1995 I also wanted to get your reaction to the oil price shocks It seems to me that maybe the oil price shocks are not unrelated to monetary policy That is, if we decided to leave the inflation rate at 4-1/2 percent, we might be more apt to have an oil price shock, or a so-called oil price shock, than we would if we proceeded in a tighter fashion   But on the fiscal side I'm afraid it works the other way That is, at some point in time if we pursue, for example, the alternative of earlier restraint, then we increase the risk of either tripping the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings [provisions] or getting changed legislation   It seems to me that the Committee ought to keep in mind when we talk about these sacrifice ratios that we could take, say, alternative 2 of pursuing a [constant] 4-1/2 percent inflation rate or alternative 3, say, assuming a rate of increase in inflation of 1 percent a year, or we could go with 4, which would be our [price stability] objective, and then we would follow those alternatives out There's no guarantee that one would not encounter even more likelihood of a serious financial upset that might engender a significant [rise in the] unemployment rate So it seems to me it might be possible that the cumulative sacrifice we're talking about might be higher    12/18-19/89  under a constant inflation target or an increasing inflation target-- if anyone wanted to do that--than it would be under a zero inflation target   Absolutely   You have to take the present value of all the benefits in the future   And the present cost of not doing it   I have a question for, I think, Don Kohn But if the others in monetary research wish to come in, that's fine It's difficult sometimes to know what M2 growth path is really [apt] to restrain when we have changing opportunity costs of holding M2, for example So I'm wondering If we're in an environment in which the rate of interest is declining at an annual rate of 100 basis points-- or as they did for a good portion of the period from June to December, I guess, declining at 250 basis points annual rate--how do we adjust M2 to know whether or not we still have restraint in place and a declining interest rate scenario? And how, on the other hand, do we know that we really have restraint in place in a rising interest rate scenario?  -23-    12/18-19/89   Well, take table 1 of Mike's December 14th memo table 1 does show on the accelerated disinflation path much lower [money growth] rates; and I presume when interest rates are declining toward the end then you show somewhat higher rates   Yes   Well, Don, I guess the bottom line of my question is Are we somewhat advantaged due to the fact that over the last 30 months we've had an M2 growth rate of something between 4 and 5 percent? Does this give us a better basis for watching this 5-year scenario than if we were in a period in which we--? I guess what I'm asking is Do we have a start, in your opinion?  -24-    12/18-19/89   But on Table 1, the Q-4 over Q-4 percentage change for 1990, I note, is 5 percent; and that looks fairly tough to do   The 1990 Q-4 over Q-4 percentage change is 5 percent That's in Table 1 of the December 14th memo   M2   Well, is this a velocity adjustment?   So, during a period of relatively slow M2 growth over the last 30 months, V2 has responded somewhat upward above this trend path   So we're now getting a little adjustment back the other way?   Well, I think we've gotten handicapped by the belief that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and that it doesn't make any difference what anyone else does--that the central bank has the power to control the price level and that it's for us to decide I would strongly prefer for us to control the price level rather than to aim for zero; zero inflation is not a satisfactory target as far as I'm concerned With zero inflation targeting, I believe that events will occur; and if we always in a sense let those events be positive but never negative, we're going to end up with an inflation rate that's unsatisfactory So, I want to go beyond that and I want to have some periods in which we have deflation as well as periods in which we have inflation I believe it's a commitment to a price level that is the most important If we have a drought and the prices of food and fiber products rise and we say we didn't cause that drought, well, then, what happens when we have more favorable weather than usual? Do you think we're going to let that kind of supply side [shock] show up as favorable? Do you think we're going to say "Gee, we're going to take the rate of inflation down"? If we are, then of course we're where we ought to be It just seems to me that the case is so strong for wanting the American people to be able to buy homes at a 5 percent mortgage interest rate People ought to be able to get a 30-year fixed rate at 5 percent And the benefit to that, it seems to me, is unusually high There is a benefit for the Federal Government with its debt; the higher the debt grows as a percentage of GNP the more benefit there is in having low interest rates The greater our external debt the more benefit there is of having lower interest rates To me, these benefits are overwhelming and they are so apparent We are a reserve currency country And my goodness we have seigniorage gains If the world uses dollars for payments, that costs us zero interest rates It's just very convenient to have the reserve currency position And we're not competing with the average country in the world; we're competing with the best competitors in that regard  -34-    12/18-19/89  Finally, it seems to me that there's basic integrity involved I just don't understand why anyone would want to say they wanted to participate in a lack of integrity, meaning we're [just] making promises It's our job to make promises in regard to the purchasing power of US dollars To me it's a moral question of integrity And I cannot participate--I cannot serve on a Board and an FOMC that doesn't have this integrity Excuse me for being so extreme! But I don't know how else to deal with it Now, as for a specific timetable, yes I'm willing to go slow and do it by 1995 And I believe we ought to tell people we're going to do it because I believe the costs of doing it are lower if we tell them Excuse me for being so one-sided on this   I would respond to a drought   I wouldn't respond by providing the liquidity to make certain that that event didn't cause the demand for money to drive up rates   Well, that's the first thing I'd do--supply Then I would decide whether or not that financial event was going to precipitate any--   --any deflationary impact and I'd watch commodity prices to see whether that was the case or not   The Constitution, as you know, does give the Congress the authority to control the money supply and to protect the value thereof--I think that is the phrasing of it And the Congress decided to delegate that responsibility to us It seems to me that it's far, far worse for us to be held to task by the Congress for not doing the job that they, in a sense, expect us to do in regard to price level stability That criticism can take place too And I would far rather be in a position of saying we were a little too committed to this responsibility than I would to have them criticize us for letting inflation run Economic growth is stated in the Full Employment Act of '46 and full employment is mentioned in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act And it just seems to me that if we know the best way to [foster] economic growth is through price level stability, then it's our job to do the best we can on economic growth--which is, of course, to put price level stability first If you believe that, then I think it's sellable  Now, I agree with what Manley Johnson said at the beginning when he said it's a question of strategy and timing Certainly, Manley, when you and I joined this Board we were involved, first of all, in a proposition to grow the money stock more rapidly For what reason? Well, I think it was because going from 12 percent to 3 percent on the inflation rate unexpectedly produced certain shocks that were threatening to upset the entire financial community I think third world debt and the commodity producers everywhere--the world was just about ready not to worry And I think that it did make sense to level off at 3 percent; and in doing so we really slipped back up to 4-1/2 percent So, now I think it's very logical for us, having done this in the first step, to take the second step And I think going from 4-1/2 percent to zero is not as tough as going from 12 percent to 3 or 3-1/2 percent or wherever it was It seems to me if we're going to sell this we won't sell it by talking about trade- offs You don't sell it by saying "Oh, we're going to go out and produce a recession and that's exactly what we want to do and we're going to put you in enough pain that everybody will become committed to not raising prices" That's not the way to sell it We really need to focus on what I call price level targeting; and that's why I like to use commodity prices as a way of saying that we're not trying to create slack We're not trying to create unemployment; we just recognize that the commodity price level, however measured, has moved up and we have to restrain that move And I think there's support for doing that Now, on the fiscal side, I believe the Federal Reserve is more at fault on the federal budget deficit than is the Congress It was the Federal Reserve with those double-digit inflation rates that caused tax receipts to rise at 16 to 18 percent per year Why wouldn't the Congress get used to spending at that rate? We're the ones that taught the Congress to spend, and bringing the rate of inflation down, of course, shuts down the receipts and it does impose rather significant burdens I don't think anyone here would suggest that the Congress doesn't have significant problems Rather than saying we ought to be [content] and we can't get the inflation rate down, I think we ought to be a little more sympathetic to Congress' problem Getting the budget deficit down in a period of declining inflation is pretty tough to do So I think we need to be sympathetic with their goals and we need to admit that we want to make that pain as minimal as possible for the Congress That's why I don't think we ought to do it as fast as the Volcker Fed succeeded in doing it between 1981 and 1984 when so much progress was made The way I think  -51-    12/18-19/89  you sell this program is that you sell low interest rates You say low interest rates are desirable that's desirable for economic growth; we get more capital formation with low interest rates; and we get an economy in which people can plan for their future And savings ought to respond I believe that we have to be somewhat more optimistic than we have been We can't sit around and tell everybody it's not going to work If you don't believe it's going to work, well then what are you doing here? What we have to do is to say "Sure it's going to work, and we're going to make it work" I think it's sellable and I think it's exciting to be out there selling it Frankly, this is the way I talk to audiences everywhere, as many of you know And I've yet to find the first person to come up to me after one of those presentations and say "Oh no, you're wrong; you shouldn't take the inflation rate down" No one says that   Well, I think it's sellable if we want to sell it   Mr Chairman, I'm very pleased that you made the statement that you made, particularly after the discussion we had yesterday, because if any of us were to indicate that we had such a meeting and that we did not come forward with a decision to [seek price level stability], that in itself could have a very significant [impact] on the market I think that's a particularly delicate subject; and I feel quite certain that the price of gold, for example, would react rather immediately if it were leaked that we talked about going to price level stability and we didn't take action to do it or if it was placed in the worst context   I think we ought to note that during 1989 we have sold over 2-1/2 times more dollars than in any other previous year of selling dollars We've sold $22 billion so far this year and the rest of the world has sold $54 billion We've had a total of $76 billion of sales By and large I think this has been appropriate; I don't want to take a position in regard to not supplying the  -56-    12/18-19/89  opportunity to do what needs to be done if there's any confidence whatsoever that the policy will be properly pursued But when the weighted exchange value of the dollar has been on a three-month decline, which of course still leaves it well above year-ago levels, for us to sell and try and affect the yen/dollar relationship is at best naive and at worst stupid It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever Now, if there's a way to get that message through to the Treasury without some of us having to vote "no" on these kinds of matters, that's the preferable way to go   Well, if they say they're going to jump off the cliff, could we promise not to link hands and jump off with them?   I would prefer that we maintain our hand in the [unintelligible]; I agree with the sentiment that says that we ought not to pull ourselves out It ought to be seen as an unusual move for us to take action for the Treasury's account without our doing it [for our account] If that were to be the case, then I can support the increase in the limit because I do expect that we will receive interest on these funds   Yes   Yes, I know the same people   Well, that was my point precisely   It might not be bad to realize some of those profits   Don, what would be the case for or against releasing our reserve estimates? That would be quite different, it seems to me, than our releasing or announcing what our policy is   Well, that's an understandable response I would comment, Don, that it's not very bureaucratic to suggest it might be bureaucratic Mr Chairman, the point is that I think we do have an objective to preserve our policy freedom and freedom from disclosure And that's why I asked the question Don, would it help at all if you were to do it with a range?   I'm glad you had the conversation I do want to express confidence in your judgment in regard to what you recommend, but I'm glad you're thinking about it   You mean the February forecast   7-1/2 percent from when to when?   Well, Tom, it's interesting that you mentioned that I would make one 30-day correction though; I think several of us wanted to ease in May, but I believe we didn't ease until June Isn't that correct? Certainly, I was foremost among those wanting to ease at that time because I was looking at what I think are the factors that we have to keep our eyes on that is, the factors that look ahead, not those that look behind One of those that looks ahead, of course, is money growth; and at that time we had money growth that was pretty well in the tank after it had been through a rather restrained period But I do agree with Tom that we have made a correction and that the time for worrying about the fourth quarter and the first quarter was in May and June and July and August What we're working on now, of course, is the economy in the third quarter of 1990 I must admit that I don't see anything to quibble with in the staff's forecast for the real economy for 1990 I wouldn't know which way to try to [unintelligible] in terms of which way there are errors Any time we are talking about an outlook for growth as low as the 12 percent projected for the first quarter--we all know that any one quarter can go in a surprising direction But it's important for us to look ahead As I look ahead, I would note that money growth seems to be falling along an 8 percent path for M2, which is rather significant compared to what we've seen previously Besides that, it is reflected in auction markets and the auction markets show that we now have more liquidity out there than we had before It's quite clear in the commodities Commodities in May clearly were showing that we were in a period of suffering from quite a bit of monetary restraint And for commodity prices on a year-over-year basis the rate of change was starting downward But now we are in a period of very, very mixed--and I can say somewhat confusing--commodity price signals In the industrial sector, clearly in aluminum and steel and copper, we have a significant change from what we have seen previously But these industrial commodity prices are coming off historically high levels And it doesn't seem to me that they have weakened so far as to take profit margins into the red for most of those basic metals Of course, producers don't like it when that has happened In the food and fiber areas we've had significant runups and with those runups producers of food and fibers continue to have profit margins that are rather ample That shows up in the price of  -85-    12/18-19/89  land that we get in the Tenth and the Eleventh and the Seventh District surveys So that sort of offsets some of the others The price of gold, of course, is somewhat erratic; it's somewhat like the exchange rates and tends to be given to overshooting and undershooting Nevertheless, that is a rather significant indicator regarding the way people feel about dollars in the future; those who wish to make other kinds of bets would indicate, I think, that our exchange rate messing around in the last three months has contributed to some unease there and I think it's showing And I think that has even [unintelligible] that active if it nevertheless has been quite accurate in terms of showing some change in sentiment The foreign exchange market in the last three months certainly has shown that our money growth path changes are reflecting that No longer do the foreign exchange auction markets show that dollars are somewhat overscarce in the minds of holders of international capital flows  Now, when I think about the dangers of what might happen--and it's always our job to try to guess and to worry about what might be happening--if the fourth and the first quarters or one of them turn out to be negative, there isn't anything we can do about it That's already locked in But if I'm going to worry about what might happen that could really put our economy in a tailspin, I would worry about the occurrence of circumstances in which the foreign exchange value of the dollar could erode rather seriously I think Jerry was referring to that problem; he referred to it as from time-to-time Sometimes I worry about it, sometimes I don't When we have slow money growth compared to the Bundesbank and Japan and other countries then I'm not quite so worried In circumstances when our monetary growth is no longer slower than the Bundesbank, then it seems to me there's a great deal of vulnerability If we were to get some significant moves in foreign exchange rates that adversely affected bond prices--unlike so far, when foreign exchange weakness has not spilled over, except sporadically, in the bond market--and we were to have higher rates by lowering rates, it is in the higher rates where it counts So, I think the vulnerabilities that we have are pretty well locked in But it seems to me that there's nothing out there that says the third quarter is going to be all that weak I must admit, Governor Seger, that I think some of the problems that you look at in automobiles may very well slip into the second quarter after a low first quarter But other than that, I don't see things in the second and third quarters that are showing a need for a great deal of attention And I do think back to 1980 Of all total benefit/cost analysis of all the policies that [unintelligible] wasted, nothing is so wasted as this short-term [unintelligible] Two quarters of slow growth followed by a resumption [of rapid growth] are totally wasted as far as price level effects [are concerned] So we want to be sure not to get too locked up in guiding monetary policy by what's happening in the economy   At this stage how much does every 50 basis points do to the [expectation of] 6 percent in 1990?   So a decline of 50 basis points would take it up to 6-1/2 percent?   Yes, Mr Chairman I do agree with you that there is some short-run impact of monetary policy That is, I do believe that the second-quarter numbers can be impacted rather slightly because those actually are the months that really fit in there--and really [also] the month of March even though it's in the first quarter because it still affects how that first quarter ends So, in the months of March, April, and May--sure, there will be some impact But my view is that what we ought to look at here is not a sacrifice ratio or sacrifice index; we ought to look at a benefits index And the benefit index is just too, too small That is, we benefit so slightly compared to what it costs in terms of inflation I remember the 1986 experience in which it actually ended up that one quarter was negative and the next quarter was positive; the third quarter was positive just the same amount the second was negative and we ended up getting zero But the rate of inflation was down low  -92-    12/18-19/89  enough that coming out of that was not letting the [unintelligible] in, and going by that I think was the proper thing to have done But we came out of that with an inflation rate that had some room It was down 1 percent Now, 1986 was an unusual year; that was an aberration in terms of the oil price factor Nevertheless, there were some possibilities of it not being so high If we go through a two-quarter slowdown and there's not a recession and we come out of it with the rate of inflation where the staff have it forecast and then we have to turn around in the fall of 1990 or a year from now and tighten or if we have to turn around and tighten in the summer, that's when it's tough When you think about the yield curve and the bond rates, what happens is that all of a sudden you get expectations that are changed The long bond doesn't just represent inflation expectations; it also represents expectations as to Fed policy And when we shift from easing to tightening we have a real tough deal to play If this is not a political window, then I don't see how that's a political window, because it really is going to be tough to make that turnaround   Well, the funds rate came down from 9 percent to 5 percent   Oh yes, 1980   Yes, I recognize that M2 growth isn't going to go to 32 percent like it did in 1980 But I'm not suggesting that What I am suggesting is that the benefit for the second quarter is so small and the benefit for the third quarter is not all that large What I see is that the financial markets and commodity markets and foreign exchange markets are rather fragile right now And I think we send an attitudinally wrong signal by this small step at this point in time I point out to you that the long bond really has been stuck in this 785 to 795 percent region and the last [unintelligible] basis points in the fed funds rate has not been accompanied by a [unintelligible] bond yield I'm saying that by being patient now and by waiting, we may very well get a climate in which these market expectations will be more favorable I'm not suggesting that I would not at any point in time next year be in favor of further adjustment  -93-    12/18-19/89  But I would rather the bond markets lead us rather than take the chance now that if we make this move and the bond market, like the last two times, signals something else That means it doesn't help Housing starts are the key to any soft landing scenario And we must let the long bond yield lead us That's why I think this little bitty move is worth my resistance   It is a Christmas present but it's a Trojan horse   Mr Chairman, I have one suggestion that I'd raise for the Committee's consideration in the language in the operational paragraph It says "taking account of progress toward price stability" and I think it's nice to leave that number one But I would move "the behavior of the monetary aggregates" into second place, which would be an indication as to why we've gone symmetric It would be an indication that we will be concerned about M2 being above the 3 to 7 percent range that we adopted tentatively And we know that right now we're guaranteed that we're going to be above it   Okay   All right, I'm sorry You're correct But I would suggest that moving that up would be a good reason as to why we went to symmetric language   Yes   Jerry, do you support moving the monetary aggregates [phrase]?   Yes   Why don't we just have a show of hands of the voting members?  SPEAKER(?) Right   That's it  -102-    12/18-19/89   Mr Chairman, I really think I'm going to request that we do have a recorded vote because I think it will be a precedent in history for--   Yes   Yes   Well, why don't we just have a show of hands? Clearly, if the majority wishes to go one way--   We need both   Sure  -104-    12/18-19/89   Yes, right   No   Yes Ordinarily, for many years, we've had a full employment Federal budget deficit What is the change from 1989 fiscal year to 1991 fiscal year in the full employment deficit?   Okay, that's fine   Would the high employment deficit or the actual deficit be the best measure of fiscal restraint? Now, I ask that, even though I don't understand what fiscal restraint is    2/6-7/90   Do you think of the FSLIC bailout cost as being different in terms of traditional fiscal effects?   Well, these questions are designed to get to the bottom line question which is With monetary policy and some tendencies toward real interest rates being maintained at a level consistent with path and with some fiscal restraint, why does the forecast assume that there's that much improvement in the level of economic activity in 1991?   Thank you   My number for real GNP is right underneath the staff's at 1-1/2 percent real growth, but my nominal number is considerably less [than the staff's number] I put nominal GNP just barely above 4 percent, so that gives you some indication of how I believe we can get a pretty narrow squeeze if we do not get better improvement than the staff has forecast on inflation The price picture is really pretty mixed at this point I do not see that we've really had much of a downward move in commodity prices other than for industrial metals prices For the most part, commodity prices are pretty well holding steady at a relatively high plateau If those commodity prices stay at that plateau, I think the chance for an immediate PPI and CPI movement downward, which would boost the bond market, is not going to come as early in 1990 as might be desirable for real output reasons  But even though commodity prices don't show that much brightness, I do believe the whole price picture is in a position where it can move pretty fast Several of you have mentioned some of these developments, but I want to refocus on them Even though house prices nationwide are not in a deflationary mode, the fact of the matter is that the majority of homeowners do not have much expectation of appreciation That has been a factor driving household wealth; and    2/6-7/90  it's a factor that I think has artificially depressed the household saving rate Consequently, I tend to feel that the household saving rate may very well respond and, contrary to what we're seeing, may not be an interlude but may be somewhat longer-lasting I believe that in this rolling adjustment that we've been in, a lot of people have experienced severe burdens of debt It happened in the farm sector and they haven't forgotten; it happened also in the oil sector and they haven't forgotten It has happened in nonresidential real estate and I don't think they've forgotten; and it has happened in LBOs And households are not in a position to pick up this gap The changes in the tax laws plus more restrictive lending standards can have quite an impact I think households have just realized that that tax reduction feature is no longer there And since home equity lines are not apt to be expanded in a flat real estate market, the home equity line doesn't provide as much opportunity for low cost or tax deductible lending It seems to me that autos financed out of nondeductible interest payments would be a rather severe burden, so I just don't see any outlook for autos and perhaps other household durable goods to come back as fast as maybe the Greenbook implies  However, I do believe that if we don't tip the economy over, there are some underlying positives I agree with those who see the [outlook for] merchandise trade exports as being somewhat optimistic, as I think even the staff forecast shows But I might expect slightly more optimism than that The foreign tourism factor particularly is not a minor factor and I just can't but believe that that will continue I think also that the undergirding factor in here is that we have had rolling recessions throughout the economy, so it's not as if we have been in a stage in which every sector has been in a boom Consequently, I think we're not as vulnerable to downturn forces because, as Bob Boykin mentioned, in Texas energy is actually in a recovery mode and agriculture and agricultural machinery are in similar recovery modes My forecast is for a much brighter picture except for the CPI; I only have the CPI down 1 percentage point from this year's level So, I'm not expecting as much gain in the CPI because at this point in time I consider the greatest danger to this sustained expansion is through a financial problem for the dollar, and I'm not as optimistic about the dollar as I have been in previous years Of course, my optimism about the dollar last year was that the dollar would be pretty stable and I think it behaved that way I think that's our razor's edge; if something happens there, that could upset things So, under the assumption that we're not going to cut the fed funds rate 25 basis points and drive long bonds up another 50 basis points, I think there's a reasonable chance that that will be okay   Did you forecast a recession?   Or we're going to see a decrease of the inflation rate in the United States to equal or below those of the other two countries   But you would agree that that is a third option?   Don, following along through strategy II, I get a [growth rate for] dollar GNP under strategy II of 5-1/4 percent Is that right?   In 1990   I didn't have my calculator with me   Okay Then that implies a V2 of zero   That doesn't seem to me to quite fit under that scenario   The velocities that I calculated on strategy II were zero in 1990 and in 1991 and plus one in 1992 It seems to me that that tightening scenario somewhere in there is apt to have a declining velocity   Yes   But those of us who believe that the Phillips curve model is not as accurate as the commodity price-V2 relationship  -29-    2/6-7/90  position would tend to see the timing of that as being a little different That is, it seems to me that the strategy II scenario would be associated with declining commodity prices sometime in the second half of, say, 1990 I just can't help but believe that that would tend to take velocity down with it; and there's some risk, it seems to me, that velocity could be somewhat lower than anticipated   Yes, that will happen as gold prices decline!   It seems to me that we really should make up our minds to live within the ranges I would be more inclined toward a range that we can live within than I would to get a little too macho and then find ourselves deviating from it I could live with alternative II provided we take quite seriously that 7 percent is really a desirable top When we look back to the last deflationary period, we let M2 get to more than 9-1/2 percent, so it would be considerable progress from 1986 when we had 9-1/2 percent if this time it were 7 percent It does seem to me that V2 could well be as low as negative 2 And if nominal GNP were in the 5 percent range, I think that over a period of time would be effective restraint I would also prefer to wait to cut the ranges until we can cut them a full percentage point I think it would be nice to make the cut from 3 to 7 percent to 2 to 6 percent I just don't feel that that's a very livable cut this time So, I would prefer alternative II But I would prefer, Mr Chairman, that in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony you make it very clear what our strategy is and why it is that we do not believe in a steady process of decreasing the ranges but that we think significant range decreases will come during the next period of interest rate increase If we have that kind of strong statement I would like that better I would share with Governor Johnson some preference for moving down at least the debt aggregate It seems to me that 5 to 9 percent on debt could be a livable range within the future Even though the thrift situation might bring back higher growth rates in M3 in 1991, I would expect debt to work in a 5 to 9 percent range   We knew what you meant!   I'm ready I move 3 to 7 percent for M2   Yes, I would   Oh yes you can   You can move to amend, that's right Mr Chairman, the reason that I wanted to be earliest is because I really have another suggestion And if my suggestion gets a second, we can [be done] with it The suggestion is that we show our seriousness by getting down to one target, M2 So what I'm suggesting and I'm willing to move it if someone would second it, would be that we not have targets for M3 and debt--just as we abandoned Ml And that places us in a much more credible position I believe that with a 400 basis point range for M2 that makes more sense It is the one velocity we think we know more about And so I would prefer and would move, Mr Chairman, that we--   Well, Mr Chairman, under those circumstances I would be open to waiting to consider this issue   I would second that   Well, we call the roll anyway for the record, don't we?   Okay   Mr Chairman, this is something I've never done before but in view of the way this may be interpreted I would like to change my vote, if it's going to be recorded, because I don't want to explain this little bitty thing I would prefer not to go with the halves but I don't want to explain that   Well, but Mr Chairman--   Well, a procedural point It seems to me that it may have been well for us just to have a consensus move on these; but once we took a vote, not to put it in the minutes offends my notion of accuracy of [minutes] Is Virgil here?   Yes, I know I'm just saying it's a matter of procedure Roll-call votes are ordinarily recorded I think it would be well for us not to have roll-call votes on these kinds of--   Well, what's Virgil's view on this?   I would agree with that   I suggest we might not want to record it, Mr Chairman   Yes   That's it   But there are some unknowns here If we were to tighten short-term rates, long-term rates might reverse  -46-    2/6-7/90  [unintelligible] take the last reductions So it seems to me that one might make a case that long-term rates would be lower rather than higher   Well, I would think an increase of 150 basis points in short-term rates probably would not be expected to be followed by future increases Consequently, I'm sure long bond prices would rise and long-term interest rates would fall But I don't know whether that mix will work very well or not   Mr Chairman, I agree with your analysis I would favor "B" symmetric That would be my preference even though I think that a large increase in the fed funds rate would cause long bond prices to rise I believe there are many other factors that would make it unwise to do that, not the least of which would be the impact upon the yen It seems to me that any tightening that we did at this point would be most apt to cause the Bank of Japan to make a move Consequently, I would see it as somewhat frivolous in regard to its benefits and would believe, with you, that stability is the best path Even though I wouldn't admit it outside this room and even though I like to talk about other factors like energy prices and oil prices, I think the fact of the matter is that the Federal Reserve is not in a "pushing on the string" era; we are instead in an era in which we're out of rope And somehow or other, if we are going to get water out of the well and we don't have enough rope to reach it, we don't have as much power as we would like to have I agree with your decision but I would very strongly favor symmetry because I would like a directive that would give the members of the Committee a chance to look at the impact of any intermeeting adjustment on the M2 growth path It seems to me that it should be somewhat more of a major step than it might be otherwise   But it's not a recorded vote   Models   Mike, one of the interesting parts of monetary policy is that we have options of being sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect on the forecast, but we also can be sometimes bold and sometimes timid I'm wondering why it is that in your forecast you have us being so timid That is, you're saying 100 basis points higher on short-term interest rates toward the end of the year Well, if you're correct in your forecast, why not bring that interest rate increase by and large into the second quarter? Wouldn't that produce a better achievement of Federal Reserve objectives? That would, of course, make Ted's forecast wrong But wouldn't that be the bold thing to do, Mike?   So--   Well, I'm reading into your answer that you're suggesting we be timid because you think you may be wrong That's always the wise thing to do to be timid if you think you may be wrong But clearly what you've shown on the path in regard to the employment gap that you believe is necessary for price level stability is not occurring as rapidly in the 1990 forecast as you had anticipated previously And I guess one [unintelligible] your lack of boldness in wanting to create that kind of employment gap so as to achieve the proper price level improvement for 1991, because clearly the 1991 price level forecast is unacceptable   Well, I may have done you a disservice because you may have been forecasting that we wouldn't be bold rather than--   No further questions   [Unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I don't have anything to say at this time I'll listen carefully to your recommendation   Mr Chairman, I agree with your assessment I would just as soon have "B" symmetric, with our watching it very carefully during the intermeeting period and being particularly tuned to any developments in any of the leading indicators that would help us to know [more] in regard to timing It does seem to me that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is increasingly through the foreign exchange rate and that having a somewhat higher foreign exchange value of the dollar does get us somewhat closer to the effects that we would have had with a somewhat lower dollar and with a 25 basis point increase in [interest rates] It just seems to me, Mr Chairman, that foreign exchange markets at this point would be destabilized by an unexpected move on our part; that would buy us more problems rather than less   There's no problem because they are out of money in their Exchange Stabilization Fund   Where?   Yes, that would be risky for them   It seems to me first of all that the very first principle is that the Treasury, with its official foreign exchange capability, and the Federal Reserve are inevitably linked in an endeavor Even if we did not engage in foreign exchange operations, we could still have the possibility of a conflict between Treasury's    3/27/90  official foreign exchange position and basic monetary policy; and it could become a conflict at the Congressional level if we decided that monetary policy was going to be for a strong dollar and if the Treasury said they wanted a weak dollar So, I don't think we can back away and say somehow or other let's wash our hands of it That won't work I think it is important that the Federal Reserve continue its educational process Now, I'm very happy with what has happened I'm happy on two scores In the first place I'm happy because the Federal Reserve is now, it seems to me, at a consensus position regarding the dollar The problem that I had for so long was that we had so many in the Federal Reserve who saw a foreign exchange depreciation as a technique to resolve the foreign trade balance, which was in conflict with our price level stability goals And I'm delighted, Mr Chairman, that today this organization now seems to be together for the first time, which says that depreciation is not going to be used as a device to solve the trade balance problem We're going to solve that problem some other way So, it seems to me we've made tremendous progress  Now, when the Treasury wishes to engage in dollar depreciation in order to satisfy a short-term political objective, that's very dangerous and we ought not to participate in it We ought to be willing to join in when we believe that the purposes are reasonable and give them some allowance in that regard But when it comes to the point of having it appear to the nations and the capital markets of the world that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve want a depreciation of the dollar, that invites catastrophe and we can't be a part of that Now, it seems to me we've made progress on that score We no longer have that high risk Selling dollars to drive the dollar down is a process that a central bank can engage in without a limit We can create all the dollars we want to create and there's no stopping it Frankly, when it is published that the Federal Reserve did not participate, I think that's going to give the Treasury a great deal of pause; I think they're going to be more careful and are going to listen to us more carefully than they did before The fact of the matter is, Mr Chairman, that in 1989 they continued to the point of building up balances that are unprecedented and those balances subject them to foreign exchange speculative risk and they subject us to that risk And sooner or later, if you stake those kinds of positions, you're going to have a Congressional inquiry and the whole operation is going to be tarred I think it's very [unintelligible] that we're setting out to do When we first did the Plaza Accord that seemed to be somewhat well understood When we first did the Louvre Accord that seemed to be somewhat well understood in regard to broad ranges But we've been asked to engage in the selling of dollars at a time in which no one knew what the down side was in regard to the deutschemark market as we were selling yen, and in this [untenable] position that the Treasury was in I think we had no choice but to separate ourselves from that risk Mr Chairman, I'm delighted we have But I will be more delighted when we get some kind of reasonable plan to deal with the large balances that we now have and some notion as to how they can be worked back down There are uncertainties that really are impacting this market No one understands what's happening to the yen at this point At one time we had some reasonable understanding as to why [exchange rates] were moving But we are now in a period of risk And I think it's just extraordinary that we've made this kind of statement; it's going to be significant when it's announced I think it is going to have an impact when it is published that the Federal  -56-    3/27/90  Reserve stepped back from it Now, I believe in doing this that we ought to be careful not to do it and turn out to be wrong [Unintelligible] then, of course, we would lose credibility But I think we've protected ourselves But I would like to see the next plan, which is Where do we go from here? What is to be done with the balances? When are we ever to sell currencies? That's what I think would be helpful to have your comments on   But by and large, Jerry, if the Federal Reserve had pursued a rigorously tight monetary policy in 1978 we would not have had to go out with our hat in our hand   If we pursue a rigorous monetary policy toward price level stability, the fear of a weak dollar is gone   Oh, I agree with you   But that's why we shouldn't add to our stock of yen at 138 and 142, because then we lose the ability to do it when we need to do it to stop an overshoot   But, Alan, you don't think the Treasury wants to be out there floating in the wind by themselves on this issue They really want us in, don't you think?   All right   Made a difference   You believe that?   Yes   But proper monetary policy is behind the world's willingness to take our claims If the Federal Reserve had not tightened and grown our money stock at a 4 percent rate for two years, the world would not have taken those claims   Not all   Right Some of us said that was not to be--   But the foreign exchange intervention works because it has monetary policy behind it   The possibility that you're gaining time by the Treasury [intervening] without us is a paper floating in the wind They can accomplish nothing   The mistake was that they did not use monetary policy consistent with that  -68-    3/27/90   Mr Chairman, could we vote on these separately? The Exchange Stabilization Fund, it seems to me, is a somewhat different question than the $25 billion   I don't see why that needs confrontation   Mr Chairman, I certainly don't want to put you in a position of in a sense not having the authority you need to go to the G-7 or to the Treasury to work [unintelligible] From the very beginning on this I've wanted to take actions that strengthen your hand, not those that cause you to be disempowered I think that's very important I do believe there's another alternative I believe the first question we need to face is the Exchange Stabilization Fund That was created by an act of Congress Is that true, Virgil?  [MR MATTINGLY(?)] Yes   All right And in a sense there was an appropriation of money, maybe out of another fund?   Nevertheless, it was an act of Congress that made the funds available But it's also true is it not, Virgil, that there is some question in regard [to the warehousing]? That is, our engaging in foreign exchange operations is, we believe, something that we have sound grounds on As our attorney you can say we can go with that one But you don't know whether we have sound grounds in regard to the warehousing, do you? You don't know in a court that we could win on that one, do you?   But I want to understand what the constitutional principles involved here are, or the law   No, I'm not talking about operations  SPEAKER(?) All three   No, I wasn't asking about the history I'm asking you as our General Counsel I don't know the answer to this question I'm asking you as General Counsel Is there a reasonable prospect that if it came to court, that we would win in court? Or is there some doubt on the warehousing?   But it has never been tested before?   Well,--   But my view goes beyond that to say that I believe the Constitution gives the Congress of the United States the power to appropriate I believe for us to do warehousing, which in a sense removes from Congress this appropriation power, is at best a [legally] risky proposition I know that I've voted in the past for increasing the warehousing authority, but I didn't know what I was  -74-    3/27/90  doing in voting for such a proposition But now that I know that in doing that it eliminates the necessity for the Treasury to go to the Congress to get an appropriation, I can't do that as a matter of principle until the courts tell me that we can Now, the courts told me on another issue that I thought was an issue but--   On the SDR certificates?   But, you see, I'm worried that the Shadow Open Market Committee and others are waiting to pounce because when you hold currencies in the size that we hold them, at some point in time you're going to have some losses   And I believe that in that atmosphere at some point in time this is apt to become a political issue And if it becomes a political issue, I believe it is incumbent upon us to protect the Federal Reserve's position, which is not to go around the Congressional appropriation that other warehousing would tend to do   But I do not believe that members of the Appropriations Committee understand this issue I do not think that they know their appropriations power is being subverted by our warehousing arrangement And I for one choose to stand in the more  -75-    3/27/90  pure position which is to say if in doubt, let's ask the Treasury to go to the Congress And when the Treasury goes to Congress and the Congress appropriates the funds or if the Congress passes a law saying [it is appropriate] for us to be warehousing them, then the Federal Reserve's risk is gone   Well, but I don't see that the present arrangement really has proved superior to that We either make some gain here, Mr Chairman--because if that's what we wish to accomplish, we would never have ended up with a $45 billion fund if our view had been very persuasive   Well, it goes beyond that The fund has become so large that it does have a risk; in a sense it puts us in a position of what I would call speculating in foreign currencies because it goes beyond what it seems to me is the demonstrated need as a reserve currency country for us to have this facility [to conduct] our operations   But, Jerry, we are the reserve currency of the world and that's quite different than other countries who [unintelligible] have to look to a dollar exchange standard and historically held--   Well, I prefer to take the cautious view   And yet we would know--   Well, yes But if we're going to surface them, why don't we surface them before we do it? Why are we waiting until it's a fait accompli before we surface them?   If we have a reasonable chance, it's going to be on the Exchange Stabilization Fund in the immediate future If we're going to ask about it, we better ask them now   Now we're claiming that is an open market operation, as I understand it Is that correct?  SPEAKER(?) Collateralized [RP]   Is that what we're claiming? So what we're claiming is that the Exchange Stabilization Fund is a foreign exchange operation Now, do we do that on Treasuries? When we buy do we buy new Treasury issues from the Treasury or do we buy them from--?   In exchange for maturing issues But we never buy new Treasury issues directly because we're not sure we have the power to do that kind of an open market operation, is that correct?   Okay So, we don't have the power to do that open market operation and now everyone tells me we do have the power to do this operation because we've done it in the past and nobody's caught us on it?   But it's not open market operations   Well, Ed, I'm not seeking a confrontation with the Treasury I simply want the Treasury to go to the Congress and get the appropriation power I don't agree with the rest of you who have opinions about the political outcome as to what the political outcome will be   Of course they won't do that   Well, the Treasury is not going to go to Congress over this issue I feel certain they will not   No   An extension of that limit--   Mike, if you pursued a gradual reduction in the rate of inflation, it's quite likely, isn't it, that the noise may at times obscure any trend of progress? That's more apt to happen in a gradual reduction approach than if there were a significant recession   So, even though in some ways this may not give the Committee a sense of a lot of achievement, you think it would be different than that if we did not pursue this course?    5/15/90   Well, I appreciate very much your laying out the policy options for us that you have   Yes, Mr Chairman, we do have some good news out there that I think we ought to talk about We only did $50 million in foreign exchange intervention during the intermeeting period and I'm most grateful for that In fact, I'm so grateful that I didn't even talk about the ESF after having an antagonizing document in front of me But there's more good news than that I counted out about 15 segments of industries in which expansion seems to be the order of the day Quite often, I think we become somewhat impacted by those that are having the pain; those industries having a slowdown are more vocal than those in which things are looking up I was used to that with farmers always describing things as mediocre or middling during times when we had boom conditions and most of the rest of time describing conditions as poor In terms of the small business outlook, I think we had a diffusion index this morning that demonstrated the same sort of thing that is, if you have as many people saying the outlook is positive as you have saying that it's negative, then it's really boom conditions So, I think we have to steel ourselves to the fact that there is going to be some pain out there And, of course, when that pain involves people getting used to house prices not rising as in the  -22-    5/15/90  past, and in some cases coming down, we're going to feel that and see that But that may be better news in regard to attitudes about money than we realize When people see house prices going up 15 percent per year, I'm not sure whether that in some ways undermines their sense of value for money And when all of a sudden the peak on selling their house passed, a lot of people said "My goodness! Why didn't I sell it earlier?" It's sort of an attitude of I want money; I'd like to have dollar balances  So, I think this kind of pain may be a precursor for some better inflation numbers The fact of the matter is, however, that there are some troublesome things on the inflation front Basically, commodity prices are still rather troublesome, as far as I can see I don't care what index you look at, unless you get into some very specialized ones, there does not seem to be the kind of improvement that you'd expect to see Look at corn prices, soybean prices Wheat prices went up because there was an announcement of a large increase But it really is a troublesome indication to see commodity prices move up as much as they did and then not move back down I would agree that at a time when the pain seems to be pervasive in many households, and when M2 and M3 seem to be growing very, very slowly, that information ought not be ignored I'd like to close by suggesting, when we are talking about a soft landing, that in any way the landing occurs it certainly has been soft but there is an element in which an airplane wing as it approaches the ground gets what we call "ground effect" Ground effect means that you have an opportunity to have more lift than you otherwise would have because of the proximity of the ground As we're approaching the 90th month of this expansion, we haven't had any abrupt pullups that might result in stalled spins because after a stalled spin the wind does not produce much ground effect as the plane comes crashing in   But the implication is that I think we have to be prepared to understand that our economy may have more ability to operate below 2 percent for longer periods of time without getting into negative numbers To me that's an encouraging bit of news I, for one, do not believe that there are factors out there that are producing a recession in the immediate horizon   I'm somewhat tempted, Mr Chairman, to counterbalance by having a governor vote for tightness to offset Mr Hoskins' dissent so that we don't continue this issue about presidents versus governors on the tightening side But I guess that really wouldn't be a logical basis for me to cast my vote I would note that of the presidents who are voting only two out of five of them could muster a tightness in their [policy stance] But of the ones who are not voting, four out of five can muster tightness, which I think probably is what gives the presidents the reputation for being hawks You presidents really are hawks when you don't have a vote!   It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that you are correct that there is some uncertainty right now And that uncertainty is such that, even though I'm in the mood to tighten and I was hoping we would be tightening, I do believe that it would be much better for us to wait a couple of weeks and see what happens in that time We could act at that point in time rather than run the risk of tightening and then have conditions go in such a direction that our credibility is lost on the other side and that we would not be able to do what we need to do when we have to do it So, in that sense, I'm very sympathetic with your position, Mr Chairman I certainly understand why prudence is in that direction I would prefer that the directive would read tighten now, but I can vote in the affirmative with the understanding that we're very close together with some consensus here which says that we deem this attack against inflation to be a very high priority; that we think following that priority gives the economic expansion more of an opportunity to develop and to strengthen and to lengthen than not to do it; that we are steeled to be ready to do what has to be done some time in the future; and that that is not to be deterred because there's a little bit of pain [involved] I had been hoping we could get there in a painless way but, frankly, what I have learned in 4-1/4 years tells me it's tougher than I thought I know from the experience in 1986 that once we've eased it sometimes takes a lot longer for us to change direction to tighten than it does to stop tightening and ease, because everybody likes to ease I just have a very strong compulsion at this point to  -32-    5/15/90  be looking for an opportunity to get the fed funds rate up to where I think it ought to be I'd be much more satisfied with an 8-3/4 percent fed funds rate than with an 8-1/4 percent rate I just don't think today is the time to do it I certainly hope we'll be ready to do it when we need to   Well, I don't get credit for it Alternative B, asymmetric   I was a little struck, Jerry, when you said that we could knock consumer spending off in the wrong direction; I was rather startled by that That's a new worry, because I presume you meant it might be knocked down And, of course, if it is knocked down that means the saving rate is higher, and it means we would be getting this long-awaited adjustment in household behavior I think it's an adjustment that comes quite naturally, given what has been showing up in the housing sector It's quite clear that during most of the post-World War II economy, American households one-by-one went from better to worse [unintelligible] The last old word was that the more money you borrowed to buy a house, the more money you made; and the only sad thing was that you didn't buy a bigger house Of course, farmers learned that if you borrowed money to buy land or machinery, you made more money; and the oil people learned that if you borrowed more money to drill holes in the ground, you made more money One-by-one all of these notions have bit the dust; housing in a sense is the last one So, I'm somewhat optimistic that the US saving rate will stay at the 6 percent level, whereas the staff is forecasting that it will fall back to 5-1/4 percent So in this new environment of opportunity, we get just what we've been asking for for a long time It does appear that what everybody said--that real interest rates do not determine savings rates--was wrong, like most everything else we were taught And it does appear that we're making some real progress  Now, my forecast is somewhat weaker on nominal and real GNP than the staff's, but not as much as you would think, given my 6 percent saving rate, because I do anticipate that the export sector is going to continue [to support domestic output] I have a great deal [unintelligible] and if we have more capacity opportunities and we have rather low profit margins in the domestic sector I think our economy is responding in rather an amazing way I just note that hardly anyone talks about the fact that the trade deficit and the current account deficit now are projected to be less than half of what they were at the highest point And it does seem quite likely now, from my perspective of course, that we're going to move into a balance-of-trade surplus position before my term is over So it just looks to me as if--   It's a secret! I know this sounds too optimistic for most of you but I'll add to it by joining in with Si Keehn, Tom Melzer, Gary Stern, and Bob Black I also believe that 1991 is the year that we will get the rather dramatic move on inflation numbers The way the numbers are set I think the year-over- year CPI is not going to change much from the present 42 to 44 percent level until about next January And then all of a sudden I think we're going to be seeing 3 percent numbers But you better discount that, because I've been saying that the last two years!   Yes Even though I proposed eliminating M3, and I hold that position as the proper policy, I do not believe this is the right time to make that move I think it would signal something we don't want to signal or to deal with at this time In regard to the 1990 ranges, I wish to reaffirm the ranges adopted previously I believe it's better for us to look at the target ranges as targets that we're planning to hit, based upon the assumptions we had at the beginning of the year, and then explain why we didn't hit them than it is for us to move the targets to hit the growth path So, I am not-- and never have been before--very open to changing at mid-year On the 1991 ranges, I agree with Bob Black that strategy II is the only alternative that's consistent with our stated objectives Frankly, I wonder why I wasn't able to see a year ago that M2 growth might not be larger But I really anticipated a somewhat weaker economy this year than we really ended up with, and my guess was that we might need the 3 to 7 percent for this year But it seems to me that the behavior of households has changed and that many households, for example, find that they probably want to hold smaller balances and hold less non- tax-exempt interest-rate debt And as the consumer saving rate has risen, that in a way brings with it a desire to hold a lower balance largely because of consumers' intolerance for debt, which I think finally has caught up It does seem to me also that there may be other behavioral changes in people's willingness to hold M2 So I believe it's quite consistent to choose alternative I and alternative II and to choose for 1991 2 to 6 percent for M2 Now, I would also choose 2 to 6 percent for M3 on the basis that I have a commitment to only lower these ranges and never to raise them And even though we may think that 0 to 4 percent makes sense for M3 for alternative II for 1991, I would hate to see us chase it down to that aberration and then end up moving it back So, I prefer to leave the consistency of 2 to 6 percent for both M2 and M3 I recognize that there could be a scenario developed in which M2's growth path in 1991 might push the upper boundary of that 2 to 6 percent; that kind of risk is there I'm very, very pleased, Mr Chairman, that we've been able to get M2 growth down from those 9-1/2 percent [rates] that we had in 1985 and 1986 and to squeeze that M2 growth down without ever having the monetary shock that all of our critics thought we were producing We're looking at four-year average growth of M2 of 5 percent, three- year average growth of M2 of 4-1/2 percent, two-year growth of M2 of about 42 percent, and one-year growth, I suppose, of less than 5 percent right now So, we have the one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year all there together and we're going to be able to get it to the 2 to 6 percent range without a monetary shock It's just almost an ideal situation On the debt, I'd use 5 to 9 percent  -30-    7/2-3/90   I doubt you'd be very successful "Fedspeak" is too much a part of you!   Both years?   You want 4 to 8 percent for 1991?   Well, for 1991 it's 4 to 8 percent   Mr Chairman, since the other items seem to be compromises, I wonder why there isn't room for a compromise on M3, as the Vice Chairman of the Committee suggested That is, the 1 to 5 percent range does accommodate what we expect to happen in 1990, I think, and it increases the odds for those of us who do not want to vote for an increase in the range to have a better chance of not having to do so You did not have a majority vote, as I counted, on the 0 to 4 percent   So, I'm just wondering why we couldn't take the compromise between those of us who are for 2 to 6 percent and those who are for 0 to 4 percent and come out with 1 to 5 percent   Well, getting into this is a kind of trap I just think that this will pose a problem for you when you start using that language up on the Hill I think your suggestion is a great idea   I'd use the least language possible   No, take it out   I'd say "more than anticipated" period   Now, Mr Chairman, I presume that has the 0 to 4 percent range for [M3]?   Mr Chairman, I move to substitute 1 to 5 percent for 0 to 4 percent in paragraph 29   Then we won't have to record it I don't think this is the kind of vote that we would want to record   Mr Chairman, I would move to amend the 0 to 4 percent on M3 to read 1 to 5 percent   Four  SPEAKER(?) You have 9 voters in here   Five to five   Well, I appreciate what President Stern has said It really is a very important difference for me, Mr Chairman, because I do want to vote with you on this I would admit that I'm not able to discern so accurately the need to stay symmetric versus the possibility that incoming data will tell us that we need to ease I would prefer symmetric language but I can compromise away from that if we are going to be looking at the data and, if the data coming in say that we ought to subsequently make a decision to ease, I can go with that But I cannot go with the notion here that we really are going to ease, because if we really are going to ease, we might as well do it now and then those of us who are going to vote "no" can vote "no" And I will just vote "no"   So, I suggest that we not put into "Fedspeak" all this new language that the Vice Chairman is about to introduce in regard to super ease I really don't think we need to fine tune our language My understanding, based upon what you said, is that we're going to be recommending that we have no change in policy, alternative "B," which I can support with the "mights" tilted [toward ease] I    7/2-3/90  can go with that I don't want to make too much over little differences, but I do believe strongly that we have reached a point where we're just about to succeed in something that we've been trying to get done You put it so well last year when you talked about the view that we have to err on the side of restraint All of us know that there is risk in doing that I want to continue to err on the side of restraint, but I definitely do not want to get this economy into recession I want us to reap the fruits of what we're about to [achieve], and I think the sooner we move the more likely the bond markets are to misinterpret and say that the Fed really gave up before we were there I think the whole [issue] is that attitudes concerning inflation are at a very delicate point I noted in the staff's laying out of strategy II on the long-run model, that in 1995 that results in the highest real GNP growth of any of the alternatives Now, I just think it happens faster I think the whole monetary world works faster than it ever worked before And if we really stand here and are prepared to do what needs to be done, I believe we'll get lower long-term interest rates Frankly, one reason that we got into slow money growth is because we lowered the fed funds rate in December, ran the long bond rates up 70-80 basis points, and the opportunity cost [of] the M2 balances has [risen] so that the shortfall of our aggregates is due entirely to our premature ease in December   Well, I do   Well, you see, what has happened is that the opportunity cost on the M2 balances has changed and then you get the lagged effect of that change from March and you get low growth of M2 in May My view is that we need the lowest long-term interest rates we can get for the second half of 1990 And I happen to think that being patient here for a [while] will get us lower rates than we will get if we jump the gun on easing   Well, I think we're closer in that respect too   I'm somewhat impatient for patience   It does seem that looking at the real economy provides some benchmark that we can use to make our estimates about the future But, certainly, the latest revisions make it very clear that, when some quarters in 1989 that were originally around 3 percent are revised to 17 percent, we have to be very careful about thinking about that kind of precision I am somewhat optimistic about the real economy in regard to the performance of net exports I think the strong current dollar net exports in the second quarter will certainly switch to very strong real net exports in the third and fourth quarters, as the price patterns in the second quarter reverse  The monetary aggregates now have fallen into the category of being interesting I used to think they were much more than interesting, having had four years in which the growth of the aggregates has been down, with M2 below 5 percent Whether you're measuring M2 over four years, three years, two years, or one year, its  -26-    8/21/90  growth is very close to 4-1/2 percent But the fact of the matter is, according to the staff forecast, we're probably going to end up with the highest year-over-year CPI inflation since 1981 That means the results in nine years have been better than the results this year Certainly, for an old fashioned monetarist that gives one pause Now, that doesn't mean that the monetary aggregates are not important; it probably just means that we have to look to somewhat lower M2 growth rates to achieve our objective than we first thought necessary We can also look at real interest rates, which I think are a very crude check in regard to distinguishing between periods in which monetary policy is apparently very easy, as it was in the 1970s, versus the real interest rates that prevailed in the 1980s, which in general were in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range Certainly, it seems likely, given the tax changes with regard to the deductibility of interest, that those real interest rates are consistent with inducing a change in household savings patterns And in a sense, I think all of us ought to be much more enthused than we are regarding the level of consumer spending It seems to me that the saving rate in the United States is not too high and that, consequently, some rise in the saving rate-- which means a diminution in the rate of growth of consumer spending-- is exactly what the doctor would order  Now, it seems to me that a look at forward-looking indicators really can [help one] begin to pinpoint a bit better when monetary policy has been easy and when it has been restrained And those forward-looking indicators clearly show that monetary policy in 1988 and after maybe the first three quarters of 1989 were indicative of rather significant restraint Whether you're looking at commodity prices, the yield curve, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar, you get a confirmation of the fact that the money growth prevailing at that time did not enable enough liquidity to be out there to support upward movements of commodity prices and it supported the exchange value of the dollar But, frankly, it seems to me that over the last nine months we have moved--though not from a monetaristic determined way of looking at monetary policy--from monetary restraint to monetary ease I don't think it has been an abrupt move; I think it has been a very gradual move And we probably have not altered the real interest rates significantly, or so dramatically as to [foster] too much expansion in the period ahead But I think it is quite apparent that the yield curve is indicating that participants in the real market are suggesting that the appropriate rates of interest are higher than we may be providing Certainly, [that can be seen in] commodity prices The staff did me the favor in Chart 7 of indexing these commodity prices to the first quarter of 1986, which is in some way a little embarrassing for me because I talked about keeping those commodity prices within a range of 10 percent up or 10 percent down from where they were in the first quarter And when I look at all commodities, the index at almost 140 means that we had an 8 percent annual growth rate over a 4-1/2 year period All commodities except crude oil show a 5 percent annual rate of gain; and that's not stability in those prices So monetary restraint does not seem to be characteristic of this era When you look at the bottom chart, all commodities except food and crude oil--which takes out some of the variabilities of agricultural policy--it looks like we have had a very significant trend line of rising prices over the last 11 months So, there's nothing there that gives me any indication that monetary policy at this moment is too restrained Indeed, if the foreign exchange value of the dollar continues to fall at the rate it has been falling--since  -27-    8/21/90  really over the last 10 months--it's a rather significant event, which with the recent movements in gold prices I think could be an outright devaluation And that only occurs during periods of monetary ease, not monetary restraint So, I'm somewhat of the view that we have already eased And I'm of the view that that ease, if it takes hold prior to the time that we get a breakout of the rate of inflation from the rut we have been in on the down side, is going to give us one heck of a problem in the years ahead   I'm encouraged by your confidence in M2 and, Mr Chairman, I want to believe you're right I think [your proposal] is in a somewhat acceptable range and I certainly do agree that we need to have more information to move Although somewhat satisfied with the range that you stated, my preference would actually be "B" with a tilt toward restraint But I don't know that that restraint would need to take place by an increase in interest rates I just believe that there's some confusion in the marketplace in regard to what it is that we are about And if there were some way of communicating your call for stability, and that includes price level stability, then I believe that we would have a much better chance to get long-term  -38-    8/21/90  interest rates down My guess is that if we were to move the fed funds rate up 25 basis points that that would be quite a surprise and that it would be taken as an indication of our not accommodating this oil price phenomenon And frankly, I would expect long bond rates to come down as much as short-term rates go up Now, I realize it's a lot easier to suggest that when you're not Chairman than it is when you are, but that's my guess In periods of low growth in which the housing industry is under such a serious restraint that it does make other consumer goods areas vulnerable to the downturn, it is important to have lower long-term rates; and those lower long-term rates come with reduced inflation expectations I believe if the world knows the Federal Reserve stands as the guardian of the value of the US dollar in purchasing goods and services in our market, which also includes a stable value of the dollar abroad, then we would do wonders for interest rates and actually increase the chances for the higher real growth that I think some of you would like to see   One   Mr Chairman, Wayne Angell I agree with your assessment The money numbers look better than they looked at the time of the FOMC meeting and the foreign exchange value of the dollar looks even more precarious than it did then Not to follow your advice and to make an easing move at this point really could [lead to] a devastating kind of market reaction To me it would be unthinkable to make that move, so I support your position   It seems to me that this slowdown is not primarily a typical end-of-period monetary induced event That is, it's a rather unusual event, given that we are 15 months into a period of the Federal Reserve bringing short-term rates down Now, I think that means that we probably don't have as much monetary ability to maneuver since it's not a monetary-induced event And given what Jerry Corrigan said about the exchange value of the dollar and what others have said about long-term interest rates, a move that shows a lack of Fed credibility on the price level objective simply will cause the rate of interest that the money market will insist on to be higher over the period ahead than we wish it to be So, ironically, in order to have rates be lower we must not make the move until we get a climate for the dollar and a climate for inflation that is better than what we see at the present time   Mike, following up on David Mullins' questions in regard to the fourth quarter I note that you have nominal GNP at 26 percent for that quarter If my memory serves me correctly, we hardly had any quarters in the 1981-1982 recession that had nominal GNP that low That 26 percent is an extremely low nominal number I wondered How does V2 on a one-quarter lag basis look with 26 percent? We really have a fair idea, don't we Don, as to where M2 might be in the third quarter relative to the second quarter? We could put that to bed and then take this number [and determine] what kind of a V2 change we would have   Yes   I noticed that   But on the nominal [GNP] there's also a rather significant move back from what looks like a 1990 nominal of about 5 percent That's not for the [calendar] year, but for the Q2-to-Q2 period; then it looks as though it goes from 5 percent nominal to 7 percent nominal But I don't think it needs any more elaboration   There really has not been any money shock that has synchronized all the sectors of the economy and there is no inventory correction cycle underway This is not a recession as generally defined Never before have we had a recession in which monetary policy eased 12 months prior to what somebody says was the likely high point I don't agree that June was, but somebody thinks it was It clearly is a synchronized slowdown in the US economy, but it is more in the nature of an event related to buildings and real estate and, consequently, banks and thrifts We have to be careful if we really want to be forward looking, not to look backward at the real economy If you are trying to be forward-looking, that's always a disaster; you can't get ahead by looking backward  Now, I think there are some considerable risks, but those risks are in the years out ahead, not in the 6 months ahead of us The considerable risk is that we will go through this slowdown event and end up with inflation at a rate of 6 or 7 percent and end up with a set of easings that tips the dollar loose I do agree with the analysis of Sam Cross that there still is a safe-haven effect on the dollar The considerable risk is that we will throw the monetary policy tool away before we have the ability to use it I would not enjoy being in a situation of a declining dollar with all that means for future inflation That could then mean that inflation doesn't peak in the third and fourth quarters of 1990; the peak might be out there further ahead So, it seems to me that the exchange value of the dollar is a real restraint on us, but I don't see any reason to admit that to anyone outside this room But I would hate to see us get into a position where we no longer have any potential to do it because we have a spread of 300 or 400 basis points between the Treasury bill rate and the 30-year Treasury It seems to me that under those circumstances then, the fears that people have about downward risks certainly would be justified So, I think there is considerable risk I do believe the US economy has a lot of recuperative ability [Unintelligible]--and I'm not able to tell as well as David is how each of the parts go--but if monetary policy is  -37-    10/2/90  reasonably steady and stable, then I think the adjustment mechanisms can take place and can take place in an environment in which we get some of these corrections made I must admit that when I first came on board I was pleased that we had engaged in monetary policy actions that I think avoided a recession in 1986 But looking back on it, I have a feeling that what has happened in Boston and in New England and elsewhere would not have been carried to such excesses, if we had let a correction take place a little earlier So, I'm just urging caution   Sam, what would be the odds of the dollar engaging in a significant downward move if we stand pat on policy-- that is, take the third alternative?   So, we could be somewhat encouraged to believe that it might be stable or even slightly strong again?   For the Federal Reserve and commercial banks it's a scheduled holiday   We don't know how to read M2, and certainly we don't know how to read it disaggregated That's nonsense   I'm arguing that we do not have sufficient knowledge about where the increased liquidity is located or whether or not being located one place versus another place makes a difference  -48-    10/2/90   But we do not know that the motive for holding the assets is what affects behavior   But does anybody believe that if someone has $40,000 in a money market mutual fund that he is less apt to buy an automobile than if he had the $40,000 in--   But when the stocks were sold, someone bought the stocks There's no use going on I'm not going to be convinced! [Laughter]   I agree with the decision that Tom Melzer has expressed and I also agree with what Bob Parry has suggested Monetary policy does its job best when it looks at the price level And this is not a monetary event in terms of its cause and it is not a good precedent to have a linkup with fiscal policy It really is the worst form of fine tuning because it is being made on the basis of the real economy and then it is linked up with fiscal policy And it has the potential of being 50 basis points, so I cannot support this policy action   Could we just be asymmetric and then see what happens in the marketplace after the budget deal and then you simply would have the authority [to call for a move]? Or do you feel you'd be in a position of saying yes or no?   Yes   Okay, in other words we will have asymmetric language and it will be simply the Chairman's judgment   But it's sort of like what we had in July?   Okay That's my point   Mr Chairman, in light of our abilities on the funds rate, I wonder whether it would be a little more accurate to pull that range in a bit The 400 basis points--   Okay   Yes   Second   You want to devalue also?   Mr Chairman, I agree that the problem you were referring to is ludicrous, but I do believe that we need to make up our mind by the next meeting about what we're going to do It would be better for us to deal with it before there's a crisis I would like to suggest, Mr Chairman, that the Committee be open to your recommendations at our next meeting as to what--   Well, I wasn't really thinking about gold I was thinking about our collateral problem I believe that we ought not to wait until we need to make a loan and then at that time have to deal with this It would be far better for us to make up our mind ahead of time than to wait until we need to make a discount window loan The time we need to make a discount window loan is going to be the worst time to make the changes   Well, I wasn't thinking of anything quite that large, but--   It's the law We would either have to send the letter back to Congress and say we don't mean to do it anymore or we'd have to get rid of some foreign currency holdings Or we have another suggestion--   Mr Chairman, since we have some policy considerations ahead of us, I would support waiting until that is done before we deal with this issue   Well, it does seem to me that there might be one alternative that would get us a little more volatility in the fed funds rate And if we did have more volatility in the fed funds rate, then the 4 percent range specified could be a clear indication of what we were doing Now, it may be unlikely that there will be a majority who would wish to do that   If we are willing to admit we're targeting the fed funds rate   Mr Chairman, I'm sorry I brought it up   Well, all the "somewhats" and "slights" and "mights" in the operational paragraph imply that we might do something   Mike, on the personal saving rate, how much of that oil tax hike was absorbed by the personal saving rate?  -16-    11/13/90   Our analytics tell us that consumer spending should be weak And consumer sentiment looks like it's in a free fall But the data we have don't yet show it, is that right?   I've been noticing as I've been listening to the comments around the table that in reflecting we quite often use the words symmetric and asymmetric And I've been thinking that there's somewhat of a lack of symmetry in regard to the way we're approaching two quarters of expected growth below where we'd like it to be I have a feeling that if we had [in prospect] two quarters of growth above where we would want it to be, there wouldn't be near the kind of alarm and the wondering about how we're going to get it down three quarters from now so we only have two quarters of boom But you can't have six quarters or seven or eight quarters that are stronger than you want and then turn around and have two that are less than you want and come out with anything like price stability Some of you talk as if the worst case scenario is that we might not get this recession, if we're in one And I'm about as sure as David Mullins is on that; it clearly is very soft But some of you are worried that we're not going to get out of it in two quarters The only recession that I remember that was five or six months in length didn't make a single bit of difference in regard to the underlying rate of inflation This is not an event induced by a monetary shock event It might be a culmination of monetary restraint, but it's not a monetary shock event And if we try to jab our way out with a monetary reaction, we might very well find ourselves worse off than we were before In other words, I think we have to have more confidence that the system will work and that we don't have to have a policy that in a sense is countercyclical; we just have to avoid policy that's procyclical, because I believe that the recovery forces in the kind of economy we have out there will be in place So, I'm a little more worried about balancing our way back out of it before we get the imbalances corrected If we're in a recession and it takes three or four quarters to get out and we get the price level thing together, then it seems to me that we have a much better chance to avoid what we most wish to avoid  I think the question is Can we get out of this situation without having a downside event? And it seems to me a downside event is not now in place It seems to me that we run the risk of having some other events take place which could cause destabilization in  -37-    11/13/90  financial markets, and that's when we're going to be in real difficulty I think That's why I join with those who worry about the foreign exchange value of the dollar We are a reserve currency country that has a good deal of the world's claims that rest with us And the global ability to take one's money and go is much more volatile than I think we've ever experienced before So, to get ourselves in a position in which our rate of inflation is higher and our interest rates are dramatically lower than those of major competitive reserve currency countries--and if we begin to move dramatically on policy in that kind of environment--seems to me is most likely to precipitate a destabilization of markets Now, I agree that the financial situation and financial institutions pose risks and I don't favor interest rate targeting But clearly if we have an end of the year kind of event, interest rate targeting might be exactly what keeps that from getting out of hand in a sense, Mr Chairman That is, interest rate targeting in that kind of environment does mean that we might end up supplying a few more reserves at the end of the year than we may be anticipating doing So, my view is that the foreign exchange value of the dollar will be okay even if it drifts downward in an environment in which price level corrections are evident to all That is, if we see the rate of inflation really coming around and if we have commodity prices that are deflating, then in that atmosphere I believe we can have considerable ease without being disruptive But I think it's pretty risky for us to get too premature with all that   Mr Chairman, I can live with your formulation because it seems to me that you placed the emphasis upon the tenuousness of the situation And it does not indicate that, except under the best conditions, we would go farther I would comment in regard to M2 that I could very well support a regime in which you announce and thus the whole world knew what we were doing with M2 and would thereby not conceive of it as an easing Because in a sense, if we were on an M2 regime, this would not be an easing And I think the foreign exchange markets might interpret it as not being an easing I have a little difficulty with--   Yes, I know I have a little difficulty trying to blend this formulation of policy with that one because it's hard for the foreign exchange markets to know exactly what it is we're doing But the bottom line is I could live with your formulation   In a sense you didn't want to change the directive; you wanted to leave it the way it was?   But basically, you have a kind of balance in your recommendation, which is a little unusual   Why do that?   I think looking at the M2 growth is always a good place to start It seems to me that there is clearly a very significant downtrend over a four-year period in the growth rate of the monetary aggregates But so far there has not been what you would call a classical monetary shock; that is, the rate of growth actually has been brought down in a very gradual pattern It is true that the rate of growth over 26 weeks is now getting close to a level at which I think anyone would be concerned if that were to continue to weaken on a 26-week basis But I would just note that in 1987 and 1989 we had almost identical periods of weakness on a 26-week basis Clearly, we ought not ignore what those monetary aggregates are saying But I would note, as Tom Melzer did to a degree, that the yield curve doesn't really suggest that we have a monetary tightness phenomenon that's being driven by the central bank; that is, the slow [money] growth is not driving short-term rates above money market rates We have just the opposite The yield curve basically shows that there is  -20-    12/18/90  quite a bit of monetary liquidity out there The foreign exchange market also I think shows considerable monetary easing; that is, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy for the United States is increasingly through the foreign exchange mechanism Certainly we've had a considerable, 15 percent decline, of the dollar against the G-10 currencies That is a factor for domestic stimulus Commodity prices it seems to me are showing more money neutrality than they are monetary restraint That is, you have some fall-back in commodity prices, but you don't have the rate of deflation in commodity prices that set in during the 1985-1986 era and that really became pervasive  Of the factors that we have going for us, the two factors I'd like to mention that are difficult to judge are the phenomena of house prices and other real estate Unfortunately, there's no futures market for housing But I think we ought to begin thinking about housing and other real estate more as if they were a commodity, because clearly what has been happening here is really [similar] to what happened in the agricultural depression of the mid-1980s, which was a rather short, sharp depression in agriculture What we see happening is that the forward price is not rising as fast as it was expected to have been rising before Now, if someone has a 10-year horizon and expects house prices to rise at a 10 percent annual rate, that would mean a $100,000 house would be worth $269,000 in 10 years But if all of a sudden you think it will rise not at 10 percent but at a 5 percent rate, then instead of $269,000 you're looking at $163,000 for the 10-year forward price That means that the forward price has to come down about 37 to 40 percent If the forward price comes down faster than long-term interest rates, then of course the present value is also going to fall But that doesn't mean that housing inflation is gone; it just means an adjustment from a 10 percent housing inflation environment to a 5 percent housing inflation environment What makes this so tricky is that houses have so much to do with household perceptions of wealth Consequently, household saving behavior is certainly impacted I think all of us understand that we're seeing a long-cycle event in regard to attitudes here  The other area of uncertainty, it seems to me, relates to the fact that the US economy is increasingly competitive in a global marketplace The international competition just means that there will not be sustained profit margins in any industry such as there were in former times when there was less vigorous international competition Now, the problem that concerns me here is the advent of failure and whether or not we might be falling into a turnaround in an expansion in an international economic order and we turn that into a protectionist world in which international trade stops growing That event then, of course, could lead the world into a most precarious circumstance In that regard I think we should be rather careful about policies that might cause the foreign exchange value of the dollar to weaken further, which in some sense can be a very strong motivating factor in regard to protectionism elsewhere We have enough protectionist forces in the United States And when we start seeing these protectionist forces hit the European Economic Community, as I think is entirely possible where the foreign exchange value of the dollar is right now, it means that we're going to crowd in there at a rate that they're not going to like--not just in agriculture but in other areas So, that's an uncertainty that causes me to think more than once  -21-    12/18/90   Yes, Don, I just wanted to comment Of course, the problem that occurs by the Federal Open Market Committee moving away from the borrowing targeting is that we thereby take away the separation between the discount rate decision, which is the Board of Governors decision with the recommendations of the Reserve Bank boards as a factor If the Federal Open Market Committee really were to choose a fed funds target precisely--if we said we want it to be 7 percent, say--then under those circumstances there is no monetary power left with the Board of Governors and Reserve Bank District boards as we'd normally see As long as we maintain the charade of a borrowing targeting then that separation of function can still be there, it seems to me That is, as long as we write the FOMC minutes based upon the charade of borrowing then the old practice can still be there   Well, I don't want to get into a discussion about the discount rate I can argue both sides of that  -31-    12/18/90   But I do think in this discussion we ought to recognize that it might be desirable--that is, the Committee and the Board may wish to consider maintaining a policy that does not wipe out this distinction we've historically used And I would not be for that kind of a change [unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, but I just want to be sure that we're maintaining as best we can the fine line I wonder if you could accommodate that to mean that we would be voting here for alternative B symmetric toward ease, and then you as Chairman of the Committee would have some discretion over the intermeeting period, particularly as you sat with the Board of Governors in regard to the discount rate   Here again, I'm thinking that the way policy runs and has run over the last several years is that at some period of time the Federal Open Market Committee has the balance of power That is, during periods in which interest rates are increasing, ordinarily the fed funds rate moves up as pressures are put on the fed funds rate In a sense the Reserve Bank directors and the Board of Governors have a standby policy And even [when the rate is] on the way down that's also the case Now, on the way up a point is reached where the distance between the fed funds rate and the discount rate gets so wide that no one is willing to allow that kind of a subsidy, so then the balance swings to the Reserve Bank directors and the Board of Governors And until someone convinces me otherwise, I would favor maintaining that [balance] And I would favor the FOMC saying at this point in time that the direction of interest rates downward now largely rests with the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks and with the Board of Governors In a sense it's kind of a flip-flop I think we ought to hear a debate on that question and see if there's a better way to do it   No, I was suggesting that with our asymmetry toward ease we delegate to the Chairman the decision as to whether or not the full 50 points show through or only 25 show through I'm just trying to keep it technical so that the FOMC is only talking about the so-called pressure or [existing] pressure between the fed funds rate and the discount rate But in the intermeeting period, given the uncertainty in the FOMC about what the Board will do, the Chairman would have the discretionary authority And if the Board chose not to move the discount rate, the Chairman then could go ahead and immediately move the fed funds rate by 25 basis points So, I'm not talking about any difference in outcome in terms of what the Chairman is suggesting; I'm just talking about the technical manner   Well, I think the Chairman has made it clear that he would expect to move the fed funds rate   I'm not talking about any change in outcome from what the Chairman is proposing   Mr Chairman, I think the FOMC ought to talk about the distance between the fed funds rate and the discount rate, and they ought to be advising us along with the boards of directors And I think the Board of Governors should decide this question   Any time we've moved the discount rate, except September 3 of 1987, we've moved the fed funds rate the same amount as the discount rate   I understand that and as I suggested, Jerry, there's another side of that issue In regard to that relationship I feel exactly as you do   Mr Chairman, I would like to comment on the monetary policy question rather than the technical one that I spoke to earlier My position is just about exactly identical with Tom Melzer's We have quite a few more months of rather unpleasant news ahead of us And if anyone is under the illusion that there are not going to be pressures to reduce the fed funds rate and the discount rate in January, and February, and March-- It seems to me that we have at least three more months of rather bad news because in spite of all the manifestations from looking at M2 I really believe that most of the members of the Committee are looking at the real economy And there's always a lag in regard to the information on the real economy That's why the Chairman was suggesting the problem in regard to our overshooting Now, I hope that this time around, Tom, there will be the votes to make the rather dramatic move, which may have to be made if you look at the forward looking indicators--the money stock, commodity prices, and the yield curve We could find ourselves in a position where we have to tighten before we have any real evidence that the economy has recovered And I think that's going to be very difficult to do So, Mr Chairman, I can go along with this, but my decided preference is to go much slower than 75 basis points a quarter And I mean 75 basis points a quarter If we continue to do that, at some point we're going to find out what the Foreign Desk warned us about the problem of the dollar It's almost as if there's a willingness to walk us there and we're going to find that we're  -42-    12/18/90  going to be blindfolded; we're going to walk in the dark and sometime we're going to find it And that frankly scares me So, I'm very uncomfortable voting to do what we're doing I do hope that the votes are going to be there when it is necessary and the time comes to tighten   But, Jerry, my view is that in the last quarter of 1986 everything really took off and we really ignored all those events Every money market watcher knew in March of 1987 what had happened and market interest rates soared and soared twice as much as what we did   Yes   On line 21-- I'm sorry, I may be ahead   I think lines 21-23 as proposed risk the mistake of our saying that the inflation is okay Do I have the wrong one? It is dated December 18th It says "Consumer prices continue to increase moderately" My view is that it would be better to say that consumer prices are rising moderately as compared to the rather strong rise that occurred in the first nine months of the year I'm afraid this will be interpreted as meaning that we think consumer prices during 1990 have been okay   That's fine   Mr Chairman, I think your words were that we had no choice   I'm presuming that we are talking ex post about a decision that has been made   This discussion is really reflecting on a decision that already has been made And it seems to me that there ought to be no thought whatsoever of not supporting that decision I did want to suggest, however, that I feel you had a choice in that the directive does not list money growth as the first item If the directive had had money growth as the first item, then I think you would hardly have had any choice But with price stability as the first item in the directive, I guess I feel you did have a choice   I wasn't speaking so much in terms of the pros and cons of the policy that's there; it just seems to me that you, the Chairman, had the prerogative, given the directive And I think we    1/9/91  understand what it was that you were wishing to accomplish by that move I do believe that the uncertainties in the Middle East already have made reading what we do somewhat more difficult than it otherwise would be That is, looking at the price of gold or the foreign exchange value of the dollar or the bond yield right now is much more difficult in this environment As to what took place yesterday, [we have no way] of knowing what we were seeing from our moves versus what the effects were of all the concentration on war or no war   Yes, but I don't have the feeling that monetary policy is so tenuous There really are quite a few days left in the year for us to make monetary policy moves No matter what the money growth is showing on a week-to-week basis, I think we can afford to take a somewhat longer view So, I don't feel quite as alarmed about what I would expect to be a rather short war period, although I don't know when it will start   Jerry, given what we've seen with regard to the banking industry, with certain banking supervisors appearing on every talk show highlighting the industry's problems and the Congress almost in a panic over not wanting the banking industry to be like the thrift industry, it would seem somewhat likely that in such an environment households and corporations would choose to hold their liquidity balances at different institutions And I would presume that the commercial banking industry would begin suffering in regard to their proportion of liquidity balances just as the thrift industry has Consequently, what I always like to rely upon in regard to measures of liquidity [is] M2 and I have to say that the information value for me has disappeared I'm in no position to [argue with] those who consider this to be a sign of economic weakness I have no way of knowing that that's not precisely correct; but I don't have any way of knowing that it is correct   Oh, you want them separately   I move Mr Greenspan be chairman   I move Mr Corrigan   Mr Chairman, for two years I was rather uncomfortable with this position I am not uncomfortable with this $10 billion request I feel that the Treasury was rather generous in moving in this direction, [based on] the Federal Open Market Committee's objections It seems to me that they gave heed to the size of the fund, which was one basis for the objections The second area that I was objecting to as a matter of principle is no longer valid in that we did call to the attention of the Congress [issues] about the appropriations process If the Congress feels comfortable with the arrangement, I'm certainly on board in this context   It would be pretty radical for us to be willing to say what it is we're really doing!   This event clearly is an event that doesn't happen very often We really haven't seen [in a long time] such a switch in preference from wanting to be leveraged to wanting to have liquidity We haven't seen such a period in which the creditors are not anxious to lend This is a very significant event and it's an event that I don't think we've seen since the 1930s This economy has a lot of factors that make for a very significant departure from the way we went through the events in the 1930s and the way we're going through them today I agree with the staff's estimate in regard to the areas in which there are strengths There are considerable strengths And I tend to believe that of the factors on the export side particularly It seems to me that this $20 billion per year payment from abroad--I don't care how you classify it--is really like an export of a military service If you put that together with the other factors, our balance of payments certainly swings rather dramatically But that swing in the balance of payments does mean that a saving rate move is going to go with it, and certainly the government sector is not going to be the source of that savings And I doubt that the corporate sector is apt to add to that savings So, I tend to think that there is somewhat less robust final demand in the consumer sector than I would expect Frankly, if it occurs in the second quarter and it becomes evident that there are no more interest rate declines, then I would expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar to make a very significant turnaround I would expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar to head back to the highs of 1989 in rapid order That, of course, may then mean that later on we would get a slowdown on the export side There is a significant downside risk that if monetary policy focuses on what I call a fairly weak  -36-    2/5-6/91  economic scenario, monetary policy will not be neutral but in fact could be quite damaging to the spot [dollar] prospects That is the most dangerous event that we're looking at here to have the foreign exchange value of the dollar move into a decided destabilized position, which I think could cause the bond markets and the stock markets to reverse rather rapidly  So, I'm looking at a scenario that I think is somewhat like [what was described by] some of the rest of you, but I tend to believe that monetary policy, if we're not careful, will make it worse rather than better From June of 1989 we've decreased the fed funds rate by 365 basis points; that's a rather significant move But it focuses upon the wrong rate in regard to what ails us The right rate is the rate that the real estate market is facing, which is the long bond rate And now for the first time in a long time we actually have long bond rates lower than they were a year [earlier] And it seems to me that we are in a rather precarious [position] if we believe--and I guess I take this from Gary Stern and many others--that these corrections don't have to take place If we believe that, I think we are mistaken I think the correction with regard to household savings is underway and is going to take place and I think the use of monetary policy to deal with that has to be very, very carefully done so as not to make it worse rather than better If we do not destabilize the situation, it seems to me that the rebound is going to occur There are many factors [signaling] that But if the dollar becomes progressively weaker, I don't think that will help us a bit on exports because in the mood of a war economy, with many countries in recession, that kind of environment could foster protectionist sentiment that could be very, very explosive  So, even though I'm not quite as optimistic on the real side as the staff, I do agree with the staff's [assessment of the] sources of strength; I think they are there And I'm comfortable with that, if we do not harm this situation I would admit that I am rather bullish in that if the Federal Reserve policy doesn't destabilize the situation--and I'm going to sound a little silly perhaps when I say this--I would not be surprised if my forecast of the CPI at 32 percent [is wrong] for 1992 The reason my CPI is so high is because of what the foreign exchange value of the dollar put us through; and once the dollar begins to rebound I can see CPI inflation doing very, very well And then [we could] get the correction that we need, which is mortgage rates in the 7 percent range in order to bring this about where we need it You see, real interest rates cannot be homogenized at this point; there are real interest rates in every market And the real interest rate for houses right now is pretty darn high In a falling real estate market--when one does not expect house prices to rise, and even expects them to fall--real interest rates even after taxes may be extremely high So, I think the key is getting long-term bond rates down; and that's a lot harder than getting short-term rates down   Don, I really have a two-part question I want to precede the question, though, by the comment that I thought this  -39-    2/5-6/91  section in the Bluebook on page 8 and the following pages on long-run strategy was most helpful I thought you put it in the context that is just right for decisionmaking And I'm not trying to set you up for the question You mention on page 10 in that paragraph about in the middle of the page--this is about strategy II--that "nominal interest rates, while higher than in the baseline in the first two years, thereafter move below those in the baseline as inflation comes down more" I didn't see those interest rates in the chart Did I miss that somewhere?   Okay   Okay Could you give me those numbers for 1993 also?   I presume these rates are short-term interest rates?   Now, Don, the tough question, which I've set you up for Could you tell me about the pattern of long rates with those two scenarios? And to make it really tough, I'd like to know the pattern of long rates without credibility and the pattern with, you might say, enough extra effort to bring on credibility   Yes, but what I really want to know about is the second half of '91 Would the long bond rate be higher or lower if you add credibility?   So, in other words, you're saying that the first part of any tightening would give [rise to] expectations of further tightening, which alters the opportunity cost of holding bonds, and thereby bond prices would be somewhat lower than they otherwise would be until the improved inflation effect overcomes it?   And that's where credibility would be so important?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, I'm in agreement with everything you have said I think you put it exactly right, so I'm not going to repeat any of that because I think you hit it right on the mark I'd also like to say, Mr Chairman, that I could detect in Don Kohn's statement not just a pure analysis, but I thought he also was leaning in exactly the same direction that you have indicated   Yes, I am; he's easily influenceable! In going with your outline, I would like to mention that the one thing I disagree with you on is that I think the probability of this scenario is more like 45 percent rather than 15 percent   Oh, at least 15 percent! I'm going to go to 45 percent even though I tend to think the recession is going to be a little longer and the recovery a little shallower But the fact of the matter is that I think we do have ahead of us some more disheartening news on the first quarter Not only do we have the CNN effect, which I think really is there--people have been watching TV more than shopping--but there's also the travel factor I have been at the airport in Zurich and at Heathrow and JFK, and there just isn't anybody there There is a real impact Harrod's runs a beautiful store at Heathrow and they had about 30 sales people and I think 2 customers So, it does seem to me that travel is going to be down sharply; that along with the CNN effect means that the first quarter will be down sharply So, I think we do have some bad news ahead of us and we need to steel ourselves for that  Now, if the staff is correct regarding the bounceback, one thing I do believe is that once the capital markets recognize that the US economy is in a recovery phase, there'll be no more cuts--and possibly increases--in short-term interest rates And I do believe the dollar could have a very sharp bounceback effect once we get past a period of stability So, I did a little calculation We have what --about $56 billion of deutschemarks? Is that close?   I was thinking that we may have a window of, say, 90 days to get rid of 2/3rds of that If we want to get rid of 2/3rds of the deutschemarks we hold--I'm not counting the interest because so far this year the $50 million we've done is only 1/5th of the interest we've earned--we're going to have to sell quite a bit I calculate $620 million per working day over the 90-day period   It really is a very substantial item, and I would suggest that the budget deficit for 1991 does not need to have a huge foreign currency exposure because we've marked the gains up in  -50-    2/5-6/91  1990 on a mark-to-market basis for our payments to the Treasury So, Mr Chairman, I appreciate very much that you have gotten done the $50 million and just would suggest that you carry on with more enthusiasm!   Oh, I was looking at the totals   I was including the Treasury too, but I thought the Treasury probably would want to do the same as we would   But Tom, if we focused on reserves, don't you think that we could end up with a 2 percent fed funds rate rather easily? Are you willing to pay that price?   Mr Chairman, I'm only going to talk about a question of the way that we conduct our business I feel so strongly about this issue that, if we're going to do it, I'd really want to have a recorded vote on this   On this   Okay   Okay In other words, a recorded vote on the amendment?   My view is that price stability needs to be there first and that it really does help the long bond market to get long rates down to have price stability as the first priority   The reason is that the current lags keep us from getting up there within this period, but it does get us to the range later   My first reaction is that in the period from 1984 to the present things seem to have worked rather well in terms of the balance that's there Now, that's [using] the assumption that I have, which gives the FOMC certainly decided power If the FOMC uses a borrowing or reserve target of any kind, it in effect causes certain pressures [in reserve markets], and that makes the funds rate move in such and such a way in relation to the discount rate I don't see anything inconsistent with the FOMC deciding that they would like the funds rate to be approximately 50 or 75 or 100 or whatever basis points above the discount rate In that scenario, if the Board with the advice of the Reserve Banks changes the discount rate, the FOMC still has the last word in the sense that they could choose to make an adjustment of the spread between the discount rate and the fed funds rate So, it seems to me that in switching from reserve targeting to fed funds targeting, the fed funds targeting could be seen as targeting that [spread or] cushion of the fed funds rate above the discount rate And I don't see why that infers such new territory   That's right   I'm responding to Tom Melzer's comment because I think Tom is right at the heart of it I turn to the operational paragraph Now, maybe the operational paragraph is not accurate in regard to what we're doing But if it is not accurate, maybe we ought to change it The operational paragraph says the Committee seeks either to maintain or to decrease [or increase] the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions That's what we say the FOMC is doing And if we do that, we then are determining more or less the gap between the discount rate and the fed funds rate rather than the level of the fed funds rate Now, if the FOMC is determining the level of the fed funds rate, the operational paragraph doesn't say that Frankly, I like the operational paragraph as it is I think we can make it work well that way But if that's what it is, then the FOMC is not in a sense determining the fed funds rate; it's determining the pressure   The thing about the discount rate, which doesn't have any notion of the Board of Governor's or the FOMC's posture that's so important [unintelligible] We really have two policy tools One of them is a more subtle one That is, the open market operations can be more subtle and can have no announcement effect if we're not pegging the fed funds rate And I think all of us would prefer to have one tool that was subtle and not announced The other tool is an announcement tool And it has never made much sense to me to hit the gong, to make the announcement, and to say nothing   Mr Chairman, I would move without enthusiasm   Sam, what was the maximum dollar guide on these holdings before we began to pull back on the Exchange Stabilization Fund? What was the maximum you said we--   No, what was the maximum market value of the total Federal Reserve and Treasury holdings of deutschemarks and yen?   All right So, if you want to be able to buy and sell--you feel some handicap in regard to being that close--do you see the $53 billion as kind of a ceiling?   Let me put the question another way Let's suppose in the process of officially determining the US foreign exchange position that there is more of a tendency to want to intervene when the dollar is strong than there is to intervene when the dollar is weak Let's suppose we had that kind of posture officially What would tend to happen to the size of your fund over time if you're operating in that circumstance?   No, I'm asking what would happen to the size; I think you know the answer, Sam What would happen to the size of the fund?   They would accumulate Now, some of us are not quite as purist as Lee is on the intervention issue, although I do understand Lee's position But if we get ourselves in the circumstance where we are selling yen and deutschemarks when the dollar is weak and is very low by any measure of purchasing parity estimations, no matter how bad they are, then how in the world are we going to get the size of the fund down so that when the mark gets to 200 or 220--? I presume you're going to want to be buying deutschemarks then Is that the general assumption?   Well, Sam, I guess I'm really asking you Do you think it's possible or do you know of a way that we can bring more balance to the game in terms of [as much] enthusiasm for buying dollars as we have for selling dollars?   I think I know Sam's answer to these questions   You could have an exchange of puts In effect, you could swap puts and thereby assume that somebody would ultimately want to exercise that added advantage And that would effectively accomplish what you want to accomplish   There's one slight addendum to this discussion We have a reserve holding that costs us more money than what is reasonably in prospect to happen on foreign exchange rates and that is that we really are not a small reserve holding currency country I think we actually have official reserves of $85 billion, Sam, compared to Taiwan's $75 billion And if you mark our gold to the $358 price, we end up with something like $170 billion There are opportunity costs because we don't get interest on that gold as we do on our foreign exchange [holdings] That cost is out there also I would hesitate for us to have foreign currency holdings that have swap puts that just sit there, [which] is now becoming the case for our gold   Peter, would there have been a difference if we had not sent out the signal that borrowings were sort of okay? To what extent is the way we've accommodated to this due to the slightly different signal about borrowing?   Since this has worked in some ways better than some might have anticipated, what might happen if the Committee at some point in the future--I'm not suggesting now, but sometime in the future--wanted to go 25 or 50 basis points lower on the fed funds rate [than] the discount rate and we had at least this generous an attitude about the window? Would that possibly be a workable environment?   What you're saying then is that if there's some reason the Committee at some point in time wished to do that, you would not be alarmed about at least seeing what that's like?   I chose not to call it that  -22-    3/26/91   I didn't intend to follow right after Roger's comments about the wind It is true that the high plains do see heavy winds in March, but we always seem to gain soil rather than lose it   It seems to me that the staff's forecast is plausible But if I [differ] in any direction on the forecast, it is not so much in regard to the timing but that I lean toward a bit weaker view of households' penchant for consumption expenditures My hunch is that this recession has been different from others in regard to the [buildup] of debt and that the saving rate will tend to run a little higher in this recovery period I am slightly more optimistic in regard to net exports--although I know the staff is also optimistic--but maybe not quite enough to offset the difference of  -34-    3/26/91  somewhat flatter consumption expenditures, if there is any difference It just seems to me that this event, even at the manufacturing level or the business level, is going to be one in which recovery in spending may occur prior to that in unemployment So, I would expect the unemployment rate to continue to move up and maybe to approach 7 percent, even though we have this kind of expansion The talk about medical costs just has to be quite a factor [Unintelligible] union collective bargaining power in terms of the desire [of business firms] to maintain somewhat leaner labor costs So, I would expect it to be in the direction that the staff has but just slightly less than that, as I judge it  It does seem to me that the pickup in M2 growth is coinciding with some flattening of the commodity price deterioration And the commodity prices don't look exactly the way they sometimes look in a full-fledged recovery--that is, if a full-fledged recovery were underway right now But at the same time commodity prices certainly are not deteriorating the way they were as we were going into recession So, it looks to me as if we're close together in regard to the outlook, but maybe with a somewhat longer and less robust recovery path   Mr Chairman, I can accept your suggestion for "B" symmetric I suppose I have a slight preference for an asymmetric directive on the side of tightness in that during periods of recession as we approach the trough it's very important to guard against easing during such a period I suppose the reason that I'm at that position  -42-    3/26/91  is that I notice the staff has a 69 percent nominal GNP growth path from Q2 1991 to Q2 1992, and 69 percent is a pretty heavy dose Now, I guess if I thought it were going to be 1 percent less, at 59 percent, I would feel more comfortable; I'd feel more comfortable if it were going to be at 5 percent because at this stage it's not the CPI or the fixed-weight deflator that counts, it's the GNP deflator that counts in terms of the crowding out [effect] That is, the only crowding out that occurs is on the GNP deflator And if the GNP deflator is at 3 percent and we have 5 percent nominal, we have plenty of room I just feel that 5 percent is more consistent with our progress toward price stability I do agree, Mr Chairman, that there is some bimodal possibility here, but the most likely way that a significant downturn could occur it seems to me is for the bond markets and the capital markets to become discouraged in regard to our progress on inflation And a run-up in long-term rates could be unfortunate in the fragile situation that we're in Now, I also agree with you and Governor Mullins that the exchange value of the dollar is more apt to be strong rather than weak later and I do agree that at some point in time that might be a factor, particularly if the price of gold were plummeting below $330 an ounce or something like that It's always possible that we could find ourselves in that environment, but I think we could take action at that time because the bond markets would be on our side So, I would prefer to be asymmetrical toward tightness I'm not giving much signal that I'm very enthusiastic about that other group changing that other tool   Wayne Angell [in Ottawa, Kansas] I'm very interested in what I'm hearing I guess I'm going to express a [note] of caution and a real preference not to move as the rest of you [unintelligible] It seems to me that for the last six months we have made considerable [easing] moves in anticipation of these numbers that we're getting What we're doing today is really in anticipation of where the economy will be in the third and fourth quarters And I'm somewhat troubled by the notion that we respond both in anticipation    4/12/91  and then we also respond on an economic announcement, which I find-- can you hear?   Okay I find it to be somewhat disconcerting that we would in a sense let market expectations drive us on days of announcements [Unintelligible] the stock market moves up But I don't see how we can afford to time our moves on [the discount rate] or the fed funds rate based upon when the markets expect us to move The bond markets obviously haven't moved Now, this does not mean that I would not favor looking again in a couple of weeks to see what the M2 numbers are I know that April seasonal adjustments are very suspect But if we were to move based upon the fact that either a three-month growth rate or six-month growth rate of the M2 is [unintelligible] but I do not see exchange and commodity prices or otherwise that would indicate a price [unintelligible] Commodity prices really are more horizontal than anything else; and it seems to me that the wholesale consumer price moves that we're seeing for the first [time] are the first indication of what we hope will be there in later months I just have some real reluctance to go ahead and steepen the yield curve as much as this may do But I may indeed be in a minority   Yes   Don, the fourth-quarter average to the end of April that you projected last week was a 49 percent growth rate The midpoint [of our M2 target range for the year] is where?   I presume that it would not be that dramatic if you were one day later It would be up to each Reserve Bank to determine   Alan, I would understand and not be surprised by the desire that we buy D-marks at 180 But if we're to be in the buying frame and we don't want our inventory of D-marks to grow without limit, there would have to be some possible [hedge] in which we would be able to sell D-marks   You mean he shook his head yes or no?   In other words, there wouldn't be an [opening] at, say, 160 for us to be able to sell openly?   Well, it just seems to me that someone needs to work out with us some arrangement to make certain that we can get rid of them if we are to buy them   Well, of course we not only have that, we also have the earnings on the D-mark and [unintelligible] that in itself--   I just want to emphasize that if the United States is more apt to be in an easing mode than other countries and is ahead of other countries, then eventually our economy is going to be cyclically stronger than other countries And we thereby are going to run into a period in which the dollar is very strong against the mark   There are indeed mixed signs out there But I think we should note that the three major forces that took us into a downturn are no longer there We no longer have any energy/oil price escalation that is eating up purchasing power; most of that price increase is now out of the system, as we've seen The housing price situation, whether it's deflation of disinflation, has changed; whatever it is has slowed down We're in an environment in which we  -16-    5/14/91  have improved affordability of housing, and I think that going from a minus to a plus is a rather significant factor And we're already seeing what is happening in regard to the autos--at least the inventory adjustments that already are there That leaves us, then, with [a question of] what it might be that would take the economy another leg down And I frankly do not believe that the risks of that happening are symmetrical I suppose it certainly is true that if net exports were to falter, having been as strong as they've been, that would be an offset to some of these other areas of improvement But it seems to me rather unlikely that we'd get that much movement in net exports with the time lags that generally exist in the net export sector Now, I think we should note that bond supply always tends to increase during a periods of downturn, which impacts government revenues But what happens to the financial markets is that loan demand generally falls off as much; so during most recessions we get a typical downward movement of long-term interest rates that exceeds what we've had this time We can do all the talking we want about why it is that the financial markets do not see the improvement that we see; and yet there are people who are making bets with real money and I don't think they have any reason to want to be biased As long as we maintain money growth above the [bottom of the ranges] that we have adopted--and certainly we've maintained it around the midpoint--it would be conducive, it seems to me, to an increase in nominal GNP, if not quite as robust as you have it, Mike Nevertheless, I would expect nominal GNP to increase rapidly enough that this improvement in inflation that everyone is anticipating thereby provides that kind of growth It may very well be time for us to be patient with regard to being willing for that phenomenon to take place What is wrong with nominal GNP growing 1 percent less than we have projected if that means that we're going to make that much more progress on price stability? When the bond market really sees that [progress], then I think we'll get the additional stimulus that will come from a normal cyclical decline of long-term interest rates That has not happened in this cycle   Mr Chairman, I agree   I guess I'm a little uncomfortable with the conversation The bulk of the conversation is agreement over the M2 growth and that seems to me a very good thing for us to be watching Quite frankly, the stock market has behaved rather robustly and we didn't say that that means the recovery is going to be robust   Oh, I think it did, too That's why some of us were pretty confident about it Clearly, there would be a change in confidence in our [unintelligible] if the stock market turned up at 2450  -26-    5/14/91   Fine   Mr Chairman, would it not be also true that even though our realized profit is a positive, the fact is that in 1991 we have some unrealized losses that will be made permanent?   Lee Hoskins has almost asked my question, but not quite These scenarios really have been very helpful and the presentation was helpful, but I suppose it's always natural that somebody wants something else And the one item that I would like to have had, of course, would have been the one that we control That is, I'd like to have seen an alternative scenario of keeping money growth at 4 percent What happens over '91, '92, and '93 if, instead of keeping the fed funds rate constant, we keep M2 constant at 4 percent--which would be identical to the rate it has grown over the last three years and identical to its growth rate from Q4 1990 to the present time?   Okay   Yes, it really does Thank you; I'm sorry I missed that And the real GNP sacrifice is how much? It's not very much in the out years   But that path shows unemployment rates actually accelerating through the period Does that seem surprising to you?   Okay   But if you were fine-tuning it, Don, then you would probably take the 6-1/2 percent 1992 unemployment rate up a bit and maybe take down the 7-1/4 percent   Yes   Well, thank you for doing precisely what I wanted you to do!   And Jim Wright!   My forecast for nominal GNP is a little lower than the staff's for the four quarters ending in the fourth quarter of '91 Frankly, I think I would be more comfortable if I were a disinterested party looking at the Board staff's forecast than I would with my own because mine seems somewhat extreme to me in some ways Yet I think I'm looking at the very same things that Mike Prell has looked at in terms of modifying his forecast to a less-than-exuberant recovery But Don is certainly correct when he suggests that Reg Q is not [a factor] this time, and I think that does mean some very different things for money growth [Several] of you have mentioned the tax and fiscal policies, and I think that has to be noted as a difference this time around That is, quite often we get either some more liberal or faster depreciation of capital rules or investment tax credit or a reduction of capital gains tax; there's always some deal out there, and this time there is no deal out there We have to remember that this time we're also not getting any action in the long bond as we ordinarily do If you take either the 12 months before the recession started or take a point halfway into the recession, which would be all of 1990, long bond rates in 1991 don't move [in a way that suggests] they're going to be any different than 1990 long bond rates So, that's quite an adverse factor for the residential real estate sector that needs recovery Ordinarily, we find that household expenditures do seem to relate to what happens to home starts--not just appliances but crazy things like automobiles seem also to be related I think we have a consumer out there who is also more damaged in regard to his exuberance for the future than we've seen in all of the post-World War II recoveries I just don't think there's a lot of enthusiasm for borrowing and spending Finally, the realization by many consumers that there is no tax deductibility on their interest charges is a factor there So, this seems to be a consumer who is behaving differently I know, Mike, that you have it in your numbers, too; I'm just taking it down a step more than you did, which is probably too extreme to be worth much But that tends also to get me a little better picture in regard to the imports; that is, I think the consumer is being a little less exuberant so I do not expect the rebound in imports that the staff has in its projection  What really worries me is that we have not had the kind of price effect that it seems to me we should have had That is, given the money growth rates, given the slack that's in the economy, and given this recession effect, it doesn't seem to be there Why have commodity prices failed to decline as much as they ordinarily would during recession periods? Now, it also looks as if commodity prices are not spiking upward in a recovery like they ordinarily would So, we have a different picture in commodity prices than I've seen in a recession and, frankly, I'm very puzzled by it At the same time that commodity prices do not show the extent of the recovery, I think it's somewhat strange that gold prices failed to move down Given central banks' reduced willingness to own gold, or given what I see as a reluctance in the foreign central banks and others to hold as large gold stocks, given countries in southeast Asia who have changed their attitudes [toward gold], and given the Soviet Union [sales], I don't understand why gold prices do not come down It suggests to me that there may be some what we call "crazies" out there who believe that gold is a good [inflation hedge] And I guess I think that [inflation concern] is in the long bond  -20-    7/2-3/91  On money growth, I do not expect 5-1/2 percent money growth with interest rates staying where they are With interest rates staying at current levels, I expect lower money growth--more like what we've seen So, I do not see that it takes a dramatic run-up in short-term interest rates in order to keep money growth at 4 percent Well, that's a contrary and rather rambling indication of my being perplexed by what is going on So, I don't have much confidence in my forecast, Mr Chairman   Well, I think we will   Don, on page 9 [in the Bluebook] on the baseline you have real M2 growing from 1 percent in 1991 to 2, 2-1/4, 2-1/2, and 2-3/4 percent [in the subsequent years through 1995] Why does real M2 grow--now, maybe real M2 is not something you think works--and yet under alternative II, the tighter [scenario], you have real M2 growing on a much slower course, from 1 percent to 1-1/4, 1-3/4, 2-1/2 and then to 3-1/4 percent? Why does real M2 behave so differently under those two scenarios?   Well, in 1995 you have the price level at 1-1/4 percent   Under both scenarios?   But if that's the case--if you have real M2 under both alternative I and alternative II at 2-1/2 percent in 1994 and then in 1995 you have 3-1/4 percent [under alternative II]--I would think the unemployment rate would fall more rapidly in 1995 under alternative II than it would under alternative I   Okay, that's fine I don't think you're disagreeing with what I'm saying that there would tend to be toward the latter part of this period some possible gains from unemployment, depending upon credibility That might actually bring the unemployment rate below alternative I   With the same inflation rate?   As you know, Mr Chairman, we've had a few reporters around in recent months asking questions One of the most interesting questions I was asked--my answer was not reported as far as I know--was What have you learned in five years? And to that there was a clear-cut, easy answer I've learned that getting inflation down is a lot harder than I thought it was five and a half years ago It just is pretty hard to get it down There have been times that I've argued with the staff, with Mike, in regard to inflation I thought we were going to be more successful than we were It's very clear to me now that it's not easy to get the rate of inflation down  -34-    7/2-3/91  The second point I would make, Mr Chairman, is that you pointed out to me a year and a half ago, when I was complaining about inflation not coming down, that inflation would come down in a bunch sometime, and I think you were right If you look at the history of disinflation, it does tend to come in bunches I had the view at one time that maybe inflation can come down during expansions, but our success in getting inflation down during the latter part of an expansion phase has proved not to be an event So, we have an opportunity; and when you have opportunities, you act to make gains  The third point I would make is that inflation never comes down too rapidly Now, deflation could be too rapid But inflation doesn't come down too rapidly because when inflation comes down rapidly the bond markets know it and you get some benefit from falling interest rates So, gradualism sounds nice in theory, but it's just too easy if gradualism never begets progress So, at some point in time we have to stake out an opportunity, and I believe this is an unusual opportunity to make tremendous gains Now, Don, I know why it is that you have the 5-1/2 percent [assumption for M2 growth in 1992] But it seems to me that by most measures we can look at the 4 percent growth rate from Q4 to June and the 4 percent average over three years --and it was very stable during the three years--and say that it really is quite adequate It would have been very adequate if the rate of inflation had not bulged to 5 percent We would have found the 4 percent to be just fine if that rate of inflation hadn't bulged If M2 growing at 4 percent is sufficient to provide a recovery that all of us are agreed is in place, then I see no reason why 4 percent money growth won't work in the future  I think you asked the question, Mr Chairman Why do it now rather than in February? And I think the answer to that is that we have a Chairman who is very, very good at persuading when he makes the Humphrey-Hawkins report And if the Chairman explains why it is that we're [adopting] a lower target range, that can give us the credibility kick that all of us think would be very, very helpful And in doing that I think we have a chance to have this recovery be better rather than weaker That credibility could cause the long bond interest rate to fall from its [current] level, which is higher than it was last year, and that would be very, very good for the recovery So, the reason that I would like to do it now is because we need the bond market improvement now That would give us a credibility that we could not get in any other way And, Mr Chairman, even though you would prefer not to explain that now, I think you'd be very good at explaining it now And I think that would make a considerable difference If I'm wrong and the money relationship changes, I don't see any reason why we couldn't back off in February The tentative step should be the step that we want to make and then if the money relationship turns out to be quite different, you'd be able to explain that next February   Be patient, Lee; be patient   I move that   I would agree   I agree   Don, if we look to the period ahead and, as Vice Chairman Corrigan indicated, we find it necessary to engage in a tightening, are there any explorations underway that will enable us to administer the open market window in such a way that we would not have every 1/4 point seen as an announcement arrangement? It just seems to me that it has always been very helpful when we had some reserve targeting arrangement that did not give an announcement effect to the fed funds rate What can you tell me in regard to explorations of ways to administer the window which would enable restraint to take place and would cause interest rates to be seen as rising by market pressures rather than as an announcement of the Fed?   Well, would having the discount rate above the fed funds rate and having some other supporting overnight arrangement below that tend to give an atmosphere in which you could do this without having the fed funds rate run too far?   Mr Chairman, the reason I ask this question is that this will be the first time that we might be in a tightening arrangement in which the market will misread every 25 basis points in the fed funds rate as having an announcement effect And I think that's a frightening disadvantage for us   I support "B" symmetric, although I understand what President Parry is concerned about And I would emphasize that I think it's very, very important that we not be seen at all to be getting behind the curve That is, if the market believes we're falling behind the curve in that kind of circumstance, it would be very, very unfortunate; I think the long-term bond rates would show that and when we tighten I think long-term interest rates would go in the wrong direction But there isn't anything right now that suggests that that needs to be done It seems to me that the money growth ought to be discounted; that is, we ought not to be thinking we're as tight as maybe we think we are looking at money growth But looking at commodity prices and other things, I don't think there's any need to tighten at this point   Commodity prices?   Wayne Angell I think most of you know that my view of the commodity prices has been that they've been pretty well flat But it seems to me that that really hasn't changed, and particularly it hasn't changed in regard to our experimental index on commodity prices ex food, fiber, and energy And I think taking out food, fiber, and energy helps if what you're trying to do is assess the impact of the money growth that you're getting on an auction bid process In recent weeks this experimental index has really taken a nose dive In fact, Alan, you remember last week I said I didn't understand why the price of gold wasn't falling and I guess lo and behold gold prices did catch on   I think that is important for two reasons One, as most of you know, I've had the lowest real growth rate projection for the economy in '91 and '92 of any member among the presidents or the Board So, it's not that I thought we had a strong recovery anyway, because ordinarily we get faster money growth and we also get some upward movement in commodity prices as recoveries take place But the problem, as I see it, is that our conventional ability to alter the opportunity cost of holding M2--that power--has slipped away from us a little and the whole yield curve in some ways is competing Then too, all the legislative talk and the swaying in regard to regulatory issues as well as lender willingness to lend really has placed us in a position where simply lowering the fed funds rate may not be effective in some circumstances But if we get into an environment in which the rate of inflation does seem to come down-- and, Mike Prell, even though you don't see it at this point I guess I do see very sharply lower commodity or PPI numbers coming in the future--it seems to me that looking at it in that context we ought to be somewhat open to making certain that we do not let real rates increase in this environment So, I'm in a position of somewhat more openness for some possible action in the period ahead   Si, are there states other than Iowa that are being hit [by dry conditions]? Does that go farther east and north in your District?   Well, in fact, I think if we're going to get the recovery to behave the way it needs to behave, it's essential that whatever moves we make are constructive in the sense of being associated with declining long rates And now that we have the rates down from the 848-850 percent level, I think our patience has contributed to that If it is then seen that what we are targeting is really price level stability and we think we are somewhat farther along in that, then it seems to me that with patience we have some chance of getting long bond rates down below 8 percent, which would undoubtedly prove to be very beneficial in the housing industry and provide a very desirable and steady underlying strength for a recovery, which puts more units of goods out there   Well, it does seem to me, Mr Chairman, that sometimes we might want the moves we make to be somewhat subtle but at some stage in the game it seems to me we might want to make a move that has more of an announcement effect   Do you want comments?   Well, having been something of an advocate of a different procedure, I must admit, Don, that in going through your analysis I really don't find anything there about which I can say "I really want to do that right now" Theoretically, I'm very much impressed with what Al Broaddus had to say in his letter I'm very impressed with the notion that pegging the fed funds rate and keeping it steady does not necessarily mean that policy is in neutral, and I think everybody agrees with that But the recent experience we've had with M2 causes me to have more doubts than I have had in previous years, and I suppose I am not quite as ready as I was four years ago or two years ago to introduce some automatism in the program At one time it seemed reasonable to me that if we erred in our estimates of the demand for money, all of the error should not show up in the money stock and that we ought to let part of the error show up in a move in the fed funds rate Now, I'm still somewhat of that opinion, but I'm not ready to advocate any of those other alternatives, Mr Chairman   Well, when David Lindsey speaks about the present procedures, I think he's correct that none of us really had in mind a year ago that we wanted to get the fed funds rate to 5-1/2 percent No one really seems to have in mind the fed funds rate that is driving us What has been driving us in a sense has been a kind of feeling our way in all of the procedures [on the basis of] all of the information that we have; and we find ourselves with a 5-1/2 percent fed funds rate So, I don't think that the [current] procedure necessarily means that we're really hooking on to some predetermined fed funds rate I think in a way many of us are surprised to find ourselves at this juncture with a fed funds rate of 5-1/2 percent And since we're surprised, then it must be that we have considerations that are driving us other than the fed funds rate   And there may be Federal Reserve Bank research departments that might wish to take on some additional tasks relating to what has been done at the Board   You mean have a separate sentence that indicates our commitment to price level stability?   And then deal with the others Well, I think there's certainly some merit in that approach   What sentence are you talking about, Don?  -11-    8/20/91   Mr Chairman, I like that suggestion If we were to do that, say, at the December meeting, that would be a "goals" meeting, which could then precede our establishment of the ranges at the February meeting   As part of the discussion But I think we should leave open the opportunity for some intra-year moves that might take place when events occur during the year   Mr Chairman, I'm having trouble getting used to a kind of newfound optimism, and I don't quite understand why I should be optimistic when the majority seem not to be I suppose there are two reasons One is that I had the lowest forecast for real growth among the Committee members; and I had the thought that given where Mike [Prell] is now I'd almost be willing to meet him half way So,  -30-    8/20/91  maybe I had a lower forecast to begin with for '91 The second reason may be more strange, and that is that I've been in Colorado, and Colorado seems quite different than it has been for many years during its very long recession When I look in Colorado, I see runways and runways and runways being built; I've never seen so many runways under construction--both in Colorado Springs and Denver But there's a new atmosphere there And it shows some of the ways that our system works When house values are where they are in a place like Colorado Springs compared to California, people start to move from California to Colorado Springs The kind of values there are just rather unbelievable And there's certainly a definite pickup But that's too minor a factor to explain much about the US economy  What is it, then, that gives me more optimism? And this is an optimism for 1992 maybe more so than for 1991 The optimism, I guess, comes from a reluctant realization that I'm closer to Tom Melzer in regard to M2 than I am to Lee Hoskins I'm just not as worried as I was earlier about those M2 numbers Don's paper was an excellent paper; it was very helpful to me to mull over what is going on in M2 And I think there's a realization that M2 is both the outcome as well as the cause It just seems to me that M2 probably is not going to respond as much as the members of the Committee would like But it may not have much to do with the outcome in the real economy  Maybe my optimism is also due to the fact that the real estate price event may be almost over and that should bode well for the banking system, which I see recovering and which I think will give us a different result in 1992 But at the same time commodity prices continue to be pretty weak and rather inconsistent with a strong recovery So, I think that means we should take a little off of our estimates for the third quarter But if the third-quarter estimates are a little softer, that seems to me an environment in which maybe what has happened to long-term bond prices can continue if the Committee is willing to be patient That is, if we continue to get through this quarter and into the next and the PPI numbers are consistent with what commodity prices are showing, then it seems to me that with patience we may have opportunities for additional, perhaps minor, steps to be taken in time, and long bond prices would respond as favorably as they did in this last move Now, we not only have long bond prices for Treasuries down to 810 percent but we've had even more of a gain in mortgage-backed securities; and those spreads over Treasuries are narrowing considerably And it seems to me that that bodes well for the housing recovery--which is a very gradual recovery, but I think it still adds quarter-to-quarter to the kind of results that we want to see  The final reason for my optimism is optimism with regard to the net export picture It seems to me that as Mexico moves more to a market-system economy with more sound monetary policy it earns the right to be a capital importer and, indeed, it is becoming a capital importer Policies they have in place will earn them an increasing right to be a capital importer, which will be very helpful to them in their development But I see also throughout Latin America and South America a desire to follow that mode And if these countries become the capital importers that I expect them to become because of improved monetary and fiscal policies, then it seems to me that that bodes  -31-    8/20/91  better for our export industries So, I look for a somewhat better outcome there than even the staff has forecast   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation on "B," and the version II [language] is okay I'd have a slight preference for symmetric language but with you at the switch I don't see that the meaning is any different [Laughter]  I would like to suggest that what we're going through here is, of course, painful But it's less painful to me than what I considered to be of some possibility six months ago, which was that we'd be through this event and back out and never get the rate of inflation down It just seems to me that we do have to have a little patience here I think we're entering a period in which we're making more progress toward price stability than during any of the period that I've been here And there's so much joy in that to me that I'm able in a sense to endure a little of the agony But that doesn't mean that I want it to continue into another year I'm very open to the Chairman's suggestion   Mr Chairman, after hearing Mike and Tom, I think I would really prefer version I   Do you want a recorded vote in the minutes, Mr Chairman?   Why don't we just recount?   Jerry, I think there are two kinds of responses that we can be involved in One is the response to a firm that has violated the ethical principles in regard to falsifying reports, which is an issue in itself But the other problem that seems to me is very important to the Federal Reserve is that we address the entire question of whether or not a small group, in a sense, ought to have that privileged access And in that vein I'm wondering how far down the road it would be for us to be able to have an electronic ability at various firms to make their bids I presume that takes quite a bit of software as well as hardware   I don't want to debate all these questions at this point, but I do think it's very important that the marketplace and the public perceive that we're very sensitive to an open access bidding system and that we really ought to give a lot of priority to making certain that that option is available so that as the discussion takes place we are not seen as holding up that process   I understand and I'll be very happy at some other time to talk about some of those other problems   Yes, Larry, I'd like to ask a question about Japan We understand that just-in-time inventory management seems to be in place in Japan and certainly Japan appears to have rather high short-term real interest rates Is there some possibility that the heavier rate of production in the first and second quarters is an inventory surge that still has to be looked at as a threat to the continued growth of the Japanese real GNP?   I think it's time to remember that we are 28 months into this period of declining short-term interest rates The fed funds rate is 465 basis points lower than it was 28 months ago This was accompanied, of course, eventually by a shift from a flat yield curve to a very positive yield curve That very positive yield curve has been in place for quite a few months We're looking, then,  -16-    10/1/91  at a shift in behavior in the commercial banking system as well as the nonbank public in regard to their positioning of assets The commercial banking system is shifting heavily into US government securities This is quite typical at this stage of the interest rate cycle that we're in Undoubtedly, when commercial banks begin at the margin to add to their holdings of government securities and to offset that by some shrinkage or no growth in loans that, of course, means that the opportunity costs of making a new loan are moving in the direction of alleviating the credit crunch So, it seems to me that we have fully in place the atmosphere that does provide for the kind of forecast that Mike has described To me the one factor that was most noticeable in Mike's statement was that the Blue Chip forecasters have a slightly lower rate of economic growth but a slightly higher rate of inflation And I guess, Mike, that maybe we have inside information But the critical question before us puts me somewhat in disagreement with those who talk about where the risks are The critical risk that we run at this stage is that we do not make the gradual progress in the core rate of inflation as Mike has outlined And if we go past this window and find ourselves with the same basic core rate of inflation we've had since 1984, you can better believe that we will pay for that yield structure and the term structure of interest rates in the future, and that certainly will be a very significant factor with regard to the size of the US government debt and the interest payments that will be there  So, I feel that where we are is just about right I don't see how it could be much better It seems to me that it would be better for us to have 2-1/2 percent real growth rather than 3-1/2 percent real growth and make the progress in [reducing] the core rate of inflation The environment that we're in, if we maintain it, came after a period of patience, which may mean that the rate of inflation, and the rate of [unintelligible] may come down more in the next 12 months Yet we're looking immediately at financial markets that [have yet] to adjust to news in regard to what we think the third-quarter GNP numbers are going to be It's entirely possible that given those numbers--[growth in] real GNP in the third quarter at the 3 percent level--that we could see the long bond yields rising above this nice 779 percent where they now appear to be So, we have in front of us a very delicate matter And it seems to me that the best prospects for growth will rest with further progress in [lowering] the core rate of inflation So, I'm very pleased, but I would be happy to have Mike be 1/2 point too high on this real GNP number   I prefer "B" symmetric but better than straight asymmetric  I like "mildly"   I was on edge wondering how you were going to do that!  MR, BERNARD "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the  -31-    10/1/91  intermeeting period The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 3 and 1-1/2 percent, respectively"   Mr Chairman, I appreciate the remarks that have been made and I understand where they come from I do not have the confidence that others seem to have in regard to knowing precisely what the fourth-quarter number will be And since I don't know what the fourth-quarter number is going to be, I would tend to presume that it is going to be closer to what we've seen than to assume that it is going to show a dramatic change Looking at the third-quarter numbers, we have had a very negative one quarter on net exports, and I find it very unbelievable that that kind of jarring one-quarter [experience] is apt to be sustained I find it rather doubtful that the inventory disinvestment that occurred in the third quarter will be that large in the fourth quarter I look at the third quarter and see that consumer spending, if it were to continue quarter-after-quarter at that rate, wouldn't leave much room for any saving that people are talking about Now, that doesn't mean that I'm on the side [of those who believe] that the economic recovery is on a normal course I have never thought that this recession was a normal recession and I certainly see no reason that the recovery will be a normal recovery But what we need to keep in mind here is that when we affect real asset prices the way we have across this country from 1984 onward--and it has hit region after region--that we do not get a snapback The animal spirits that are out there in regard to borrowing money to buy real estate or to develop this or to develop that are archaic; they are seriously faulted Consequently, I do not believe that we're going to affect the outcome quarter-by-quarter very much by what we do except run into some danger, as Tom Melzer suggests, of actually making it worse  Now, Jerry Corrigan is correct in saying that we ought not test the market at this time If we test the market and then try to come back and do something later, I think that's going to be confusing I'm really on the side of standing pat here It seems to me that with the 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent growth rate that we're apt to experience over the coming quarters--four, five, six quarters ahead of us--we're going to have plenty of opportunity out there for certain disinflations to demonstrate that they're moving along The very best thing we can do for the recovery is to continue our policy, which is targeting price-level stability And out of that we will get the long bond rate moving where we need to get it moving in order to get this recovery going After the Chairman's remarks the other night, I'm convinced that the bond market won't react adversely to a 25 basis points move So, I think we've already found that out; the bond markets will tend to do nothing here Frankly, I think the bond markets will do quite well if we do nothing and they indeed will be better over the coming months if we show patience The worst thing we can do is to create more uncertainty [As to the] suggestion that we have to make dramatic moves [my view is that] the market will say the    10/30/91  Fed has moved and nothing will happen And we actually may contribute to a worsening condition with a worsening bond market and make the circumstance much worse than it would be otherwise So, I strongly counsel for us to stand [pat] I just do not believe that there are gains from our throwing 25 basis points away in these winds   Mr Chairman, maybe we ought to have a leak of this so that Messrs Sarbanes and Hamilton and so forth would want to get the number of presidents voting up from 5 to 12! [Laughter]   I agree with those who suggest that this is a long-cycle adjustment process I think anyone who saw what happened in the oil producing states and the agricultural states in the mid- 1980s understood that this was going to be an asset price adjustment period Now, monetary policy was sufficiently powerful in the mid- 1980s to be able to abort that adjustment process We are not just at 12 months and 10 small [easing] moves but 2-1/2 years and 490 basis points lower in the fed funds rate than we were in June of 1989 That's a rather significant move Now, it seems to me that monetary policy lags may be increasing in this environment And I wonder about looking at maybe at least two behavioral groups to see how that might be occurring First of all for households, with their reliance on CDs and other short-term investments that we taught them to rely upon in the 1980s, I think that heavy shift really did not involve direct ownership of equities; and a very small amount of direct ownership of bonds by households leaves them rather vulnerable on the income side, [given] the interest rate declines that have occurred The interest gap for the household sector is rather enormous when one thinks about short-term CD rates at 4-1/2 percent as compared to credit card interest rates of 19 percent It doesn't take a great deal of brilliance for households--many of whom learned to have a mix of both short-term liquid assets and also to hold liabilities at the same time--to understand that there's a lot of payoff to shifting out of CDs and bringing down debt That low rate of return for households is undoubtedly driving them into the equity market in a new way As interest rates fall, that occurs And that phenomenon means that we don't get quite the "bang for the buck" that we ordinarily would because we're not impacting the rates that households are paying as much as we're impacting the rates that households are receiving  There's also a lagged phenomenon at commercial banks In ordinary recession cycles there is a shift, of course, between lending and investment; but [when] a longer-term adjustment [is under way] that shift might be even more pronounced and longer-lasting and have some somewhat perverse effects It seems to me that the real opportunity cost for commercial banks in lending is not exactly the opportunity cost in what they're paying; as US government securities in the two- to three-year range become a larger portion of the assets  -21-    11/5/91  of commercial banks, the real opportunity cost is the yield on those two- and three-year Treasuries In a declining interest rate market that yield is much higher than the coupon rate And as long as that yield is as high, in many ways commercial banks worried about asset quality in the lending area would naturally delay making the transition to aggressive lending In many ways it seems to me, then, that the impetus to lend is going to come somewhat after interest rates have stopped declining So, to some extent, declines in short- term interest rates may [lead to] a delayed effect as to what occurs  Now, there's another factor we ought to consider and that is that long-cycle adjustments occur because conditions get out of whack And those adjustments--those things that need to be changed--need to [occur] In a sense aborting asset price adjustments doesn't help all that much Asset prices need to adjust to a different level of expected inflation And in some ways the faster those asset price adjustments take place the better the recovery Unfortunately, the RTC and other ownership arrangements that don't cause these assets to be docked may indeed prolong the adjustments  Another fact in the long cycle that we have to consider is that household savings in a sense are inevitably linked to capital inflows to the United States And I think there are some real advantages for household savings to adjust in such a manner that we do not [continue to take] the share of the world's capital that we have been taking over the last 10 years So, that savings adjustment needs to take place, and we need to keep in mind that we don't want to disrupt conditions by trying to create in a sense the typical recovery The typical recovery is not going to be there; and trying to get that typical recovery will run greater risks of upsetting certain markets than if we go in a more steady-as-we-go [manner] through here Just think how serious it would be if we were to upset the foreign exchange market or upset the equity market One concern that I have is that the equity market could be in for a boom and that could involve a speculative fervor; and if this adjustment period is as long as I expect it to be, then a run-up in equity prices [until they get] out of line and then watching them unwind very rapidly is not going to be a very pleasant experience So, the critical question in front of us is What are we teaching the world that we are doing? Are we teaching the world that our focus is on employment and output or are we teaching the world that we continue to have a concept of price level targeting that will enable long-term interest rates to come down in such a way as to continue to get recovery in housing, which I think is essential to get this long-cycle process going our way? Just because it's a long cycle doesn't mean that it has to be an extraordinarily bad long cycle And I think what we do is very, very important   Mr Chairman, since we might be having a telephone conference call anyway, there's some uncertainty in my mind as to how that would take place if the Board were not to make a discount rate move Wouldn't there be some advantage in going "B" asymmetric and then having a telephone conference call after we know what the Board is going to do? That would still mean the FOMC would be free to do what it chose to do, but it would then have knowledge about what the announcement--   That could be an alternative That would be an alternative that would be more appealing to me   Yes  -29-    11/5/91   Mr Chairman, I hope my advice is wanted on this even though it wasn't on the other I do believe that there's an integrity question here Information is scarce and information is hard to come by for the market And I don't feel comfortable for us to deliberately let an auction take place for a 10-year issue tomorrow morning and not let the markets know all that we know I do not feel comfortable with people taking short and long positions on an auction tomorrow while we know precisely what we're going to do It seems to me that the fairest thing to do is to do it as soon as the markets have [closed], which I think for us would be tomorrow morning I would also suggest, Mr Chairman, that there have been times that we've had leaks that are more in the realm of information for [news media] But if we were to have a leak, that would only be seen as an advantage for someone in the market and would do this institution a great deal of harm   At what time, Peter?   You wouldn't do it early?   There was a bit of restraint here on the part of the Board members Maybe we wore ourselves out in this morning's briefing!   Unfortunately, any time public officials make comments about taking away the supply of an instrument that the markets have been accustomed to using-- And with the considerable demand for strips that is out there, it does seem to me a bit dangerous to destroy in a sense an entire market system, including that largest commodity of all which is Treasury bond futures That is, I think moderating the supply is quite different from any discussion of taking the instrument away   I can support that position I guess I don't have quite as much enthusiasm as others have expressed It seems to me that Governor Kelley ought to know how hard it is to change it once we've done this And with this language it's just almost impossible to change it, so I think we're back in the same circumstance I do believe there are times that the Committee may wish to give a signal of changing emphasis; it seems to me that during the '80s we had foreign exchange markets that did need some attention And having a way of responding to that which is necessary, I think, was helpful At the same time the movement up in the order of "price level stability" was a part of the announcement or the signal of the Committee's determination in that regard, which I think frankly will get lost in this arrangement But I can understand when something is going [to be approved] and so I'm going to vote for it! [Laughter]   Yes, Mr Chairman Even though it seems as if the economy is dead in the water--and the forecasts for the fourth quarter and the first quarter certainly suggest that--I think it's better to look at the economy as being balanced by certain sectors and regions in which growth is occurring, albeit rather slowly, and other sectors and regions in which there are continuing adjustments and some retrenchment So, it seems to me that there still is not the synchronization of all of these sectors and regions into a common inventory cycle phenomenon Consequently, it seems to me that the seeds for growth are building even while we're in this period of a pretty flat economy  Secondly, I want to suggest that the pessimism we see associated with this [economy] is a real estate phenomenon It's a  -14-    12/17/91  long-cycle real estate phenomenon and it is accompanied by depository institution difficulties that look just like those that were experienced in the 1920s and 1930s And it seems to me that we are not immune from the sense of pessimism associated with that kind of an event I think it would be well for us to remind ourselves of some significant differences between the current conditions and those that prevailed during that last banking-real estate episode  First of all, I would suggest that the monetary aggregates-- whether you look at Ml, M2, or M3--are growing; they are not contracting And there's a substantial difference between monetary contraction and slow money growth If you look at Ml as well as M2, there's some indication here that we are supplying liquidity to the system And that liquidity, as shown in the steep yield curve, will work its way Now, in the 1930s the banking system did not have the heavy concentration of Treasuries in their portfolios that they hold now At that time, as many of you probably remember, the government debt was contracted from about $24 billion in 1920 to about $16 billion in 1929 So, in that episode, we didn't have commercial banks chasing yield into long-term Treasury securities And the commercial banks had a quality bond problem It wasn't just a question then of having bad loans; it was also a question of having bonds, both municipal and business corporate bonds, that were not marketable And when that quality spread developed, the banking system was, of course, locked in with those securities So, they didn't just have bad loans They had bad loans in bonds as well as bad loans of the usual kind Of course, they did not have something that we have today and that is deposit insurance I know a lot of people have been complaining about deposit insurance systems, but this is not too bad a time to have one, it seems to me! [Laughter] And, of course, that's why we haven't had a monetary contraction If we had had these depository institution failures without deposit insurance, it seems to me that there would have been no way we could have kept the money stock growing  The second thing I would mention is that we are not in a deflation period as measured by the producer price index In the latter 1920s and early 1930s, we had very steeply declining prices that brought the price level down 40 to 50 percent below where it had been before We haven't yet had what I would call a significant producer price index decline And the fact that the PPI for finished goods is now year-over-year at minus 5 percent is hardly an indication of a deflation underway  The third point I would mention is that our system is indeed a transfer payment system that does offer a huge amount of support I mean by that not just Social Security, but Medicaid, Medicare, and unemployment compensation, and also a rather large pension plan program So, that provides a great deal of sustenance  The fourth thing I'd mention--I know one could add more to the list but I'm going to stop at four--is that world trade is expanding It's not expanding quite as rapidly as it was a few years ago, but it's still expanding And in the 1930s, as you know, we were undergoing the threat from the Hawley-Smoot tariff So, this circumstance is so different that to me it doesn't make sense for us to let that kind of fear permeate our ranks  -15-    12/17/91  Now, as to the monetary aggregates, I frankly am not worried at this point about M1's growth rate When I look at Ml and M2--and M2 seems to be dawdling along at a little higher [growth] rate than it was before--it doesn't seem to me that this is a problem at this point on either side I'm not going to join the forces of alarmists in regard to Ml But I do remember, Ed, that in 1986 when I was not too worried about M2 growing at a rate of 9-1/2 percent and some of you were saying that that was a problem, that it did turn out to be somewhat problematic So, I don't know at what point in time liquidity in a sense catches hold and shows up At this point, commodity prices do not show any force of over-liquification as Ml's growth rate might indicate That is, I don't see any upward bulge in commodity prices that says we're putting too much liquidity in the system But neither do I see commodity prices forecasting a significant deflation It does seem to me, though, that the commodity prices are forecasting stable producer prices and some diminution in the commodity price index But I think it's worth noting Bob Parry's report regarding agriculture Civilizations do go through periods in which certain [anomalies] in agriculture show up And it seems to me that we do run the risk that we're in an era in which food prices may be subject to more [unfavorable] surprises than good surprises  In conclusion, it seems to me that the healing forces and the recovery forces--with a little longer time lags than we're used to-- are really underway I don't want to try to do any better at forecasting [than the staff]; I don't have any quarrel with Mike's forecast at all I don't think we've ever been to this place before, and I don't know for sure that that's the way it's going to work, but it does seem to me that this is a time for a little patience   Yes, Bob Black I think stated it a little differently, but that's the way I heard you   Mr Chairman, I can vote for your proposition, as I'm sure you anticipated that I would Thanks a lot for giving me a chance not to have to write another dissenting statement! I do want to suggest that during the last six years I've become a bit less optimistic in regard to how easy it is to get the rate of inflation down When I came in, I had the view that inflation could be brought down by gradual and persistent control of the money stock even if unemployment is at its natural rate My experience is that it's very tough to get the CPI rate of inflation down And I don't know why we're looking a gift horse in the mouth Here we have had some unexpected occurrences, which means that the rate of inflation is going to come down a little faster than we thought it was going to But we're committed not to let it turn into deflation We're just not going to let that happen I don't know, Mr Chairman, whether there's more pain doing it this way than there is doing it over a 10-year period I feel quite confident that this improvement in the outlook for inflation will make the recovery that we finally get a much better and a long sustained one I do look forward to the discussions that I    12/17/91  think we might be having, particularly in regard to Governor Mullins's comments, and I guess I get to vote again So, thank you   Jerry, on page 5 you mentioned that the minimum capital for new [commercial bank] primary dealers would be $100 million of Tier I capital and then you suggest $50 million for registered broker-dealers Why the distinction?   Jerry, on page 6 you mention that of necessity, at least for the time being, the number of additional primary dealers will be relatively limited And yet the document doesn't seem to make a distinction between the pre-automation era and the post-automation era I think you correctly point out on page 6 that for the time being it will probably be impossible to [allow everyone], who wanted to, to step up and be in contact with the Desk But did you have in mind that this could possibly change in the post-automation era?   Well, on the top of page 4, it is mentioned that it is contemplated that each dealer firm's performance will be evaluated annually beginning in June 1993, which gives the impression that you're going into the post-automation era    1/9/92   Well, as you know, in regard to the conversation at the Board, I'm somewhat concerned about the "franchise value" of the primary dealer status And it seems to me that you've only eliminated one of the factors that tends to give franchise value, and that's the exam surveillance part of it Don't you think that when you limit the number you give "scarcity value" or franchise value? And don't you think that access to the Desk and that information gives franchise value?   Well, Jerry, I certainly agree with that And it would help the document from my perspective if it clearly indicated that in this transition period we will be taking the first steps But then after the automation [is completed] it seems to me that we should give some indication that the arrangements might be somewhat different   Thank you, Jerry   Mr Chairman, in an unplanned manner I would say that I think it would be a wonderful idea for us to have Alan Greenspan as Chairman Now, would you want me to go ahead and do more [and nominate a Vice Chairman] or do you want to do one at a time?   And women!   I would be happy to move the adoption of the proposals that have been presented by Mr Truman And I would like to express appreciation and gratitude that we're back to [an authorized level of] $5 billion and [the amount warehoused] will not be close to that amount    2/4-5/92   Mr Chairman, we've already talked about it, but let's just go ahead and vote for it anyway! [Laughter]   Si, has the Caterpillar labor negotiation progressed?   What are the union wage demands?   It would seem, with farm sales down 24 percent, that maybe Deere made a mistake also   It seems to me that the bond market continues to be a check in regard to our ability even to re-inflate I have some question as to whether we can cause the growth path to be much more robust than is forecast Probably we would have to demonstrate that we're re-inflating before we can alter some of these conditions that exist in people's confidence level I don't think I've ever seen so much ill regard for our government among people And even though we think that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, people out there have a  -24-    2/4-5/92  lack of confidence in government and what spills over from that somehow or other is that things won't be dealt with in a proper manner Maybe that is what causes long bond prices to be at the same place they were 2-1/4 years ago That's a rather sad commentary Now, clearly, the housing market has been helped because the seven- year Treasury rate has come down quite substantially over the last 2-1/4 years even though the long rate has not I sense, as many of you do, that there is some perking up, particularly in the housing market Houses are selling; old houses are selling And that does involve new activities Certainly, a lot of refinancing is going on As to whether the refinancing is being done in such a manner as to reduce the payments, the best sources that I have indicate that 70 percent of the refinancings are going to reducing the length of the maturity and keeping the payment [amounts] about the same  Clearly, M2 looks a little better than it did a month ago I agree that in the commercial banking system the capital positions of many of the banks are improving; and the stock market seems to be a plus But I can't find any robust sector I can't find any area, in any industry or any geographic region, that really is alive I know, Tom, that you have those textile mills running at capacity; but as far as robust and entrepreneurial spirits being charged up, that doesn't seem to me to be really there I think some additional mischief could occur on the international scene Europe could be a little softer than the staff has [projected] in the Greenbook I see very little prospects for the GATT round getting anywhere by April, as everyone is saying And if that doesn't occur, I tend to share the feelings that have been expressed about how protectionism might slow us down So, we have what I think is a recovery out there, but I certainly don't think it is a very robust one If it is, I'll be mistaken I'm somewhat more optimistic on the GDP deflator for this year, but only marginally so   Mr Chairman, I don't know whether "amend" is exactly the right word because as I was talking yesterday and listening to myself it sounded very confusing to me [Laughter]   I decided last night that the reason it was confusing was because I wasn't really willing to put the proper labels on what I think are our current circumstances I don't think we can do the right job of selecting policy unless we understand more precisely the nature of the circumstances that we're in Those circumstances are, I believe, that we are [involved] in a long-cycle event And it's a long-cycle event about which we must understand the cause because we can't do the cure if we don't understand the cause I think the cause of this long-cycle event was the very expansionist monetary polices of the 1970s that created double-digit inflation That double-digit inflation began a debt cycle in the private sector, which in a sense was not sustainable unless the rate of inflation was to be increased continually I believe it was not possible for the world's reserve currency to be subject to a continuation of that inflation So, it was entirely proper that under the Volcker Federal Reserve that was headed off and brought back down  But, ultimately, no more inflation means that the private sector--either corporations or households--does not wish to hold the debt as a ratio to their income that they did before Now, during a long-cycle event it seems to me that the proper policy is one of price-level stability in order to get real stability to the event As we've found during this period, to keep disinflation from turning into deflation we've had to provide reserves at a rate much [higher] than we ordinarily would think necessary, and we still have had a hard time keeping M2 and M3 growth where we wanted it If it's the case that households and corporations are trying to reduce debt as a percentage of their cash flow and their income, then it seems to me that we have to admit something that central bankers never want to admit, and that is that the government has to become the debtor of last resort in such a circumstance Because if we're going to force the growth of credit at a 3 percent rate or whatever even anemic rate may seem desirable, then someone has to be the owner on the other side because credit can't grow faster than debt grows I think it's entirely responsible and important for the continuation of the creation of the private sector that those debt ratios be brought down And under those circumstances I do not know how government debt can keep from going up That raises the question for me as to what we say about this borrowing because it's the borrowing that causes the people out there to be so unhappy The people are unhappy with their government because they don't understand how during this critical time we can have what they call "irresponsible borrowing"  -28-    2/4-5/92  Now, if that's the case, then I am somewhat admitting that Keynesian economics is really depression economics and I don't want to sound Keynesian; it's terrible for me to sound Keynesian, but I think we ought to be wise in regard to what the government does as it increases its debt As defense spending comes down and as we have layoffs of highly skilled workers in the defense sector, it seems to me that it will be important for us to have [other] capital investment It's not good to replace defense spending without employment compensation That's a very bad tradeoff in regard to our getting done what we need to get done So, I would much prefer to recognize the desirability of public sector spending on the infrastructure, that is, building highways and bridges and doing public sector spending that has the best multiplier in regard to the private sector In other words, what I was trying to say yesterday and sounded so confused about is that I don't think monetary policy can in and of itself resolve this problem I don't think monetary policy can do it [now] any more than it did in the Great Depression So, Mr Chairman, I wanted to revise and extend my remarks to recognize that this event is different By that I do not mean that it has to be more severe; I do not mean that the outlook is necessarily worse than Mr Prell has it But I do believe there's a downside risk to the outcome that Mr Prell has outlined That is, if the debt contraction in households and in the business sector is to go on and if households ex ante wish to increase their savings all at the same time, then the paradox of thrift leads us to somewhat slower consumer sector spending than we have projected in front of us And under those circumstances our job ought to be viewed somewhat differently and that is not that we can fix it but that we can keep it from getting worse That would lead me to a stability orientation Thank you for indulging me in that   Mr Chairman, I really appreciated this discussion It is exactly the right presentation I side with you that the most critical question for us at this point in time is conveying what we are going to do in the short run So, I agree with your position I would, however, like to keep on tap this notion of the tunnel as possible for the long run as well as the short run That is, we sometimes have [viewed] a yearly [target] as if it were the long run and then our FOMC meeting [decision] as the short run It does seem to me that once we find ourselves at the middle of the desired tunnel, it might be good in terms of a track record for us to have [the tunnels] out there as we [draw] our cones to see whether or not we have cumulative base drift  Bob, I was a little surprised that you were willing to accept a 4 percent growth path in your tunnel I would have thought that you would have insisted on a growth path in the tunnel of either 2 percent or 3 percent, which is consistent with price level stability Now, I find this tunnel arrangement puts us in an expansionist mode; I think it does exactly what you suggested, Mr Chairman If we had said we should have fostered growth of the money stock at 4 percent last year, not 4-1/2 percent, and if the tunnel from that should have been 3 not 4 percent, then we would have a long-run tracking guide that I think gives P* its force but yet maintains a business as usual [approach] in regard to this year's cone  -34-    2/4-5/92   You'd end up with an historical tunnel   On a long-run basis, alternative II is clearly my preference Real GDP between 1991 and 1996 grows at a 26 percent percent average annual rate under alternative II, which is just 02 percentage point lower than the 28 percent path under alternative I Now, I know we don't have clear insight that these are accurate paths I guess Don Kohn doesn't claim clear insight that these are accurate out [that far], but I do think this expresses exactly what we know to be the long-run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth So, if I could end up in 1996 with zero inflation While we have 3/4 of a percent in the Bluebook table, clearly that falls within my notion of what zero inflation would be; I would guess that 3/4 to 1-1/2 percent would probably be real zero inflation if we measured properly So, I have a clear preference for alternative II I would admit, Mr Chairman, that politically I think February 1992 is not a good time for you in your Humphrey-Hawkins report to announce this Even though it would be a wonderful economic presentation and education, I think it would not be desirable for you to do that And I can't imagine your wanting to do that So, I will accommodate myself to one more year of begrudgingly voting for and accepting alternative I But I do want us to be [where alternative II takes us] And I do agree with Bill Hendricks and Tom Melzer that we must keep our vision on price level stability Indeed, in the circumstances that we're in, that clear commitment to price level stability in the Humphrey-Hawkins report will do more to keep long- term rates down and I believe will give us a better growth path than we would get if we appear to be willing to re-inflate   Mr Chairman, I didn't; I would not   I have a question, Mr Chairman Isn't there some danger in that? I agree that the majority of the voting members would accept the upper part of the range But if we said that in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, doesn't that then put us in the position of appearing to have [that as the] actual desired range? Suppose money growth is weaker than we anticipate Even though we might end up, let's say, cutting the fed funds rate one or two times, we might still have weak growth Would that not then cause our critics in Congress  -50-    2/4-5/92  to say to us You really acted as if you wanted to be in the upper end and then you didn't [even] get to the middle   I would prefer that   Don, I guess this is a question for Ted Truman as well as for you When we look at the real exchange value of the dollar, I presume we do not make any attempts to adjust for differences in the measurement of inflation in the United States versus that in the other G-7 countries If most of us tend to believe that we might be as much as 1 percentage point off on our measurement  -52-    2/4-5/92  of inflation, over a period a time that 1 percentage point compounded could give us quite a distortion in terms of the real exchange value of the dollar   It seems to me that in places like Japan, by using rents as the equivalent to owner-occupied homes and then having rent control, they understate their rate of inflation   All right   Mr Chairman, I can certainly support your recommendation But I would like to indicate my strong preference, if easing does appear to be appropriate, that we time it with more forward-looking indicators and avoid creating the impression that monetary policy is tied to the real economy If that [latter] impression is developed, then the bond market will anticipate, rightly or wrongly, that a rebound in growth means we're going to tighten Whereas if the monetary aggregates--and I might even mention commodity prices--were to indicate the desirability of having a lower fed funds rate, it would be clear that any easing that we do would really not be easing in the sense that money growth was below target and we were trying to keep monetary policy neutral by not pegging the fed funds rate high   Preferred   Mike, what are you seeing for energy prices, mainly oil prices, for the remainder of 1992 as compared to your earlier view of that?   It was a runup based upon a predicted freeze   I haven't checked   Don, that does bring March then to just about exactly on the midpoint of our target range from Q4?   Mr Chairman, I'd like to go back to Si and ask for an update on Caterpillar   Thank you   I'd like to return to the oil price question and the exchange rate question Charlie, what I'm wondering is If the dollar is on the stronger side, as some of us have been suggesting for the last six weeks, and if the economies abroad in Europe and Japan are on somewhat subdued growth paths, how would you expect the price of oil to be able to be increased in deutschemark and yen terms? Under those somewhat lessened demand conditions, would there not be a tendency for the price of oil to remain somewhat stable in those currencies and to rise in dollars?   Yes   I know   Well, I was thinking more in terms of $2 a barrel, which is I guess within your range of not--   Well, it seems to me that it's material It also seems to me that it almost works, in terms of our imports, like a reduction in taxes   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that it might be somewhat worthwhile at this point to reassure the new members that in [our review of] this issue two years ago most of us who were on the side of not having as heavy a hand and not building up our foreign currency balances have been very appreciative of the fact that the Federal Reserve's position under the Chairman's leadership has been in the direction that we prefer I have a great deal of appreciation for the fact that there's a political question involved here And it seems to me that our being absent from a significant portion of that [intervention] speaks a lot louder than the $25 million participation that we did So, I feel in accord with the direction we're going in and I'm satisfied, but I'm not suggesting that we ought not to have the review Mr Chairman, I'd be very happy to move to ratify the transactions, if that's appropriate   Yes, I would Anything you say, Mr Chairman! [Laughter]   I would agree that the staff forecast is a reasonable forecast I would be on the side of slightly lower nominal GNP, if I had any difference, over the coming two or three quarters I agree with Jerry Corrigan that the circumstances in Japan are really close to being super worrisome Asset price deflations once underway may not respond as well as some may believe to a monetary policy adjustment And I think we all know about the run-up in real estate prices in Japan It's not as if it were a magnitude of 2 times or 3 times as high as would seem reasonable, but it might be more a magnitude of 5 to 10 times as high as might be reasonable! I guess all of us have had confidence that they will be able to produce a soft landing a lot better than we could, and yet it does seem to me that their reluctance to respond to rather low monetary growth does indicate that the tide among central banks internationally, including the G-7, is still pretty conservative It seems to me that the European community also has its own problems, and driving European monetary policy by the Bundesbank's particular set of parameters affecting Germany and not affecting others seems to me to [drive fiscal policy in Europe to] equal in some sense the fiscal policy in Germany, which is out of accord with the Maastrich rules That is, they're not going to qualify for being a part of the club if their fiscal policies deteriorate So, even though I expect some change, as Ted Truman suggested, it does seem to me that it will be on the conservative side And when you look at those European economies and the amount of subsidies that are there and the pressures that are on them, it does seem to me that they are not quite in the promised land in regard to the economic growth that one would expect to be a part of the Common Market phenomenon I think we will find more and more that a common economic market without a common political market has a lot of obstacles and they haven't found the way to crawl over all the boulders yet And there seem to be a lot of boulders  This would then suggest that US exports or net exports would be even more of a drag than Mr Truman and the staff suggest And I suppose my optimism shines forth here in regard to my belief that with cost-cutting in US firms, with the exchange value of the dollar where it is and the learning curve that our exporters are on, I  -22-    3/31/92  expect to see us do as well as the staff suggests if not slightly better, even with a somewhat weaker foreign economy  Now, it seems to me that the driving force in regard to monetary growth in the United States is not so much what happens on the liabilities side of the commercial banks' balance sheets but what happens on the assets side When commercial banks have been looking at spreads between loans and CDs and all of a sudden on the margin the assets they are picking up are US government securities, then in a sense the spread that they're chasing is a quite different spread So the only way that they're going to have the kind of earnings they insist on is to have CD rates that tend to continue to run lower than rates on governments, which it seems to me is going to [encourage] disintermediation to some extent and hold up M2 growth as compared to Ml and the monetary base So, in this environment it seems to me we end up with really quite a bit of rope out on the table And, frankly, I don't think it would make much difference in the growth of the monetary aggregates if we had fed funds rates 50 basis points lower than they are So, I would still expect the monetary aggregates to come in at around the midpoint [of their ranges] or below And if the monetary aggregates surprise me and are stronger than that, then I think it's probably getting pretty late in the game My guess would be that once private credit demands increase--and I think the good news we are hearing around the table gives some notion that there might be some increases in private credit demands--if they begin to expand as fast as we would like them to grow, then we would probably find growth of M2 headed toward double-digit rates, though again I'm talking quite a few quarters down the road, farther than I can really see My guess is that we might have to have an adjustment in the fed funds rate of 200 basis points to [rein] that in But I think that's a long ways down the pike   Well, Don, they are your seasonal adjustment numbers!  -30-    3/31/92   Mr Chairman, I would prefer to be symmetric It seems to me that the foreign central bankers perceive our policy as being easier than it is And they tend to have this history [of believing] that the United States always sort of leads the way to too much inflation I think we really have a very delicate matter here in regard to the foreign perspective as to where we are, and how those  -32-    3/31/92  central banks feel about us spills over into the capital markets Of course, I can see that there might be some circumstance--if the Bank of Japan made a significant easing move and the yen became extra weak while factors here made it consistent with price level stability-- [where it would be appropriate] for us to make a move I could understand that And I can vote for a policy that's not my preference based upon what I said at the last FOMC meeting Mr Chairman, I also said at that time that I had all the confidence in the world that you wanted to meet the same price level stability objectives I have a great deal of confidence in that, so I can vote for asymmetry [toward ease], but I have to express a little caution when I do   I guess it's the yield curve problem that I consider And [despite] Governor Mullins's careful analysis of that yield structure, I don't quite agree with his view that it's the fiscal [situation] that drives it It seems to me the driving factor is that monetary policy was seen to be eased on the basis of real economy data And the bond markets say that if we ease on the basis of the real economy, then we're going to tighten if the real economy is strong So, I think it's this anticipation of stronger growth that has caused the yield curve to falter So, even though we've got money in the bank, in the real bank, I don't think we have much money in the perception bank   I not only concur, but I really want to express appreciation for Bill McDonough's capturing the spirit of the Board and the FOMC position and very well representing that It's very comforting to me to know the direction we're going, and I've had time to worry about other things!   Mike, looking back at the chart on page III-3 on M2 velocity Last fall some around here were quite concerned that M2 growth was quite a good indicator of where [the economy was] and yet these first-quarter numbers I presume [raise] nominal [GNP growth] for the first quarter up to somewhere between 6 and 7 percent That makes V-2, with a one-quarter lag, shoot up to 4 percent Doesn't that really cast a lot of doubt on all that concern about slow M2 growth?   I calculated the two-quarter lag also and had the same conclusions Thank you   I've always been very sympathetic to watching the monetary aggregates, and I believe that they really are a very [integral] part of our fundamental program against inflation But as you know, from time-to-time I have looked carefully at other means to determine whether or not there is a shift in demand for any one of the aggregates And I've concentrated on commodity prices as probably being the most sensitive in showing whether or not monetary restraint truly is in place or whether [policy is] characterized by monetary ease At the present time commodity prices, although they have the reputation of being very volatile, seem rather stable to me If there's any trend it's probably slightly upward but not as strong as ordinarily would be seen in a recovery phase So, on the surface that doesn't seem to show great inflation signals out ahead  -25-    5/19/92  Gold prices probably need to be looked at some, particularly since there are those who view the declining gold prices as [unintelligible] into growth rates This thesis holds that M2 growth has been very slow and it shows up by following gold prices I think it's important to recognize that gold is always [unintelligible] in regard to its monetary properties and for a long period of time gold prices were lower than market forces would have dictated due to the fact that many governments wanted to sell out their gold stocks Consequently, gold stayed in the [$340] range a lot longer than it otherwise would have Costs of production in many places in the world were way above that, and so there was no technology going into that industry When gold prices are running up so the optimists believe the price is going to be in the $500 range, then you get a surge of technology into that industry And it seems to me we're experiencing the impact of that surge Indeed, the surge has been primarily a US surge In the United States, we've had during the 1980s over $8 billion of investments in gold mining, just as an example of what technology can do when the price outlook is favorable That has resulted in a very quick [advance] for the United States from nowhere in the park of gold producers to the number 2 position Indeed, production in the United States is now above 60 percent of that in South Africa and very well could exceed South African production before the decade is over A new technology involving heat-bleaching means that the cost of production with that new technology runs closer to $250 an ounce rather than to $350 an ounce When you look at what is happening in Chile and other areas around the world, it looks as if this same technology probably is catching on in other places One would then expect the price of gold to fall closer to its cost-of- production in the marginally efficient areas I give this explanation I suppose partly because I've begun to receive "hate mail" [accusing me] of having been unresponsive to falling gold prices and [saying that I] should have been an advocate of monetary ease based upon that   Well, I answered the question by saying that I have never supported $350 an ounce gold; people just think that I do   I see Well, it's all right to be in that direction It seems to me that we ought not let the current information on inflation, disappointing as it is, cause us to move to precipitate action It seems to me that sound money is something we accomplish over a long period of time But it does suggest to me that the level of restraint that's out there is probably not as great as many have thought it to be and that we do need to be in a posture of maintaining constant restraint over time until we get the producer price index numbers behaving better than they're behaving There's no reason for us not to get inflation in the goods sector quickly down to zero And I think if we maintain the kind of posture that's needed, that will occur I do think there will be a time lag between [that and] the adjustment of inflation in the services sector to zero  Looking at the real economy, the Greenbook forecast is one with which I would have no strong arguments I would expect exports to be somewhat stronger than in the Greenbook and I would expect  -26-    5/19/92  productivity gains in 1993 to be more of a continuation of the patterns seen in 1992 I would consequently expect corporate profits to be in range similar to what John LaWare has outlined It's a very disappointing period in regard to those inflation numbers I think we do not stand ourselves in good stead by representing too strong an interest in movements in the real economy from quarter-to-quarter   The average target would be more like 4-1/2 to 5 percent  [Coffee break]   You know, it's written as it would be written if we were going to publish it the next day   Mr Chairman, I could support an asymmetric directive if it were toward tightness and I could accommodate myself  -40-    5/19/92  to a symmetric directive as you have suggested It seems to me that we do encounter some likelihood over the coming period that the fed funds rate might need to be closer to 5 percent than to 3-3/4 percent; and money growth, M2, right now doesn't give us any leeway to make that move at this point in time So, symmetric will work for me But I just wanted you to know my leanings and also my inability to support the asymmetric direction   Asymmetric in which direction? [Laughter]   I understand the "might" but do you want "somewhat" on both sides?   We might take out the words "a resumption of"   "With growth of"  SPEAKER(?) That's better   What would be the impact of following case 2 versus case 3 on the saving rate and thereby the investment rate over that period?   So, the argument for case 2 really is that the benefits would appear in the period from 1996 to maybe 2006, which I think everyone would admit is a very long time   It seems to me that we ought to assume that the economy is really moving along at about a 2 percent growth path in the first half I tend to discount somewhat that little higher number for the first quarter, and I wouldn't consider moving back to 2 percent in the second quarter and maybe only a little higher than that in the third quarter as being out of line It seems to me that it's very difficult to derail and change the direction of an economy We have a huge transfer payments support network in this economy, and I just don't see what it is that's going to turn all this around We're seeing a lot of the same things we've been seeing for some time but I don't see new sources of weakness out there at this time Whereas my forecasts for real GDP and the CPI are identical to the staff's for 1992, I have some concern about the particular mix that the staff uses to get there And it seems to me there's a vulnerability I think this adjustment period we've been in is really an adjustment period in regard to the personal saving rate in our economy I expect the personal saving rate to be inching up whereas the staff has it pretty flat I also see the trade deficit moving south again as a vulnerability for the foreign exchange value of the dollar And with the dollar as weak as it is, any move at this point that would be associated with a lower fed funds rate could quite easily be interpreted as Federal Reserve acquiescence to a depreciating or devalued dollar And I'm not sure how world capital markets would react to such an event There's a real potential for upset in that regard Corporate profits and cash flows look pretty good, so the saving rate in the business sector may be much better than in the government sector, which doesn't look like it's going to respond very rapidly and yet does, I think, provide a considerable amount of restraint  So, it seems to me that we're in a circumstance in which our being seen as focusing on price level stability has more payoff than any other action in terms of having faster growth I just do not see how an alteration of the present fed funds rate is going to contribute to an improved outlook, and I think it could very well contribute to instability rather than stability   Don, when economic variables don't behave as our background and our history suggest they should behave, it seems to me that we may have a tendency to think too soon that there will be a return to the standard or what we would call "normal" Let me ask you what you think the risks are that this [unusual] behavior of M2 and its velocity has not yet peaked What is the risk that M2 growth might be even lower and V2 might be even higher than you anticipate? The reason I'm asking is because a 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is pretty close [on the low side] It doesn't do what Bob Black suggests, does it? That is, it doesn't really move the range down so that we center it on 2 percent So, my question is What is the probability that M2 growth might be substantially lower than 2 percent and V2 substantially higher?   No, I wasn't suggesting that you weren't balanced; I was just suggesting that if you were projecting 5 percent growth and we had a range of 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, that a miss on one side would be a more serious--  -36-    6/30-7/1/92   Well, no I would be historically at least close enough to Bob Black not to want to do that But I think you've answered the question   Mr Chairman, Bob Black got into part of my question but I want to follow it up I just have two questions and then, depending on your answer, I'll respond Our commitment to price level stability has in it, in a sense, the background that we thought we were going to be lowering these M2 targets until we got down to an M2 growth rate that was consistent with price stability I believe many of us thought that it meant "never-never land"--that maybe at some point in time M2 growth rates of 1 to 4 percent or somewhere in that area would be consistent with price level stability if we didn't have something going on with regard to the aggregates After the higher costs of intermediation have worked their way through--and I think Larry Lindsey is right that these [adjustments] can't go on forever, at least not in one direction--what in your mind would be an appropriate M2 target consistent with price level stability in that future out there?   Sure   The second question is If you believe as you and Bob were indicating in your interchange that price level stability needs to be a significant part of the Humphrey-Hawkins report--and you know I agree with that--what alternate form of communication do you propose [to convey] that that's what we are out to do and the manner in which we want to do it? What would substitute for Jerry Jordan's 2 to 6 percent range that some of us voted for last year and pulling that down? I'm open to another program   Well, you see my question stems from a view that there is something resembling a Wicksellian natural rate of interest prevailing in the critical 5-year, 7-year intermediate interest rate area, and we have tacked onto that Wicksellian natural rate an uncertainty premium in regard to inflation because the world doesn't know what we're doing What I'm asking is What do we say? How do we explain our action? What is the guidepost that causes the bond markets around the world to understand the nature of our commitment?   Yes   Well, I am so committed to such a proposal and I have such questions about M2, which we're working on, that I'm certainly willing to consider an alternative that has that kind of commitment to explain to the world exactly what it is that guides us And it indicates in a sense the rigors of monetary policy You know, gold standards aren't marvelous deals; the only thing gold standards do is that they ensure some kind of discipline that will remain there; if you stay with that game, you don't have the luxury of doing what's popular What we have to do is to indicate some better system than that, which would give the world the confidence we need so that we can get economic growth restored   Frankly, Mr Chairman, I think that a statement in the Humphrey-Hawkins from you that indicates our commitment to this program and our expectations of some success--almost a Bundesbank-like commitment to price level stability--without any monetary aggregates in it, would work But that's a pretty tough step for us to take   Yes, he's very friendly   Well, I can go with your recommendation with this interchange as background, and I thank you   In a sense that's the problem we had a year ago When we talked about the range for '92 we said "Well, let's just put the tentative marker down and leave it alone" Then when we got to February we said "Well, we really don't want to change our tentative marker" So our tentative marker last year got to be a little more solid than some of us had hoped   Well, I didn't think we were and I didn't think Don thought we were I thought M2 was a problem a year ago Opportunity costs and M2 velocity were running off the charts a year ago, so we knew we had a problem   In other words you find it hard to vote the same way that I vote?   That's the big point   The first half?   Congratulations, Mr Chairman   Don, is there any alternative language to "The Committee agreed on tentative ranges"? It seems to me that what we're saying here is something a little different than "agreed" on tentative ranges I think what we've agreed to do is quite different; we are really saying that we are deferring a decision to change the range   Yes, any change in the wording would be helpful   "Established" is tough   Yes, "set" is better   Well, "plucked" might be even better!   Thank you   Don, M1 growth from Q4 to June would be what?   So it's approximately 12 percent--well within double-digits then?   And the 3-month growth rate of Ml?   Thank you   Does that modify your real GDP for the second quarter?   In some ways it seems strange, I suppose, to be confident at times such as these, but I ask myself what we need to do to have long bond rates lower by September 1 and I am very, very confident that [the answer] is for us to do as you suggest and that is to stand pat I believe that the Federal Reserve does control long- run bond prices; it's much tougher than [controlling] the fed funds rate, but if we're going to control long bond prices, we have to do it by focusing on that [rate] The uncertainty inflation premium is very disruptive to economic growth I'm also confident that economic growth will be stronger if we stand pat and if we give the world a sense that we are indeed an independent central bank that has its eye upon the one thing we can do and that is to create an environment of price stability That adds not only to long-run growth but I believe it adds to short-run growth in this environment I understand that the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony has been pretty well determined, and I'm thinking about how our commitment to price level stability would come out if before that [testimony] or at that time [we were to ease] We know that's not what is our guide, but the world will see it as a capitulation It seems to me it would undermine that testimony that I understood you wanted to be there as a substitute for lowering the monetary aggregates growth ranges  Now, like John LaWare and Tom Melzer, I strongly prefer symmetric language because that really is standing pat I wonder, with the attention on symmetry that took place last time, whether we will get through the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony without this being known It seems to me that even going from symmetry back to asymmetry sends a signal of uncertainty that the market doesn't need So, I strongly prefer symmetric language I heard what you said in regard to the way you're going to make your choices and I didn't hear anything about M2 being the guiding factor in that So, in a sense, I'm very supportive of what you're saying, but I'm very concerned  -70-    6/30-7/1/92  about being in the same voting group with others who certainly want to ease quickly   I think we need the sentence in, but I'd take "especially" out  -74-    6/30-7/1/92   With "especially" out   If we take the sentence out, how can we live with the 2 percent and the 1/2 percent?  SPEAKER(?) That's the problem   What do we have besides 2 percent and 1/2 percent? What is a better number than 2? If we say "about" and we want to be symmetric around it what number would you choose, Don?   No, I don't--   2 percent   Oh, I see--2, okay   Well, why don't we take "long-run" out? Say "suggests that the relationship between their growth and the Committee's objectives is uncertain at this time"   I think you've hit it, Jerry I think that's where the uncertainty is We're not certain whether the contemplated reserve conditions are consistent with--   It seems to me that we could say "The contemplated reserve conditions are not likely to cause the monetary aggregates to return to their targeted ranges"   Yes, "may not be consistent with the aggregates returning to their ranges"   Well, in a way not, because if we were--   I think that's accurate I don't think we expect that Look at this chart in the Bluebook and where "B" is   But Mike, Don's chart shows "A" and "B" below not only the cone but below the parallel lines Both "A" and "B" are below the parallel lines and we ought to communicate--   Well, Mr Chairman, if we're going to delegate to you some [asymmetry], why can't we delegate to you [the task of] carefully going over this until you're satisfied that you have a [good] sentence? I would prefer to give you the authority to clean that up or take it out, whichever one you want   Yes, it would be better than our trying to manufacture [one as we sit here]   Ed, this is Wayne Angell Really, the money markets don't need any broadening here, and once we start that process we really have no way to end it I think it's best to do as we've been doing in the past because the money markets don't need a lot of support A 7 to 0 vote speaks for itself   Well, even though I really support what you've said, Mr Chairman, I find it unusual for me to be almost on the other side of you on this issue in that I have complained so often over six years regarding intervention I need to make my position clear; I don't think it has been expressed by anyone yet There are many ways that we go about conducting monetary policy In that context, foreign exchange policy is a part of monetary policy Monetary easing domestically tends to cause the value of a currency to depreciate versus other goods that are trading in the domestic market Internationally, monetary ease tends to make a currency less valued against goods traded worldwide and against foreign currencies The full scope of monetary policy then should enable us from time-to-time to use all aspects of this Monetary policy is not the sole province of the Federal Reserve When the Secretary of the Treasury makes remarks, in some sense that creates uncertainties in the market in regard to what US policy is  My own view is that the foreign exchange value of the dollar at this time is in a very precarious spot It's not whether or not the market is very disorderly but whether or not it will become very disorderly We have used monetary policy to take interest rates in the United States very low for domestic purposes compared to the monetary policy adopted by the Bundesbank in pursuit of their domestic policy As a result of [the slope of] our yield curve out to 10 years [versus] the Bundesbank's yield curve out to 10 years, there is an arbitraged 10-year D-mark/dollar forward rate of 170 [Unintelligible] if the Bundesbank seems to be more concerned about inflation than we are, that would tend to make the forward D-mark stronger compared to the forward dollar Now, we are in a spot, it seems to me, where we have to understand that what happens in the foreign exchange market is part and parcel of what happens to 10-year Treasury securities If we were to ignore the foreign exchange relationship in a world with huge international capital [stocks], the international capital flows would occur in such a way as to cause an equilibrium adjustment of 10-year notes in the United States It just can't be that the dollar will fall off a cliff [relative to] the D- mark and head down from 145 to 140 to 135; if that occurs, then at some point in time someone will say "Hey, how in the world can the dollar get back to 170?" And there could be a serious breakdown such as what the Chairman suggested happened in [October] of 1987 To me we are very close to that kind of serious breakdown I believe we    8/18/92  have accomplished a great deal of what we wanted to accomplish, which was to create an interest rate environment in the United States that was conducive to US economic growth I don't believe at this point that depreciating the dollar is going to work very much [in the direction of providing] stimulus to our foreign trade It's part and parcel of all that we do, and I don't want to tie one of our hands behind our back at a critical moment in time If someone says that they want us to use the right hand to do one thing and the left hand to do something else, then I will vote "no" as I did in the summer of [1989] when we were following an exactly opposite policy in foreign exchange intervention than we were in [domestic] monetary policy Now, I support this program; it's a good program and I think we ought to be prepared to do more of it But I support it because I do not want to take the foreign exchange value of the dollar down, which will cause import prices to rise and will not be conducive to progress on inflation I don't want monetary ease In a sense that could be a drastic kind of monetary policy ease that I believe could upset the markets So, I guess that's a more extreme position than has been heard   Well, I agree that there's no question as to where the call is located legally in regard to exchange rate policy But the monetary policy operations of this Committee can overwhelm any official exchange rate policy That is, if we decide to buy Treasuries or buy deutschemarks--it doesn't make any difference--if we buy in the open market, we will overwhelm other foreign exchange objectives So, this Committee has tremendous power when it comes to determining the outcome of the official position that is [decided] by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Chairman   So move   They are interest-bearing notes   I wanted to hear all the news and I agree that Governor Lindsey has summarized it pretty well There is almost a total lack of anyone who thinks the economy really is going to go charging ahead, and maybe that's the best news there is I've had such low nominal GNP forecasts for so long that I'm glad finally to have some company with forecasts the same as mine I think you're right also, Governor Lindsey, in looking at the international arena That's not something we can control Yet the US dollar is still the major reserve currency for the world and the US dollar is affected by activities that take place in the world Even though the goods markets may be very imperfect, with a lot of protectionist devices out there, the capital markets are not imperfect and they do move very quickly When we look at the question of whether or not the disinflation in the United States has gone too far and whether we are moving into deflation, the fact of the matter is that wholesale prices around the world on a year-over-year rate of change basis indicate much more disinflation as do prices in other G-10 countries than do prices in the United States Of course, in Japan [prices have declined] year-over-year; but even in Germany, with the Bundesbank worried about inflation, the year-over-year change in wholesale prices  -34-    8/18/92  is lower than ours and very close to zero It even looks as if the United Kingdom's disinflation rate is such that their year-over-year change in wholesale prices might slide under ours in a couple of months Our year-over-year change in wholesale prices at 18 percent just doesn't show what I would call disinflation turning into deflation So, I don't see how we can build the story that we're in a deflationary environment  Clearly, we're in an environment in which economic conditions are very sluggish To me this is to be expected It seems to me that American households should want to alter their balance sheets and to increase their saving rate And it seems to me that there is some prospect that the saving rate before we get to 1994 might move up beyond 5 percent from the low of 4 percent that we had a few years ago We've seen it move on up to 5 percent and I think it quite likely could move up to 5-1/2 percent before 1994 That would mean then that the source of our growth would not be from the consumer sector as we might expect As we look at the patient, Dr LaWare, maybe we ought not just be patient but monitor a few things as we go along I think we ought to monitor commodity prices and see that commodity prices do not turn downward Gold has quite often led commodity prices; gold has bounced around some and is now in somewhat of a downward mode I don't think we ought to ignore that leading signal which might be more important at this point than M2 in terms of our seeing where we're going Frankly, if the price of gold were to take another strong leg down, I'm not sure but I might join Governor Lindsey in regard to where we ought to go But I do believe that we need to be on a very secure price level stability base before we make the next easing move because, if the world doesn't know that we are committed to price level stability and we ease in that environment, we risk destabilizing financial markets around the world Governor Phillips says What do we have to lose? There's not much danger that the inflation the bankers are worried about is going to come charging back But I do think in the environment that we're in that we could very well destabilize international capital markets and we might understand that the notion of sour is a whole lot better with the DOW at 3320 than if the DOW were losing 200 points a day So, I think there's some strength out there In addition to commodity prices, I want to monitor M2 I think M2 in the coming months is going to be very important because I've had an hypothesis that M2 is going to be guided more by what happens to intermediate rates [unintelligible]   I'm uncomfortable with "C" because putting the velocity in there makes it seem that the resulting nominal GDP is exactly what our policy objective is, whereas my understanding is that we would like the resulting nominal GDP to be higher than it might be or than we might be able to make it to be So, I would prefer just to do the straightforward "B," I'm presuming with your revised numbers that you might be able to put a "2" in there Is that right?   So, I'd prefer "B" with 2 percent in it   That's acceptable to me   But if more banks were to choose to adopt the alternative clearing balances, that would alter that prospect, right?   I'm glad to have you contribute your part to that!   There seems to be little disagreement in the views that I expect to hear as the go-around continues and the staff forecast It does not seem to me likely that the economy is going to be substantially stronger than the forecast Since I anticipate so much agreement in regard to the current state of the economy, it seems to me it would be well for us to continue the earlier discussion, which involved assessing how well monetary policy is working to accomplish any impact upon the real economy Now, I for one have more confidence, I think, in Mike Prell's forecast than maybe he does   My confidence is based upon the fact that he has produced consistently biased errors in one direction over the last three years That seems to me entirely likely if you have someone who has some motive other than getting the forecast right or if the model is defective And it seems to me it's time for us to examine more carefully the model that produced such biased errors Let me go back to the Humphrey-Hawkins period and the July FOMC meeting I think the pickup in M2 growth in August and September to a very slight 3 percent rate was due more to the declines in intermediate rates, which were almost unprecedented, following the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in July We had dramatic declines in two-year, three-year, five-year, seven-year, and ten-year Treasury rates, and that seems to me to account for the rise in M2 Now, I would hold that lower fed funds rates under some conditions may well reduce aggregate demand and that under some conditions lowering the fed funds rate may very well cause intermediate rates to rise Under those circumstances it seems to me that M2 will grow more slowly rather than more rapidly and we will then end up with unintended consequences    10/6/92  But to me the most important point is not necessarily to look at the [transmission] mechanism through the fed funds rate on M2 but to look at it in terms of its impact upon household balance sheets and on household income statements I believe it's time for us to devote a great deal of attention to the question of the duration of household assets and the duration of household liabilities If households have taken [on] a huge interest rate debt and if the duration of household assets were conditioned by a period of rising interest rates or an expectation that interest rates would rise again and if households then are holding very short duration assets, under those conditions a fall in the fed funds rate is going to result in a substantial reduction in household income Now, I do not know what the duration of household assets might be by looking at their flow-of-funds I don't know whether anyone knows what that duration might be What I'm suggesting is that there may be some conditions under which lowering the fed funds rate is not going to work the way we'd anticipate Since we have watched the fed funds rate come down from 990 percent to 3 percent--that's 690 basis points--and it has had less than the intended effect upon credit and upon spending, then it seems very appropriate for us to look again at this model  Now I'm going to live a little dangerously I think I disagree with Bill McDonough's comment that the foreign exchange market does not in a sense have an implication for our domestic monetary decisions I would agree that a reserve currency country does not take its cues from trying to follow somebody else's exchange rate But it seems to me that the dramatic fall in intermediate interest rates in July and August put the spot foreign exchange value of the dollar on a downward course, unless the implied forward rate of the dollar were rising faster than those rates were falling So, we have to ask ourselves then What will happen if we reduce the fed funds rate at a time when the foreign exchange value of the dollar may be at a precarious point? It seems to me that making a fed funds rate move might very well feed into a weaker dollar I think all of us must understand that we have a very exploding global money market condition; we have almost pure competition in this market--not perfect because information is catching up--but it's exploding also So, with this very perfected money market that is global, we have to look at the feedback loops that possibly exist between the fed funds rate and its impact upon the weaker dollar and its subsequent impact, which could very well cause intermediate rates to rise Indeed, if the implied forward exchange rate is to remain constant, then under those circumstances lowering the fed funds rate [and] lowering the two-year Treasury rate, has to raise the implied forward rate at years 9 and 10; otherwise we're going to be out of adjustment on the forward rates So, I believe we're in a precarious place here One of the good things we have going for us in an economy that needs growth is that the US equity market has not yet taken a tumble But I think most are very leery concerning where we are here  My assessment, then, of our current economic condition is that it is a global-money capital-market-driven relationship We have gone a long way And I am not optimistic about the impact of lowering the fed funds rate at this point in time in terms of stimulating economic growth Now, if we are willing to make our fed funds rate moves based upon price level targeting and if everyone knows that's the basis upon which we're making our moves, then it seems to me that under those circumstances we could very well expect in the future that  -21-    10/6/92  lower fed funds rates will provide us more bang for the buck So, I'm in a mode of saying that there may be lower fed funds rates out there that will be helpful in the future if we are on the path that Mike Prell has suggested toward price level stability But the question for us is How do we get the most bang for the buck?   Mr Chairman, I was hoping we would come into this meeting and be prepared to be patient, be prepared to seize the initiative from financial markets and indicate that we were conducting monetary policy in a deliberative way as Governor Lindsey suggested I think what you've given us, Mr Chairman, is a courageous action in that it does step back from market expectations However, there is a difference between courage and foolhardiness; and no matter how strongly I believe that it would be appropriate for us not to take a step at this time, I do want to see how the markets react to this news because what you've suggested is, it seems to me, news So, it's a courageous step and I think we should see how the markets behave [in reaction to] the step that we're taking If at a point in time the Board of Governors were to decide to lower the discount rate, then it  -45-    10/6/92  would be appropriate under those circumstances to have a telephone conference call Even though my preference would be a straight "B," you certainly accommodate what I believe is appropriate under these conditions   Which votes are you trying to lose? [Laughter]   We have had a rather sustained six quarters of doom and gloom and yet the economy has continued to move along at an average rate of 2-1/4 percent over that six quarters In spite of all the talk about forward and back and double dip or triple dip, we really have not had as much variability in real GDP as normally occurs So, the economy in some sense is doing pretty well given these conditions As for the downside risk, I share the view that Jerry Corrigan has mentioned It does seem to me that the pace of developments--not only monetary policy but other policies and outcomes --in the United States is somewhat out of step compared to developments in Europe and Japan While commodity prices seem to be very subdued in dollar terms--in fact to some extent one might say they are still on a very slight downward trend, with a decline of maybe 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate over the last four years-- nevertheless, wholesale prices in the United States are not responding nearly as well as one would expect under those conditions That is, the rate of change in our finished goods wholesale prices year-over- year has been stuck in the 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent range for some time In contrast, even though they have much higher wage and price inflexibility, the year-over-year rate of change in wholesale prices in Germany is -16 percent and in Japan -13 percent And the Bundesbank is very upset about a 3-1/2 percent inflation rate as measured by their year-over-year CPI Yet, somehow or other, we are at 32 percent and maybe that's [viewed as] okay  I'm wondering with this GATT round--and we all seem to dispute where it [stands]--how much danger we're in with regard to a continuing rollback of trade openness With this kind of slow growth that the world is experiencing--and I think that's reflected in commodity prices--I'm wondering whether or not we really are on a much more dismal path toward protectionism than we may believe I'm wondering if Europe and Japan may be closer to zero in their real growth I'm wondering what that means for world capital markets if the United States is able to achieve 3 or 3-1/2 or possibly 4 percent real GDP growth It seems to me rather unlikely that we could get up to that level of GDP growth with [the economies of] Europe and Japan as slow as they are But I think there is considerable risk that the capital markets, and indeed politicians here, may not be willing to accept a rising trade deficit for the United States If under those  -21-    11/17/92  circumstances we have a restrained US trade position, and if the GATT round does not get done in the next two or three weeks, we could be in a very, very difficult [situation] I also wonder about world competitiveness under conditions in which many countries continue to have an industrial policy And there are those in the United States who I think are somewhat more inclined in that direction What happens to capital markets and what happens to profit margins when we have these kinds of competitive conditions worldwide? Do we find other industries falling [to] the same world profitability level that we've seen at times in steel and coal and ore? Are our airline profitability rates in significant danger of being repeated [in] automobiles? How long can we go on with Boeing and McConnell Douglas and other aircraft manufacturers being in somewhat of an up stage while we're watching these airlines and the major leasing firms have their difficulties? So, I'm not worried as much about a double dip or triple dip as I am about an expansion in the United States that is in some sense unsustainable given world conditions It seems to me we might have to ask questions about a true recovery, a true expansion, but one that is not sustainable in a world undergoing severe trade restraint So, I continue to find things to worry about   9 percent   1979?   I think they were pretty well stuck at 9 percent in '79   Mr Chairman on my preference for the short-run specifications, I agree not only with your analysis but also with your policy, although for me it's a preference for "B" symmetric under the conditions that you outlined As you described the risks, it seems to me that the risks are pretty balanced So, I think symmetric language really is more apt to describe where we are  In regard to the ranges for 1993, I agree with you that the technical conditions have changed Unfortunately, we stopped the policy of [making yearly] 1/2 point declines in the ranges that we had been doing a while back I would prefer that we go all the way to 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent Let me tell you why It seems to me that, when we have a forecast calling for 2 percent M2 growth for 1993, starting in with a forecast right [near] the bottom of the range doesn't give us much [room] for errors V2 could be slightly stronger than we expect as well as slightly weaker Under those circumstances I'd hate for us to run the risk of being below the target range when the economy might be performing in such a manner that we believe we're on target in regard to the economic performance, including price level stability The second reason I would favor the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is that I don't think it's going to be easy for us any time to make downward changes in the ranges So it seems to me that when we're making a downward change, we might as well make it what we need to make it at the time rather than be faced with having to do it later on The third reason that I prefer the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is that it gives us a midpoint of 3 percent And if Mike Prell's forecast on inflation is correct, then that 3 percent midpoint might  -28-    11/17/92  blend in to a long-term stable condition that would be conducive to this alteration of expectations I agree with you that a break in expectations that would get long-term rates to move down--think about what the 30-year bond at 6-1/2 or 6 or even possibly 5-1/2 percent would do for us in regard to growth--is very, very important The fourth reason that I favor 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is that what you said about inventories is certainly very applicable If we get an investment tax credit, if we get inventories moving, and the economy turns out to be a little stronger than it needs to be, and we have V2 where we think V2 will be, then we might find ourselves in the position of needing to tighten And I don't think that would be a good idea I would prefer when we need to tighten to have a possibility of [M2 growth] being at least in the upper half of the range So, the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range gives us that advantage  As for timing, with a new Administration coming in I think there's a real advantage to them in regard to their planning process to know what we know On the basis of this study that we now have available, we do not think of this as a monetary policy [issue] as much as we think of it as a technical adjustment to the changing way that M2 works and responds to short-run opportunity costs that we control So, I think it's very important that we provide the information when we know it and give ample time I agree that there's a slight disadvantage in not having the testimony immediately [But] the members of the Banking Committees and their staffs will have good memories and will give you ample opportunity to be heard on this question come February When I envision your answering their questions at that time, I see it as easier for you to be answering them saying "Well, this is what we told you as soon as we had the study in on what we knew and this is what we told you as soon as we knew about the third-quarter GDP and third-quarter V2" So, to me, it's easier if we do it now   Well, I'm certainly agreeable to that!   I don't disagree with that  -31-    11/17/92   You favor 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent? I didn't hear   I agree it could very well be off 2 percentage points or 4 percentage points either way!   But I would prefer to have [the projected rate of growth] closer to the middle [of the range]   Saying that we expect to make a cut in February is really a good two-stage approach to that--   --because, after all, we're only dealing with a tentative choice now anyway   We still have to make the choice in February   So, there's a consensus, then   The minutes would read that there was a consensus?   And the Gonzalez letter is the vehicle for doing it?   Sure   It's purely technical It would be a policy move for us not to make the technical move   How do we make it soft asymmetric? I counted six who preferred symmetric and then you said either way   I've got Corrigan--   He said symmetric but he could accept   Right, you said symmetric but could accept asymmetric   Sure   Right   I would admit that it's 6 to 6 I think the Chairman can decide!   Well, it really is a moot point; when the fed funds rate is on top of the discount rate it is a moot point   So, I'm not going to vote "no" either way--   --because it's not that big a deal   I don't view the idea of protecting individual confidentiality in a discussion as being uniquely different for the Federal Reserve than for other groups I do believe we have a basis that we can argue is unique to the Federal Reserve, and that is that it's really group confidentiality we're trying to protect, not individual confidentiality It seems to me that we have to distinguish very carefully between the discount rate, which does have a clear announcement, and open market operations, which under different procedures really are perceived quite differently That is, it's important for us to preserve the flexibility for open market operations [in cases where] we're not pursuing fed funds targeting For us to say once and for all that fed funds targeting is the real way to [conduct] open market operations ignores the possibility that at some future date some monetary aggregate or some reserve measure, borrowed or nonborrowed, might behave in such a way that we would follow that; and we would once again be in a period in which market forces would be moving the fed funds rate rather than our doing it deliberately as a part of our policy So, I believe we ought not to make announcements about fed funds rate movements; to me that would take away the emphasis of the announcement effect of a discount rate [change] I agree that maybe we ought to move the discount rate more often and thereby make more announcements We could try to lean more toward doing that and not go the long periods as we sometimes do because of our hesitancy to [move] the discount rate  -58-    11/17/92  I also believe there's another important point in the Gonzalez letter to the Reserve Bank Presidents that needs to be addressed His request that the position of nonvoting presidents be ascertained and recorded is one that we ought to resist with emphasis The reason we ought to resist it is that recording the position of the nonvoting members then could have us in the confusing position of announcing that the majority of the members voted one way and the majority of the 19 participants voted another way By doing that we would in effect be overriding the Congressional intent when [the Banking] Act of 1935 [established] a Federal Open Market Committee made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors and five presidents We ought not to fall into that trap of those [nonmembers] being recorded  Now, I do agree with Ed Boehne and others who think that we ought to ask ourselves whether all the delays are necessary I wonder whether or not the delay in the release of the [policy record] for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting until three days after the next meeting could be [shortened to] four weeks after the meeting; if there's a tilt on policy and we haven't moved in the direction of the tilt, then it seems to me there's not much revelation after three or four weeks I don't know how much we really gain by waiting through the last part of the [intermeeting] period I would not want to take away the flexibility that exists by making an earlier announcement than that   But the question is not for us to try to buy something; the question is for us to ask if we are doing what we're doing in such a way that we can defend it I don't know how we can particularly defend waiting quite as long as we wait on the release of those FOMC policy directives   Why? We have tilts on which we don't act and we have tilts on which we do act   But I presume we have some exposure in regard to the tapes; it's just that we think we reduce the time scale of danger, isn't it? Aren't the tapes subject to a FOIA request?   Yes, but I'm saying we do have a period of vulnerability in regard to the tape   I think we have to keep that in mind   I had a question as to the 2 to 2-1/2 year delay I understand the delay on the present policy directive because what we're doing is waiting until the next meeting I think we have to be careful that we not oppose a delay that's not [unintelligible] or defensible   It seems to me that, whatever we might suggest, it's a very slippery slope downward I think we'd be better not to    12/14/92  get into such specifications because there is hardly any way to say that 2 years is different from 3 years or 1 year   Or 3 months And then somebody will say Well, why not 30 days?   You might defend that almost better than the other   I can see where the Presidents would like to have one letter, but if anyone wants to send a letter with a dissenting view from that of the majority, I think that would be appropriate since Mr Gonzalez wrote to [each of the Presidents] I don't think we should be seen as muzzling anyone   Is the meeting starting at 800 am?   Let me run this by again You mean a country owns gold and has it stored in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and if they ship it out, that's an export?   That makes sense!   But that again depends upon the elasticity of demand for the products   But it seems to me it's quite different if it occurs in a period of sustained monetary restraint than if it occurs in a period in which that monetary restraint is not in place   It seems apparent that the economy is stronger than we had anticipated I think the question we should be asking ourselves is why Now, it may be that this is a normal cyclical surprise, but I doubt it because normally we get a monetary aggregate like M2 growing at a fairly rapid rate in a recovery period and normally we get some upward movement in commodity prices as recoveries begin This recovery doesn't have those features and yet we have surprising growth in the midst of a period in which pessimism was the predominant view If we ask why, I think we may ask ourselves whether we have underestimated the short-run growth stimulus of getting the rate of inflation down We have decreased the tax rate on capital goods by lowering the rate of inflation, and that may have been in place long enough now to be giving us some real lift We're also seeing a labor productivity rebound which has been as strong as it has been in a normal cyclical [stage] in which employment and output both were growing So, this is something that we ought to keep in mind The one awesome worry out there is the external situation Will slow growth abroad and will the penchant for protectionism through either tariffs or subsidies or whatever cause the world's economy to be derailed? That's still a worry even though the US economy does seem to be well on its way to sustained expansion Now, it seems to me that the price level in the United States is still rising but at a decreasing rate And it seems to me that the price of gold may be falling at a decreasing rate Somewhere in here, if the rise in prices levels out at 3 percent, we may be missing a wonderful opportunity If short-run growth does respond as well as we might believe to lower inflation expectations, it would be unfortunate if we lost sight of the goal of monetary policy at the very time in which the field is most fertile for achievement of our long-term goal   Well, nominal GDP targeting is really not as bad as it might seem in that it does have a heavy price level direction to it That is, the advantage of using nominal GDP as a target versus using real GDP is that we are saying to other policymakers that if they in some sense gear up activities that tend to cause wage rate pressures or other price pressures to take place, then they are voting for lower real GDP So, nominal GDP targeting is not that far away from what I think is price level targeting I think price level targeting is better, but we'll see   Take the supply-side shock we had in 1973 That supply-side shock with nominal GDP targeting would have produced about the same kind of monetary restraint we would have had if we'd pursued a price level target A very severe monetary restraint would have been induced by that kind of supply-side shock   Yes, but the problem is that the FOMC in the 1970s did too much of that   If you had chosen the monetary base, your voting record would have been more conservative than Tom Melzer's!   Mr Chairman, I strongly support "B" symmetric I have no appetite for asymmetry toward tightness at this point, first, because I think there still are some weak spots out there But more importantly, I see no signs that in this intermeeting period we are likely to need a tightening immediately I just don't see that need right now Also, I have the feeling that if we do need to tighten, 25 basis points is probably not going to be enough; that is, when we hit the point where we need to tighten, we may need to go 200 basis points in one nice move [Laughter] That would help the markets get out of this habit that they get into every time we have this kind of circumstance and we move 25 basis points and then 50 basis points and the markets say Well, this is the first of a series and the bond market really takes a big hit It seems to me that we can't be so lucky that a 3 percent fed funds rate is just exactly right, but I see nothing now that would cause me to believe that a move is imminent   I didn't hear you   The original letter to you, as I recall, did not ask for individual replies from the Board of Governors   And, as I recall, since I've been a member of the Board there has never been a time when we've been requested as members of the Board to give an individual reply Now for me this is somewhat problematic because I've never been involved in as serious a discussion on this issue with members of the FOMC, whereas in the Board meetings I clearly have been involved as one who is not a middle-of-the-roader on this question of openness and Government in the Sunshine So I just want the members of the FOMC to know that I recognize that my position is not in the consensus; it is not in the majority at the Board I did not bother to argue the issue because there are so few who hold the position that I hold that I thought it would be a waste of my breath to do so But I do want to make this warning that my view is not mainstream   Yes, I will do that   And even I, Don, am much closer to the Committee than I am to Representative Gonzalez   You mean an unnamed successor? What does that do to Jerry's confidence?   Ted, what assumptions have you made in regard to the international trade process including GATT and the likelihood of dumping and possibly increased protectionism that might be forthcoming?   But in the steel cases do we not [impose] the necessity of posting bond so that already in the February--   I understand But do you think any modification of pricing behavior would be likely in this kind of environment?   Thank you    2/2-3/93   Thank you That's very helpful It's about what I would have expected   Yes, I just want to follow-up If there's an error in [their estimate of] the deflator, would that be an error in the nominal or in the real?   So then real GDP will go down?   It seems to me that we're the only game in town in regard to economic policy, and the only explanation for the significant rate of recovery that has been under way has been monetary policy And that has been occurring in an environment in which the head wind seems to be decreasing because monetary policy has worked to strengthen the net interest margin of the banking system, and that does mean that a great deal of impediments to lending are moving away  When I look at my forecast for 1992--I know the performance came in at 30 percent Q4 over Q4, which was higher than I anticipated -- I ask myself why I underestimated the performance in 1992 And I think it centers on the fact that I anticipated that the saving rate would rise more than it did and consumer spending as a result turned out to be much higher Indeed, if we look at gross domestic purchases in the second half of 1990, they were declining at a 37 percent rate; and in the second half of 1992 gross domestic purchases were increasing at a 4 percent rate That's a rather significant turnaround If we look at real GDP in the second half of 1990, it was falling at a 28 percent rate and in each half-year period since that time it proceeded to move up from negative 28 to negative 7 to positive 9 to positive 22 to positive 36 And I ask myself if monetary policy was successful in generating this accelerating recovery--though it was very modest at first--what in the world is going to stop it at this stage? Will it be our interest rates? The staff is forecasting lower interest rates in what I think are the most relevant portions of the yield curve, so that wouldn't seem to be a factor I must admit that I'm not quite as optimistic on long-term and intermediate-term interest rates as the staff is in its forecast When I look at commodity prices I ask myself, Mike How, after so many FOMC Humphrey-Hawkins [meetings] of having the Federal Reserve's experimental commodity chart in [your Chart Show] did you happen to take it out just at the time that the commodity prices are beginning to show something? The ex-food, ex-energy experimental commodity price index shows a rather significant change upward, which for the first time really goes with the kind of economic recoveries that we had in 1983 and 1987 This rise in commodity prices may not be    2/2-3/93  sustained How could commodity price moves ex-food, ex-energy be as strong as they are with M2 growth very slow and [recently] declining? Well, I just don't know how to judge M2 growth, but I do know that when commodity prices start moving upward it is an indication of what's happening on monetary policy showing through So, the bottom line is that I end up with a forecast that I guess is the highest of the lot, or at least at the top of the range I end up being slightly less optimistic than the staff on inflation for the first time since I've been a member of the Board of Governors I've been equal to the staff's expectation of the CPI but I've never been higher in any previous discussion  I do think FASB 106 is still going to be somewhat of a drag on productivity But I think there's a modification here in that the companies that had the high post-retirement medical benefit programs are the ones that are contracting and the small to medium-size firms that do not have the generous post-retirement programs are where the expansion is So, I end up with a somewhat lower unemployment rate at the end of the period All of this makes me a bit puzzled to be positioned as I am in relation to the staff, but I'm going to be honest with you about it and not try to cover it up!   I don't know I must admit that I really felt that 4 percent [GDP growth] was quite likely but modesty and restraint in regard to a drag from net exports caused me to bring that back down I do think we need to recognize that the personal bankruptcy safety net means that this adjustment period for consumers is not as severe as it was in other long major cycle adjustments And it seems to me that that's consistent with the consumer spending that we have I, like Bob McTeer and others, worry a little about what we are targeting I don't have any appetite for targeting M2 But the lack of appetite for targeting M2 does not make me feel comfortable targeting interest rates as a means of running economic policy   Don, on page 8, assuming that the fed funds targeting is really designed to produce those M2 changes and nominal GDP changes, I noticed that with a fed funds rate of 3-1/4 percent, V2 is 31 And then when the fed funds rate is brought down, eased to 3 percent, V2 moves up to 33 When it is brought down to 2-3/4 percent, V2 in a nonlinear fashion moves up to 38 What happens to V2 if, for example, [the economy is weaker or stronger]? Jerry Corrigan was saying yesterday that he has this feeling that it might be stronger On the other hand, it might be weaker Suppose we ended up with a weaker [situation], so much so that the fed funds rate were taken down to 2-1/2 or 2 percent What in the world happens to V2 at, say, a 2 percent funds rate? Does it accelerate the way it does here in a nonlinear fashion?   Okay, what you're saying is that since you really have intermediate rates trickling off a fed funds rate, I presume that that would be a scenario in which the intermediate rates are moving downward anticipating the fed funds rate to produce that kind of V2   Now, to put another scenario out Suppose we were to have a rather aggressive easing of the fed funds rate ahead of anticipations of weakness that might cause intermediate rates to move  -34-    2/2-3/93  backwards, as they did after our December '89 fed funds rate cut, instead of moving with it?   Yes   Of course, I think we have to keep in mind that since May of '89 we have had that perverse effect almost 1/4 of the time we've been easing; other times we've been able to do it in a way in which we haven't had that perverse effect Would this be relevant to the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in some sense regarding those who argue that the Fed made a mistake because we did too little too late? One might look back at the lack of perversity--that the intermediate yield when we were too little too late resulted in better M2 growth than we would have gotten if we'd been more aggressive   In other words, I'm not misreading the bottom line here that if the economy [developed] further weakness and we delayed our easing but were forthcoming as the market expected, we might get better movement in intermediate rates and consequently more effect on M2   Thank you   Mr Chairman, you can count me on board as not having exaggerated my feelings in regard to [the role of] M2 I wholeheartedly agree with your statement I also agree that it's a political perception question that we're dealing with here and I'd like to ask you a question in that regard Since it's a political perception question, if we go to a 2 to 6 percent range--which means we've made a move--and if actual growth comes in below 2 percent, are we not putting ourselves into a very difficult political situation?   Yes   Well, for political perception reasons, I would prefer to go to 1 to 5 percent on M2, [lower] M3 to 0 to 4 percent, and leave the debt range alone My reason is that in my mind we are going to take political heat for the 1/2 point [reduction] And we're going to take 90 percent of the political heat if we go to 2 to 6 percent that we would take if we went to 1 to 5 percent   My view is that there's just too much uncertainty here Let's suppose we move this range [down by 1/2 percentage point] and the economy is performing just like the staff forecast and it is not adequate to get the kind of job growth that politically is desired I believe that with our staff forecast and the lack of job growth and a range of 2 to 6 percent, if M2 is at 18 percent, we'd be in a pack of trouble  -40-    2/2-3/93   Okay By and large in this case, this is your story in the Humphrey-Hawkins setting, even though I don't quite agree about the political risk That is, I would rather face his continued unhappiness right now when I think we're okay than I would to take it on the chin a year from now As far as the members of the Committee are concerned, if we were to go to 1 to 5 percent or even 2 to 6 percent and if conditions changed--for example, if the velocity picture changed and other leading indicators were suggesting that M2 ought to be growing [above] the top of the range--I would feel it very strange not to be able to accommodate such growth of M2 under some conditions   Well, I'm not going to vote against a [1/2 point] decrease in these rates, particularly in this situation where it seems to me that what we're doing is backing you up as the Chairman making a presentation Even though I like 1 to 5 percent a lot better, I think in a sense that it's your call I feel rather strongly about it, but at the same time I feel very supportive of your position   Mr Chairman, I agree with your prescription I am very tempted, of course, to believe that we may be falling behind in regard to maintaining price level targeting by targeting the fed funds rate at 3 percent I think all of us know the difficulty of targeting M2; we've all discussed that Certainly, there's difficulty in targeting the fed funds rate We know that's really no way to run monetary policy under changing conditions Also, targeting nominal GDP poses real political dangers for us because it's just so difficult to go before the Congress and explain why we like 5-1/2 percent nominal GDP better than 6-1/2 percent when there's clearly a relationship between GDP and the unemployment rate The unemployment rate at 6-1/2 percent GDP would be more desirable than the one at 5-1/2 percent So, with Humphrey-Hawkins suggestions that we [emphasize] price stability as a second to employment and our knowledge that employment benefits from improvement in the inflation outlook, I'm inclined to believe that we ought to be thinking about tightening at this stage But I just don't have the stomach for doing it, Mr Chairman; I lack the courage to be what I think would be seen as somewhat rash And it was that prediction of lack of courage on my part and your part that caused me some meetings ago to suggest that at some point in time we might find ourselves with the need for a very large-scale move If you would turn to Chart 6 in the Financial Indicators package that Don has provided as he always does--I was mistaken in thinking the charts were missing from the other document because they're always in this document--you will see on that bottom chart for all commodities ex-food and ex-oil a price move that is somewhat of a preliminary indication of what happened at the end of 1982 and what happened in 1987 I don't have the courage to vote to tighten at this point, Mr Chairman, because I'm hopeful that this will get reversed And the price of gold being--   Well, lumber was up 43 percent year-over-year the last time I looked   Yes, but of course the beauty of this experimental ex-food and ex-oil commodity index is that it's not a [unintelligible] phenomenon with lumber; it [measures] actual house construction that is moving up and increasing demand; and it provides an indicator not only of price levels but also of real economic activity Now, if you look at the top chart on all commodities, which is the best predictor of CPI inflation, oil's decline and the behavior of food prices do not worsen the inflation outlook  Well, Mr Chairman, I would prefer the alternative of asymmetric toward tightness, but I certainly never find myself in the position of dissenting over the question of symmetry However, I do want to call the Committee's attention to what I think is a possibility of our getting behind the curve by maintaining the fed funds rate at 3 percent for too long Thank you   You have unanimous consent!  -58-    2/2-3/93   How about "are likely to"?   That's better   I was very sympathetic to Al Broaddus' statement and would associate myself with believing that continuing to look at these tradeoffs is somewhat worthwhile In my letter to Chairman Gonzalez I came down on balance for not having the study, believing that it was better to end up supporting the position of the Committee on this topic But the problem that I had, Al, in terms of getting there without further study, was whether or not early release of the directive would tend to cause us to be less likely to go to an asymmetric directive And my conclusion was that early release would cause us to be less likely, but I don't know the [unintelligible] of the information available and that [unintelligible] So, I would be open to the study   I agree, Jerry   Alan, here again in this same area, when you talked about inflation, it seemed to be a very defensive statement It was that somehow [or other] our goal was not to have inflation get worse, which seems to me something of a departure from our commitment to lowering the rate of inflation until it no longer is a factor taken into account in business decisions And that leads to rising standards of living I'm afraid that--   I know, but what you just read in this statement--    2/18/93   Yes I mean--   The thing that concerns me is that--   Yes I know, but by and large we've been careful to keep in mind or we've always thought we had to keep the focus on a reduction of inflation in order to get bond prices to respond the way we wanted them to And now that we've got bond prices responding, do we have some reason there why--   Yes   That's right   Yes In all the material that you've read you didn't once mention price stability   But my sensitivity is to the bond market today That seems to me all caught up in this notion that somehow or another a deal is being done on fiscal policy and monetary policy   Okay, but the two times that you talk about a common goal, which is to raise the living standards, you do not mention that we raise the living standards on our end by proceeding toward price stability That's the vehicle that's consistent with that   Suppose you get a question that says "We know you want to proceed toward price stability but you also want fiscal improvement How would you balance these?" Suppose you had to choose between them, how would you choose?   No   I would be very concerned that you could get yourself in that spot Then the fiscal policy people have got you   Because that almost gets back to the Brady argument of why won't you give us the kind of growth that gives us the revenue to fix our fiscal policy?   Yes, my view is that when we move from a high- inflation environment to a low-inflation environment we are always going to have a fiscal policy problem A fiscal deficit problem follows; that's one of the transition prices we pay    2/18/93   Yes   Jerry I agree that it is there, and maybe I'm overly sensitive on this--   Sure   But when you get on that point, we have to recognize that they have low growth in there But low growth, then, is consistent with a 3 percent fed funds rate as far as the eye can see   Beginning when?   Right   Mike, if there were some depressing effects from the tax package, what do we think the timing would be?   But when will this $31 billion of extra spending [occur]? It is $31 billion above the baseline, isn't it?   So when does the fiscal impact of that $31 billion plus the baseline kick in?   I don't see how it could be   You mean on the procedural votes?   So you think it's not just a question of the votes where they have to have 60 votes to close?   You're talking about 50?   Mr Chairman, you're exactly right The authority is Robert's Rules of Order, newly revised Let me read [the description of] minutes "The record of the proceedings of a deliberative assembly is usually called the minutes or sometimes, particularly in legislative bodies, the journal In an ordinary society, unless the minutes are to be published, they should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting, not what was said by the members" So, Robert's Rules of Order clearly suggest that these are minutes and that we are doing them the way they suggest they should be done   I'd like to take a few minutes to review the economy's performance in the monetary environment that has prevailed six months before earlier troughs in economic activity As you know, we've eased the fed funds rate from 990 down to 300 basis points What struck me when I reviewed this was that we only had the fed funds rate down from 990 to 8 percent six months before the [latest] trough So a fed funds rate of 8 percent six months before the trough seemed to be conducive to blunt the downward momentum that the economy had at that time We know that we had some head winds that occurred around the trough and after the trough And yet monetary policy seemed to be succeeding in overcoming the head winds and getting economic activity up to a somewhat lackluster 1-1/2 percent annual rate of growth in the second half of '91 through the first half of '92 Then, I think it's important to note that we lowered the fed funds rate In some sense we were trying to buy insurance as you will recall We kept saying that we must be sure that we don't [falter] because this recovery is pretty tentative and the outlook is pretty precarious So, we continued to buy insurance But at the time when the recovery was beginning to take off in the second half of 1992 with a 41 percent growth rate, the fed funds rate was 4 percent Over the first three quarters of the recovery, the average rate of expansion was 12 percent; the real growth rate was then 22 percent in the  -27-    3/23/93  first two quarters of 1992 and up to 32 percent in all of 1992 And all this was occurring in an environment with a fed funds rate of no lower than 4 percent--that is, unless someone believes that monetary policy works faster than it seems to me that it works Now, we know why we bought the insurance And as we were buying the insurance of taking the fed funds rate lower we said that there seemed to be very low downside risks to taking the fed funds rate lower just to be sure But there was all this talk about when the time comes, of course, we will pull that rate back up The tough thing always is to know where we are on the monetary ease/monetary restraint path It seems to me that monetary policy ordinarily needs to be in a slight restraint mode and ought to avoid having to be in a severe restraint mode That is, we have made a mistake if we have to go to a severe restraint mode Now, let's look at the indicators of monetary ease It doesn't surprise you that I would use rising commodity prices Let me give you some of the numbers Our ex-food, ex-energy experimental index is up 20 percent year-over-year It's up at an 87 percent annual rate for the first quarter I put the numbers in my machine this morning to [include] yesterday's commodity prices so I'd have them almost into the first quarter and it was an 87 percent annual rate Now, if lumber prices in this quarter are up at a 1000 percent annual rate, let's take lumber prices out and see what we have left If you take lumber prices out then it's "only" a 33 percent annual inflation rate in the index and I would agree that lumber prices alone ought to be discounted as being a monetary phenomenon--   It's always so easy to take something out so one can say "I don't need to be worried about this" Our total index is up 26 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, given a very favorable energy price environment with energy weighted at something like 55 percent of the total Then there are food prices, and I look at food prices because when we see these favorable unit labor cost factors there for us I think we have to know that that's really quite a positive But we also have to know that when food commodity prices start moving upward as rapidly as they now are And food commodities in our experimental index are now up in the first quarter at a 50 percent annual rate Now, gold prices are no longer falling In fact, gold prices are only 17 percent lower than they were one year ago Gold prices have been on a downward trend for a long period of time as the world adapts to a different monetary policy environment But gold has had a particular kind of technological evolution that is taking the United States from among the also-rans in gold production to the number two producer in the world with the new technology That, of course, is unlike an equilibrium price for gold that would have occurred in an earlier period That is, when we saw the price of gold get to $280 an ounce in the last decade, that was not in this environment with this new low-cost technique of producing gold So, we're in an environment now in which US gold production [incurs] variable costs somewhere between $220 and $250 an ounce And naturally in this environment gold prices tend to move downward relative to other commodities But gold prices have stopped that downward move Now, I don't know that this 12 percent annual rate of increase in gold prices in the last six weeks is all that meaningful Frankly, if it had not been for gold prices moving down, [I would have discussed this sooner] That's kept me quiet on this subject for longer than I otherwise would have been  -28-    3/23/93  As for the second indicator of monetary ease It seems to me that we're at a somewhat tepid foreign exchange value of the dollar in the face of the relative strength of the US economy versus economies abroad With our economy so much stronger and the other economies so much weaker and interest rates abroad coming down and interest rates in the United States being fixed, I'm asking myself Why isn't the dollar stronger? That seems to me an indicator that we may have more dollars out there than we realize The third thing I would suggest-- Governor Lindsey already mentioned this prior to the meeting--is that short-term real interest rates are approximately at zero, and that seems to be an indicator of monetary ease The fourth thing we have is an unprecedented steepness of the yield curve, which indicates that short-term rates have been pegged below the Wicksellian natural rate of interest I may sound very eclectic today but I guess that's how I am I suppose another perspective on that would be that a 3 percent pegged fed funds rate when the economy was moving at 1-1/2 percent is different from a 3 percent pegged fed funds rate when the economy is expanding at a faster rate Even I remember the IS-LM analysis! We have to have disappointing PPI and CPI numbers It worries me a little to be trying to run monetary policy based upon the CPI and PPI because those are not forward-looking enough, and the dangers that Governor Mullins mentioned are certainly apparent Now, in this environment I think we have to recognize that the favorable employment cost numbers continue to be extraordinary Also, commodity prices and steel scrap prices are rising--and by the way, Mr Chairman, steel scrap prices are up 89 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, though annual rates, of course, tend to get exaggerated But I think all of us know that if labor costs are being restrained and if prices are moving forward, indeed isn't that a wonderful opportunity in regard to profit expectations So, that causes me to believe that the economy may be stronger; and I continue to stand with my forecast, which is 1 percentage point stronger than the Greenbook's Now, if the Greenbook [forecast] keeps creeping up, at some point in time it may get closer to mine But I haven't moved mine up any since my Humphrey-Hawkins [submission]  Now, let me also look very briefly at three historical periods of concern My first concern is Where are we? I feel that we are in a position that is very similar to where the William McChesney Martin Fed was in 1967 The inflation rate was still in the 1-1/2 to 2 percent range and yet I think they ignored what they needed to look at and instead set the stage for that decision that had to be made to scrap Bretton Woods, in a sense turning the Fed's money printing machine loose as it was in the 1960s But, clearly, when Arthur Burns became Chairman, we already had launched into an era in which some very severe choices had to be made I'm talking about over-restraint Those severe choices, of course, were not made and the US economy suffered gravely from that era at the last of the Martin period and the first of the Burns period  I'd also like to look at a more favorable example from history, the Volcker Fed in 1984 Now, I think that anyone knew [the Fed had] to do what was done in 1981 and 1982, but to do what was done in 1984 was really unprecedented because the Volcker Fed at that point of time--and some of you were here--in a sense began to tighten up before they looked at the CPI and PPI numbers They didn't wait until they had bad PPI and CPI numbers I think Paul Volcker was always a closet commodity price watcher! [Laughter] And clearly he took the  -29-    3/23/93  steps that needed to be taken in a preemptive way And what that did was to lock in the progress on inflation It meant that the double- digit inflation came down to 4 percent and they locked it in It also meant that we introduced a period of rolling recession adjustment sector by sector rather than having the whole economy synchronized, and that prolonged the economic expansion  The last period in history I want to look at is one in which I participated--early 1987 I knew in January and February that I should be voting "no" to accepting a status quo monetary policy I knew we had over-extended ourselves in regard to lowering the fed funds rate in 1986 and we did not correct it But somehow or other in the mood of the time I went along Now, I think we're at a very dangerous crossroads We are pegging the short-term fed funds rate, and pegging the fed funds rate is a very dangerous exercise We have to recognize that the fed funds rate may not stay in neutral very long, pegged as it is I agree at least with Jerry [Jordan] that we shouldn't peg the fed funds rate, whether or not we agree on the direction it ought to go Now, it seems to me that we ought to enter a period here in which we let ourselves in for a little trial and error, [moving] the fed funds rate in response to the outlook for economic activity At this stage I don't believe that it is necessary to accelerate [our move to] the natural rate for fed funds--that has to be higher than the 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent range I just say that now is the time to say that monetary policy is working and we need to [begin to adjust] it before the time comes to do something drastic because doing something drastic is always very disruptive to the US economy  So, I think we're in a dangerous period I don't know that inflation is going to rise to 4 percent; I think not I don't think we have 4 percent inflation on the horizon What I do think is that our progress to get inflation down low enough so that it [isn't a factor affecting] any business decision is now in jeopardy And I think we have to bring restraint on board which gives us a chance to realize a continued diminution of the rate of inflation because 3 percent is really a very, very bad inflation rate The newspapers say inflation is gone; they mean 3 percent Three percent is terrible, and we have to keep on our course If we don't keep on the course to get it to 2-1/2 and then to 2 percent, I'm quite certain we'll lose it on the other side   I agree with everyone on the issue of symmetry You've got that right I hope I'm wrong on the other score I hope that I'm worrying about something that doesn't need to be worried about I guess I'm also engaging in a confessional; I'm sort of apologetic for my past criticisms of the Martin and Burns Fed because [the job] really is tough It's very easy to sit there and look backward and say Why did they do that? The signs are very clear when looking backward; they are not so clear when one is looking forward I certainly recognize how tough this kind of call is But a few of the things you've said convince me even more of my position I hear the Committee being satisfied with 3 percent inflation I hear the Committee targeting 3 percent inflation I hear the Committee saying if the rate of inflation doesn't go up, we are all right Now, stop and think about this a minute What that means is that the Committee is confining the periods of diminishing inflation to periods of economic slowdown and recession, which is just the opposite of what our responsibility is, it seems to me Our responsibility is to apply the pressure that brings the rate of inflation toward zero continuously and gradually and consistently That's what our job is And I hear you saying that if the rate of inflation doesn't go up--and maybe it won't--we're okay I'm not more pessimistic on the rate of inflation going up than the rest of you I'm just very pessimistic about inflation staying at 3 percent, and [I'm concerned that] if it stays at 3 percent, somewhere in this expansion it'll go higher The minute it goes higher than 3 percent, then we're going to put the brakes on and we're back to a stop/go policy It really is very painful for me to be a part of this kind of operation So I thereby step aside from so many people I respect And I am willing to say that I am only the fool who sees it correctly! [Laughter]  Choosing a fed funds rate is quite different from changing the fed funds rate by increments If all of a sudden we dropped into the room and none of us had anything to do with where the fed funds rate is and we looked at the US economy, at the world economy and at interest rates around the world, what rate would we choose for the fed funds rate? I wish, Jerry, that I could rely upon M2 I always wanted to rely upon the Ms And I only left the Ms when the Ms left me! [Laughter] So, what we're doing here is that we're caught in an incremental creep You see, in the Martin Fed it was those eighth of a point changes in the fed funds rate that they belabored over; in looking backward with hindsight we see that they were clearly out of the ball park in terms of what they should have been talking about But we have the benefit of looking at that history and knowing that history  As for the bond markets, what I hear you saying is just setting the bond markets up for a real spill If we act now, some of the people in the bond markets will say "What in the world are the people at the Fed doing?" But they'll think about it, and I don't  -44-    3/23/93  think that the bond markets will react by saying "Well, my goodness look what's coming" Incremental creep, of course, gets the bond market participants to believe that the fed funds rate is not a random walk Consequently, if we get behind and they make the first move, the bond market will say "Here they come" and then anticipate all the moves that are there because they will also see those price numbers that are going to cause us to act I believe the fed funds rate ought to be set at such a rate that we would have just as strong a chance that the next move would be down as that the next move would be up Otherwise, we're going to do the bond market in But if we ask what should the fed funds rate be and say we should set it high enough that we would think the next move may be down because we really are in a fiscal mode change here--that I'm certainly very well aware of--it's possible that the fiscal drag in 1994 would be such that lower interest rates may very well be called for But if we start off into this environment with the fed funds rate at 3 percent when we may need to be easing, I think we'll be lost  Finally, I guess I have only pretended to be thinking the way many of you think because I really don't I really do believe in price level targeting I really do believe that our job is somehow or other to mimic that wonderful golden era, the gold standard, in which money is restrained in such a way that people have confidence in money and its purchasing power, and thereby I'd like to see credit growth right out of the roof in an environment in which people know that they can depend upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the purchasing power of the dollar So, Mr Chairman, as no surprise to you, I choose alternative C And I really don't care what you people do with your alternative language   Jerry, your comments are very much along the lines of my thinking I learned to fly an airplane very early in my life; I had a father who was my flight instructor who taught himself back in 1931 He spent his life teaching me that the best way to be a general aviation pilot is to find out what mistakes people make And even though I don't fly very much, I do read very regularly about airplane accidents to find out what mistakes pilots make And it's interesting to me that the major mistake that amateur pilots make is that they get in bad weather and they don't feel the gauges are right Somehow or other they think the gauges are wrong It feels as if the airplane is doing this and the gauges tell them the airplane is doing something else We're at the place, in the murky weather, where the old monetary aggregates don't give us much help In this environment, we have to look at the gauges; we have to look at the instruments And the instruments tell us that inflation is rising Clearly, inflation is not going to go down to the 2-1/2 to 2 percent level that I thought was doable as recently as one year ago I think the Chairman is correct when he says that it's not a question of money or credit that explains this phenomenon Clearly, as others have said, it is an attitude question Now, in December I made some comments about a 200 basis point increase in the fed funds rate and, Mr Chairman, you [went further] when you said that 300 or 400 basis points really wouldn't work to change the attitudes Well, I guess I don't quite agree with that   The result   Here's what I think would happen I don't think we should increase interest rates by 300 basis points but, if we did, I'm quite certain the price of gold would immediately begin a [sharp], quick [drop] It would happen so fast you'd just have to go and watch it on the screen If we made a 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, the price of gold surely would turn back down unless the situation is worse than I anticipate If we made a 50 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, I don't know what would happen to the price of gold but I'd sure like to find out! [Laughter] Now, I want to remind you that monetary policy cannot do anything about growth except harm it Monetary policy can't fix growth; monetary policy can only harm growth; monetary policy can only cause growth to be worse I agree that there are some attitude problems out there and some significantly held belief by the American people and foreigners that the US government budget deficit is out of control And they believe that because it's out of control the Federal Reserve will not be able to stand firm They believe that we'll have to give in and that we will have to inflate our way out of this problem Now, I don't believe that But the American people do believe that, including, I think, your daughter, Jerry Maybe she doesn't even understand that; she just knows that inflation is going up  We cannot make growth better in the period immediately ahead We just can't do that Now, when I look at the first-quarter numbers in the Greenbook, nominal GDP was 52 percent Mike tells us that if the trade numbers come in [as projected], if real GDP goes up, then nominal GDP may go up also Now, we only had two quarters of the eight in the current expansion when that 52 percent was exceeded; one was 62 percent and one was 71 percent Of the eight quarters, the 52 percent is [the third highest] and everybody is sitting around wringing their hands about what kind of growth we're [experiencing] Pardon me, but every time I look at GDP quarterly data I see variations quarter to quarter I don't know what is going to happen right now, but monetary policy can't fix it Monetary policy can harm it Monetary policy is about credibility; inflation is about credibility Now, if the American people believe that we are not going to act, then this phenomenon of inflation attitudes we have will get worse; if attitudes get worse, that means the tradeoff gets worse We can fix the attitudes about the Federal Reserve very quickly And if we fix those attitudes, we will gain stature for our institution and our political system Our democracy respects proper decisionmaking If we do what we need to do, [inflation] attitudes will improve  At the last meeting I was very concerned about what commodity prices were doing And as you know, they got lucky again and told us that the rate of inflation was higher than we thought it was Now, I know there's nothing to it but they did get lucky I've had plenty of econometric studies tell me how lucky commodity prices can get I told you at the time that the reason I had not been upset before the March FOMC meeting was that the price of gold was well behaved But I said that the price of gold was moving The price of gold at that time had moved up from 328 to 344, and I don't know what I was so excited about! I guess it was that I thought the price of gold was going on up Now, if the price of gold goes up, long bond rates will not be involved People can talk about gold's price being due to what the Chinese are buying; that's the silliest nonsense that ever was The price of gold is largely determined by what people who do not have    5/18/93  trust in fiat money system want to use for an escape out of any currency, and they want to gain security through owning gold Now, if annual gold production and consumption amount to 2 percent of the world's stock, a change of 10 percent in the amount produced or consumed is not going to change the price very much But attitudes about inflation will change it  The longer we go with this situation, the more we'll have to increase rates and the higher long-term rates will go The sooner we move, then the sooner we [will remove] the uncertainty in intermediate and long rates that comes with an increase in short rates I hope Bill McDonough is correct that a rise in short-term rates will mean that the 10-year rate will fall Whether that's the case or not to me is a little uncertain, as I think it was to you That is, I don't know whether people will say "Oh my goodness, the Fed is worried about inflation" If the market's reaction to the first move is that the Fed is worried about inflation, then in that environment I would expect long bond prices to improve But every 25 basis points we give away on long bond yields--and we've already given 25 away by not acting when we should have acted--is lost When we act, when we let the American people and the capital markets around the world know that we care about price level stability--that's our mission--then we will be well ahead and we will return to falling intermediate- and long- term interest rates, which will help get growth higher A monetary policy step at this time is a win/win I don't know what is going to happen for sure I hope Mike is correct that the rate of inflation will move back down to 26 percent for the remaining 8 months of this calendar year If we make a move and Mike is correct, we could take credit for having accomplished this and the price of gold will soon be down to the 328 level and we can lower the fed funds rate at that point in time and declare victory But if what some of us suspect is true--that the Greenbook is a little optimistic on inflation--then it seems to me essential that we take a [firming] step I don't feel very strongly about it! [Laughter]   I'd like to ask you a question also When you mentioned where we are, if the dollar were to weaken somewhat on foreign exchange markets do you think it would be appropriate in that circumstance to surprise everyone and not sterilize the intervention?   I know, but it seems to me that the timing would be--   You think a $200 million change in reserves would cause the fed funds rate to move definitely?   Yes   But what I meant was that if we change a path by $200 million, that's quite a few basis points, right?   What other meaning can you give to non- sterilized intervention than a change in the target?   You could demonstrate the $25 million of foreign exchange intervention--   We haven't raised it since February of '89  -42-    5/18/93   It seems to me important that the Chairman's powers not be diminished to require a vote I just don't think we want to do that at all   I think the Committee should remember that the reason for having [an asymmetric] directive is that sometimes the deliberation/decisionmaking process is facilitated by having the Chairman be free to make the moves that need to be made based upon what the Committee has said I guess I thought that's what you were after   Maybe I'm haunted too much by late 1986 and early 1987 At that time a lot of regions of our economy really were pretty sick You could put a football over the map of the United States and put one end on Phoenix, Arizona and the other end on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and lay that football out and the economy would really [unintelligible] Talk about pessimism and talk about depression and talk about the fall in land values from $1700 an acre to $900 an acre and in Iowa from $3100 down to $1400! That pessimism was strong It was hard to see then, but we knew what was there if we looked at commodity prices and gold And yet when we got ready to act, we were so incapable of acting because events got in our way This speech is about events that may get in our road One event was the Louvre Agreement When the Louvre Agreement [existed], it didn't seem appropriate for us to make a move because in some sense that was a part of what some of us thought was a deal And then we got into May of '87 and the dollar got strong; and I remember Paul Volcker saying "Well, is this the day we want to increase rates?" And I felt that the dollar was strong on that day, [so] maybe we didn't want to do it then We didn't do it; events got in the road and all of a sudden we found ourselves with the wrong fed funds rate in the fall when you came on Board, Mr Chairman So, of course, I want to act today I want to raise the rate today I'd be satisfied with 25 basis points That's crazy when I want 50, but I'm a compromising person [Laughter] I would recommend to you--in a sense I've taken myself out of the decision--that you stay with the Chairman's recommendation on an asymmetric directive I think it's very important that you do that   But that would be more restriction on you than you normally have when we have [an asymmetric directive]   To the investment   And lo and behold the credit demands are not robust!  -14-    7/6-7/93   Well, I don't think I've heard such pessimism in a long, long time I'm not sure what has changed I don't know what it is that's getting worse I don't know what business profits are declining I do not know that nominal GDP is really going to come in for the entire year as the staff suggests at 48 percent when in that lousy first quarter nominal GDP was 44 percent But maybe I'm seeing things somewhat differently  I would like to focus just a minute on the lag in monetary policy Even though we don't have an M2 that works the way we want and we don't think M2+ would suffice either, there is a concept of a kind of pure M out there That is, there are transaction balances that we've created over the last 10 to 12 years Investment money has been mixed up with our [measure of] deposit money, so we don't know what that pure M has been doing If we did know what it was doing, we would have some sense of being forward-looking Since we don't know what it's doing, it's almost as if we're faced with looking at last month's CPI or last quarter's CPI And, frankly, it's very, very scary to me to think about our trying to run monetary policy based upon last quarter's GDP or last quarter's rate of change in the CPI Certainly no one, I presume, expects that there's much we can do about the CPI rate of change in 1993 Can monetary policy now alter what happens in 1993? It seems to me we're working on monetary policy with regard to the rate of inflation for 1994 and, indeed, even into 1995 I don't have the ability to see 1995 clearly enough to do monetary policy based upon that fact And since there's no M2 or other monetary aggregate out there to guide us, I think we have to look at some other matters  Now, a bit contrary to Ed Boehne's view that we're at the place in the cycle where we're not going to get much more inflation improvement, it seems to me that we have several factors working in our favor in terms of [moving to] a lower inflation rate We have not had any minimum wage increase in 1993; that's not in the numbers We haven't had any major supply shocks throughout the world, no oil shocks, no [unintelligible] We haven't had in the United States any significant impact of employment cost conditions that would in a sense be a driving force for inflation We've existed in a world in 1993 in which use of resources is way down This ought to be a very desirable time to be getting inflation rates down We're in a period where we have some real productivity gains, as has been noted; and those productivity gains ought to be helping us to get more than cyclical improvement in inflation numbers Now, inflation in my view is not a micro-economic deal; it is a monetary policy deal The rest of the world, the other six countries in the G-7, are running a rate of inflation a full percentage point below what they were running even though only Japan has more flexibility in wages and prices than we do We're the most favored country in the world to get the inflation rate down and yet the outlook is that it's not there  It seems to me that the conclusion one can draw from this is that monetary policy in 1992 was really not as stringent as we thought  -39-    7/6-7/93  it was A year ago I was in the camp that thought 2-1/2 percent [inflation] was possible and by February I'd given up and had gone back above the 3 percent level But my inflation forecast isn't an outlier at all It's just exactly the same as the staff forecast of 33 percent But I consider this 33 percent in a period of such favorable opportunity to mean that monetary policy has really missed its restraining force, and I don't know what's going to happen to cause that to change It seems to me that monetary policy is indeed getting easier and easier as inflation expectations rise  I don't get letters too often, but here's a letter "My wife and I have been married 51 years We worked very hard for every penny we earned and have been extremely frugal, saved for old age I can't tell you how much I hate inflation for what it does to those savings Our circumstances dictate that they be invested conservatively and all of the interest we've been getting from our investments is lower than the rate of inflation It is taxed as income, which is not taxation but confiscation of capital" Now, they go ahead and give me a little bit of praise regarding my position on inflation, but they finish it off and say "Although I'm not optimistic that you will be successful, I can't thank you enough for your efforts" Well, I guess that's about it! [Laughter]  You know, there's a lot of loose talk around Everybody has an opinion about gold prices There's a lot of gold going into India and it flows into India because clearly people there want to hold gold rather than rupees, a paper currency that goes down in value And clearly gold is going into Indonesia and into China as people there choose to hold a more reliable safeguard against these crazy paper currencies that have terrible inflation rates But the price of gold isn't being affected by a little increase in the number of Chinese who are buying gold The price of gold is pretty well determined by us For many things, like land prices, long-term interest rates can have a significant impact But the major impact upon the price of gold is the opportunity cost of holding the US dollar No other currency has a reserve base that causes someone to be able to say "Well, I don't like holding my own currency" If you don't like holding your own currency, you always have the option of holding dollars instead But we set the stage We have a low interest rate that causes this saver out here to say he and his wife have been had And I understand how they've been had We're in a period in which we're going to increase some income taxes; but I'm not one who believes that people who are making more than $250,000 a year are going to cut back their consumption because their income tax rates go up I think their saving rate is going to come down We're in a period of being impacted by inflation expectations, and it shows up in the price of gold We've had a 20 percent increase in the price of gold since last February's Humphrey-Hawkins meeting Now, [yearly] world production of gold only runs 23 percent of world stocks I thought it rather dramatic--I had not thought about that with the price of gold at $390 an ounce--that the value of the world's stock of gold is a measly $14 trillion Now, a lot of that is held by central banks But we were at one time in a restraining mode, making it unprofitable for central banks to hold gold But I think this year those who have held gold have said they've got the best deal going as the [value of the] world's gold stock has appreciated $234 billion since our February meeting We can hold the price of gold very easily; all we have to do is to cause the opportunity cost in terms of interest rates and US  -40-    7/6-7/93  Treasury bills to make it unprofitable to own gold I don't know how much change in the fed funds rate and the Treasury bill rate it takes to do that, but I'd sure like to find out  I'd like to have some education here I certainly understand the feeling [of those] on the Committee who would say Is this a time to increase rates? I would tell you that I don't think this is a very good time to increase interest rates But, unfortunately, our interest rates are way too low, and there won't be a good time to increase interest rates If we drive every household that saves conservatively to buy stocks they don't feel they are knowledgeable enough to buy or to buy junk bonds or whatever else--they ought not to be trying to do radical things but if we drive them, and it's up to us--then it seems to me that if we then ever have to catch up on interest rates, those investments in common stocks and junk bonds could really fall off the table Talk about a mess you don't want to be in! I don't want to be in that mess If we had been very, very lucky and the rate of inflation had gone down to 2 percent, we might have gotten by with a 3 percent fed funds rate But we didn't get that lucky and, consequently, we now have a fed funds rate that is just clearly out of sight in regard to world reasonableness And it seems to me that there ought to be some real thought on our part as to whether our job is to decide which way to change rates or where rates should be to provide stability for people like this man who have their savings all there together I better stop   Don, suppose we ended up adopting alternative II or alternative III for 1993 and 1994 and there was a surprisingly strong resumption of disinflation and the CPI numbers moved down more like they are projected in the tighter scenario II on page 8 of the Bluebook In that circumstance if the Committee decided to [move] against too rapid a pace of disinflation and lowered the fed funds rate, is it likely that we would have a problem of getting monetary growth above those ranges in alternative II or alternative III?   Yes, I would think long-term rates would come down even more   So what interest rate or what possible shape of the yield curve might likely result in getting outside the range on the top side on alternative III?   Thank you   Are you arguing for alternative III rather than II?   Do you have any concern if we go to II and then still undershoot?   Okay   Sure   But, Tom, it may very well be that when velocity goes back to zero, it will go back to zero at a different level That is, when the rate of change of velocity goes to zero does it go back to zero at that higher level or does the level go back? It seems to me that one might make a very good case here that it will go to zero at that higher level, and I think that's what Don is suggesting I guess I don't understand why those who want to pursue a gradual reduction of inflation that gets these numbers down--1 to 5 percent certainly encompasses that picture--[object to a lower range] There is not a money projection out here that gets above 5 percent with that kind of projection   Now, if this Committee doesn't want to proceed toward getting inflation down to zero, I think we ought to shut our mouths and quit talking about price stability I just don't understand how we can talk about price stability as being desirable and then not want to take the money range down [to where] with, velocity returning to zero, it is consistent with price stability And it seems to me that 1 to 5 percent does that Doesn't 1 to 5 percent permit us a midpoint of 3--or even of 2 percent and then a velocity of 3--and a nominal GDP of 5 percent? It seems to me that the velocity we're predicting is almost like targeting nominal GDP at 5 percent   I would prefer to go with your original proposal, which was to change the 1994 range to alternative II I could live with alternative III, but alternative II is certainly a compromise I'm willing to make If we're changing the tentative 1994 range in July of this year to 1 to 5 percent, it seems to me quite reasonable to change this year's range to 1 to 5 percent because we know there's just zero chance that it is going to be exceeded on the top side for the rest of this year It seems to me there will be less of an impact to do '93 just like we're going to do '94   That's a good point   Mr Chairman, why don't we vote on 1994 and then after you announce that vote on 1993   Mr Chairman, as I understand it, we're voting on 1994 now, aren't we--just the bottom of page 24 as Norm read it?   The 1 to 5 percent  BERNARD Do you want me to read [the language] or just call the roll?   Well, I'm clearly not in tune with the other members of the FOMC I don't see any need to wait for any information The markets provide indications every day as to whether or not we've provided more liquidity than is called for And when we lowered the fed funds rate from 4 percent to 3 percent, my guess is that made very, very little difference in the rate of real GDP growth The destabilizing factors that have led people to hold, shift, or use their balances as much as they have was, I think, a drag against the stimulus that was already in place A 4 percent fed funds rate already was providing a lot of stimulus We already had pegged the fed funds rate well below the natural rate of interest We now have evidence, and we see it in our own staff's forecast, that the expected rate of inflation has moved up 06 or 07 percent just [since the May FOMC] meeting Now, in that environment, policy is not stable We do not have the same policy that we had at the last meeting because the real rate of interest by our best estimate has fallen to even more sharply negative territory We clearly see in the price of gold that people are making bets out there And we continue to lock in to a fed funds rate that will only aggravate that kind of speculation and it only detracts from the role of the US currency as the stable currency for the world The cost to the world of the United States pursuing inflationary policies in the late 1960s and the 1970s is unbelievable We're still paying the cost because many other central banks with no confidence in us think they have to be Rambo-like in beating their chests because in some sense they've got a track for the inflation-induced environment that the Federal Reserve as the world's reserve currency provides This is the time for us to move real interest rates back at least to zero I would be satisfied to do a measly 1/4 percentage point, which would not get us back to zero, but there would be intervention value in that There wouldn't be any harm in it Is there anyone who really believes the US economy, regardless of what is done on the fiscal [side], is going to suffer because the funds rate goes up from 3 to 3-1/4 percent? Now, I read Henry Kauffman, as many of you must have, and it's just absurd Well, I must be the one that's absurd! Thank you   Well, I guess I had only one question on the next to the last one Would you read that again about the outlook?   I strongly believe that in a democracy public officials have a responsibility And one responsibility we don't have is to engage in chicanery with the press and to give any background or off-the-record information If everyone who talked to [a reporter] said "I only talked to you because you're using my name," then that embarrassment will discipline each person I do not believe that anyone from this organization should ever talk to any reporter on background or off the record That's what constitutes the problem In a democracy public officials do have a responsibility to communicate There is an educational program The Federal Reserve if it is to be successful in regard to accomplishing our primary objectives must be able to say clearly what our objectives are And [education] becomes a very, very important part of that And for us to react by saying no speeches, I'd say no I agree with the no speeches 7 days before and 7 days after [an FOMC meeting]   That's the important period But if anyone talks to any reporter, I think we should keep a log of who we talk to and make that log available to each other That is, any time we talk we ought to make a log We'd say I talked to so-and-so on this day and put it down And we ought to share it with each other Now, I don't understand this CNBC thing It seems to me you're dismissing that a little too lightly, if someone from this organization absolutely told someone what they had no business telling them in regard to that vote No one had the right to correct the mistaken vote that CNBC reported No one had the right to do that No one has the right ever to say what they think my view is; I am the only one who has the right to say what my view is I don't have the right to say what David Mullins' view is or what anybody else's view is I don't have the right to say what the Board might do; I don't have the right to say what the FOMC might do I want a different distinction than is being made I think the obligation in a democracy is very, very strong And I [don't] think the best thing for us to do is not to talk and never to give our views   But unfortunately there are some instances in which that is the case   Bob, I'm not as concerned about the people who violate it with their names as I am about those who violate it without their names   Well, telling someone else is every bit as bad, if not worse than telling the press   Telling somebody else is even more suspicious   You're [able to] read [people's views on policy] better than I I hear people saying that inflation is a problem and I don't know how they're going to vote after I've seen them make a statement about inflation being a problem There have been four or five people who have made statements about inflation being a problem and, frankly, I don't know how they're going to vote based upon what they say I don't understand how you think the reporters know how they're going to vote   As much as one used to   I think that's correct   How would you suggest doing it?   Wait a minute What are you talking about?   Members of the Board of Governors are not appointed by the Chairman Did you have the impression that we were?   Now, there's no question that we have a pact that we should enter into, one with another As the Chairman says, there is information that doesn't belong to each of us [as individuals] But I certainly can't understand your comment, Si It just blows my mind that one of seven--   Sure   Well, [unintelligible] the statute is somewhat different I don't think we want to have a huge difference in practice, but the statute is quite different in that the dismissal of a member of the Board of Governors falls under an impeachment clause It's very specified But the presidents serve at the pleasure of the Board of Governors In practice, we certainly wouldn't want it to be that way; we'd look pretty silly if we ever--   It seems to me that we need to discipline ourselves with a little more reporting That is, if anyone does have a speech scheduled, we ought to notify the Chairman's office or some office We ought to go through a process of saying I have scheduled [a speech] The Committee ought to be notified when we're going to speak in the blackout period   Si, the late start on planting Is that pretty universal throughout your District all the way from Iowa to Michigan?   And Indiana had ample moisture?   And Illinois, I presume, is like [the others]?   In the global economy, prices and interest rates do adjust depending upon conditions that exist throughout the entire world market The one price that doesn't really move based upon global economic conditions is the fed funds rate because we at the Federal Reserve decide exactly what it will be And the question can be whether or not the rate that's chosen is in equilibrium with other rates throughout the global market system Six months ago it did appear quite likely that the rate of inflation for [1993] would be just exactly where it appears it is today I think those of us that made [forecasts] around that median for the group of about 32 percent inflation [thought] that didn't look too bad then [and it] doesn't look too bad now I never believed at the worst of the conditions in March that the rate of inflation for [1993] was going to accelerate It just seemed to me that we were in a circumstance in which global forces were somewhat favorable in regard to a decelerating inflation rate in the United States and that the United States in [1993] should have been poised for a continued disinflation I thought that we  -27-    8/17/93  should have ended up in [1993], conditions being ideal, with an inflation rate around 2-1/2 percent December-over-December That has not happened and we now find ourselves in a position where, unlike March and May and maybe even July, it just would not make any sense for us to make an immediate change in the fed funds rate given the market conditions as they are today  Certainly, I would agree with Al Broaddus and Bill McDonough and others who expressed the view that our posturing, particularly summarized by the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, has indeed worked very well for those of us who have a pragmatic inclination That is, look at the bond market and see what has happened It has really been an ideal arrangement, one which I think all of us have been concerned about as we brought rates down during the recession and slow recovery period The reason we wanted to be slow in bringing rates down is because we understood that bringing rates down as fast as the market wanted would give us adverse effects on long-term and intermediate interest rates, and recovery would be slower rather than faster So, I think it is always good news when things work out better than one might have expected I think that posturing was beneficial and I share Bill McDonough's view that if it's not broke, maybe we ought not try to fix it  But I do believe that there are some out-of-equilibrium risks that exist for us and that we ought to be conscious of them as we go forward First of all, most of our studies of commodity prices show very clearly that the true pass-through effects in regard to the CPI and the PPI were clearly driven by oil; that is, using US consumption weights to determine the right weighting on commodity prices gives us something like a 55 percent weight on oil prices on our commodity experimental index Not all is due to monetary policy; we're in a favorable period in regard to oil prices and that provides a wonderful window for possible further disinflation That window may not be open forever; just as oil prices sometimes get down toward the $16 or $15 range, we've noticed they tend to shift back up So the prospects of somewhat higher oil prices could be somewhat upsetting in regard to future inflation, but I don't think that exists for the remainder of [1993] Another probably more immediate worrisome out- of-equilibrium condition would be seen particularly in the dramatic change in the exchange value of the yen versus the dollar over the last year Think about a 20 percent appreciation of the yen It's sort of like when [a team] gets down to the final four It doesn't make much difference how well it performed against the also-rans; it doesn't make much difference how it performed in December when it was playing those state colleges that almost paid money to come and play at your university We are in competition, of course, with the Japanese yen as a reserve currency We certainly lead the way in that regard But if we take the G-3 countries plus Switzerland and look at their PPIs year-over-year, all of these countries but the United States have negative PPIs year-over-year That is, Germany's PPI is lower than it was 12 months ago; Japan's PPI is lower than it was 12 months ago; Switzerland's PPI is about exactly where it was 12 months ago; and our PPI--I didn't look recently but I assume--is around 13 percentage points higher than a year ago So there are some questions And it seems to me that if there's any kind of edge of a cliff, it's the edge of a cliff in regard to the prospect for the soundness of the dollar versus the yen whereby the world not only doesn't know what the price of yen in terms of dollars might be next  -28-    8/17/93  month but many might say, if asked what it would be 5 or 10 years in the future, that there is a general expectation that the rate might favor being in yen assets versus being in dollar assets Clearly our short-term interest rates do not provide reasonable compensation for that expectation and that kind of change  Productivity has been a real puzzle for me Clearly, if your forecast gets really thrown awry you say it's a puzzle; and part of my real economic forecast for [1993] has certainly missed the mark I really just don't understand productivity I don't understand how we can have a decline in productivity for the business sector of 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 percent two quarters in a row when productivity in manufacturing has been rising at 4-1/2 to 5 percent! Somebody really is doing very, very poorly; and if anyone knows who it is--who is really snuffing on the job--they haven't been spotted yet So, that is indeed a real puzzle  Over time, the battle against inflation is sometimes a battle of technology; whether technology will keep up is a question in the very, very expanding world I [don't] want to sound too Malthusian because Malthus I think forgot or did not really understand how equilibrium price adjustments can take place to forestall what he would call such dismal outcomes But when we noticed that the world's oceans finally produced less fish last year than they did the previous year, we knew something was going on We have a lot of technology in regard to harvesting fish and that technology has been used by a lot of people And it has interested me to note that fish prices of some of the good fish catches--I mean cod, salmon, and so forth--are relatively high at the grocery store And yet I thought it was interesting to note that the value of all the fish harvested in the world was less than the cost of production, which is a rather interesting phenomenon This doesn't tell us that we're going to run out of fish because we do know that aquaculture and other techniques will enable us to provide the demand that's there But we will not do it at the same price that is occurring when we're doing some harvesting I noticed that with all the attention paid to the floods in the Mississippi Valley and the entire region, there has been a lot of talk about corn production and soybean production, which I think is probably a pretty minor event, but very little talk about all that soil that went down the river  Now, over the years as China enters [the global economy] and continues double-digit economic growth with a billion people and as the world makes more and more demands upon resources, we will have an adverse inflationary environment to look at in the long haul And we have pegged the fed funds rate at a level that can't be changed right now, but it does need to be changed Since we missed the March and May opportunities to get that rate up, I think we do want to be fully conscious of the opportunity whenever forces are such that we can get the rate closer to what I think the Chairman indicated would be more of an equilibrium rate; we ought to be ready to do that   Don, I guess I always thought an asymmetric directive could [mean] two things One is an indication that the Committee in the intermeeting period wants the Chairman to be alert to a possible move in one direction only But I presume there's also another aspect of it and that is that with an asymmetric directive the Chairman wouldn't feel very comfortable, unless there was a very unusual circumstance, moving rates the other way without a conference call; that would not seem to be appropriate I didn't hear anyone today talk about the need to lower rates during this intermeeting period What I'm wondering is, if we went to a symmetric directive, whether there is any likelihood that rates would really be lower without a telephone conference call   Yes   Right   Okay   That's a good idea! [Laughter]   I'm concerned that the Committee is becoming a little over-attentive to symmetry versus asymmetry Certainly, in May, as you know, the fact that we went to an asymmetric directive didn't convince me that [it was an appropriate alternative to] increased rates And if we continue to battle over symmetry and asymmetry, then we're back in the day and age in which the Committee groaned and moaned over an eighth of a point change in the fed funds rate, a change that really didn't amount to much So, the issue of symmetry and asymmetry is not very great, given the Chairman's statement that he does expect us to be in an asymmetric mode in the long run That is certainly more appropriate than acting as if we're going to tighten immediately I recognize that the price of gold has come down from $400 to $371 and that really is a factor that parallels the move that took place in the bond market; and that has worked very, very well And even if the fed funds rate is wrong, it would not be appropriate at this time to increase the fed funds rate I'm very  -41-    8/17/93  disappointed that we went past that window of opportunity and did not get it done, and I am very concerned that, with the Japanese yen/dollar exchange rate being where it is, we put ourselves in a position in which the rate of inflation actually is going to be higher than it would be if we had the fed funds rate at the level called for by alternative C That is, if magically we could go to "C" right now --we can't get there but if we could get a 3-1/2 percent instead of a 3 percent fed funds rate--the exchange value of the dollar versus the yen would not be so precarious and we would not have the window that is going to be there for price action by the automobile companies [They will raise] wholesale prices but that will show through [to consumer prices and], we're going to have a higher inflation rate at a 3 percent funds rate than we would have if we had 3-1/2 percent I also am concerned that a 3 percent rate provides lots of liquidity in the financial markets and it provides an opportunity for certain bubble events because money is scurrying here and there At a 3 percent rate, we're chasing people out of M2 accounts to elsewhere And all of that chasing may not be in the interest of long-run stability So, I'm very uneasy with the fed funds rate where it is I recognize, Mr Chairman, that this is not the time to increase it But more important than going back to asymmetric toward tightness would be for us to look for windows to get the fed funds rate up whenever we can   Ted, did you have a NAFTA [assumption]?   I have two questions for Mike Mike, when I look at those interest rate forecasts that you have in place and then look at the ECI numbers on page I-14 of the Greenbook, I'm wondering what happens to the pension contributions For any period in which interest rates behave as you have them forecast, assuming that before the end of 1994 there might be some upward pressure on short-term rates, would that make much difference in regard to the impact on the ECI if pension plan fundings come under pressure--that is, given some of the assumptions on rates of return that are built in?    9/23/93   At the same time, for persons who are retired or approaching retirement and are counting on short-term funded investments, is there likely to be current and continued downward pressure on consumer spending from this segment due to the fact that there is a perceived reduction in investment income?   The last question has to do with your statement in regard to substantial fiscal restraint Substantial wasn't exactly the word you used but you had some--   --adjective regarding fiscal restraint Yet when one looks at the Congressional Budget Office forecast and I think even our own, the budget deficit doesn't change very much over this forecast period I recognize that a deficit staying around $250 billion would [constitute] a declining percentage of GDP, but I'd like to have you explain why you call it "substantial" fiscal restraint   Looking back over the last 18 months, the data seem almost unbelievable In fact, no one talks about it because it's really hard to believe The fact that we got to a 39 percent increase in real GDP--which no one talks about and I would admit wasn't 4 percent--and then had that cut literally in half! In some ways it doesn't seem that way That is, during 1992 no one really felt that good about things and in some ways during 1993 no one feels that bad about things [But] that's really quite a significant step down to be operating at that level and then to fall back What makes it more disconcerting is the fact that in 1992 December over December the CPI was up 31 percent and we've still got the CPI running at 31 percent Now, we're forecasting 1994, Q4 over Q4, of 2-1/2 percent, and I don't think anyone knows how to change that number No one seems to have any real good suggestions or real good alternate numbers that they've been advocating To make it even worse, the revisions seem to show productivity trends higher than we thought they were We've got productivity trends very, very high; we've got the ECI very well behaved and yet we're not getting the kind of combination of output and price level response that certainly seems desirable I wish I could say just why it is that the economy has faltered so badly, and yet I can only guess I think corporate rationalization certainly has been a factor Certainly, the FASB rules in regard to post-retirement health care benefits undoubtedly gave some impetus to  -27-    9/23/93  downsizing employment Certainly, the pension plan underfunding that seems to be there probably already is impacting large corporate employment plans And I think all of us are very well aware of how disconcerting that is Apparently, many people who have jobs in this environment are much more aware of the fact that jobs are not necessarily permanent So you'd think maybe we'd be getting a higher savings response or somewhat more conscious spending response and yet the numbers don't show that at all We don't see any budge upward in the saving rate So, all in all, from the domestic scene it seems a very strange combination  When we look abroad, certainly [we see] the impact of the economies in Europe and Japan; I guess the Federal Reserve staff and members of this Committee have all agreed that those economies are going to be weaker than they were generally thought to be by the governments and the central banks of those countries When we look at the stock market, I guess we would think that if all this downsizing and rationalization efficiencies are going on, the profit numbers ought to sustain the kind of equity prices that we see And yet ironically we don't seem to be having any inflow from abroad to US equity markets Indeed, in terms of diversification, mutual fund investors in the United States seem to be the only ones that are buying equities in Japan So, all of this gets to be pretty confusing and maybe I better stop before I get in worse trouble   I can go along with "B" symmetric I would simply note that if you're looking at real output, the recognition lag may be longer than we would wish it to be So I agree with you that we need to remain alert   Whereas minutes that have been presented and voted on thereby have the consent of all the parties   Let me ask a question about the members present I don't know, has Ed Boehne been a member of the FOMC the longest? Well, whoever it was, would that mean then that we wouldn't have to release [raw transcripts] as long as-- So it would really go back beyond his time?   That's my question   But not five or six?   Do we have a better chance of winning if we are not too ambitious?   So there might be an advantage for us to have a strategy of getting on board and doing it before someone compels us to do it   [What] if we were open to doing our own determinations of releasing what we know to be already edited notes? That is, as I understand it, in the transcripts if you took the Lord's name in vain it's not in there; and if you used some other swear word it is in there So they are edited, are they not?   Well, what I'm saying is that Henry Wallich is dead If we act too quickly, is this kind of a disregard for [him] in some sense? We would be releasing something that he might have said [but maybe] he didn't say it that way or it was interpreted incorrectly What responsibilities do we have to individuals as well as to the public?   Does it?   But on the one hand we might gain strategic advantage by saying ourselves that we're going to release everything up to five years ago   And we might think by doing that that the Justice Department might think we're reasonable But on the other hand, doing that may show a kind of disdain for individual rights, which is bothersome    10/15/93   And every newspaper that quoted it would run the full disclosure as the lead!   You should change that to "had"   I think I learned about it much earlier than that and pondered the question I thought immediately, when I knew of it, that there was a very significant risk that this would be a problem in the future But it also seemed to me that to change the procedures would also be a significant risk   Dick, of course, one of the problems is that you're talking about reams and reams of material And to go back through that and reduce it to a form and have everyone agree--or everyone who is still living agree--that the reduction fairly represents what [they said] is a pretty tough task   Virgil, your opinion?   You mean it seems large to us   I think--excuse me, Ed, go ahead   Our starting point has to be the existence of those transcripts from the tapes, and those transcripts cannot be destroyed We as an organization [have a] need to be open There's historical material that would be sought after and I would prefer us to change the boundaries of the time that we're thinking about To me three years doesn't work at all We really ought to be talking about 14 years because what we have here, it seems to me, [is a situation in  -13-    10/15/93  which it is] impossible for fairness in editing for the living and the dead on those that go back; and once you've edited them, then it really does take on more danger in some sense I think we're better off, and I would prefer, to release the raw transcripts as originally transcribed It's hearsay and it's historical and we would go back 14 years The reason I'd use 14 years [relates to] those of us who are officers of the United States and are subject to appointment We might have some person serving a term who, at the end of that term, might be subject to reappointment Now, do you want such raw unedited transcripts to be a part of the discussion in a confirmation hearing? It seems to me it's ludicrous to have that happen So, it seems to me that if we don't go back 10 to 14 years, it's going to have a quieting effect upon the behavior of [meeting] participants So I would prefer to start off with that grand reach for years to recognize they are there and I'd prefer to do nothing in regard to any decision until we find out the outcome of our determination If we found the outcome was that we had to release that information earlier and it's not to be used for historical purposes but could have some other use, then I'd want to stop the process immediately   Tom, I believe legislation to protect us is now out the window It seems to me that the Congress was willing to deal with us when they couldn't get anything But now that the Congress believes they may get a lot, they're not going to want to protect us   But we have to decide whether we are or are not going to release any of these [transcripts] for which there are going to be FOI [requests] And it seems to me that we are better off releasing some, according to their age, and not releasing others It seems to me we have to make up our minds on that  SPEAKER(?) It's irrelevant   I want everyone to know that the Secretary did not provide me, ever, any notes or transcripts of anything anyone else said but only the words that I had said which I wished to use in order to be sure that I didn't say in my dissent what I had not said in the meeting I thought it very appropriate that the Secretary not provide me with other people's words because in some sense other people hadn't seen and verified that those were their words   Alan, I really agree with both you and with Tom And when I say that, I agree that going forward a Memorandum of Discussion is the preferable way to go But that Memorandum of Discussion, going forward, will be subject to Committee approval We do not have Committee approval on the previous transcripts, which are there I agree with Tom Hoenig that once those are there, our attempt to substitute [Memoranda of Discussion] for them going backward will not work very well It won't work very well internally That is, how can we go backwards and pull these together? We don't have the procedures whereby the members who participated have an opportunity to sit down in a discussion and say "I don't agree with this" and someone else says "Well, I don't agree with you" And finally the Chairman says "But we're going to have to come to a consensus," and the majority vote rules in regard to going forward with the Memoranda of Discussion But to try to put Memoranda of Discussion together for the past that have the unanimous consent of all current members plus all those who've left us seems to me--   But there again, I think the amount of time that it's going to take on our part to do previous Memoranda of Discussion is going to be far in excess of the time it would take someone to follow the instructions about redacting information that ought not be to be there by substituting "bank" for--   Yes I would like to see us take steps as soon as possible--as soon as we have a consensus to do so--to adopt a Memorandum of Discussion on a going-forward basis and to announce that we would have those available with a three-year lag or whatever the majority believe [is appropriate] But I just believe that there's a separate question on the previous transcripts that are rough and unedited And I think the time delay ought to be longer on that kind of material than it should be for the Memorandum of Discussion   But the biggest loss for us is not that someone is going to find something in there and say "See here!" That's because, by and large, they're going to show that we've been a very careful body in regard to going about our decisionmaking The biggest harm for us is that someone will say "See, there they go; they're trying to rewrite it" I just think it's a losing proposition for us on what is already there But that's enough   But in the meantime, we have an opportunity At least since Bill McDonough joined the Committee, the Committee is now [at full strength] And from that meeting on, why not begin immediately to put together a Memorandum of Discussion, starting with the August meeting or--what was it--the October or September meeting?   September meeting Let's get on with that, because if there's a will to do Memoranda of Discussion, it seems to me we ought to get at that We would thereby know a little about what it's like to put those Memoranda of Discussion together And it would show that we are taking an immediate step to achieve this And then, I agree, it would be nice to have Virgil find out more information in regard to where--   You don't think doing the August and September meetings would involve a heavy budget outlay?  -6-    10/22/93   But there have been people who served on the FOMC during that period who are gone and cannot participate And there are rules of order in adopting the Memorandum of Discussion    10/22/93   Except that every day that goes by increases the likelihood that the Congress may, in a sense, take it out of our control, and if we are thereby seen as being reluctant--   The swap line between the Treasury and the Fed?   Okay, but you are not talking about enlarging the swap line between the Fed and the Treasury?   Yes   It would be helpful in regard to our reaction to this information if you would tell us what the vote on NAFTA is going to be [Laughter]   The upper limit for the dollar against the peso?   So the high is 330 for the dollar What is the low?   Right Did they take both sides of the band?   They just widened the band   It may be that they've been successful because of the anticipation of NAFTA--that there has been a capital inflow, which has been driving the rate   Right   It also runs the risk that it might affect the vote on NAFTA That is, a significant depreciation of the peso running into [the time of the vote on] NAFTA might be exactly the argument that some would use to say that the United States will be the loser because of the shift in trade It seems to me that it would be very, very unacceptable to have the shift to a free market--   Right, toward a devaluated peso, because it could affect the vote outcome   So our specific swap line goes from where to where?  -6-    11/9/93   But what is the amount?   So that would take it up to $25 billion   I don't quite understand this I thought a swap line was there to be used  when it needed to be used   I know, so why isn't this just a straight swap [line increase]?   I just want to know what the legal distinction is between a swap line where we say we will lend up to $2-1/2 billion if you wish to draw upon it and one where someone  I do not understand that distinction   I know, but why draw on it  SPEAKER(?) It shows on their books as dollar reserves   Oh, I see; they want to go ahead and put it on--   Why don't they just request us to announce that the swap line has been increased?     It does seem to me that the Committee needs to act on two [matters] First of all we need to increase the swap line from $700 million to $25 billion If we decide to do that, that is one issue Then it seems to me we should authorize the [Foreign Currency Subcommittee] to clear a drawing on the swap line   But I do not understand why we should limit it at all If it is going to be It seems to me that at some point in time we have to face the real question, and the real question is the drawing on the swap line--   For real!   That is the real question I don't think we should be under any illusions that we might not have to face the real question   Yes, 90 days; three months is fine   But why not go ahead and approve the additional $23 billion in the swap line?   Which [raises the total] to $3 billion That gives the Chairman the backing within which he might want to negotiate   And then give the Chairman the authority to if he deems it desirable   The Subcommittee  SPEAKER(?) The Subcommittee   It seems to me that the Treasury would be making a mistake if the Treasury and the President do not use this in regard to the vote   Virgil, I thought it might be more appropriate for the Committee itself to increase the swap line   I think the answer is yes   As far as the minutes--   I guess I am always uneasy when we in a sense have voted to do something and then we decide not to vote to do it because we do not want it to be public It causes me to come back and ask What is the downside risk if the peso is stronger than we anticipate and it is subsequently known that the Federal Reserve saw fit to make a swap line available which was not used? My goodness, the United States has a $32 billion swap line out there that we do not use I do not see any downside risk   We increased it because we were asked to increase it   But then why not have another conference call? Even if everyone cannot be brought together, why not have a conference call and act when we are ready to act?   With a specific amount?   Ted, does the ESF have the liquidity to [provide] the $3 billion?   That about puts them up to their--   All right So they do not have the liquidity to do $3 billion?   I thought they did not have the liquidity   I would not object on a permanent basis, as long as it is not a repo   But at the same time it seems to me that we should be aware that our setting up the facility, which might thereby be announced, and then our being unready to meet that outgo could have certain market repercussions   But it seems to me that the monetary policy regime that is in place in Mexico is a very sound one That they are asking for this with such large reserves is to me an indication that they have moved into another realm of central bank operations, and I think we should recognize that I feel that it is quite unlikely that they are going to need [to draw on those funds], given their willingness to push real interest rates where they have and to produce such a significant slowdown in the Mexican economy that is already under way They have in place a monetary restraint which makes it somewhat unlikely that they are going to need--   I understand But at the same time, however low the probabilities are, I believe we have to be aware before we make this move that in the unlikely event they would need to draw that money down, it could be a somewhat disruptive event for us to say "no" at that point in time   My statements have been made in the context of my being a supporter of what you are asking   Yes   Don, when you outlined your alternatives you mentioned releasing the raw transcripts with, I presume, a warning label on them as well as a warning label on the [MOD] Then you [discussed] separately the release of lightly edited transcripts You then gave us some advantages and disadvantages Did you consider an alternative of releasing both a lightly edited and the raw transcript?   But one of the disadvantages of the lightly edited transcript is that someone might say that it really wasn't [accurate], that it was really a rewriting of history   And one of the disadvantages of the raw transcript is that someone says "Here's what happened" and isn't very careful--   But you didn't visit with the Archivist or get impressions as to which [he would prefer], if he had both a lightly edited and the raw transcript I would think that most people would find it much easier to read the lightly edited one   I know, but it would be somewhat more expensive, I think, to do that back [in time]   It's desirable that we appear more intelligent than we are?   It seems to me that we do need to be somewhat forthcoming to Mr Gonzalez in addition to the three- and five-year proposal As we go to the hearing it seems to me important that we come forward laying some [proposal] on the table [to the effect] that we would expect him and his staff to maintain the privacy [of FOMC materials provided] I think we should make a deal before the hearing so it doesn't appear that we're fighting everything and then explain why it is that we're asking the Committee to keep [the materials] private  In regard to the future, the Memorandum of Discussion is acceptable to me with a three-year [lag] I think there's some advantage of having the organizational improvement [of an MOD] as compared to the lightly edited transcript I think a Memorandum of Discussion is unacceptable going backward because we don't have all the members [available] to concur I would prefer for the past that we have both the lightly edited and raw transcripts Now, when I say raw, I mean raw redacted according to the General Counsel's  -23-    11/16/93  privileges And I would presume, Virgil--tell me if I'm incorrect-- that references to individuals by name that in a sense weren't necessary could be left out Even in the raw transcript could names be left out?   Thank you   And what's the form going forward?   Do we have current minutes?   With attribution?   I agree with the thrust of your arguments This Committee has a lot of capability to maintain a deliberative process even if it doesn't seem exactly ideal I can't imagine, whatever happens, that we're going to let ourselves change that much   But we can go in more directions than one and [the differences in] one alternative versus the other alternatives are not that significant And I agree with you that changes can be made if they need to be made But I do believe that we need to decide today what we're going to do The longer we go without deciding, the more it's going to appear that somebody else is pulling our chain   No  SEVERAL No   And both   No one mentioned MODs going backward, did they?   Well, by only two people I believe   My first choice is releasing both [lightly edited and raw transcripts] with redactions   Right So my first choice is both; my second choice is the raw transcripts   Well, I guess in terms of the count we have a multiple choice here and we ought to boil it down to the two highest and have a vote-off on the two highest   Well, why?   I mean multiple choice voting-- You really need to find out among the two highest choices--   Listen, Robert's Rules of Order provides for always determining a majority; you can't do anything without a majority   But you don't have a majority first choice for light editing   Well, what was the count?   First choice?   Well, I sure didn't-- I heard a lot of raws and I heard a lot of boths as first choice How many raws were there for first choice? Were there three?   Okay, so it's the voting members I see All right   Well, that's fine if there's a majority   You have to annotate unless you put the original out   I hate to tell you this but the reason you want to do both is because if you have both of them there; that solves that problem   No, because somebody is free to interpret as they wish and say "Look, here's the way the experts thought it should be"   Once you've edited, you've doctored it   And [for] some member of the Committee who is no longer living, I just think it's better to have some doubt in regard to whether the [editor] fixed it or not   I don't understand the first and second choice How do you count the first and second choice? Are you counting both choices?   You're just counting the first choice?   This is on the future?  SEVERAL The past   The past All right Five is first choice; three is second choice   But the emphasis is upon light and we must define what light means   Does that mean non-sentences become sentences?   You can't change the substance and I presume every sentence that's there has to be left there   Just solve it by the Archivist standards?   MOD first choice; lightly edited second   What are enhanced minutes? I thought the current minutes were enhanced minutes   What was the count on the MOD?   I thought that was your proposal--the MOD   Well, how did you vote?  -50-    11/16/93   Can we vote for lunch?  SPEAKER(?) Is that one of the choices?   Does either one of them have seven votes?   Then I think we really have to go around a second time   Well, then it seems to me that someone needs to move some motion and see if it passes or gets amended or something   Does enhanced minutes have attribution in it?  SPEAKER(?) No   Yes, we do that now   Mr Chairman, maybe that's what we need to decide Some of us want to have attribution and some don't Maybe we need to decide that first That's either a yes or no   Rather than discussing this, Mr Chairman, I would move that we have attribution first of all And then we'll decide what form the attribution will take afterwards I think that's the disagreement here   Does yours have attribution in it?   I thought we did that   We did it Now what?   Absolutely   It is essential that we go forward I don't know what the majority is on this attribution/non-attribution issue I don't know what the majority is on keeping the tape recorder on But let's find out Let's vote   That's fine Mr Chairman, I would move that we leave the tape recorder on All right?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Yes That's what we're moving Vote it down if you don't want it   But, Mike, one person thinks one way and one thinks the other A motion has been made and seconded Now, if you want to make a substitute motion and reverse the order, that's your privilege   That we leave the tape recorder on   But when the discussion doesn't lead to determination as to where the majority is, a motion is a very handy way to find out where the majority is   Of course All votes are--   Well, Mr Chairman, I don't care which we vote on first I'm open to voting on--   Okay   No, not unless-- Are we doing this as voting members or are we doing it with everybody?   Delay?   Six or seven?   Okay   Mr Chairman, my confusion here is this We had a discussion, which seemed to be much more in one direction than I anticipated it would be Then all of a sudden we had a discussion about, well, we can do it this way or that way, or we can make it work Many of us--I can go several different ways--can be satisfied with more than one [approach] I don't feel strongly about which way we come out But I do feel very strongly that this Committee is going to be disadvantaged if, after you've written your letter and you say you can't answer his letter about these tapes until the [next] FOMC meeting--   Is that all he requested?  -59-    11/16/93   To every part of his letter?   I don't think I understand what you're saying What decision have we made?   Yes But what decision have we made in regard to his request to give [the raw transcripts] to him? I thought that was a separate question   Virgil, is that a separate question?   So what is our decision on that?   Oh, I just didn't think that had been discussed and deliberated and voted on   I thought we were voting on what we were releasing to the public and we decided to do [lightly edited transcripts] with a five-year delay   Well, what I'm wondering is whether or not there would be a possibility of your going to him and asking him if we could make them available to him as a Committee Chairman and keep them private and still have our five years Do you think that's an option? I thought, Virgil, we had to deal with the fact that he's the Chairman of the Committee and-- Are we saying "no" to him? Is that what we've [agreed]? Okay   I see   Well, I do want to dissent from that decision   Could I ask you this question? Do you think there's any chance that he would be open, after you've told him we're releasing these lightly edited transcripts with a five-year delay and that means we're going to get out the-- Are we following the suggestion that we start with 1988 first? Is that the order?   Yes Now, after telling him that--that we've been forthcoming and the Committee has voted--do you think there's any chance that in negotiation with him he would be open to proceeding in the direction of having them himself with one staff person to review them and not go the subpoena route?   Well, I just would prefer we not get caught in a subpoena if we can negotiate our way out of a subpoena   Well, my fear is that we will have kicked and screamed all the way, and he will end up getting all of this [despite] our kicking and screaming and it will really put us in a very bad light with the public I at least wanted a discussion of the alternatives to going that route   My approach would be to authorize the Chairman to release to [Mr Gonzalez] whatever FOMC materials he wants to see, if he will agree that only he and one staff person will look at them and that they will return them to you within a reasonable period of time--   So that's impossible?  SPEAKER(?) That's impossible   Wonderful  SEVERAL Is it lunch?   Well, I agree with the Vice Chairman of the Committee that there are not likely to be issues here [in terms of] the Committee wishing to make this kind of change It seems to me that we've already expressed sentiment in regard to careful and judicious use of these instruments But I would tend to favor their being retained as a part of the arsenal under the arrangements in which we're very careful as to how they're used So I don't really see that much benefit, Jerry, of the Committee engaging in that study   Yes, it was about 1989 or 1990 when we had our last--   For the first two-thirds of what John was saying I was almost exactly in agreement and thought maybe I didn't need to talk very much, but then it turned out that--   It seems to me that the sentiment expressed around this table is surprisingly strong That is, there were those of you who were somewhat concerned on the down side who now seem to lack that same concern And certainly some of you who had a more placid outlook now seem to be reporting more vigor in regard to the rate of economic activity I think some of us--particularly I do, having had such a bullish view a year ago--have to ask ourselves Well, what about this year? Will there be another downturn? First of all, this recovery statistically does not have more variability than any previous recovery There aren't any fits and starts in this recovery; there are fits and starts in people's perception of it But the quarter-to-quarter variability is really just about right on Industrial production, which is a somewhat independent measure, indeed seems to me to be on a pretty steady upward progression  But economies don't get into difficulty because it gets to be January This January we do have this significant tax phenomenon, but  -83-    11/16/93  I've decided that maybe the impact of that tax phenomenon is mis- measured It's true that some people underwithheld in [1993] and they have to make it up in their actual 1993 tax payments and will have a significant increase in their estimated tax or withholding in 1994 But it seems to me that the people for whom that occurs are people with high incomes and they are well educated, and I just can't imagine that there's any surprise of fact Indeed, I think the political rhetoric--that is, the American people's dissatisfaction with government--continues to cause in some sense an over-assessment of the tax impact so people even in high income tax brackets probably are over-reacting and have already taken those tax effects [into account] in regard to their own permanent lifetime income notions and wealth present values Many Americans are not going to have tax increases The political rhetoric has been that they will; consequently, maybe we'll have a little surprise People will find out that [the new tax] isn't as bad as they thought it would be, and only a surprise, it seems to me, is apt to alter the activity level And it seems unlikely to me that we're going to end up with the same inventory condition in that we do not have the year-end boom this time, which subtracts out of the first quarter because of [efforts] to get [expenditures] in one tax period as compared to another So I think we ought not take it for granted that the economy will do a little dip next year  I'm not disagreeing with Mike Prell's forecast in regard to GDP; it's a very reasonable forecast But it seems very unlikely to me that the economy will be softer than what Mike has outlined I think there's a considerable chance that the economy will be somewhat stronger, or maybe surprisingly stronger, than that forecast But none of us has a crystal ball to be able to see that and to know for sure that that's going to happen The Federal Reserve has a great deal of credibility at this time We have quite a bit of esteem There are people who believe we're the only game in town because those who have such a disdain for their government tend to look to us as being somehow or other the people who get it right So we're in a rather preferred position and yet our responsibility is to continue to pursue a monetary policy that continues this disinflation If we [lose] that--that is, if bad news or an unanticipated shock effect cause the rate of inflation to zoom upward without any action on our part--there will be some penalties  As for the inflation forecast--and here again I'm not quibbling with that because it does seem somewhat reasonable--I would point out that it [shows] very, very meager [progress] And it's very meager [compared with other countries] in the world I was looking at the G-10 group and I believe we are only slightly ahead of the United Kingdom and probably a percentage point and a half ahead of Italy Other than that, all other G-10 countries have a better forecast, according to our staff, than we do This to me produces some vulnerability because as long as there are expectations of continued disinflation then I would expect good bond market behavior The bond market does have more potential for stronger bond prices and lower interest rates at the intermediate and long levels But that's not guaranteed; that's very difficult at this stage of the cycle And we have to be very conscious of the fact that if we are perceived as moving before people thought we should move--indeed if there were some notion of "What in the world is the Fed doing?" in such a move--we would probably get a very good long bond response and thereby not  -84-    11/16/93  damage the growth prospects On the other hand, if there were a pickup in activity and if world growth were to pick up somewhat and world commodity prices were thereby adversely impacted and we were seen as moving in a laggard fashion, then I think we could have a very significant upward movement in interest rates in the intermediate and long areas And that could [induce] some vulnerability in the markets I am somewhat bullish in regard to the equity markets I think the equity markets probably haven't had that last boom and bubble that often accompanies such moves The opportunity cost of being in the equity market is very, very small So if the economy is a little stronger and inflation about as we expect, the equity markets may have a somewhat supportive upside potential World growth has to be a very significant factor for an economy with our trade balance and its impact on us I'm not optimistic about Japan I'm not optimistic about Europe, but I'm not that pessimistic either; it seems to me that they may very well have reached bottom and we may have seen the worst of the impact on our exports in that market Mexico does provide some downward risk due to the monetary tightening that is inevitably accompanying the difficulties there, and that will have some adverse effect But China and other Asian countries and parts of Latin America may offset that to a great extent That about summarizes my view It is that the economy has the potential to be much stronger, but I think hardly any chance of being weaker than we've forecast   My preference in this situation, in which the fed funds rate is at 3 percent and it really ought to be at 4 percent, is to be at a permanent symmetric position I would agree that this isn't exactly [the time]--I'd like to have a little better opportunity for timing than doing it today--but that's my preference A 4 percent fed funds rate just seems to be much more likely to be associated with stability in commodity prices, the price of gold, and a more neutral monetary [policy] position away from the accommodative [policy position] that we're in And I just doubt very much that we have an adequate ability to call the turn at the time So, I'd just feel a lot more confident with 4 percent but, Mr Chairman, I don't know how to get there   Thank you, Mr Chairman When we look at this process, it does involve a lot of attention on the real economy; that is, each of the twelve Presidents naturally has a responsibility to speak about economic conditions in his District It wasn't too long ago that various groups were unified--well, unified or crossed--in their analysis by the role of M2 When V2 was stable, those who wanted to use the output gap approach to inflation found the stable velocity of money to be very helpful in regard to achieving a policy conducive to the level of output that would provide the kind of gap approach that would either restrain inflation or produce gradual disinflation Robert Black and Frank Morris certainly had different perspectives; both of them crossed in the sense of recognizing that M2 was information of importance In the [1970s] I suppose we talked about disappearing money With the V2 one-time step we were confronted with, in a sense, disappearing money in regard to its role in policy formation Many who looked at money did not look at it on the basis of predicting the output gap But the steady growth of money is to be seen as a prelude directly to price level stability So that the Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz background said If you do the right thing with money, you end up getting stable prices and you don't need to worry about the real economy The market-system economy is so efficient that if you provide stable money, then output growth and employment will be allocated very efficiently and we'll have very good end results But when V2 becomes totally unreliable--really it became unreliable in 1982-1983 and was unreliable many other times--then those who want to follow the output gap approach are left without a forward handle in regard to creating the output gap that's critical for monetary policy That's because monetary policy, as we know, works with a very significant and variable time lag So this concentration upon the output gap I think is somewhat exaggerated by the very good work that Mike Prell and Ted Truman and their staff do in the Greenbook because the Greenbook is an attempt to say "Well, what's out there?" And I think all of us know that the very best forecast is not really all that good in regard to knowing what is out there; the forecast has to be not only with regard to the growth rate but the forecast has to have the correct level of productivity to know where we are  -19-    12/21/93  Now, in this atmosphere it seems to me that it's very, very important that there be around the table those who continue to follow very closely the output gap because the statistics are clearly supportive of that view That is, the best predictor of the rate of inflation is that output gap And yet it seems to me that following that approach, even if it's economically advantageous, has a very strong political disadvantage That is, the very notion that we might take away the punch bowl when growth gets going is a position, it seems to me, that the central bank ought not to be in Since so many follow the other approach, I prefer an approach that tries to target the price level directly but I also don't have any help from M2 in regard to doing that And if we don't have help from M2, then I think we have to ask ourselves What is the current condition of monetary policy? Is monetary policy at the present neutral or is it accommodating or is it restraining? If M2 doesn't tell us by itself, then I think we have to ask if we're providing too much liquidity and what signs we will see as to that extra liquidity Now, I suppose the oldest approach would be the approach of Knut Wicksell, which says that there is a natural rate of interest And I think those who want to follow that--whether you want to concentrate on real or nominal rates--can look at the five-year Treasury and say that's what the market is saying the natural rate of interest is And if you pull the rate of interest too far away from its natural rate, you are going to be engaged in constraint or ease [depending on] which direction you go But you can't tell by moving interest rates up or down or leaving them the same as to whether policy is consistent  Now, I've done a lot of work--and many of the people here have been very helpful--in regard to commodity prices, because if money is rather plentiful then it should show up in commodity prices And that's a mixed bag There is no panacea here When you look at commodity prices today, you see a mixed picture You see a picture in which the price of oil has been declining and the Federal Reserve's experimental index of 21 commodity prices has about a 21 percent weight on oil in terms of its passthrough effects So when the price of oil has been coming down, as it is now, we know that we are in a very favorable immediate CPI arena Now, how well the CPI performs compared with being in this favorable arena may be another question But if you look at the best evidence of commodity prices now, it seems to me that they are not quite as robust as the price of gold But there is some picture there that we do have ample money on the table And if that ample money is on the table and we leave it on the table long enough until the CPI responds, then in some sense it's too late And it's too late in terms of stable money because sound money doesn't simply aim at price level stability; sound money is stable money and aims not to have any monetary-policy-induced cycles It seems to me that most of the cycles that we've experienced have been monetary- policy-induced And that's why we have to be somewhat in the forefront by not asking ourselves what's going to take place in the second quarter of 1994 but what the price level effects of what we do today are in 1995 and indeed in 1996  So, under these circumstances, I tend to be about where Al Broaddus is and to believe that [maintaining] the fed funds rate at the current level at some point in time will catch up with us And when it does catch up with us, we won't know how much of a move it will take in the fed funds rate to correct the situation That is, at 3 percent we've had a kind of head winds phenomena but we've    12/21/93  particularly had a household sector that has been very duration mismatched Now that duration mismatch is much less than the duration mismatchwas three years ago as money was flowing out of 6-month CDs into longer-term bond mutual funds and into equity mutual funds So for that reason alone monetary policy is more accommodative at the current level of rates than it was 17 months ago I checked, and it was 17 months ago, not in September, that the Treasury bill rate reached its low level because the market anticipated that level; so the Treasury bill has been really in this current range for about 17 months now And over this 17 months, monetary policy has become increasingly accommodative Now, I do not know when this accommodation will have gone on too long The US economy and the world economy have had a very significant real asset deflation, which has altered the behavior of the commercial banking industry in regard to making loans and has altered the behavior of people in regard to wanting to make loans So we're on new ground and we really don't know how soon such a change might take place So I would prefer to say the price of gold at $389 an ounce is too high And last spring I think many of us thought that the price of gold would never go above $400 But if you leave policy alone the opportunity cost of [holding] gold will be conducive to the price of gold going above $400 And the longer you let it go and the higher it goes, the greater will be the tradeoff cost of bringing inflation back to where it ought to be So in my narrow view, I can't see any choice but to say Let's try to move closer to neutral I don't think any of us knows where neutral is but I would certainly think it is closer to 4 percent than to 3 percent [on the fed funds rate] If we can do this before the bond markets tag us with a reluctance to move, I think we will get more output and more growth than we will if we, in a sense, get in a lagging market I'm very envious of the Swiss's 4 percent 10-year rate and the tremendous increase in output and growth that can occur If I thought that pursuing price level stability directly gave us more output and more growth and more employment, I don't know how anyone who cares about the quality of our labor force could ever foster and favor policies that lead to people being unemployed or people being bankrupt So I think it's a commitment to stable money; stable money gives us more output because we don't have to have those recessions Thank you   Don, at what meetings in '87 were we asymmetrical? When did we first go [asymmetrical], at the March meeting?   Right   Mr Chairman, I certainly feel I'm in good company here There is-   But, John, if I'm correct, I think the minutes of any conference call we might have would be published February 9th Is that correct?   In other words, if the Committee made a decision-- So, who knows?   There's so much that has been said that I agree with, but I won't emphasize all that I think it's correct that it isn't right to go to an asymmetric directive We need to act at a meeting I think we all agree to that And many of you made some very fine statements saying "Don't react to strong employment and growth numbers" And the Chairman's statement was really very, very helpful in that regard I'm going to add one other tough deal, all right? And that is Don't make a 25 basis point move And here is the reason If we are as far away from neutral as I believe we are, it's much better to wait a week or two and get 50 than it is to do 25 because 25 could be [misaligned] by the time the bond market reacts to that So I strongly believe that when we act--or when you act--that it should be 50 basis points Remember the 1970s and this jiggling along with moves of 1/8th of a percentage point; it just didn't work It's so hard when we start moving rates up; in '87, Don, I believe we [initially] raised the funds rate by 25 basis points Did we move it at a meeting or did we move on an asymmetric directive in March?   But I think that we put the rate up 25 basis points and then the bond market [went up] another 50 basis points and of course that wasn't enough And it wasn't until Alan Greenspan came in that we really said "Hey, wait a minute," and then we were caught in a very bad timing situation Now, not only do I think we ought do 50 basis points but I really think we ought to do 50 basis points now And the reason that we ought to do it now--or whenever the next opportunity is--is because unexpected bad things happen You go along and you get an employment number, or you get this or you get that, and it just doesn't seem [to be the] right [time] to do it We were caught with that in May of 1987 I remember Paul Volcker called Manley [Johnson] and me in and said, in effect "Look, you guys have been wanting to increase rates; I'm now telling you when you want to do it, just let me know" Every day we looked at the markets, including the foreign exchange value of the dollar which was strong, and we found an excuse every day not to do it, so we didn't do anything And that made it more difficult So, do 50 and do it now   That means send it up there?  -42-    12/21/93   Mr Chairman, I support your proposal I wonder whether there's a pre-step that might be taken which would set the context a little better, and I'd like to have Virgil respond I'm wondering whether previous to that [review by Banking Committee staff] we should state categorically what we think the tape will show   In a letter  -45-    12/21/93   Yes, so you state it And if there's any ambivalence there, I think I would approach the ambivalence before so there's no news value in the actual looking at it   Right, because of the vulnerability that [emerged], what many of us thought about as we began [preparing] our own testimony was What notes did I take and what did I do? And then even for those of us who had knowledge of what seemed to be the Committee's [procedures] and what the Secretariat was doing, when you said what you said it was clear and unequivocal that you had a responsibility as Chairman to reveal that information So the question that was raised by individual members was Should I put it in my testimony? Of course, for me, I had independent knowledge and it had to be in my testimony But there was a discussion, as I recall, of members saying Well, do I need to put it in my testimony? And I think we need to set [the point] out clearly that the individuals in asking that question never had any doubt that you and the Secretary were going to reveal fully [the existence of] the tapes So no one, as I recall, had any view of not wanting the tapes to be out there We knew they had to be
