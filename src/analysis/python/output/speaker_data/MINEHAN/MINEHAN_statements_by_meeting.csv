2093,1994-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman   I trust I won't either!   I have a question and a comment Ted, is it accurate to say that Mexico has been the only country since the early '80s to actually draw on the swap lines?    3/22/94   So the conditions that we impose on Mexico in some sense do not involve treating them like a second-class citizen; those are the only conditions that are really operative at present in terms of our swap lines   I would generally agree with President McDonough that this is a legitimate function of central banks in general But I would be concerned, to whatever extent we enter into this swap agreement with Mexico, that we do so on a businesslike basis for us In that regard I'd be a little nervous about relying on the Treasury's collateral I'm also bothered, as other people have been, by the history of the drawings and the amount of money that seems to go from one source of funds to another source of funds to pay each of them back And I would be concerned if we didn't take measures on our own in terms of this very substantial expansion of the line with Mexico so that if it were to be drawn upon we would have independent means of securing our own exposure   So you would contemplate that if they ever needed--   I must say I am impressed by President Forrestal's comments I would like to see the disclosure decisions as a package and I would not like to see us committed to announcing every time But in general I think announcement is not a bad thing "
2094,1994-03-22," Well, I have a somewhat less bullish report than the rest of you But it's also a little less bearish than has been the usual case for the First District Sizable data revisions and recent data trends suggest that the New England economy is doing better than most observers, including ourselves, recently thought Upward revisions to the payroll employment numbers were substantial and now show that the region began a gradual recovery in the summer of 1992 or about a year earlier than the originally published data had shown Services are the most notable source of employment growth Service jobs in the region now exceed their pre-recession peak by about 6-1/2 percent Other indicators--unemployment rates, help wanted advertising, housing permits--are consistent with a gradual economic recovery in the region After a very severe recession, New England's recovery finally seems to be tracking the nation's Now despite the net increase in overall employment, large employers in a number of industries continue to announce layoffs, and manufacturing employment continues to decline The shrinkage in defense spending is hurting the region The computer companies are still struggling Interestingly, however, the region is benefiting somewhat from the strong performance of the US auto makers despite having no assembly plants Companies making various rubber, metal, and textile products have seen increased demand from the auto industry Most manufacturers have ambitious capital spending plans, but few if any have plans to resume hiring  Although a few First District manufacturers report scattered increases in input prices, selling prices are not going up Competition is intense in almost every industry, so there is no automatic passthrough of higher costs In addition, companies appear to be using technology more intensively to improve productivity And the products they sell also may be more durable and last for longer periods before replacement is needed than before One major dealer of heavy trucks reported that it is common now for truck trade-ins to occur after 600,000 to 700,000 miles owing to improvements in technology and durability versus trade-ins at about 250,000 to 300,000 miles less than a decade ago Severe weather has depressed retail sales and construction in New England but manufacturers and manufacturing hours were generally unaffected  On the national side, we see a deceleration from the pace in the latter part of 1993 similar to the Greenbook At issue here is how much slack does the economy have before it reaches a point where inflationary pressures increase considerably and how fast will it move to that point As the staff noted in one of their briefing papers, reasonable people can differ on the amount of labor market slack, and at the margin we do Our view is that the NAIRU is perhaps 25 basis points lower than the Board staff estimate or at the low end of the range We also see the growth rate of potential GDP as slightly higher, so we come out with an estimate of a higher capacity for growth than the Greenbook On the issue of how fast the economy will close the gap, we have been impressed by the amount of longer-end interest rate movement that has occurred since February and the  -26-    3/22/94  constraining effect that has On the other hand, our estimates of the future drags from the external sector are less than those of the Greenbook and we see somewhat stronger consumer durable goods expenditures and state and local spending and perhaps higher inventory investment These forecasts of slightly greater speed are marginal, however, and we are in complete agreement with the Greenbook assessment that there is no near-term threat of rising inflation "
2095,1994-03-22," Well, maybe you stand where you sit on these issues Being in the First District and not being surrounded by signs that are as optimistic as those that give rise to the optimism in the other Districts, we at the Boston Bank have had a lot of arguments in getting ready for this Committee meeting But they tended to be more about moving up 25 basis points versus doing nothing I think we could buy into 25 basis points We think that would be more smoothing to the markets and would be expected as opposed to a stronger move that might not be expected We also believe that with higher rates there is the possibility of a weaker economy than the Greenbook projects, and we would not like that to occur So by and large we would be in favor of the 25 basis point increase We would also be in favor of a symmetric directive or a conference call if we want to make a change "
2146,1994-05-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman Things are clearly in recovery mode in New England Payroll employment has grown for the region as a whole in each of the last three months and jobs overall  -18-    5/17/94  are about 2 percent above a year ago This improvement is broad- based With the sole exception of durable goods manufacturing, all major industry categories had more jobs than a year ago On a geographic basis, only Connecticut continues to show job losses The New England unemployment rate declined for the third straight month to 56 percent, well below the rate for the nation as a whole Other indicators are also positive; average weekly hours in manufacturing reached a new post-recession high, help wanted advertising rose in March, and per capita income growth of 37 percent exceeded the national pace slightly All this good news should not obscure the fact that the region as a whole has gained back only about a quarter to a third of the ground lost during the recession, no matter what data are used to measure progress, although one could question whether we want to go back to the late 1980s in terms of how heated up things were in New England Companies continue to report that competition is very keen and that their own quality and efficiency improvements are the primary determinants of survival, not rising overall demand There's no rising tide to carry them all to prosperity On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any remaining undertow either  Several contacts, including some on our board, complained that the Fed is raising interest rates just as the economy finally shows some signs of life In response to our questions, however, a number indicated that they were seeing attempts by suppliers to increase prices, but these attempts were being resisted Retailers saw strong growth in March but a fall-off more recently Cautious optimism may be the best way to express the New England viewpoint almost across the board  On the national scene, we too believe that growth will be somewhat stronger than projected by the Greenbook We've been impressed by the degree of tightening in labor markets recently, but on the other hand our projections of the NAIRU are at the low end of the range that seems to be used by Board staff, and we are a little more optimistic about potential GDP growth While our sense of the components of the picture varies from those in the Greenbook, we do agree with projections of low inflation, at least in the near term "
2147,1994-05-17," Which you just happen to have!   I agree with President Boehne We support the 50 basis points; we support the symmetric directive, and the wording of the statement "
2197,1994-08-16, Thank you 
2198,1994-08-16," Mr Chairman, the New England economy continues to grow June employment was about 2 percent above the year-earlier level, and the regional unemployment rate is about the same as the national average, with rates in several states well below the national figure Looking at the region, there are big differences state to state Massachusetts and New Hampshire are growing above national rates while Connecticut bumps along not growing much at all, at least in terms of employment Job growth has been concentrated in the services industry, especially business services Construction and wholesale/retail trade also have been expanding reasonably strongly Services jobs are commonly characterized in highly pejorative terms, at least in the First District And this pattern of recovery has left many consumers and businesses skeptical that the recovery is for real Even more sophisticated observers of the regional economy who recognize the high quality of many services jobs find themselves frustrated at their inability to determine what is driving the expansion of these services industries In constrast to historical experience, manufacturing employment in New England has fallen during this recovery In the last few months, however, the job decline seems to have ended and our informal conversations with regional manufacturers have had an increasingly positive tone Firms are seeing some materials cost pressures and, for the first time in a long while, some companies are passing these price increases along Retail sales are fairly strong, though the environment is highly promotional and margins are flat Inventories are said to be lean Our little contribution to the inventory story here is that one major catalog dealer just ran out of the items that everybody wanted this summer This really puts them in quite an embarrassing position since they sell themselves largely on their ability to deliver things in a certain short period of time The one area that is showing signs of  -12-    8/16/94  slowing is housing Contacts report that sales agreements have fallen during June and July in response to higher interest rates Statistics on sales and construction still look quite good, but of course they reflect decisions that were made some months ago  On the subject of the national economy, based on the strength of the employment data over the last several weeks, we think that the economy may well be stronger in the near term than the Greenbook forecast We would expect to see some overshooting of even our estimate of the NAIRU in the short run as a result of that, and we would expect also to see the GDP numbers for the second quarter at 4 percent or better when they are finally revised That could mean stronger third-quarter numbers Over the longer term, we have a little different view than the Greenbook forecast, particularly since the Greenbook incorporates a degree of tightening that we are not quite comfortable with We are interested, Mike, in whether you ran any numbers on what a somewhat slower rate of tightening might produce next year in the way of inflation and GDP growth I am looking, for example, at the DRI forecasts, which tend to have less monetary tightening, somewhat similar if not lower GDP growth, and just about the same inflation numbers built into them   Yes   Yes, they actually have rates backing off, I think   Too short of a period of time perhaps?   Yes, and I think we would agree with that   We have had the same reports in the First District It seems odd that bankers should be telling the media that they are making loans that they shouldn't be making  -15-    8/16/94   No, they even are saying that they are leaning over backwards because of the competition "
2199,1994-08-16," There is not much I can add to what I think has been a shared sense that there is some risk right now, mostly on the up side, and that we need to deal with that risk We agree further tightening is necessary We would go with the 50 basis points; we would follow it up with a discount rate increase We are getting into the area of nuances here I think our belief on the nuance side is a little closer to Governor Blinder's than perhaps to President Melzer's, that whatever the nuances are in this statement, they ought to be in the form of sort of wait and see if anything more is necessary--   I would fully agree with that and I would be in favor of that wording "
2253,1994-09-27," I'm interested in the change that you mentioned between August and now You gave several reasons and the material we've been getting gives several reasons But in your mind can you prioritize what was the main reason why your forecast and the implicit amount of tightening changed as much as they did from August to now?  -11-    9/27/94  And what do you think most hangs in the balance subsequent to this meeting? What data coming in are you most looking at?   Is there one out of that?   You don't have to go through your whole presentation! I was just looking for--   And what would you be looking for in the next data coming in? Would you be looking particularly at the consumer side?   It's ghosts   New England's recovery remains respectable in terms of the data, but the pace and feel of economic growth lead me to conclude that we may still be experiencing the lull that we thought was there nationally during the summer In July, employment growth was just under 2 percent for the region as a whole over the previous year or nearly a full percentage point below national levels Earlier  -20-    9/27/94  in the year, regional growth had tracked national levels a little more closely As in the past, employment growth in the region varies considerably by state, with Massachusetts and New Hampshire employment growing at just under 3 percent, that in Connecticut nearly flat, and Vermont and Rhode Island employment beginning to flatten as well Growth in service jobs remains dominant, with two-thirds of the job growth in New England over the last year occurring in services However, we are beginning to see an upturn in manufacturing, a fact that has engendered some optimism Consumer confidence rose slightly in August, but here again it is not what it was earlier in the year In general, New Englanders have expressed less of a sense of growing optimism over the past year than is true nationwide, with local consumer confidence readings moving up less than 10 points versus over double that for the nation as a whole Perhaps these consumer confidence figures account for the general spending malaise reported by our retail Beigebook contacts  Continuing this tale of moderating growth, construction employment has been essentially flat for three months, new housing activity is slowing, and significant commercial construction has yet to materialize However, both housing permits and the value of residential construction contracts remain considerably above year-ago levels Retailers and manufacturing contacts report very little cost pressure in contrast to more widespread reports of raw materials cost increases six weeks before And where there are price increases, we also see the inability due to competition to pass on those price increases Finally, while the overall volume of District bank lending is growing at a pace over that of 1993, such lending in the commercial, real estate, and personal loan categories is growing at a quite moderate pace compared to national trends I don't think that has anything to do with the banks' willingness to lend because we hear the same kinds of things that people hear nationally--that there may be some deterioration in the credit standards at the bank down the street There has been some news about that locally in the papers, but we don't see a tremendous degree of growth in the actual bank lending data  I should note two bright spots First, there was a great summer tourist season in the Northeast, similar to New York, with reports from Maine, the Boston area, and Cape Cod quite strong Second, commercial real estate markets seem to be tightening, at least in specific areas Vacancy rates in downtown Boston have declined substantially and some experts are predicting new construction as early as a couple of years from now, with serious renovations of older buildings in the meantime That contrasts very sharply from what people were thinking when I first arrived in Boston three years ago At that time, people were talking about sort of a 10-year horizon before anybody would risk building something new in Boston  On the national scene, we concur with the Greenbook that the prospects for the third and fourth quarters look stronger than expected Labor markets are tight; external growth is stronger Inflation, while perhaps not accelerating as yet, has stabilized and may be showing signs of turning upward So we are in harmony with the forecast of increased rates over the last half of the year, but the amount and the timing we believe are an issue Looking at a range of private sector forecasts, none seems to project as much tightening as the Greenbook though they achieve similar rates of GDP growth and a  -21-    9/27/94  moderation of inflation during 1995 So, we are a little agnostic about the degree of tightening, but we agree that the risks are on the up side   A shortage of teenagers who want to work "
2254,1994-09-27," I find myself very much torn at this stage I have a great deal of sympathy for what both President Broaddus and President Stern have said I feel, given that the economy has been operating near full capacity for some months now and that the statistics keep coming in much stronger than we anticipated, that the data over the next couple of weeks are likely to be strong On the other hand, while I think the risks are on the up side, the timing of further increases is something that has both an economic component to  -42-    9/27/94  it and a political component to it I would trust your judgment in this sense that maybe the best timing would be a little later So, I would be in favor of your recommendation I think the risks are on the up side I think it's likely that we'll move during the intermeeting period So, I would be in favor of the asymmetry as well "
2313,1994-11-15," Congratulations [Applause]   A girl?   How nice   Yes   It would be in the face of disorderly markets, right, Ted?   I know you can't, but we wouldn't just do it to prove we could do it   I think there is a distinction to be drawn I thought the November 2nd and 3rd interventions were helpful because of the perception of disorderliness in terms of the Administration's back-and-forth approach to the dollar I think it was helpful in terms of the country's credibility that we did intervene and that the intervention was successful    11/15/94   That's true The reason may be, as you said, that it came at a surprise moment and that contributed to the success I would worry if in the absence of a surprise--well, I don't know how one can know this except after the fact "
2314,1994-11-15," An opposite question to President Boehne's I was interested in the reference in the Greenbook to the cessation of speed effects that brings about the moderation of CPI increases in the last part of 1995 I wondered whether you had any estimates of what that CPI figure might be absent speed effect changes? Did you look at it that way?   Yes, right   So you think it is more the special factors that are pushing the increase in prices to 38 and 36 percent rather than any uptrend?   Yes   Looking at the other side, you have a declining impact from inventories, but certainly a smooth one Do you care to comment on that?   That's what we thought too!   Right   Finally, have you looked at the price effect when the ARMs that were issued this year kick in next year? The teaser rates this year have been very low Some of these ARMs have new provisions to extend the maturity, but a good portion of them will kick in next year   Thank you   Mr Chairman, New England continues to recover gradually But there is a distinction to be drawn between the incoming labor market data and other indicators, so I'll try to frame my comments about New England along those two lines Unlike most of the rest of the country, New England has not yet recovered the jobs lost in the last recession and is not expected to do so until late 1998 at best There is a continued lull in growth that I commented on at the last meeting, and it is hardly as welcome in New England as it might be for the country as a whole Payroll employment declined in five of the six New England states in September, putting the region's establishment job count slightly below its July level But it is still nearly 2 percent over a year earlier Massachusetts and New Hampshire continue to reflect the strongest growth rates among the six states, and Connecticut still bumps along on the bottom The September job decline for the region was concentrated in manufacturing unfortunately, but all the major industry categories except construction and government recorded declines Unemployment rose noticeably in the region in October, also in contrast to the national scene Prices and wages seem to be rising somewhat more slowly in the region than in the nation, and the residential real estate markets are definitely slowing  To round out this rather downbeat picture, trends in defense- related business also show deterioration relative to the national picture For example, prime defense contract awards to New England companies during the first half of 1994 were lower than at any time since 1980 and 35 percent below their 1989 peak Defense-related employment continues to decline and in some states the decline is nearly twice the national pace and probably accounts for a healthy share of the manufacturing job losses I noted earlier  Moving from the labor market data to other indicators, however, consumer confidence, help wanted advertising, and retail sales all show continued improvement in New England Retailers contacted for the Beigebook, especially those selling hard goods, were upbeat about recent activity and the near-term outlook I must admit that every business group I meet with seems to be much more positive than the incoming labor data would make me believe More than 50  -16-    11/15/94  percent of any group I have talked to in the past month or two are contemplating hiring people over the next 12 months and out into the future; they are seeing escalating input prices and are seriously considering raising prices in response to these escalating prices, probably along the lines of the January price increases that were mentioned in the Greenbook  In sum, New England faces considerable sectoral challenges-- defense, the computer industry, health care--which tend to drag down the data But there are sources of growth and ebullience emerging  On the national scene, we agree with the Greenbook's inference that the economic expansion has overshot We expect employment costs as measured by the ECI to turn up soon, and we agree that near-term inflation prospects are not optimal I've covered our concerns about the Greenbook in the questions that I had for Mike, but overall we don't find a lot to complain about We seem to be slightly further behind the curve than I would have liked at this point and the longer we wait and fail to slow the economy, the greater the chance that rates will need to be significantly higher If we don't increase rates at this meeting, I see a real chance of causing the boom-bust cycle that we have been trying to avoid I think the risks are on the up side, and I think we have to move sharply and fast to curb those risks I'm in agreement with President McDonough that that move should take place at this meeting   Oh heavens! "
2315,1994-11-15," I'm in full agreement with your recommendation, Mr Chairman My comments earlier were fairly strong and I'd like to put them in context First, I agree with the comments that both Governors Yellen and Blinder made that monetary policy lags being what they are, we won't see the full effects of what we have done already and certainly what we may do today until 1995 and early 1996 However, I do believe that the labor markets and other data we have gotten today continue to indicate that we have overshot I fear, along with Governor Lindsey, that if we move too slowly, underlying growth rates, which we have consistently underestimated all year, will cause significant overshooting In that case, we might find it necessary to pull even harder on the monetary reins, perhaps in the aggregate moving the full 150 basis points or more, and create a real hard landing Thus, I believe we should move now, move more strongly than the 50 basis points everyone expects, go to the 75 you have recommended, and I wouldn't care to predict anything about December I'm hopeful that we will be able to rein in the strong economy and achieve a better and softer landing "
2365,1994-12-20," Let me just kick off the regional overview The First District continues to expand at a moderate pace We have had a rate of job growth for the region as a whole that is behind the nation Our unemployment numbers are about the same, and as usual there are all sorts of variations by state, with Massachusetts still leading the pack and Connecticut still bumping along Consumer and business confidence in the region has risen sharply according to both recent data and an increasing amount of anecdotal information On the other hand, while District bank lending has grown through the third quarter, the pace of its growth is well behind that of the nation as a whole And if you compare the districts, the First District is lagging in all kinds of bank lending  Job growth continues to be concentrated in services, especially business and health excluding hospitals Manufacturing employment continues to lag, but the anecdotal reports from First District manufacturers are generally positive Strength is fairly broad-based However, there continues to be weakness in the defense area  Most of our manufacturing and retail contacts report increases in input prices, though their comments often revolve around the same inputs, largely paper and wood products in our area They are also starting to report increases or planned increases in selling prices Larger organizations, both retail and manufacturing, seem to indicate that the downsizing is over About half of our contacts report that they are going to be hiring in the new year If they have price increases in mind, they probably will be putting them through about the beginning of the year There are reports of wage increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent I think, however, that the high side of this range probably reflects some desire in companies that have been through downsizing to reward those people who are remaining I don't think that is necessarily reflective of a trend of continuing 5 percent wage increases  Now trying to stay on the right side of this fence, with regard to the Greenbook, we were more optimistic generally speaking when the year began We thought there was likely to be a lower full employment level, a little more potential for growth, and certainly no inflationary risk of any size We saw balanced risks at that time    12/20/94  As the year has gone by, we along with everybody else have been impressed by the degree to which the data are always stronger than we expect I see that Boston is widely thought of as a dove on these matters, but even the most dovish of the people at the Boston Fed now believe that the risks are more on the up side  Our own forecasts are now a bit more pessimistic than the Greenbook We think 1995 will have more overshooting on the employment side and a greater risk of inflation than is embodied in the Greenbook If this doesn't stray too far over the fence, we think that the tightening in the Greenbook is about the minimum that is needed [Laughter]   You handed me a challenge   Right It's not over until it's over   That is really true "
2366,1994-12-20," I have been concerned for some time about the thermostat issue that Governor Blinder raised We did quite a little work prior to this meeting to assure ourselves that at least as far as we could project, however deficient that projection might be, that the amount of tightening that is already in the pipeline is not sufficient We came out pretty strongly, all of us in Boston, with the conclusion that it is not sufficient So for us, it is not a question of ""whether;"" it is a question of ""when"" I would align myself with the people who think that if it is not a question of whether but a question of when, that sooner is better than later In that area I would align myself with Governor LaWare's remarks Don Kohn talked about the markets being fairly confident, but I think it is important to remember that what the market giveth the market can take away, too And along the lines of what you said, Mr Chairman, I too would be concerned that we might lose the credibility that has been hard won I view the 75 basis points we did at the last meeting in two ways as a 50 basis point make-up for actions that I think we should have taken earlier, and as 25 basis points into what we needed to do at that meeting So, I don't really regard that move as being as strong as some other people do All of that said, I'm very cognizant of the probability that people who are closer to the markets than we are in Boston have a view of the thin trading and whatever that is perhaps better taken than ours So I'd be willing to go ""B,""  -40-    12/20/94  but I'd feel fairly strongly that asymmetric should be the tone because I am concerned that we might see market movements, given the strength of the underlying economic data "
2417,1995-03-28," So move   Second   So move   Mr Chairman?   I don't have any objection, but this is an issue that has to have been discussed at tables like this around the world, given what has happened in Mexico, Argentina, and other countries I am wondering what rethinking is going on internationally with regard to how these sorts of things play out and what can be done   The moral hazard is extraordinary   I would think that whatever rethinking we do about what the Federal Reserve's response should be and how we view these things has to take place in the context of how the rest of the world is thinking about these issues   It's probably not right to think that we can dot every ""i"" and cross every ""t"" and have a set process that we follow in all circumstances But what you're suggesting would be helpful, I think, in terms of our understanding this better   Second   Peter, you mentioned that the dealers were surprised by the demand for Treasuries and that was what made the difference in terms of the price and yield moves in the Treasury market Clearly, people are not buying dollars to get into the Treasury market Has there been a big change in the ownership of these securities foreign vis-a-vis domestic? Or is it even appropriate to ask that?   It's not big enough to affect the Treasury market   Second   Second "
2418,1995-03-28," Both the statistical indicators and our informal contacts suggest that the pace of expansion is slowing in the First District Since we never got into an expansionary phase to begin with, this is not being met with great joy around the District Payroll employment in the region grew a little more slowly at the end of 1994 than it had earlier in the year and then dropped in January Help-wanted advertising dropped At the same time, our retail contacts, which are really quite a diverse set, were almost unanimous in reporting that sales were flat to down in both January and February Some attributed the disappointing performance to the weather; again, we didn't have much snow this year But there was general agreement that the regional economy is slowing On the manufacturing side, our contacts are more positive than the retailers That has been the general pattern for the last several months A majority of our contacts reported increases over the year ranging from quite modest to fairly strong--in the range of 30 percent or so But there are some notable areas of weakness aircraft parts, medical equipment, and potentially the small volume of manufacturing in our area that relates to the auto industry The price picture remains as before Prices are generally stable but there are major exceptions in the areas of paper, plastics, and leather in particular Residential construction has slowed in our region as it apparently has elsewhere, but the potential for nonresidential construction is solid, both as we see it happening right now and in the future Vacancy rates in Boston are now about 10 percent, which is a level that, at least earlier in the 1990s, nobody predicted would happen over the next 10 years It may well be that we will see new office construction soon--if not in downtown Boston, then on the circumferential highways of 128 and 495 By way of contrast--and New England has really been an area of contrasts throughout this recovery--Hartford vacancy rates are in the mid-20 percent range and still rising  Two major items of economic interest have dominated the regional news The first of these is the report of the commission on military base closings--the defense industry in the New England region is about 1 in 10 jobs--and the second is the proposed Fleet-Shawmut merger Hanscomb Air Force Base, which is in eastern Massachusetts, was not on the closing list to the great relief of many in Massachusetts If the initial recommendations are approved and Hanscomb continues in operation, it will add slightly to jobs in the region rather than take away something like 11,000 jobs The Fleet- Shawmut merger has prompted at least two state attorneys general to threaten some sort of action--we are not really sure what--over the loss of jobs as a result of efficiency measures expected after the merger So far, Connecticut appears to have negotiated a deal to keep certain jobs that would otherwise have been cut, and I am sure Massachusetts has this in mind as well We have not seen a draft application, which I think is being held up because of the complexity of some of the competitive issues involved in this merger  Turning to the Greenbook, I must say that I have some concerns along the lines that Bob Parry was suggesting We find ourselves in agreement with the basic GDP growth rates shown in the  -21-    3/28/95  baseline forecast But when we use these growth rates, our own projections of unemployment are slightly lower than the Greenbook's and our estimates of inflation growth are a bit higher More importantly, we don't see the level of inflation stabilizing next year I know there is a tradeoff in terms of the impact from the external sector, but we don't see that level of stability in terms of rates of inflation growth in 1996 We see a gradual uptick, which is consistent with our projections of unemployment We believe that the core trend is rising, which is discussed in the Greenbook Therefore, we think and maybe others believe as well, that there is a bit of upside risk in the degree of inflationary pressure in the baseline forecast, particularly as we take it out through 1996 "
2419,1995-03-28," Don, do you also think that 25 basis point changes could be implemented, as they were in the beginning, decoupled from the discount rate?   Yes   Right   Unlike, I think, many of the other people who have spoken already, I did not come to this meeting with a predisposition in favor of staying pat Rather, most of the work we have done, and most of the people I have talked to, suggested that further interest rate increases were necessary to keep inflation in check and deal with the kind of capacity constraints, particularly on the labor market side, that are being forecast both by us and by private sector forecasters My own bias would be to tighten sooner rather than later because I think that ends up making for a better situation overall Increasing interest rates at this time does not seem to be the main thrust of the argument here I can certainly buy into the argument that it doesn't matter whether we do it at this meeting, or at another meeting, or in between My own preference, however, would be to indicate that the Committee would be more inclined to increase interest rates in the future rather than to leave them pat, or possibly decrease them, because I think that the trends in inflation over the longer run are not what I would prefer  With that in mind, when we discussed our stance toward announcing decisions after meetings, we did discuss the possibility that when there was no change, we might want to communicate more than that we just left the room That is a possibility that does not require us to wait eight weeks, although it does run the risk of what President Jordan referred to as the impossibility of saying anything right But it is at least a possibility that we could mention something in our discussion of this meeting that was a little more explanatory or a little bit more on the side of being concerned about the upside potential for inflation in whatever we release after this meeting After saying all that, I guess it should come as no surprise that I would be in favor of an asymmetric directive I really do think that there is more room to move interest rates up before we stop doing so "
2471,1995-05-23, So move   He can take it   Second 
2472,1995-05-23," Absent supply shocks, Mike, and absent a real contractionary effect from fiscal policy, I would like to talk a little about your inflation forecast and the idea that you believe the risks are fairly evenly balanced around the forecast--at least that is my understanding of what you said In particular, I was drawn to the fact that the ECI is on a slight upward trend relative to the moderation of the core CPI and that the forecast stays at the low end of most people's assessment of the NAIRU range Where do you see this in 1996? Do you still see the risks as pretty well balanced around this inflation forecast by the end of 1996? I know that is looking further out and we could perhaps be reaching some cyclical downturn or whatever that would have other effects on inflation I would like an assessment of what you think the risks are in 1996   Yes   Thank you   Economic activity in the First District is growing at a very modest pace Payroll employment in most of the major industries in the District is little changed since the end of 1994 Services employment in particular seems to have lost the buoyancy of last year, but it is too soon really to tell whether this slowing reflects a seasonal blip or a more fundamental change In some ways we are happy to see the hospital industry shedding jobs, but for most individual services industries the monthly data are just simply too erratic to draw many conclusions at this point Unlike services, manufacturing employment in New England has been in a secular decline, so stability constitutes relatively good performance In general the old-time industries such as metals, rubber, and plastics, and in particular paper are faring better than high-tech industries, which in New England have a large defense component  Anecdotal evidence tends to support the statistical picture Recent retail sales have been disappointing and expectations are lackluster Furniture stores are especially anxious Manufacturing results were more positive, but the pace of demand has slowed since last year First District companies express some relief that auto- related demand has not fallen more in fact than it has Overseas sales are said to be benefiting from the weaker dollar, and in particular some of our software companies are experiencing upticks in sales as a result of the decline of the dollar Housing construction is actually holding up a little better in New England than in the nation as a whole Sales of existing homes in the first quarter are about the same as in the fourth quarter, though down a little from a year ago Some of our small business contacts report that credit is widely available, with numerous banks calling in search of new lending opportunities Markets are still quite competitive for most businesses, eliminating the degree to which cost increases in raw materials can be passed on and emphasizing the need for cost-cutting and restraints on wage increases  Generally, all the states in the region realize that New England's slow recovery has a large structural component as well as a cyclical component Much attention is being paid in all the states to the cost of doing business This has had the effect of bringing down egregiously high costs such as workers' compensation over the last couple of years Recently, there has even been some movement in the area of bank taxes in Massachusetts But this movement in the states also has increased the level of competition, both among the states in the region and between the states of New England in general and other regions of the country We are now seeing the remaining large employers in the region openly bargaining with legislatures for the tax and utility cost breaks that they believe are necessary and holding the threat of imminent moves, usually south and west, over the heads of governments Against the backdrop of general unease about jobs in particular and the economy in general, this is not contributing to an overall sense of confidence in the region Those changes that inspire real structural adjustments in the cost of doing  -16-    5/23/95  business in New England, and not just specific industry cost breaks, could be beneficial  On the national scene, I agree with President Broaddus and President McDonough that it is very tempting to believe the Greenbook It does describe in the baseline forecast the perfect definition of a soft landing, and I sincerely hope that the staff is right However, we do remain skeptical--along the lines that President Broaddus ended up with and President McDonough described--that inflation, as measured by the core CPI, can remain so well behaved in 1996 after a relatively small blip in 1995 I hope that President Forrestal is right that inflationary trends are simply cyclical and are not showing some wayward long-term uptick here But I am skeptical about whether that is true and whether we are just seeing a pause now rather than a somewhat more permanent downward shift in demand We could see things heat up toward the end of the year, with an untoward impact on inflation "
2473,1995-05-23," Yes, it is closer to 6  -29-    5/23/95   I, too, am in agreement with your proposal, Mr Chairman There are a couple of things that I think we need to be concerned about First, where are the uncertainties? You have talked a bit about that And secondly, what are the costs of being wrong in either direction even if the uncertainties are more or less balanced? At this point, I think the risks are reasonably balanced But inflation could be higher than the Greenbook projects, and my own  -33-    5/23/95  assessment is that the costs of being wrong on that side are a little higher than the costs of being wrong on the other side You indicated that you are inclined to the view that the uptick in inflation is cyclical; other people have mentioned that as well I am concerned about the possibility that it is not necessarily all cyclical If it isn't--and the Greenbook has built in an estimated 1/2 point increase in the core CPI rate in 1996 versus 1994--even recognizing that 1994 was pretty low, I keep asking myself whether we should be satisfied with that and whether that kind of outcome is something to be sanguine about going forward Are we certain enough that this is cyclical and not some uptick in the trend, or is it potentially an uptick in the trend if in fact we are experiencing a pause rather than a more permanent downturn in the growth of demand? So, I agree with your comments; I agree with your proposal I think I am just a little more nervous about the inflation prospects   Is cyclical   Somewhat or slightly?   So we use ""somewhat"" for both   Yes "
2522,1995-08-22," Will this be part of the transcript to be released five years from now? [Laughter]   Second   Peter, in the absence of financial difficulties in Japan, would the US Treasury on its own have supported actions in the market to increase the value of the dollar?   I'm not really asking that I am asking what the driving reason was behind these interventions Why did the US Treasury perceive that there was a problem with the foreign exchange value of the dollar independent of Japan, which is what Secretary Rubin implied in his comments after the intervention? Or was that a    8/22/95  way to make palatable to a variety of different constituencies something that was really done more to help the Japanese situation?   Yes, but there are two issues here First, there is a sort of long-term mindset about why you intervene You intervene to counteract disorderly markets, at least that's the received wisdom coming through the Fed Second, who really knows the right value of the dollar? There are winners and losers for any value of the dollar Why would we support strengthening in the absence of a real rout that was damaging to the financial markets?   But it seems to me that is a different position than the one that I at least have been led to understand is our position vis-a-vis defending the dollar, to use that old terminology But second, once the winners and losers have been decided over a period of a week after exchange market instability settles down, it looks as if we are taking actions well after the fact that are detrimental to the people who are seeing this new exchange rate level as not really all that bad In fact, our firms are more competitive in foreign markets   It's just an interesting change, at least to me, in perspective    8/22/95   So you think that this is an--   Right, and are they going to try to do this a few times to prove the point that intervention can be successful so that when we have a disorderly market and they do intervene it works? Is that the logic here? Or are they seeking some particular foreign exchange value for the dollar? "
2523,1995-08-22," Just following up on that question I was struck by the fortuitous timing that you have in the Greenbook of the    8/22/95  halt, if you will, of the one-time--although it seems to be a long time--decline in costs of benefits due to employer efforts and so forth I am referring to the coincidence of that with our coming to a point in the cycle where the unemployment rate is such that it should not be causing labor market pressures and pressures on prices You don't see an upturn in inflation after the downward impact of the drop in benefits costs subsides, which will occur sooner or later Could you talk a little about that timing? Obviously, you think it is probable because it is part of your forecast How do you come to that fortuitous timing?   We have this discussion once a month at our directors' table because our chairman is the president and chairman of New England Medical Center and because of the predominance of the health care industry in the First District For at least the last two years, we have tried to get a handle, both from questioning on our side and from concerns on his side, on how long business efforts to control costs will continue to have an impact in terms of cutting medical costs It just strikes me that they don't have a handle on it at all They are being pushed by market forces that have become extremely strong and unavoidable, at least in the First District I assume that is reflected nationwide   Thank you, Mr Chairman Overall, the New England economy can be characterized as moving sideways It is not declining as it did earlier in the spring and summer, but it is not moving up markedly either As in the past, there is considerable variation in employment growth among the states, with the northern states down through Massachusetts doing much better than the Rhode Island and Connecticut region In fact, I think I reported in the past that Connecticut had barely inched out of its recession lows Actually, even though the economy is not doing well there, it is doing better than Rhode Island, which is on a downward trend As an offset to this, unemployment rates in the region are below what they were a year ago, although there are some labor force participation issues in this assessment Consumer confidence has improved; price pressures are modest overall Things are, as I said, moving sideways  Looking at bank lending, our growth in bank loans had been below that of the nation as a whole We are now running at about the nation's rate of increase I think that is more reflective of the fact that bank lending nationwide has slowed and we have come into line with that I don't think much has changed in the First District  We don't have any large firms anymore that drive the First District economy When you look at it, there tend to be more similarities among firms of roughly equal size than there are among firms of different size within similar industry categories Our larger industries seem to be tremendously affected by downsizing, by defense industry contraction and all of that, and they tend to drive the headlines and some elements of consumer confidence The small industries tend to be where the growth in output and jobs is occurring We get very different impressions of what is going on when we look at the data, which tend to show relatively sluggish business activity, versus what we pick up anecdotally when we talk to business people We have a small business advisory council These people tell us that New England is booming Now, it may be that we selected the right people or the right people agreed to join our council They are finding it difficult to hire the workers that they need; they see price pressures that they can't pass on; they see a lot of competition; they see more economic growth than we do in the numbers for the District or what we read in the newspapers The latter probably reflect more of the impact of the large industries So, we are seeing something that people have commented on as a national trend People in New England like to think that things happening in New England precede what is going to happen in the nation That's really the dominance of small industries in terms of the economic pattern of the District  -13-    8/22/95  On the national side, we see the economy very much the way the Greenbook sees it If we were going to quibble, we would quibble about the optimism on the external side and we would quibble a bit about the downward trend in the inflation forecast I personally was very happy to see the revision in this Greenbook versus the last one in terms of the uptick in GDP for the remainder of the year We continue to believe that there are forces working in the economy that are going to produce more growth than the Committee certainly expected at the last meeting I was happy to see the Greenbook reflecting that this time In our view the Greenbook forecast--as you pointed out, Dave--seems the perfect definition of a soft landing This also led us to concerns about where the risks are and the probability of ever landing where the Greenbook is forecasting We evaluated the likelihood of that pretty much the same way you did We were struck, as you seem to be, by the apparent balance in those risks, even though the risks are sizable on either side and there isn't a high probability of hitting the forecast on the head So, we would assess the balancing of the risks the same way you do, and I think that is probably enough to say prior to our policy discussion   We take exception to the idea of an all-Ohio World Series [Laughter] "
2524,1995-08-22," Yes   As do I, Mr Chairman "
2582,1995-09-26," So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Well, like everyone else I think that the idea that price stability ought to be the long-term goal of the central bank is completely consistent with the contributions a central bank can make to economic growth over the longer run But the autopilot aspects of this legislation really worry me It may be that some of the language will permit us to finesse all of that, and the bill certainly would allow us to set the details rather than have written in law that we must report on a set of data that seems to be important at one point in time but may not be at another I think it is quite helpful to have some options in terms of the details in achieving this longer-run goal But I have some concerns on the opposite side from Tom Melzer Frankly, I think we have done a good job over the 1980s and the 1990s precisely because the institutional setup has allowed people of some wisdom, arguably less or even more from time to time, to take the right actions given a variety of circumstances that were impossible to know or to forecast at the beginning of the 1980s The idea of single-mindedly approaching something through several business cycles in a way that has some autopilot aspects to it gives me concern It may be that the language allows more flexibility than that and the reality will be less onerous than that, but it really concerns me   That is the concern that I had If you read the language in that paragraph absent the comments of the Congressional staffers, you do get the sense that we have this one- time transition period during which we could take these factors into account After that, it is like a cruising 747; we don't touch the controls Isn't that kind of language something totally unrealistic and unresponsive to the success that we have had over the last 10 or 15 years? It is hard to understand, given the success that almost everyone thinks that monetary policy has achieved, why we need this now   I am not suggesting that this one is not understandable in terms of its long-run intent   That's true, but this bill seems to have less ambiguity in the sense of that paragraph really referring to the transition period "
2583,1995-09-26," His teacher was an accountant!   That's why separation of duties is so important   This organization has no claim to be a primary dealer   Okay   Okay, that's good   You can get it back   Mr Chairman, you probably remember from the board meeting that you attended a week or two ago at the Boston Fed our characterization of the New England economy since the summer as a tale of two sections Overall, the region's jobs grew just about 08 percent during the year ending in July--that compares with national growth of better than 2 percent--but there were distinct differences between northern and southern New England The northern states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are all experiencing growth in employment, sometimes even in manufacturing jobs which is welcomed They have lower rates of unemployment and their employment levels have returned to or near their pre-recession peaks On the other hand, the southern states--Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island--have not returned to their pre-recession employment peaks and are not expected to do so anytime soon I must say, though, that job growth in Massachusetts is much stronger than in either Rhode Island or Connecticut Rhode Island in particular currently has a level of employment that is below that of a year ago and has lost jobs in each  -18-    9/26/95  of the last three months for which we have data The state is undisputably the biggest basket case in New England, which probably makes it the undisputed winner of that prize for the country as a whole Rhode Island is now edging out Connecticut, which up until recently was winning this contest In terms of job types, growth as in the past is largely in trade, services, and construction Defense industry cutbacks continue New England fared relatively well in the last round of base closings, losing only one major base and about 1,000 jobs, but the region overall lost 32 percent of its military base employment in the years 1989 to 1994 as compared with about half that rate for the nation as a whole  I am coming to believe that the anecdotes we hear when talking with business groups around the District are almost diametrically opposite the standard economic data that we get for the region as a whole Again, there may be some self-selection process that is going on here Two local business confidence indexes show marked improvement over recent data, though they are somewhat below their levels a year ago Our Beigebook contacts and members of our New England advisory council both report higher manufacturing sales than a year ago However, there is a dichotomy between healthy sales growth and sales prospects and indicators of future employment Business plans and actual sales have been upbeat, but expectations as to job growth are not Businesses apparently are willing to continue to try to succeed with a proportionately smaller work force than before, perhaps because of the effect of capital investments over the last two or three years In addition, many business executives-- representing small and large firms--continue to report an inability to raise prices even in the face of rising demand Competition remains too keen  Turning to District lending, I reported earlier that we had slower rates of loan growth in the First District than the country as a whole That situation has corrected itself, not because we have had faster credit growth in New England but because the national pace has slowed New England's rate of loan growth at its large banks was about 6 percent in the last quarter, about the same as the current rate for the nation as a whole, but the latter is down from a considerably stronger pace earlier  On the national scene, I don't find too much to take issue with in the Greenbook We could argue, given the projection for output, that unemployment might turn out a tick higher than the rate in the Greenbook We could question the projected rates of growth abroad, and I think Ted Truman reflected some concern on the down side with regard to foreign growth We could look at consumer durables and wonder whether the projections for slower auto sales in the Greenbook really will be offset by consumer buying in the housing area And while we don't know any more about inventories than anybody else, it is reasonable to be agnostic about any specific projection there However, while all of this does suggest some downside risk to the forecast, it really is nitpicking In the context of a fairly low rate of unemployment and the impetus that could come from financial markets, the fact that there may be some downside risk in some of these factors does seem to us to hold out the promise of economic balance moving forward--that is, a tendency for the various factors to offset one another  -19-    In sum, our view is that the data reflect a mixed bag of economic information and that is probably just what we would hope for to keep us on target with moderate growth, low unemployment, and relatively low inflation Risks to the forecast seem balanced or perhaps slightly tilted to the down side But if downside risks emerge, they can be easily addressed For now, economic conditions seem pretty good and, given all the uncertainties, I at least am drawn to the idea that they may be about as good as we are going to get   Wooster "
2584,1995-09-26," I, too, support your conclusion and the reasons that you gave for it As I said earlier, I am drawn to the view that the economy is doing well both currently and prospectively So in terms of prescriptions about policy, I look to the old physicians' oath of ""do no harm"" and look at ""A"", ""B"", and ""C"" as to where the harm would be done if we did anything right now I think it would be more harmful right now to raise rates than to lower them Lowering them may be the next action, but I agree with the timing points that you made I don't think that waiting right now, in view of everything that is happening on the fiscal side, prejudges whether or not we would wait in the future if the budget debates really drag out So, I am comfortable with using timing as an argument right now, although I do agree that we should not have our hands tied at all as to future monetary policy actions  Finally, I would quote some people with whom I ate breakfast yesterday Their advice with regard to monetary policy was ""Don't just move, stand there"" "
2644,1995-11-15," So move   So move   I have a couple of questions On the Japanese funding situation, I know that all this planning is being done within the normal framework of Desk operations I don't know about the rest of you, but the headlines in The New York Times about this special funding arrangement hit me as a surprise when I read them at 730 one morning If there is going to be a briefing of Congress, I wonder whether the Committee also could be briefed It's not that we are going to say anything necessarily; it's just to make us feel a little bit in the loop when these things come out in the press   Do we have these informal understandings with other central banks, other than the Bank of Japan, that if they run into dollar or liquidity problems (a) their banks are not to come to us and (b) there may be some way in which we can, within the normal procedures, help them with their funding?   Oh yes    11/15/95   I totally agree and I certainly understand what you are talking about The implication that we would do things after hours, after the securities wire closes and all of that, did seem to me to be a move that it would have been interesting at least to know about   The second question that I had was on the new procedure relating to your operations in coupon issues Peter, is it your intention over this three- or four-day period, for however long you might spread your coupon pass, to pick certain portions of the yield curve on any given day as opposed to preselecting from a number of points on the yield curve?   And you don't think that will have any disruptive effects on that given day?   Is it part of your plan to discuss this with major market participants outside of New York?   Right    11/15/95   It might be useful to talk to Fidelity among others   Beyond the technical issues, aren't we dealing with a moral hazard situation in the sense that if we show ourselves ready to close all the gaps when these situations occur, the chance of their happening with greater frequency increases? I think it's entirely appropriate to come at it from the point of view of financial stability The only question I have is whether being willing to use matured securities as collateral and to do repo operations in matured securities says that we are willing to accept the moral hazard up to a certain point where we, arguably, need to do that for the sake of stability in the markets and financial stability for the country as a whole, but beyond that we will not go I think that's a perfectly appropriate message to send and position to take, but I think that it's not just on the outright operations that we run the risk of running counter to a high principle We run that risk doing anything with these matured securities I think what Peter has proposed is defensible, but I don't think we take ourselves out of the arena of the problems that he mentioned simply by drawing a line and not doing coupon passes in matured securities "
2645,1995-11-15," For some time now, I have been asking people in Boston if we can learn anything about the current situation or be better informed about the current situation by looking at the late 1980s experience and seeing how long we were below our estimate of the NAIRU at that point before inflation started to accelerate They keep telling me that we are nowhere near as far below the NAIRU now as we were then, and we were that way for a longer period of time in that period Given the recent small uptick in hourly compensation and where we are with the unemployment rate, I don't debate your choice of a new NAIRU I think it's closer to what we had been thinking it was But I just wonder whether prospectively we are starting to see something like what we saw in the late '80s Or are you really thinking of this as just minor noise here?   You have!   Mr Chairman, New England continues its gradual expansion from the trough of the recession, but recent data suggest that even the moderate growth pace of earlier this year has slowed a bit As usual there is good news and bad news--or at least downbeat news Let me cover the downbeat first and finish on a more hopeful note  During the first eight months of 1995, New England added jobs at only about a third the pace of the prior two years National job growth has slowed in recent months, but New England's decline has been sharper The region had been adding jobs at about two-thirds the national pace since the recession ended, but recent data show that our job growth has slowed to about half the pace for the nation as a whole Among the states, Rhode Island maintains its ranking as the basket case, with employment continuing to be below that of the year before Connecticut is barely growing at all, while the remaining states have had, at least in New England terms, relatively healthy job growth Manufacturing employment continues to shrink, but the pace of contraction has slowed a bit The cause of the recent regional employment slowdown therefore lies outside manufacturing; employment growth in finance, government, and transportation has come to a relative standstill I should note that despite the trend to smaller government, the share of government in the employment pie in New England is expected to grow This is because the Bureau of Labor Statistics now classifies Indian-run casinos as ""other local government"" [Laughter] One wonders about this! Without casino- related job growth, Connecticut clearly would have continued to be our  -27-    11/15/95  basket case, because that is where most of Connecticut's job growth has come from Despite this, unemployment remains relatively low in New England at least in part because of weak labor force growth and outmigration Recent estimates show that the labor force actually has shrunk by about 200,000 since the recession ended while the number of establishment jobs has expanded by about 325,000 We maintain a decent unemployment rate but largely because the labor force is shrinking Adding to the downbeat news from local labor markets is considerable softness in retail sales This undoubtedly reflects weak consumer confidence, which is below year-earlier levels  Now to turn to a little hope There are bright spots in New England High-tech businesses are booming, at least certain kinds of high-tech businesses So much so that one contact said his company was constrained not by demand but by a relative shortage of silicon wafers and glass yarn Software designers are in short supply, and the industry itself is beginning to regard 25 to 30 percent growth rates as disappointing A contact at a major software company located both in California and New England said he will be moving some jobs to Massachusetts because shortages are even worse in California Wages for these workers have risen only a modest 4 to 5 percent, however, due in large part to the value of stock incentive programs that are being used increasingly to reward highly paid workers Tourism has been another bright spot, with significant gains over even last year's strong performance  Finally, I don't know if this is hopeful or not, but loan growth at large District banks has slowed considerably from its earlier pace It had been slower than for the nation as a whole throughout the recovery Most of this weakness lies in commercial and industrial loans, and some of this is due to uneasiness about large bank mergers, which we think have redirected some business to smaller banks in the District  Turning to the national scene, we had a rather healthy internal debate among the economists on my staff It's a serious debate because I gather money has been wagered on what the direction of the Committee's next move ought to be, up or down The fact that we can make good arguments for both positions, I think, underscores the Bank's general agreement with the Greenbook forecast As I see it, that forecast shows a fairly good outcome with relatively balanced risks Actually, it was a bit more upbeat than I had expected, possibly because the third-quarter numbers have been such a surprise In that regard, I think that the foreign growth numbers projected by the staff may be overly optimistic, and I really don't know what to believe about the numbers associated with the federal budget crisis Your crystal ball is probably as good as any on that one On the other hand, I really do think that the impetus provided by low interest rates and booming financial markets, combined with where we are in terms of the unemployment rate, does play out in the direction of an upside risk, and I would buy into a few of the concerns that President Parry mentioned in his comments I am concerned that we may not continue to be successful in keeping inflation at the projected 3 percent rate "
2646,1995-11-15," I, too, agree with your overall policy position, Mr Chairman I also agree with the concept of keeping the directive symmetric I do see the risks as being reasonably balanced, not so tilted to the down side as some believe I agree that we should not have our hands tied by the current and prospective debt impasse on the part of the federal government, although I wonder how this will play out going into the future If even by the next meeting we were to see--and that may be unlikely--an unexpected acceleration of growth, something that might make us want to change interest rates by raising them rather than lowering them, I wonder how an asymmetric directive toward ease would play out in that environment Whether or not that scenario turns out to be the case, I wonder if we will find that monetary policy will be somewhat hampered if the budget negotiations drag on for a period of time I hope they won't   One would think so   Yes "
2695,1995-12-19," Just a couple of factual questions The $650 million is from the regular swap line or from the temporary one that was part of the program to help Mexico last year?   Is it a function of our regular swap program that we are repaid by the Department of the Treasury?   The Treasury would repay us, if necessary, under either program on any part of the $6 billion?   I just wanted to understand that Secondly, the North American Framework Agreement (NAFA) was to provide a forum, according to footnote 2 in your memo, for more regular consultations on economic and financial developments Has that worked?   Combining that with the additional transparency that the IMF obtained from the Mexicans in terms of some of their data reporting, do we feel that we would not have been in the situation that we seemed to be in earlier in terms of our knowledge of how much their reserves were being depleted?   It is 1994 that I was getting at   I wasn't so concerned about whether the market knew I was more concerned about whether we know in a timely way   A final question There is an implication in your memo that while we will approve this renewal, we won't necessarily be receptive to letting them use this swap arrangement for a number of different reasons Is that a wrong implication to draw from this memo?   So they don't expect to use the swap facility either   Yes   The sole roadblock is this certification issue? "
2696,1995-12-19," Mr Chairman, slow growth continues in New England Nonfarm employment grew for the third straight month, although the overall gain was quite small In total, the region's job count was up only slightly less than 1 percent over the previous year as compared with nearly 3 times that rate of growth over the 12 months prior to that The region's unemployment rate declined to a level well below the national rate, but consumers remained wary and uncertain Real wage growth has been negative Consumer confidence dropped, especially in the component of that measure that looks at expectations Retailers have felt this pressure As one of our Beigebook contacts put it, he could not explain the fits and starts that have characterized the retail market this fall Business is horrible one week and very strong the next On a more upbeat note, manufacturing contacts report solid recent sales, with demand increasing for machine tools and industrial equipment, computer and electronics products, health care supplies, and a range of building  -13-    12/19/95  products and equipment Input prices have stabilized somewhat, and continued competitive pressures have precluded increases in output prices Manufacturing jobs continue to decline, but employees are getting hard to find for some job vacancies that call for especially high technical skills The market for residential real estate is neither good nor bad Expectations of next spring's seasonal pickup are positive, given this year's decline in interest rates In fact, if rates go any lower we could see a mini surge, at least in the three northern states and in Massachusetts where markets are stronger Some commercial building is under way, though the improvement is spotty and confined to eastern Massachusetts Bank lending in the District remains slower than that of the nation as a whole, with negative growth in commercial and industrial loans most recently Consumer loan growth is somewhat erratic but generally in line with, if not stronger than, the national pace  Finally, while the economic climate is tepid, if not cool, we are going to witness a very hot senatorial race Bill Weld is taking on John Kerry for his Senate seat, a contest that has been labeled by such far flung media as The Economist as the battle of the blue bloods This may augur well for Massachusetts at least until the election As an example, since a mill burned down in Lawrence recently, to insure that displaced workers receive as much aid as possible Their efforts have paid off according to with workers being sure they can survive until the new facility is completed   In some sense, yes! Turning to the national scene, we are very much in agreement with the Greenbook scenario I must say that I have a lot of sympathy for the 4 or 5 points that Mike Prell mentioned as potential sources, if you will, of upside risks to the forecast We looked at some of those and thought that there is some upside risk here but also some downside risk Overall, though, we thought that the risks were reasonably balanced And given where we are in terms of the tightness of labor markets and the basic underlying strength of economic growth that the Greenbook mentioned and Mike highlighted and that we also see in our forecast, this balance of risk looks pretty good and the overall forecast looks pretty good So, we don't have much to argue about with your take on the national scene, Mike "
2697,1995-12-19," I think you have laid out an extraordinarily intriguing and interesting scenario When preparing for this meeting and looking at the forces in the economy, our use of a traditional Keynesian framework to evaluate the Greenbook forecast led us to agree with that forecast--the patterns of good solid growth, stable inflation rates, low unemployment and so forth--and we saw the risks to that forecast as being relatively balanced However, when one begins to think about the changing framework--that is, the NAIRU being lower, using that as convenient terminology, or the economy's potential being higher and perhaps providing a little more room for growth without higher inflation if that new environment has materialized--then it is quite tempting to think of the current level of real interest rates as too high to promote the projected levels of growth The new framework suggests some additional room to probe on the up side or the down side, however one wants to look at it, and possibly to get more growth out of the economy at given levels of inflation or even declining rates of inflation I would like to believe that such a new world is here and that there is some evidence, given the reactions of wages and so forth, that says it is here However, I don't think the evidence is strong enough yet to be really persuasive  Reflecting on your comments about the potential bubble in the bond and stock markets, Mr Chairman, it is hard for me to believe that real interest rates are too high It is also hard for me to think about easing credit in the face of the kinds of financial markets that we have right now The costs of being wrong, both in terms of the stock and bond market bubbles and in terms of capacity constraints and so on if the world has not changed, clearly are much higher if upside risks are realized as opposed to downside risks  So my basic inclination would be not to change policy at this meeting, but I can't debate 25 basis points We talk about having purchased insurance against downside risks in July My attitude at this point would be not to change policy in the sense that that purchases insurance against upside risks All that said, I don't think I will dissent over 25 basis points, but I think there are risks here and the risks pertain to whether or not we have that new world you described sufficiently in hand   I'm glad you do, Gary! [Laughter] "
2740,1996-03-26," Mr Chairman, the New England economy is looking more and more like the national economy, even better in a couple of respects The small revision in how we are looking at things comes about as a result of changes in the benchmarks for payroll data, which other people have commented on The changes have shown New England's rate of growth over the past year to have been about the same as that for the nation Before that, we thought our regional economy was lagging The picture may change a bit when the national figures are revised this summer, and New England still has not recovered all the jobs it lost during the recession Nonetheless, the latter episode is beginning to look more and more like a rather severe, one-time negative shock rather than the beginning of a new, slow-growth regime New England's recent growth, while modest, reflects a continuation of longer-term trends in each of the states New Hampshire is enjoying the strongest growth Connecticut continues to lag behind the region while Rhode Island--the basket case as I have referred to it in a couple of presentations over the last several months--now appears to have been holding its own at least with regard to job formation over the past year Unemployment in the region is low, only 5 percent for the region as a whole, with New Hampshire now down to 3 percent  -9-    3/26/96  Surprisingly, in view of the low unemployment, hourly earnings are increasing at an annual rate of only about 2 percent compared to 3 percent for the country as a whole Anecdotally, however, our contacts indicate that there is a little more wage pressure than these numbers would suggest Most of them are planning wage increases in the 3 to 5 percent range, where in prior months they had been contemplating 2 to 4 percent One contact observed that people are no longer comfortable with wage increases covering inflation, and several others have commented on their difficulty in finding highly skilled computer workers and especially software engineers, for which there is a crying need Unfortunately, laid-off defense workers are not always seen as suitable for seemingly comparable civilian openings  Defense cuts continue to be a drag on the New England economy, with the region experiencing larger cuts in defense-related employment than the country as a whole The pace of these cuts is slowing, however, and over the next several years we believe the fallout in defense employment should be mild in the region Despite defense cutbacks, total manufacturing employment has fallen less in New England in the past year than in the nation No areas of strength stand out Rather, employment seems to be increasing slightly in a variety of traditional industries such as lumber, metals, food, and paper and to be stabilizing in nondefense high-tech industries Moreover, conversations with a variety of manufacturers suggest that 1996 is likely to be similar to 1995 Business is not great, but a number of contacts describe new orders as pretty good or decent Indeed, some companies that pared employment in 1995 are now planning modest increases in staff, and several contacts report efforts to increase prices of final goods  Retailers continue to worry about competitive pressures and consumer anxieties However, several contacts with stores in other regions observed that their 1996 results have been better in New England Moreover, some of those who complained most bitterly in the past now report that their 1995 profits were up rather substantially rather than down as they had suspected  Turning to the national scene, we agree with the Greenbook's assessment that the likely outcome for the next year or so is GDP growth at a rate near potential, with unemployment relatively unchanged, and some rather modest upward pressure on wages and prices While I agree that the risks to this forecast seem balanced right now, there may be some reasons to believe that it is marginally subject to surprise on the down side That is especially because it includes very optimistic projections for both residential investment and consumer durables, at least when compared with several other forecasts, and because of the upward trend in interest rates, particularly since the employment report released in early March I would view the possibility that the interest-sensitive sectors may be weaker as a potentially moderating influence on the upward tick, albeit small, in inflation that is incorporated in the forecast If in fact we do see a March employment report that is anywhere close to being as strong as the numbers we saw for February, I think we would have to take rather decisive steps at that point to keep the expected uptick in inflation from becoming a surge "
2741,1996-03-26," I also agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman I would like to reflect a little on your comments about reaching the end of the business cycle expansion sooner or later Obviously, that will happen The concern I would have is that we might experience a pattern somewhat like the late 1980s when prior to the end of the expansion phase of the business cycle, we had a surge in inflation that we had to tamp down, thus feeding into the end of the business expansion and adding to the depth of the recession I am a little nervous about that possibility at this point and concerned that we should, on assessing the data as we go forward, be vigilant on the side of keeping interest rates and monetary policy restrictive  -26-    3/26/96  enough to prevent a surge in inflation that ultimately would tend to shorten rather than extend the growth phase of the business cycle "
2790,1996-05-21," There was a wonderful quote by Ed Boehne in the research paper that we got on opportunistic strategies It went along these lines Well, we are where we are; sooner or later we will have a recession; we don't want a recession; but if we can work things in a way that takes advantage of the inroads that we have made against inflation and hold the line to the next cycle, then we will achieve a pattern of every cycle having lower rates of inflation than the previous cycle, even at the cycle peaks To me that is the operative definition of an opportunistic strategy, but it raises the issue of whether or not we can sit down and say, okay, by the year 2000 I anticipate that we will have had at least one recession and have made the same inroads into inflation that we made in the last recession Therefore, my goal for the year 2000 is 2 percent inflation rather than 3 percent I find that level of precision difficult to deal with We need to have this discussion about what we mean by price stability Does a price stability goal mean holding the line where we are and taking advantage of opportunities to get inflation lower, or does it mean some forward-looking policy to drive inflation down with all that implies about how we measure it There are a lot of issues having to do with what are we talking about when we discuss inflation measures We know there are a lot of problems with the CPI What number are we going to look at when we say we have achieved victory? It's only part of the discussion, but I think we need to have it I don't know whether all of us giving you a specific number incorporating a lot of different assumptions in ""X"" year has to be the way we start We need to start talking about this, though   All the major unresolved issues of monetary policy in one meeting? Swaps and price stability? "
2791,1996-05-21," Mike, turning from this supply shock to the underlying demand, you did mention a number of factors that you put into your projections that acted to damp demand I was struck by how stable unemployment stays through 1997, granted that you are projecting growth that is a little higher than in 1995 Could you talk a little more about the unemployment and labor market side?   Maybe it's just the tone of the Greenbook, but given the feel of the underlying strength of demand in the Greenbook I was surprised to see this stability   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in New England are quite favorable, though many of our business contacts describe the situation as continuing to be highly competitive and tough Employment grew at a rate of about 1-1/2 percent last year and in the first quarter of 1996, slightly less than the pace for the nation but consistent with New England's long-term experience The regional unemployment rate was 47 percent in April, with New Hampshire and Vermont enjoying rates below 4 percent We do not think that this is an indicator that wages are about to take off in the First District, however, since in growth periods New England typically has an unemployment rate below the nation's Our contacts with regional businesses are generally reassuring on this score Wage increases of 2 to 3 percent are the norm, although a few companies are  -11-    5/21/96  going to be more generous Anecdotally, we continue to hear stories of severe labor shortages, mostly for software specialists At the Bank, we have been trying to hire data communications people, for example It is not just a question of money These specialists would rather work for a consultant, or even as temporary employees, to get flexibility and to ensure that their skills stay on the cutting edge Materials and vendor prices are flat, and retailers are holding the line on customer prices A few manufacturers have succeeded, however, in raising their prices by modest amounts  The retail situation in New England is very competitive, making it difficult to discern underlying economic trends Upscale stores are doing well, but discounters are struggling Their sales are down from a year ago Among manufacturers, revenues are continuing to grow at a fairly good rate Business is especially good for manufacturers of capital goods, particularly those producing traditional products such as industrial machinery and equipment used in construction and high-tech companies producing computer networking and microelectronics products Concern was expressed about signs of slowing in the semiconductor business, as others have mentioned, although the correction is expected to be temporary In addition, several of our manufacturing contacts think their inventories are a bit on the high side despite generally good sales Retail contacts in contrast believe that they have their inventories under control  Loan growth in the First District continues to be slower than for the nation as a whole, and our banking contacts report that the competition to make loans is fierce Banks indicate that they are not lowering standards so much as they are relaxing terms--for example, by not requiring personal guarantees I question whether terms and standards really overlap and how one can distinguish between the two I think this is an issue for some of the lending officer reports that we get  On the national scene, I remain convinced that the risks have tilted substantially to the up side As the Greenbook points out rather forcefully, sources of economic weakness and potential restraints on the fairly solid pattern of current economic growth seem few On the other hand, threats to the rather benign run of price data that we have experienced seem significant I believe these may stem more from inherent demand than from supply shocks in food and energy Those shocks could be short-lived and flow through only to a moderate extent to the general price level However, the impetus from tight labor markets, continued income growth, consumer durable spending, business investment, housing, and the stock market rally could be considerable The issue for me now is not the direction of the next move but when we make it "
2792,1996-05-21," I am going to continue the revolt of the nonvoters! [Laughter] As I indicated before, I think we clearly have moved from a period of balanced risks to risks on the up side The risks of increasing rates of inflation seem significant both from supply shocks and from demand factors It may be that rising long- term interest rates will act to damp activity sufficiently, but the ebullience of the stock market and the continuing strength of such indicators as housing and consumer spending suggest that credit and funding are both available and not overly costly In my view, the issue now is how forward-looking monetary policy should be I have argued, and I continue to believe, that the costs of being wrong on the up side and letting inflation get out of hand are greater than being wrong on the down side We need to act before we see the ""whites of the eyes"" of inflation, as you have argued, Mr Chairman I am also worried now that moving later in the year might be more difficult for a number of reasons, and that moving later than that might require a more significant move than we would otherwise need So, for me the questions are how much to do and when to do it In that regard, I want to piggyback on the insurance argument We did 25 basis points in January We thought things were quite slow at that point Hindsight now shows that they were not as slow as we thought I would reverse the insurance policy I would move the funds rate up 25 basis points, and I would do it now At a minimum, I agree with President Hoenig that the directive should be asymmetric  -33-    5/21/96 "
2844,1996-08-20," My memory on the subject of strikes is short because I have not been coming to these meetings for very long, but I was struck by the number of times the notion of a ""strike"" appeared as a factor underlying the analysis in the Greenbook, particularly in Part II There were references to strikes that had just ended and to the potential for a strike in the auto industry I am wondering  -8-    8/20/96  whether the principal effect of strikes is not so much their near-term impact on economic activity or inflation but rather their longer-term impact on people's perceptions of the relative power of labor unions versus management despite the decline of membership in labor unions in this country It's an impact that is occurring in an environment in which there seems to be a great deal of concern about whether Wall Street, shareholders, and management are enriching themselves at the expense of workers' standards of living So, I am wondering whether, even if a strike does not have an immediate inflationary impact, its potential to affect even nonunion relationships between labor and management may be significant going forward   Yes But just the fact that a strike occurred, I think, is something that is--   Yes, but I think that was in an environment in which people generally felt that unions were detrimental to the overall competitiveness of US industry They may still feel that way, but I think there is much more of a feeling now that the wage earner is the one who is bearing the brunt of efforts to improve US competitiveness   Mr Chairman, while the economy may be slowing somewhat nationally, that is a bit hard to see in New England right now Job growth is steady, unemployment rates in the region are low-- a full percentage point below the nation--and pressures in the job markets are growing as employers find it hard to hire skilled and in some cases even clerical workers Wage increases are picking up, with increases of at least 3 percent the norm, and reports of up to 5 percent are not uncommon However, inflation concerns remain low with the expectation that wage increases will be offset by productivity increases Manufacturing conditions have improved While jobs in this sector continue to decline, New England's rate of decline is now marginally less than that for the country as a whole By some estimates, the manufacturing job picture is better now than it has been since the late 1980s Our contacts in the manufacturing sector are upbeat overall, with areas of particular strength noted in medical supplies, furniture, and construction-related products Construction jobs also have grown at a good clip, in part reflecting an increased pace of activity in the construction of Boston's Central Artery project, which in nominal dollars is the most expensive highway project ever undertaken in this country Residential construction has picked up as well At least in the western suburbs of Boston, much of this construction involves very high-end, high-priced single-family homes The commercial real estate markets are vibrant in many areas There has been virtually no new construction, and with growing economic activity, conditions are markedly improved, especially in Boston This is true also in Portland, Maine and in suburban Rhode Island as well as in a number of other suburban locations around the District Retailing remains highly competitive with disappointing results for many Tourism has been very strong, with a major influx of foreign visitors  -17-    8/20/96  District loan growth, as reflected in the data that we get from five large banks that report monthly, continues to decline as it has throughout 1996 However, this trend largely reflects the balance sheet restructuring that has been going on at Fleet since the Shawmut and the Nat West mergers Officials at Fleet have indicated that their balance sheet adjustments are over Loan data for the District as a whole, which tends to be heavily dominated by three or four institutions, may soon start to reflect trends associated with economic rather than acquisition activity  Turning to the national scene, we agree with the Greenbook's assessment that the expansion will slow, possibly to potential, through the rest of the year We also agree that the sources of the slowdown lie in domestic demand, especially in the interest-sensitive sectors of residential construction, consumer durables, and business fixed investment We are not quite as optimistic as we usually are about the sources of foreign growth that are shown in the Greenbook We wonder, however, whether there isn't a certain amount of risk, and I think Mike addressed this, that GDP growth will be stronger than is reflected in the Greenbook in light of the recent declines in long- term interest rates, manageable levels of business debt, recent moderation in the growth of consumer debt, the unknowable effects of an inventory bounceback that may be even larger than is anticipated in the Greenbook, and the continuation of rather buoyant equity markets Moreover, the risks that wage cost increases will push overall inflation higher seem even greater than the risks that GDP growth will be greater than we expect Given the overall credibility of the Greenbook forecast, we find possible and certainly credible the assumption that price increases will be moderated by productivity improvements at this point in the business cycle or by shrinking profit margins, but we wonder whether there isn't a good deal of risk in this area Thus, we believe the inflation situation as measured by the core CPI is likely to be marginally worse than is forecast in the Greenbook if no adjustments are made to policy   By using these cards, small companies can offset considerable expenses that they otherwise may have For example, a small business may previously have had credit cards that were being charged to the company's account and may have incurred sizable clerical costs to reconcile the charges and various business expenses Diners Club, for example, will now give all of a small firm's employees a credit card against the employees' own credit The firm avoids the need to reconcile charges And if there are enough employee names on the list, the firm does not have to pay the first year's billing costs, and it can switch to another card and do that fairly easily "
2845,1996-08-20," I ask myself, what are we doing here? [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) That's a pretty good question Do you have an answer?   Yes, I have an answer to that We are trying to keep the economy on track We are trying to keep inflation low so as to provide the best atmosphere for economic growth This is not easy to do, and we have not always been very successful at it But we have been more successful over the last 10 years and particularly over the last 5 years than we had been in earlier years Part of that is because we have tried to put an emphasis on being forward-looking Looking back over the long run, it seems to me that most of the times when we could with 20/20 hindsight characterize the Fed as having made an error, it was mostly on the side of waiting too long, as Don Kohn has mentioned, and then having to move harder than we would have had to otherwise, clamping down and feeding into the business cycle I probably have the name of this philosopher wrong but I think it was  -41-    8/20/96  Santayana who said that ""those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it""   Good, I am glad   You are older and wiser than I am, Mr Chairman! Now, it may be that the experience of the last 8 to 10 quarters is a signal that the economy is changing But we are starting to see wage pressures and we are starting to see a flattening out, if not an upturn, in most of the broad measures of inflation In this environment, I do not think we can be quite as sanguine as many have suggested I think we need to be very humble about our forecasts of the GDP slowdown being enough to guide this rather large and cumbersome plane totally on instruments without human intervention, at least at this point in time I think we need a course correction I think we need to step in and start steering this economy a little bit Now, it seems to me that if, in the expectation that the expansion would be slower, we adjusted policy in 25 basis point increments, then we could start to steer it against an upside threat in small increments as well It might be that the markets will overreact, but I think that overreaction would be short-lived I do not necessarily believe that they would think we are all knowing because many of them have seen the same trends that we see in some of the data I am conscious of the fact that a lot of what we are getting from the markets has more to do with how they think we are going to react rather than how they think we should react If some uptick in the markets, particularly to the extent that it increases costs, takes them back up to perhaps where they were earlier in the year, that might be helpful in restraining some of the possible sources of overshooting that might be in the GDP forecast  So, I would agree with those who recommended a course correction at this point I could go with 25 basis points "
2897,1996-09-24," Probably   This may be a naive question, but is liquidity absolutely determined by the percentage of bills in the System portfolio? A priori, the more bills, the more liquidity? Are not the other securities that are commonly used in repo transactions every bit as liquid or is that not accurate?   That is less liquid, yes   I know the presumption is that the bill area is more liquid; there are more securities at that end, although I believe that the Treasury has been extending the overall maturity structure   Right   Right But I would think that if we went to an all bills strategy, we would have complications associated with how large a share we are of the auction and perhaps how large a share we own of any given issue That might be a problem as well So, I think some gradual move to a more liquid position without going all the way is probably the one to be preferred You asked the question about income I do not think we should have an income objective either, as nobody else seems to "
2898,1996-09-24," Mr Chairman, overall economic conditions in New England remain good In particular, the regional unemployment rate in August was a full percentage point below the national rate Initial unemployment claims have been falling and are approaching levels last seen in the 1980s In thinking about this, we had a discussion about how our regional economy feels now versus how it felt in the late 1980s Basically, the thinking is that the dynamism--or as some would phrase it, the frenzy--that characterized the New England economy in the late 1980s is not there now even though the unemployment numbers are approaching the levels of the late 1980s Payroll employment expanded only 1 percent over the past year or at about half the national rate Help-wanted advertising is about the same as a year ago and well below the levels of 10 years ago The growth in average hourly earnings remains subdued, with increases for production workers only about 19 percent in New England over the past year compared with a national increase of more than 3 percent However, the anecdotal reports are more positive than the statistics, and there is some speculation that the state employment numbers will be revised up when the benchmark revisions are done in early 1997 State tax receipts suggest greater strength than the employment data show    9/24/96  The largest disconnect between statistics and anecdotes is in the manufacturing sector Employment continues to drift down at New England manufacturers, but our informal contacts are generally very positive Most report sales and orders comfortably above year-ago levels Some report smaller increases than earlier in the year, but others see no evidence of any slowing A great exception to this is the paper industry, which Jerry Jordan mentioned before Manufacturing inventories are in good shape Prices generally are flat and wage increases are in the 2-1/2 to 4 percent range Most firms say they are not feeling wage pressures, but it depends on the kinds of employees they are looking for Computer and software engineers are much in demand and can be had only if the employment package is sweetened with stock options and other incentives Reports from the retail sector were also positive Absent from the latest reports were the customary complaints about excess capacity and new competitors Upscale products are doing especially well Here, too, prices generally are flat, with a few increases of 1 to 2 percent reported There are some recent articles that have suggested that changes in temporary help employment may be a leading indicator If so, the reports from our contacts in this industry point to continued strength Business continues to grow rapidly, wages are rising, and one contact reports that qualified workers in the technical and professional areas are able to demand wage increases of 5 to 10 percent over year-ago levels because they are in demand and because there is a wide range of options in terms of projects for them  Turning to the national scene, we mostly agree with the Greenbook path for GDP, though I would question whether consumer spending will fall off quite as sharply as expected in the third quarter However, that GDP path, given stable low unemployment rates through 1998, does not seem likely to result in such a stable level of inflation as is expected in the Greenbook By anyone's estimate, labor markets are tight The unemployment rate right now may not be 51 percent, but I do not think it is 54 percent, and I have some doubts about whether it will bounce back to 54 percent quickly Such a bounceback seems to be what is needed to create the rather low CPI projections that are included in the Greenbook estimate The inflation picture is also more than normally confused by BLS measurement changes We have ignored those changes for the purpose of attempting to compare like numbers, which I know is futile, but they do appear to show an uptick of a slightly greater dimension than is reflected in the Greenbook numbers The Greenbook forecast in some sense is an idyllic one, but the sense that I have is that we are using more than the normal amount of smoke and mirrors to create this idyll, and you should forgive that phrase, Mike As I see it, this forecast is a very risky one Growth may well be stronger, and even if it is not, the flow-through to inflation may well be more pronounced than is projected in the Greenbook  Let me close by noting that our Bank, along with everybody else's, has normal rounds of meetings with outside groups We had a group of academicians in the other day--Paul Samuelson, Jim Duesenberry, Marty Feldstein, Rudi Dornbusch, Bill Poole, and Ben Friedman--people who rarely agree about anything But they were all in harmony on the subject of where monetary policy is right now They all felt that it was a little too ""not restrictive,"" let's put it that way, or a little too easy for the conditions as they saw them and in need of a bit of tightening Of course, there was a lot of debate  -10-    9/24/96 "
2899,1996-09-24," This is a tough period, and I have some sympathy for what President McDonough had to say But I do think that a healthy discussion of where we all are should not be divisive or problematic to our staffs In fact, I think the worst message that we could send would be to stop doing that at these meetings because people will ultimately know about it  I don't think there is a question at this point about whether GDP growth will slow; the question is how much Larry Lindsey asked about my comment about consumers As you mentioned, Mr Chairman, there is some reason to wonder about the August retail sales data I do not have anywhere near as much perspective on September sales as you do But given the employment data, given the level of consumer confidence, given the rise in the stock market, given the lack of real visible restraint on interest-sensitive sectors and particularly the housing markets, I think there is some risk about how far GDP is going to slow The next question, to the extent that it does slow, is whether that slowing will be sufficient to restrain inflation  You mentioned the growth in wage pressures It is clear that the relationship between tight labor markets and wage pressures that we think exists, does in fact exist The question is what nexus exists between the increase in wages and the increase in overall prices and has that changed It may be that profit margins will be squeezed, but I question, as I think you do, how long that would be allowed to happen in the atmosphere that all of us have seen--or heard of, anyway--in board rooms around the country I do not think profit squeezes will be accepted for long You talked about productivity, and I totally agree from what I know of it, which is a lot less than you know, that it is mismeasured I see that as a hands-on operating person, which I have been through most of my career I think productivity improvements in the service sector, of which we are a part, are vastly undermeasured Be that as it may, the question is whether the increases that we have been seeing in productivity, whether we know what they are or not, will offset wage increases in the future Now, with such tight labor markets, productivity improvements have to accelerate to offset the acceleration of wages Whether this will happen seems doubtful because markets are tight and because we are starting to pick up more marginal workers than we were earlier This whole question is confusing I would assume that the impact of the kinds of things that go into technological diffusion and help increase productivity and cut costs may not be as significant going forward as they have been for some time So, I would agree with you that when we begin to see squeezes on profit margins, that will  -34-    9/24/96  indicate the end of the trend where increasing productivity offsets increasing compensation costs  I think the only place where we do disagree is in our degree of willingness to wait to see that happen There is a willingness, on my part anyway, to move on the belief that wage pressures ultimately will not be damped by squeezes on profits and by productivity increases but rather will show through into final prices I think the risks that that will happen need to be dealt with sooner rather than later and that in fact we may be behind the curve It is true that our inaction over a period of months has allowed more growth to occur perhaps than would have otherwise, but if we are behind the curve and we continue to be, that does not augur well for growth going forward, given past history In fact, once we experience an increase in inflation, we might have to move more than we would if we started to tighten policy now Waiting might therefore have a more negative impact on growth than would a slight move now So, I would go along with those who would increase rates at this point by either 25 or 50 basis points "
2949,1996-11-13," I have a question on the material you sent us last night On the basis of the inventory data that were released last week, I see that you reduced your estimate of third-quarter GDP growth to a rate of 19 percent and traded that off with an uptick in fourth-quarter growth How sure are we of third-quarter final sales?   So you are still quite confident that the low level of consumption recorded in the third quarter, despite changes in inventories, is pretty much baked in the cake?   Mr Chairman, New England remains on a solid growth path Job growth on average has been slower than for the nation, but this is traditional for New England The unemployment rates for the region as a whole and for each state remain below that for the nation Employment in our region is still below its prerecession level, but the slow, steady job growth that we have been experiencing is expected to continue for the rest of the decade and to bring employment back to the prerecession level by the end of 1998  Just to touch on some of the bright spots Manufacturing job losses are continuing but at a slower rate We see this especially in the defense industry where downsizing is abating, and we are beginning to see signs that defense-oriented firms are becoming successful in nondefense lines of business Real estate vacancy rates are down everywhere, especially in Boston A director on our New England Advisory Council heads up the building trades in Boston, and he reports that new buildings are actively on the drawing boards, including six new hotels and a couple of new office complexes When I arrived in Boston five years ago, that was not expected to happen in anyone's lifetime Despite low rates of unemployment, anecdotal reports of labor shortages, except for specific technical skills, appear to have abated in the last couple of months There is some sense that the New England labor force may be growing There is less net outmigration and perhaps greater labor force participation by previously discouraged workers, especially older workers Wage increases are expected to be in the area of 2 to 5 percent, probably centering around 3 percent, but pressures on overall prices are considered to be low Business people firmly believe, along the lines that Mike Prell reported for the nation, that they cannot raise prices Some are going to try, but overall the expectation is that whatever happens on the wage side, businesses will somehow accommodate to it within their overall cost structure and not raise prices  Consumer sentiment and business sentiment are extremely upbeat, even in such formerly depressed areas as Connecticut We have had people from Connecticut talking to us about business conditions looking brighter The stories in the newspapers are more optimistic, and that is not because they just opened a new Indian-run casino in Connecticut! I think the better sentiment has its roots in the opening of a lot of small new businesses  On the national scene, we do not have any essential disagreement with the Greenbook Certainly, the risks that growth will get out of hand seem to have abated since our last meeting The slower growth in consumer spending in the third quarter, a slight cooling of housing markets, and a bigger drag--bigger than we expected anyway--from the trade deficit all point to a moderate fourth quarter, even assuming a fairly good bounceback in consumer spending The risks to the forecast for growth also seem fairly balanced, at least for the coming year, again as compared with our expectations at the time of the last Greenbook However, there are continued upside risks to inflation The Greenbook may be overly optimistic about the unemployment rate It could very well drift slightly downward, at least in our view, and we do not have a whole lot of wiggle room here The NAIRU probably is lower than we expected earlier, either permanently or cyclically, but it certainly is not centered around 52    11/13/96  percent The Greenbook inflation trend is up, even though that gets masked a bit by measurement adjustments and so forth But if we were able to make all of those adjustments going backward, we would still expect to see a small uptick in the rate of inflation going forward The key question here is whether that expected upward tick in inflation is acceptable, and if it is not, when we should move to address it even in the presence of moderating economic growth   She was from Texas!  -13-    11/13/96 "
2950,1996-11-13," Things have changed, at least from my perspective, since the last meeting I see a bit more balance in the factors bearing on the prospects for growth going forward At the last meeting, I saw all the risks on the side of faster economic expansion, but I now see some counterbalancing developments Factors that in my view inject some negative prospects into the growth picture include consumer debt, the trade deficit, and some cooling in housing markets There are still many sources of strength in the economy, and I tend to feel as do Al Broaddus and Tom Melzer that there are considerable risks on the inflation side But I think the perhaps temporary abatement in economic growth and the injection of some negative aspects to the growth outlook have given us a little breathing room However, I want to associate myself to some extent with what Governor Lindsey has said and what Tom Melzer just said The financial markets are acting as if interest rates only go in one direction, and with that attitude there are undoubtedly bets being made that are unwise now and will grow to be more unwise as time goes by We are risking a major asset price bubble unless some sense of caution, some sense of reality is injected into these financial markets at some point, and I think that injection needs to be made relatively soon All of that said, I could go with a 25 basis point increase at this point, but I can also support your recommendation, Mr Chairman We have some breathing room, but I think we need to retain an asymmetric directive So, I would agree with you "
3003,1996-12-17," I want to add my approval; I welcome the changes I think they will be helpful to you in getting a better range of bids    12/17/96  I did want to comment a little on your thoughts for making our operations more transparent, granted that there is a range of uncertainty, particularly about the projected need for reserves over a period of time We have been hearing from some of the fund managers in Boston about the interpretation of a lack of a coupon pass in December that coincided with concerns about market asset prices and so forth The temporary nature of the System's operations at a time when normally more permanent, outright operations were expected was interpreted as a subtle way of keeping things tighter than they otherwise would have been Of course, there was no way to reply to this, knowing that the information you share with us is not to be shared with other people But perhaps some of that might have dissipated a little and maybe it would have had some effect on the stock market volatility Of course, these fund managers were in the stock market more than in any other market In any event, the effect on market expectations was very marginal   Yes, I realize that The more transparent you get, the more everybody wants "
3004,1996-12-17," The New England economy is humming along, though there is some bounciness in the data Unemployment rates remain low; job growth is solid and on trend from an historical perspective Net out-migration of the labor force is less than it was in the early '90s Consumer confidence is better than it was a year ago Real estate markets are in particularly good shape, especially in Massachusetts, and both manufacturers and retailers see prospects for a solid Christmas and a good beginning of 1997  On the negative side, while anecdotal reports continue to stress the inability of individual firms to raise prices and the average rate of growth of wages in New England remains slower than for the country as a whole, the Boston CPI has experienced a couple of months of increases that are sharper than for the nation, largely because of medical, shelter, and fuel costs Moreover, anecdotes about wage pressures in selected occupations and areas have begun to flourish once again A mutual fund company, for example, just instituted an across-the-board salary increase of between 5 and 10 percent on top of a merit increase of 5 percent because of intense    12/17/96  demand for system and service professionals and sales people A high- tech manufacturer reported that the lid has blown on salaries of engineers and software specialists in the Boston area where such professionals command salaries over $100,000 Given our inability to hire such people at the Boston Fed, I think this is probably accurate Another high-tech firm is offering stock options and starting pay 20% above a year ago to attract new technical talent Thus, while this sort of competition has not found its way into average wage numbers, we do see some pressure on overall costs from other than wage components, and it may be only a matter of time before general wage levels rebound as well  As we all do, I meet periodically with various groups In Boston, we focus on investment professionals in the mutual fund industry and on a panel of academic advisers A couple of similar trends were evident in our meetings this time, and I thought I would give you some perspective on that Several of the market types and some of our directors as well reported extreme competition for yield among the mutual funds--which I suppose is not news to anyone--and declining liquidity ratios They expressed concern about the liquidity of the mutual funds, particularly the equity mutual funds, and more generally about the higher and higher degree of leverage in financial markets Our contacts are worried that this degree of leverage could make stock market adjustments more painful than otherwise and, in contrast to 1987, they perceive that the economy is growing more slowly now so that its resilience in the face of a market downturn might be less  There was some discussion of what, if anything, the Fed could do aside from the occasional speech to let the air slowly out of an asset price bubble, assuming one exists There seemed to be general agreement that raising margin requirements, while not particularly effective in substance, might send a message to the markets But there really was no great enthusiasm for an increase There was concern that more proactive actions, such as raising the funds rate, might not be a good idea unless one were sure that there would be an orderly regrouping after the market adjustment One person on the academic panel commented that it was probably unlikely that we had any firm sense of, or control over, what would happen after a market adjustment, and that playing with avalanches was always risky Finally, the academics saw wage inflation as the dominant risk on the horizon, but most of them thought preemptive policy was not appropriate at this point One participant referred to the lack of evidence on the relationship between unemployment and prices at low levels of inflation and noted that uncertainty made it difficult for monetary policy to be extremely forward-looking There were also some comments to the effect that there is not a sharp distinction between being reactive and being forward-looking A central bank that is nervously reactive may be as close to forward-looking as it can get [Laughter]  On the national scene, we have no serious questions about the Greenbook forecast We think the staff may be overly optimistic about inflation and that the elements of strong growth that are present--job growth, rising real wages, good disposable income, buoyant financial markets, everybody knows all of these--may end up creating more pressure next year than expected However, we think the staff may continue to be slightly overly optimistic about foreign growth as    12/17/96  well, and who knows whether the Grinch will actually steal Christmas or even if that would be an adverse development, given the level of consumer debt In sum, we are pretty much in agreement with the Greenbook forecast "
3005,1996-12-17," Mr Chairman, I am in full agreement with your recommendation for ""B"" asymmetric I also believe that Vice Chairman McDonough's definition of the various aspects of symmetry is quite in line with mine I think that our indicating symmetry or asymmetry in our directive really does communicate the direction to our thinking and does not have any impact on what the process will be in terms of how that will be implemented I would like to see that understood by everybody because the notion of symmetry in our directive is confusing I think we can make it less so "
3052,1997-03-25," I noticed that you built into your forecast for 1998 an increase of  75 to 100 basis points in the federal funds rate   I gather from the wording of the Greenbook and your briefing  that that was basically to keep real interest rates stable But I wondered why you were doing  that At least in my memory, it was a change from earlier Greenbook practices, and I would  find it helpful to have your comments on this Of course, we can see in your alternative  projections what the effects are if you do not change the federal funds rate assumption   I certainly do not object to that approach as a forecast It clearly  is in line with a lot of major forecasts But I thought the whole point of doing the  Greenbook, at least the way we have been doing it, was to have something that shows what  happens if we do not change anything   True   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the New England economy remains quite  healthy In fact, it is healthier than we thought it was As I reported before, we had been    3/25/97  tracking regional employment growth at about half the national pace The spring benchmark  revisions to the employment data showed that, in fact, jobs were expanding at just about the  national pace or about double the rate that we had been seeing earlier New Hampshire and  Massachusetts are exhibiting the strongest growth; Maine, Vermont, and Rhode Island are on  the low side, and even Connecticut is showing surprising strength The region's jobless rate  fell to 42 percent in February, more than a percentage point below the national rate The  rates in all six states were below the national average in January, with rates in Vermont and  New Hampshire well below in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range  The labor market continues to be tight for selected job categories, but the  definition of ""selected"" seems to be broadening a bit More individual occupations or job  types are being mentioned as hard to fill than in previous periods Some retailers indicate  they are experiencing recruiting difficulties even at the low end of the job skills spectrum,  and temporary employment firms report both increased difficulty meeting demand and rising  wages across the board Anecdotally, I am told that an employer no longer interviews  prospective employees in the data communications field; the prospective employees  interview the employer, and some will not even show up in person for an interview unless the  answers to their questions over the telephone are responsive to their concerns Those  concerns are not just about money--they include money, to be sure--but more often than not,  these technicians want to be assured of being involved in high-tech, cutting-edge projects so  that their skills will continue to be marketable Contacts also note that their firms are using  signing bonuses and stock options to attract scarce skilled staff but that those practices are  not yet leading to across-the-board wage increases Rather, employees with specific skills  are being paid more, while other employees with less marketable qualifications ""enjoy""    3/25/97  much smaller pay increases Thus, overall wages are rising a bit more slowly in the New  England area than in the nation, and we continue to hear that price increases are difficult, if  not impossible, to make stick  I have reported in the past on the pickup in nonresidential construction and the  prospects for more nonresidential building, particularly in the eastern Massachusetts area  Housing markets also are enjoying a good bit of strength Realtors region-wide have said  that activity is picking up either in terms of actual home sales or the number of inquiries from  potential buyers Massachusetts stands out with reports that 1996 broke the previous record,  set unfortunately in 1987, for the number of residential real estate sales in a calendar year  But contacts say all the New England states are seeing improvement Prices are rising in  response, modestly as yet, and new housing construction has picked up  Turning to the national scene, we are in general agreement with the Greenbook  that the near-term outlook for GDP growth is stronger than we might have expected earlier  this year and the risks associated with inflationary growth are a bit higher Arguably at least,  the Greenbook overstates a little the strength of the prospective expansion, and the external  sector especially could exert a stronger drag than is projected by the staff In addition, our  estimate of potential is a bit higher, so we do not expect unemployment to drop below 5  percent as does the Greenbook But all of this falls by and large into the category of ""nit  picking"" The potential for robust, above-potential growth led by consumption seems clear,  as are the asymmetric risks that capacity constraints will begin to bind sooner rather than  later Thank you   Right You have to find all the programs where only two digits  are embedded instead of four "
3053,1997-03-25," Mr Chairman, I fully support your recommendation for both the  25 basis points and the symmetric directive I, like many others, could support an  asymmetric directive as well, but I think your wisdom in this case is good as usual   We don't have time for that! "
3096,1997-05-20," President of the Republic of Texas   Thank you, Mr Chairman There is not a lot to report that is  new about the First District The regional economy, despite the slow-to-arrive spring  weather, continues to hum along at a rather rapid pace, buoyed by solid job growth at about  the national pace, which is good for our region There are low unemployment rates--in fact, I  believe New Hampshire at 21 percent has the lowest unemployment rate of any state in the  country--and moderate increases overall in prices and wages Competition continues for  specific skills so that we do continue to see a heating up in total compensation Contacts in  retail and manufacturing report solid growth over a year ago, and there are expectations that  this favorable trend will continue The District's high-tech industries--software, biotech,  hardware producers, and telecommunications--remain extremely vibrant and continue to face  a shortage of technical employees that I have mentioned in the past On the financial  services side, we have a sense that the downsizing in the commercial banking industry    5/20/97  locally may be moderating as firms realize that they cannot prosper any longer simply by  cutting costs alone They need to generate revenue and improve customer service Insurance  companies, on the other hand, may have just started on a trend of downsizing and  consolidation This is in direct contrast, of course, to the firms in the money management  and mutual funds industries that are growing by leaps and bounds This growth plays out in  quite low office vacancy rates, particularly in the Boston metropolitan area; the low vacancy  rates have spread from downtown Boston all the way out to Route 495 Contiguous office  space of any size is just not available Rents are rising and new construction cannot be far  behind though, unlike reports from some other areas of the country, we are told that  developers in our region continue to be wary of building ""on spec"" after the lessons of the  1980s  Turning to the national scene, I am impressed a bit by the tone of somewhat quiet  desperation in the Greenbook forecast Things are really quite good, but we seem to be  frustrated by our inability to gauge either the strength of the economy, even into the current  quarter, or the quiescence of inflation There are a lot of questions One of them is when the  current combination of very favorable trends will come to an end It's not that we  necessarily want them to end, but we would like to know when the economy will slow,  perhaps on its own as a result of the projected moderation in the growth of consumer  spending, a worsening of net exports, and a decline in residential investment Alternatively,  at what point will overall resource utilization become so tight that the wage-price spiral will  take off? Just as important as these two questions is which of these reversals to trend, if they  occur, will happen sooner In my view anyway, the likelihood is that resource utilization will  begin to bite before the strength of the economy wanes It is true that the current economic    5/20/97  data show signs of some slowing but, frankly, some slowing from a first-quarter pace of 6  percent is inevitable and necessary However, if one looks to the first half of the year, then  assumes that the Greenbook is right about the degree of slowing in the second quarter, which  may or may not be accurate but let us assume it is right, we still have GDP growing in the  first half of 1997 at a rate that is nearly double our current estimates of economic potential  Will growth in economic activity moderate for the rest of the year as the Greenbook expects?  Maybe, but we still see healthy job creation, good income growth, high consumer  confidence, good business confidence, and booming financial markets The same factors  persist that have caused our projections of economic growth to be off the mark fairly  consistently through 1996 and 1997 I must say that I remain agnostic about whether growth  will slow in line with the Greenbook forecast, at least without some shock to the economy  that no one is forecasting at present  We, along with others, have been wrong about inflation We have underestimated  the potential of the economy to grow at a solid pace without the usual bottlenecks associated  with tight resources It would be comforting to think that this can continue, but here I am  also agnostic If we think about our estimates of labor market tightness not as a point but as a  range of uncertainty that is fairly wide around a central tendency and we consider both the  experience of the late 1980s and the current data, I am drawn at least to the proposition that  we have not had sufficient constraint on resources long enough to produce the smoking gun  of a real inflationary increase But I do not think we are very far away from this, particularly  given the continued labor market tightness projected in the Greenbook and elsewhere    5/20/97  So, despite the recent indications of a slowing expansion, I think the risks are still  strongly asymmetric If anything, the Greenbook likely understates both growth and  inflation "
3097,1997-05-20," I think my analysis is quite similar to Bob Parry's We need to  assess both the risks that we face and the costs of being wrong in any action we take I, too,  view staying put as a policy action  As I noted earlier, the risks that growth will be more rapid and inflation more  difficult seem to me to continue to be strongly asymmetric In fact, if I thought the  Greenbook forecast had a reasonable probability of being realized, I probably could live with  it It is a forecast of a pretty good economic outcome But I do not think it has a good  probability of coming about In my view, some additional amount of tightening is necessary  to provide an extra source of constraint on the economy and keep it on a healthy track Your  discussion of productivity was extremely interesting, Mr Chairman, but in the end it seemed  to me that you had some sense of the potential need for tightening at some point this year  What if we were to tighten now by 25 basis points and we were wrong and  everything started to come in at least as well as the Greenbook sees it, and maybe even a  little slower? Are the costs of being wrong in that way unacceptably high? I do not think so,  and one of the reasons has to do with the argument of the psychological impact on the  markets I meet with a group of investment managers on a fairly regular basis Their  discussions in recent weeks have continually focused on the availability of credit, the  liquidity of the markets, and the excesses that they see everywhere, particularly when it  comes to commercial real estate financing Rather than feeding a sense of caution through  uncertainty about our actions, I think that not moving at this meeting or certainly not moving  soon will lead to a greater level of certainty among market participants that they can persist  in their excessive activities and that will feed into more speculation in the asset markets than  is healthy    5/20/97  What if we stand pat and we are wrong? Of course, timing is everything and  perhaps it really doesn't matter whether we tighten now or in July or August or whenever we  meet during the rest of the year I do think that in delaying we stand to lose a bit in the  markets, as I mentioned, and we also stand to lose the high ground of advocating a proactive  monetary policy We need to reduce the risk of overshooting, and if we do not do it at a time  of fast growth and tight labor markets, when will we do it?  For what it's worth, the same group of investment managers spent a lot of their  time at our meeting discussing what they saw as the potential outside sources of resistance to  Fed moves, along the line of what Tom Hoenig was reflecting on in his comments earlier  Their advice, again for what it's worth, is to do the right thing For them, doing the right  thing is to tighten up a bit on the markets and rein in the potential for inflation to get out of  hand I believe the right policy now is a further 25 basis point move But again, timing is  everything I think our current policy stance is not too far away from where it should be, Mr  Chairman, and I could support your recommendation "
3142,1997-08-19," I have a follow-up question based on some of the conversations at the  conference It was rather striking to a few people there, as it probably is to a lot of people in this  room, that as compared with our involvement with Mexico and in IMF packages in general, there  was no specific US involvement in the Thai baht situation I am sure that some people in this  room view that as highly positive and other people may not I wonder whether there is any  perspective on this Is this a new paradigm going forward that we do not get involved in these  things, or is it solely related to how much the Thai baht is going to impact the United States? What  is the thinking?   Yes "
3143,1997-08-19," You noted the dependence of your forecast on the assumption about  inventories Is there any way of knowing how much of this inventory accumulation is domestically  produced versus imports?   Mr Chairman, the New England economy--   Oh, okay I have to think about that   I hate to call myself old anything [Laughter] I think I'll wait on that  The New England economy continues to expand steadily Employment growth is  roughly the same as that for the nation, and it is above New England's long-term trend  Massachusetts is a star performer, while Rhode Island lags behind The retail sector in New  England is experiencing fierce competition in addition to somewhat slower growth overall than the  nation All our retail contacts think that the New England economy is quite strong However, in a  number of cases, their own results do not reflect this In contrast, the manufacturing sector is doing  quite well Although increases in employment are minuscule, they are there Employment in  manufacturing increased over the past year for the first time in a long time I assume that a lot of  this is due to the Boeing merger with McDonnell Douglas and the demand for aircraft worldwide    8/19/97  The demand for aircraft engines that are produced in the First District, at least in part, and for  aircraft parts is quite strong We also have a local auto-related manufacturing industry, and  demand among the firms in that industry varies depending on which auto company is being  supplied Suppliers to Chrysler reflect a mixed picture, and reduced production of the Taurus  model has affected suppliers to Ford On the other hand, a fabricated metals company reports  fantastic business because General Motors is using its product  The regional unemployment rate was 42 percent in July, and that rate puts our region  back, after several months, below the national average A number of firms are responding to the  tight labor markets with targeted compensation schemes We see a lot of reports of individual  workers' salaries going up by 20 to 25 percent, but these salary increases are being applied so  selectively that the overall rise in compensation packages amounts to a small fraction of total  payroll, somewhere between 2 and 3 percent Some firms also are using signing bonuses to attract  workers In general, firms seem to be contending successfully with these tight labor markets,  although one of the Bank's directors recently noted that turnover had increased so much that  training costs had become an issue While both the unemployment rate and the anecdotal evidence  indicate that labor markets are tight, help-wanted advertising in the region remains very low,  suggesting that employers may not be using traditional means to attract workers  Firms continue to view increasing their prices as an impossibility One person, who may  have been talking to Peter, said in commenting on customers' resistance to higher prices that ""the  paradigm has changed"" Despite their inability to raise prices, a number of firms indicated that  margins are being maintained or even improved There are exceptions to this benign price picture  One is the rates for Boston hotel rooms that have risen 12 percent in 1997 in response to a banner  year for tourism Another exception involves commercial real estate in a number of cities in the    8/19/97  region The Boston real estate market has been described, as I have mentioned before, as being as  hot as a firecracker and as one of the three or four best real estate markets in the country The  office market is especially strong, with rents up 10 percent in the past year and even industrial rents  are rising Other cities are seeing a less dramatic improvement Hartford still lags behind but is  starting to appeal to some investors because its space is so cheap  The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence provides an interesting  perspective on the regional economy The index increased slightly in July from a fairly high June  However, the assessment of current conditions soared while future expectations plunged to levels  not seen in two or three years There may be a sense in New England that things really are too  good to last  On the national scene as well, trends have been almost unbelievably good We, like the  Greenbook, have begun to question our assessment of capacity measures, especially in labor  markets We have trimmed our perceptions of likely inflationary growth over the next year, though  we believe there certainly is the potential for the economy to be stronger and for the rate of  inflationary growth to exceed the rather mild uptick predicted in the Greenbook In particular, I  think conditions for residential investment seem a bit brighter than the Greenbook suggests, and we  would not predict that net exports will have as benign an effect on prices due both to dollar  depreciation and our somewhat stronger assessment of foreign inflation prospects On the whole,  however, we have no major differences with the Greenbook Thank you, Mr Chairman "
3144,1997-08-19," He's not a voting member   I accept your recommendation as well   Just one last question because you raised the issue in your  commentary We have noticed an uptick in housing-related components of the CPI There also are  increases in other asset prices that people are worried about, obviously the stock market,  nonresidential real estate, and so forth   Yes, exactly I probably am asking the same question that you were  posing What do we do with monetary policy when there is no inflation but asset prices are  booming?   Yes, in your AEI speech   Hindsight tells us to prick the bubble sooner, but how does foresight  tell us we have a bubble? "
3189,1997-09-30," As Jack mentioned, most of the good questions already have been  asked Mike, I know we have had an asymmetric risk picture in most of the recent Greenbook  forecasts and certainly in the way the Committee has approached setting its directives Would you  say that the risks incorporated in this forecast are larger than they have been in earlier ones in terms  of the degree of ""judiciousness"" that has been used in interpreting some of the evidence?   In your alternate forecast scenario that involves no further change in  the federal funds rate, I wonder about that 26 percent GDP growth figure for 1998 which occurs  without the 100 basis point tightening I think there is a lot of optimism in that forecast that growth    9/30/97  will slow on its own Now, granted that this is not your forecast number, but in terms of trying to  balance off your actual forecast against a picture of what would happen if we did nothing, I think  you have a lot of windage in that ""no change"" scenario   Well, we don't have to worry about our educational system!   Mr Chairman, the New England economy continues to grow steadily  at roughly the national rate The regional unemployment rate in August was about 43 percent, and  initial unemployment claims continue to trend down Labor force participation rates are rising in  response to the attractive employment situation Most of our job growth has been concentrated in  services, as is true for the national economy, but no sector of the regional economy is doing poorly  at present Even manufacturing employment has begun to edge up This represents a rather  striking contrast We are always looking at how things got out of whack in New England at the end  of the 1980s and how things are different now, and hopefully they are At the end of the 1980s,  New England was enjoying a very high degree of prosperity Then, as now, most of the new jobs    9/30/97  were in services, but that situation masked employment declines in many of the region's  manufacturing industries, and that, of course, played into the depth of the recession when the  bubble finally burst in New England  Our informal conversations with the region's retailers and manufacturers confirm the  positive picture Retail sales and manufacturing revenues are up from year-ago levels, surpassing  expectations in many cases Manufacturing strength is quite broad-based, with aircraft parts and  furniture exhibiting some of the most rapid growth Most retail and manufacturing contacts report  that they have capital expansions under way Some of the manufacturing plans are quite ambitious  Many of our contacts characterized labor markets as tight Several commented that the quality of  the pool of people from which they draw has declined Employers claim to be resisting increasing  wages across the board, although the normal wage increase seems to be edging up from what it was  a few months ago It is now in the 3 to 5 percent range In addition, special bonuses and other  incentives seem to be available to more and more of the workforce While overall wage levels  continue to rise only in the moderate range I have talked about, our contacts in the temporary help  business commonly report increases of 10 percent or more, and in some cases a lot more Wage  increases are particularly rapid for people with technical skills These workers in New England, as  well as elsewhere, are in very short supply Many receive offers of permanent employment but are  choosing to stay in contract work The temporary help agencies report no difficulty in passing the  increased cost of temporary workers on to their customers Salary pressures are also quite intense,  as you can imagine, in the asset management area One respondent observed that while the general  salary pool increase at his firm is 4 percent, investment managers have bonuses like sports stars  Bonuses to existing employees who refer new hires are becoming more prevalent along with  signing bonuses, and these referral bonuses typically range somewhere between $500 and $2000    9/30/97  Most companies in retailing and manufacturing continue, however, to hold the line on  prices, citing competitive pressures Even when prices of materials or wages have increased, gains  in efficiency have enabled companies to maintain selling prices without sacrificing margins A  contact from a very large company regarded as one of the nation's most efficient observed that she  sees virtually unlimited opportunities for cutting costs and improving productivity These  opportunities often involve changes in procedures rather than specific new capital investments  I must say that I was impressed by some of the discussion when a trade mission from  India recently visited Boston; the trade mission included India's minister of trade and industry and  the ambassador They were talking a bit about the boom in some areas of the Indian economy In  particular, they talked about how several hospitals in the Boston area now create automated records  during the day, which are shipped overnight via telecommunications to Bombay, entered into  online real time databases there, and then are available the next morning for use by our hospitals,  effectively a day or less from the time that they were created This basically moves major back  office operations out of Boston to Bombay in a way that seems to be fairly easy to set up They  were pointing to the advantages that India has, and it was quite striking that this improved service  was available to hospitals and other kinds of companies that traditionally have had some difficulty  with the productivity of their back office operations Another contact attributed low inflation to  Wal-Mart and other retail giants who have taught companies to be just as difficult with their  suppliers as their customers are with them  Real estate markets throughout New England continue to be quite active, and we had  some improvement in previously lagging areas, Rhode Island for one Prices, however, are  increasing as yet only modestly    9/30/97  I was intrigued by Mike Prell's discussion of the Greenbook forecast because I think it  addressed a lot of the differences that we had with the Greenbook presentation We agree with  your assessment of the outlook for growth, Mike, particularly over the short run--that is, over the  next 3 quarters or so We have some concerns after that We think it likely that unemployment  will decline to the 4-1/2 percent level talked about in the Greenbook and that, at least in the short  term, inflation will creep up only modestly However, we begin to have some questions after the  short term We question whether the appreciated dollar will stay where it is over the entire  projection period and have the impact on controlling inflation that is expected in the Greenbook  forecast We wonder whether we are going to have more normal cost increases in benefits You  talked a little about that, Mike It is not featured much in the Greenbook, but you did bring it into  your discussion We think it possible that more normal wage increases will begin to reassert  themselves sooner rather than later I also question whether the impact from the decline in the  stock market that we have been expecting for so long will really begin to hit us in the early part of  1998 the way both your standard forecast and your alternative forecast assume  It seems that aside from the dollar, you are hanging your hat on two things to derive a  very rosy forecast They are a 100 basis point increase in the federal funds rate and a related drop  in the stock market I want to question whether, if we get on this bandwagon a little earlier than is  assumed in the Greenbook, we can do a little less and have a little more of an impact on asset  valuations going forward That would help to moderate demand pressures and reduce the risk that I  think is apparent in this Greenbook forecast that the economy could get out of control earlier next  year than we expect   Boston, too! "
3190,1997-09-30," I, too, am supportive of your proposal, Mr Chairman I also would  have supported a small preemptive move at this meeting, but I recognize that the lack of a real  smoking gun in terms of inflation, either existing or in the pipeline or guessed about, makes that  sort of recommendation a bit difficult to entertain at this point I agree with Alice Rivlin that we  probably are facing a less inflation-prone economy than might have been the case in earlier  decades, but I also think that the factors that have contributed in a major way to this situation are  more transitory than new paradigmish and their effects may be coming to an end I think benefit  cost increases, wage increases in the face of increasing labor shortages, and the potential for a  reduction in the value of the dollar given the large size of our external deficits will at some point  start to work together to make this less inflation-prone economy more inflation-prone I agree with  the comments about being forward-thinking and locking in the benefits of reduced inflation    9/30/97  I have some concern about the idea of communicating to the markets With respect to  what you said in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I told a lot of people to read the whole  testimony, not just what was in the headlines of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal  There was a good deal of balance in that testimony I think it is really difficult to communicate  these things in such a way that people understand the intended message Don Kohn made some  good comments to the effect that surprising the markets, particularly in a boom-like environment  either existing or building, is not all that bad a thing I wonder whether we can communicate  effectively in the absence of real inflation, but I think we need to move before real inflation  materializes In my view, anyway, there is more than a 50 percent probability of our moving at the  next meeting "
3237,1997-11-12," Just a question If all the primary dealers reacted well to your  counseling, Peter, what would be the impact on our operations? What benefit would we see as a  result of that?    11/12/97   Looking at your first chart on primary dealer performance in Desk  financing transactions, that dotted line for the median is -18 basis points Your desire is to move  that up to the stop-out rate?   So, you would like to move that intersection both up and out? "
3238,1997-11-12," I want to go back to Ted's comment about whether or not the paper  we got on the ""worst case"" scenario was really ""worst"" or ""worse"" I noticed that the paper still  foresees some growth in 1998 for Korea, and I must say I am a little concerned that the impact of  the Southeast Asian crisis on Japan may be more significant than the paper anticipates If you  have any comments, I would like to hear them because I'm a little concerned that our idea of  what is the bottom may not really be the bottom    11/12/97 36   If you use that ""worse"" case scenario as a guess, is the impact a  one-half percentage point reduction in our GDP growth over the next couple of years?   Spread over 1998 and 1999?   Apart from that, how does this scenario play out in terms of  unemployment and downward impact on inflationary pressures?   Mr Chairman, there is not a whole lot that is really new in New  England In a nutshell, our unemployment rates remain well below the national rate The rate of  job growth also remains below the national rate, but it finally has been sufficient to bring the  region back to its pre-recession employment levels This has occurred about a year earlier than  most forecasters had been expecting, so it is very good news for the region as a whole Our state  economies are all quite healthy Their tax revenues in fiscal year 1997 provided all of them with  surpluses somewhere between 2 and 5 percent of their spending bases Inflation remains  subdued, as evidenced both by anecdotal reports and the CPI for the Boston area Increasingly,  we hear the lament in a variety of forms that economic conditions are so good they can only get  worse  I want to comment on a couple of developments of a local nature with some national  implications First of all, loan growth at the four large First District banking organizations that  are tracked on a weekly basis accelerated to an annual rate of about 18 percent most recently  That increase is well above national trends and well above what it has been locally This was a  result of solid commercial loan growth at the District's two largest banks as well as concerted  efforts to expand real estate portfolios, both residential and commercial Banks in the District, as  elsewhere, remain very profitable They are well capitalized and their stock prices are as high as  three to five times book value However, the CEO of one of our banks in the $10 to $20 billion  range--we don't have many of them, but we have one or two--told me last week that his  institution, which had been increasing in size basically by acquiring smaller, mostly thrift,  depository organizations, was now in a holding mode because he felt the prices of those smaller  institutions were getting much too rich for such acquisitions to be sensible investments He    11/12/97 59  characterized this as a ""very dangerous time"" when the availability of cash and the outrageous  price tags on smaller depository institutions could lead some organizations, his not included, to  very poor acquisition decisions  As everybody knows, we have a large confluence of mutual funds in the First District  Our employment numbers in the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors in Massachusetts  have grown almost 4 percent over the last year The mutual fund industry is seen as one of the  main reasons for the tight Boston office market, which is getting tighter every week that goes by,  and more generally for the city's currently strong vitality We have been doing some research  over the last year or so in combination with people at the New York and the Cleveland Reserve  Banks on what the reaction would be in the mutual fund industry and more broadly to a sizable  stock market correction Lo and behold, about the same size correction that we had been asking  our contacts about actually occurred, at least for a day or so So, we went to all the mutual funds  and banks that had been part of our earlier study to see how they felt they had weathered the  crisis In general, the mutual funds believed that they had weathered the experience fairly well  Redemptions were considerably higher than normal on both October 27 and 28, but purchases  were also higher, especially on the second day Outflows were within the volumes that could be  financed from cash reserves Some funds needed to draw on lines of credit, but those that tried  to access uncommitted lines of credit found that they probably would be better off paying the  extra price to get their lines of credit on a committed basis Funds reported no major liquidity  problems and no significant problems executing payments, but they did experience a degradation  in response time to shareholder calls Banks serving the mutual funds industry also reported no  significant delays, and one contact observed that the increased transaction volumes were likely to    11/12/97 60  be highly profitable to the banks in question So, maybe the next time we go out and talk to the  funds, we need to consider asking them about a bigger stock market correction!  Turning to the national forecast, I guess all of us around the table have been  impressed, as I know we have been in Boston, by the continuing strength of the economy and the  continuing environment of a low and even declining inflation experience as reflected in broad  measures of prices While we have observed this favorable economic performance, we also have  found that we are unable with our current forecasting methods to project both the strength of the  GDP and the quiescence of inflation  As a response to our own sense of uncertainty about these developments, we invited a  few fairly well known forecasters to talk about inflation and how we might better forecast it As  one can imagine, there was a considerable divergence of opinion as there always is when such  people are brought in to talk about something so close to their hearts as the way they forecast  inflation There was, however, a good deal of focus by two or three of these forecasters on the  impact of the change in relative prices of computers--something that Bob Parry talked about a  little earlier--in creating a positive supply shock with sufficient feedback effects to account for  much of our inflation success Now, they recognize that it is possible that the relative change in  the prices of computers and its impact on our overall inflationary trends is temporary, somewhat  like health care cost changes or import price changes, but forecasting how temporary it is really  presents a conundrum It would seem that the relative changes in computer prices might be  much longer-lived and have a much greater impact on the overall trends in inflation than changes  in either health costs or import prices Maybe this is just the other side of the new paradigm    11/12/97 61  economy, or whatever There did seem to be a sense among these forecasters of a much less  temporary impact and a potential for a much longer-run effect on our inflation numbers  We talked a little about the uncertainties stemming from the turmoil in Southeast Asia,  its impact on Korea and Japan, and the potential for a broadening of that impact I sense that  many of you are much more sanguine about that impact than I am getting to be I think that this  development inserts an element of downside risk that I did not see earlier, or perhaps it generates  a greater appreciation of the downside risk than I have had over the course of the last several  FOMC meetings While I don't think we would disagree with the Greenbook's baseline forecast  that the economy is very strong--nearly all the incoming data suggest that it is--I do have a little  more question about whether we're going to see that transmitted as strongly to the inflation  numbers as traditional models would suggest Also, I think I now have a slightly sharper sense  of concern about the situation in Southeast Asia and its impact more generally So, I guess I  have moved out of the climate, or the attitude, of seeing all the risks only on the upside to where  I now sense a greater balancing of risks in this forecast than I did in previous ones "
3239,1997-11-12," I am in basic agreement with you, Mr Chairman I want to add a  couple of thoughts even though I know the time is late I want to make clear my thinking  because it has undergone a bit of a change  My comments on a set of more balanced risks notwithstanding, I do believe there are  real inflationary concerns about the underlying momentum of the economy These relate to tight  capacity constraints, the momentum in both consumer and business spending, the absence of any  real sign of a drag from fiscal policy, and very accommodative capital markets But I have  begun to ask myself whether I really believe that this combination of factors will cause inflation  to tick upward so that growth needs to be reined in at this point We have not seen inflation  actually change; in fact, it has gone down over the past year by most broad measures I still hear  anecdotally from almost everybody I talk to in the First District a marked unwillingness to raise  prices even though there is a sense that wage pressures are growing I think this pricing restraint  is only going to be intensified in the near term by the Southeast Asian turmoil both because of  reduced prices for competitive products and actual reductions in the cost of components for US  goods  I still think the best guess is the traditional one, the one that is embodied in the  Greenbook, that we need to move to tighten policy fairly soon to head off a strong inflationary  impulse But I for one would like to do that on the basis of something more than a blip in wages  that can be, at least in part, attributed to minimum wage impacts I would like to see more  evidence of rising inflationary pressures to strengthen my confidence that after a fairly long  period of getting inflation trends wrong, we finally got them right In that regard, I am in full  agreement with your recommendation, Mr Chairman    11/12/97 "
3287,1997-12-16," Mr Chairman, the New England region continues its recent trend of  solid growth, low unemployment relative to that for the nation, tight labor markets, but only  moderate price and wage pressures There are exceptions in specific job categories where    12/16/97 39  workers are in extremely short supply, especially in information technology and engineering  Like Atlanta, the First District is experiencing a boom in tourism We, too, have some large  manufacturers who are concerned about deflation as in the Philadelphia region But my sense is  that their concern reflects a long period of very strong competition within their industries rather  than any real expectation that the economy will experience broad-based reductions in prices and  wages  While it has been a short period since our last meeting, we have seen a change in  attitudes regarding the sustainability of this favorable economic situation On the one hand, there  is the Asian crisis, which will both limit the exports of some of New England's fastest growing  companies and increase domestic competition because of lower import prices However, we also  are told that some New England companies outsource production to Southeast Asia and may now  be getting cheaper components, thereby keeping costs lower than would otherwise be the case  The other area that has called into question the sustainability of the regional expansion  is speculative commercial real estate construction I have been reporting for some time that  while the Boston commercial real estate market was very tight, with only small amounts of  contiguous Class A space available, there also were no reports of plans for major building  projects or much new building under way except for that related to the Artery Project going  through the center of the city That has now changed Senior city officials told me recently that  plans have been submitted for 40 new hotels in Boston proper We also have reports of 113  million square feet of speculative office space being proposed for construction in the greater  Boston area within the next 12 to 18 months At current absorption rates, this additional office  space will take about four years to fill Commercial loan data support stories of an increase in    12/16/97 40  construction plans First District loans are growing at better than twice the national rate, with  real estate lending at our two largest banks leading the way at over three times the national pace  Commercial real estate lending is seen as a growth opportunity for the first time since the late  1980s, raising regulatory as well as economic concerns We understand that a Systemwide effort  is under way to investigate lower lending standards of banks We would suggest that some  follow-up be done on commercial real estate lending as well, as we are doing in the First District  Finally, one of our directors, the chairman of State Street, sounded a warning of a  different nature at our last meeting As you know, State Street has extensive and highly  mission-critical information technology systems As a result, it has been a leader in century date  change planning Recently, State Street was asked to speak to eight very large European banks  to discuss Year 2000 problems and ways to work together to solve them  Our director believes it would be helpful and in the national interest if the Federal  Reserve were to raise this issue more forcefully  Turning to the national scene, we had prepared our own forecast prior to receiving the  Greenbook Our assessment for GDP growth in 1998 was in the area of 28 percent, following  growth of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 We had unemployment trending down  by year-end 1998 and the core CPI trending up, even after adjustments were made for  measurement changes Obviously, in terms of broad trends this is quite different from the  Greenbook scenario though it is in line with several private forecasts In preparing this forecast,    12/16/97 41  we incorporated between 50 and 75 percentage point of negative impact on GDP as a result of  the Asian crisis and a few tenths more reflecting our expectations of a general slowdown in the  domestic economy The result is that we had projected a bit less of a slowdown in GDP growth  than the Greenbook  When I looked at the Greenbook forecast this weekend to assess the progressively  gloomier Asian prospects, I could accept the Greenbook estimates of the effects of the external  situation However, I am more agnostic about the impact of smaller additions to inventories and  the gradual decline in stock market prices, both of which contribute to a Greenbook GDP outlook  that is well below our forecast in Boston Inventory and stock market levels are difficult to  project, and I worry that they are expected to play such an important role in reining in the  domestic economy I believe there is a good probability of growth being stronger,  unemployment levels more stable, and pressure on prices greater than is evident in the  Greenbook, though I do agree that the Asian situation is a wild card "
3288,1997-12-16," In thinking about the current situation, I ask myself, where are the  risks to the forecast? Last month, I was more negative than the staff on the Asian situation, but  my sense now is that the Greenbook has it about right, although there certainly is a lot of  uncertainty about potential developments in Asia It is possible, of course, that a ""worse case""  situation could materialize The Asian situation could get worse, spread to Latin America, affect  Hong Kong and in turn China more significantly, and the contagion could develop into a    12/16/97 76  worldwide downturn On the other hand, it is also possible that, given the strength of the current  data, domestic growth could fail to slow sufficiently despite retarding external effects, feeding  into a cycle of more intense wage and price pressures and ultimately into higher inflation To  me, these risks seem fairly balanced right now, but I think the costs of being wrong are not  balanced  If, in fact, international developments occur along the lines of the Greenbook forecast  or even get worse, we will not be in such a bad situation if we do nothing now Monetary policy  is not overly tight We have inflows of capital to the United States that are reducing interest  rates We have low inflationary expectations There is not a lot to be lost in waiting in that case  On the other hand, if resource use is tighter than we think and economic growth is stronger than  projected in the Greenbook, we could be waiting too long Wage inflation could get embedded  It would then cost more to root it out, and it could cost more at a time when the strength of the  US economy is more rather than less important to the worldwide situation In thinking about  these alternative costs, I conclude that the right decision is probably not to do anything now The  underlying situation is too uncertain in Asia I also believe that it would be desirable to see the  price data stabilize, if not tick up, before we move on the inflationary front But because I think  the costs of being wrong in the direction of greater inflation are more significant than if we are  wrong in the other direction, I would have a slight preference for staying with the asymmetric  directive I would interpret symmetry and asymmetry a little more broadly than simply looking  at what is likely to happen over the next several weeks   Not to mention transparent "
3340,1998-03-31," I second the motion   Give us an ""A"" "
3341,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in New England  continues to be strong Actually, on the basis of revised benchmark data, it is a little stronger  than we thought it was in 1997 and early 1998 Tight labor market conditions prevail, as do  strong real estate markets in most areas, and good, if not great, prospects for the tourist industry  and investment management firms, just to name two businesses Manufacturing reports are a bit  more mixed Some firms are doing quite well as a result of accelerating demand for aircraft and  heavy truck parts, furniture, and equipment Others, especially in the equipment and high-tech  industries, are holding their own or experiencing some difficulties in the face of cheaper imports  and difficulties in their Asian markets  In general, the impact of Asia seems wider than at the time of the last meeting Nearly  all the manufacturers we talk to either have felt some impact so far from Asia or expect, directly  or indirectly, such an impact by midyear The nature of the Asian impact can be both negative  and positive, echoing a little of what President Guynn said On the negative side, firms have  been affected by the cancellation of orders from their Asian customers, and several have    3/31/98  associated layoffs with this problem, including in one case the closing of an entire plant In  addition, some contacts have indicated that they have had to supply financing to Asian customers  or suppliers who are unable to get credit through normal sources On the positive side, however,  many of our contacts report that lower prices have led them to increase their purchases in Asia,  and they are trying to move more manufacturing to that region to take advantage of lower  production costs It will take some time for them to make these changes in cases where existing  business relationships are constrained by long-term contracts  As I noted before, labor markets are very tight and one hears anecdotally about  difficulties in hiring beyond high-tech employees who have been a problem for some time in  New England Even entry-level employees, particularly in the hotel and tourism industries, are  difficult to find At the Bank, we have begun to experience turnover in our night check-clearing  staff that is making it difficult to absorb the increased processing that resulted from the closing of  our RCPC in Lewiston, Maine Contacts tell us that firms continue to pursue a number of  strategies to cope with hiring difficulties The latter include on-the-job training to improve  efficiency and efforts to accommodate the mix between job and family life situations, as well as  selective increases in wages, benefits, and bonus pools Even the very hard to employ and  particularly those who are targeted by the Federal welfare-to-work legislation are being courted  in Boston by such firms as Marriott, which is designing special training programs aimed at  making these people employable and employed in the hotel industry This objective will be very  hard to achieve, and one can only hope that the effort will be successful  On the national scene we, like the Greenbook, have increased our estimate of 1998  GDP, so we still stand a little above the staff forecast Our forecast is based on the strength of  employment, residential construction, consumer durable expenditures, and business investment    3/31/98  so far this year We agree that there will be a drag from Asia and an inventory correction as  well, but we fully expect that domestic demand will be strong enough to withstand these negative  forces and keep the economy from slowing much below potential over the remainder of this year  We, like the Greenbook, see 1999 growth about at potential, though we have been hesitant to  forecast a stock market correction Our forecast shows unemployment declining and core  inflation rising a bit more than in the Greenbook, but taken altogether that is not a bad prospect  Where we are concerned is in the assessment of the risks Mike Prell picked up a little  of that concern in his presentation as well At our last meeting, I and a lot of other people  thought that the risks to the forecast were roughly balanced I could see the potential for  negative as well as positive surprises Now it seems that the risks are more on the upside again  Domestic growth is stronger than expected Wage and benefit increases have crept up by some  measures into the 4 percent range, particularly in services There are selected price increases in  service industries Comments around the table have reflected on indications of more speculation  in real estate activity This speculation is fed by financial markets, which are extremely  accommodative From every perspective that we can see in our region and nationally, monetary  policy is not tight; it is not even neutral It is accommodative to an increasingly speculative  environment  Sure, there are negatives We have yet to see the full brunt of Asian developments  Inventory levels may correct The temporarily benign influences of low benefit costs, growing  productivity, increases in dollar exchange rates, and declining oil prices may be about to shift I  think the question for today is how long the current situation can last before tighter monetary  policy is warranted or, more specifically, how long we can wait before we have waited too long "
3342,1998-03-31," Mr Chairman, I came to this meeting prepared to vote for an  increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate, and I also came prepared to dissent if we did  not at least move to asymmetry I am glad that your recommendation is to move to asymmetry  I support it, but I am concerned that we continue to face the difficulty of explaining a tightening  move in the context of declining price trends Of course, our expectations are that those price  trends will turn around over the course of the period during which our current monetary policy  has an effect I also am concerned about what you have so eloquently described as the  vulnerability in financial markets and what President Poole has described as the lack of    3/31/98  uncertainty in those markets I think we face a real risk of feeding the speculative excess that  will ultimately come to haunt us if we do not move soon That may still mean moving when we  have broad price trends that do not suggest major inflation upticks I frankly believe, along with  I think at least one other member of the Committee, that moving now might be easier than  moving later, given the transitory effects of Asia But, again, I am willing to go along with your  proposal  I have felt for some time that an announcement of no change is as much a policy move  as an announcement of a change So, when we do not change our policy, I think it would be  helpful to go beyond saying at 215 ""the meeting ended at such and such a time"" If we can  figure out a way to say in one or two sentences why we made a policy change, we could figure  out a way to say in one or two sentences why we did not make a policy change and what our  general policy attitude is   Right, and that takes me to the policy speech proposal I know we  have been commenting on these issues in policy speeches, and I agree with Alice Rivlin, Ed  Boehne, and others who have talked about the context in which to describe our policy actions  But I am a lot more comfortable with policy speeches after a move than before a move I worry  about the latter What are we doing here if we are going to telegraph what we will be doing  before the fact rather than explaining it after the fact? I think we are better off if we avoid a  stance where all of us are trying to telegraph what we are doing before we actually do it "
3392,1998-05-19, Just a follow-up question You are referring to bank paper and not  to bank customer paper?   The recommendation for some time has been for them to  distinguish between bad banks and good banks in their efforts to resolve their financial problems  Is the Bank of Japan becoming the bad bank?   Second 
3393,1998-05-19," I think you have mostly answered this question, but let me pose it  in another way Are the computational changes being made in the CPI masking the real price  increases that are occurring? In other words, is there a distinction between what people really are  experiencing and what the numbers say, or are the computational changes reflecting the reality of  what people see?   So, you don't see further major changes after the end of this period  in BEA's computation of this measure? If you take the 1994 numbers, compare them to those  projected for 1999, and adjust for measurement differences, you get an upward trend of something  like 5 percent You don't think that trend will then reassert itself? You don't think BEA's  adjustment is masking a trend that is going on anyway? You think it is measuring what is really  going on?   This gets into metaphysics! [Laughter]   Yes, of that estimated one point plus something   Thank you, Mr Chairman The New England economy continues  to show remarkable strength With employment growth only slightly below the nation's and an  unemployment rate that remains lower than elsewhere, the District economy remains strong and  vibrant As evidence of this, regional manufacturing jobs recently increased at a pace faster than in  the nation and merchandise export growth was faster as well This may reflect the fact that we are  a little less oriented toward Asia than some other parts of the country The trend in manufacturing  jobs reflects a turnaround in the region's computer industry, the successful commercial conversion  of some formerly defense-intensive manufacturers, and growing strength in the region's equipment  and transportation industries  Our labor markets remain very tight even at entry levels Here are a few anecdotes  We cannot hire check clerks for our nighttime processing operations to deal with the increase in    5/19/98  volume from the shutdown of the Lewiston RCPC One of our directors, who is the publisher of  the major newspaper in New England, cannot find people to deliver the papers Employers  associated with the tourism industry in Maine are concerned, similar to what President Boehne  mentioned, about filling summer jobs in tourism in southern Maine Pressure is most widely felt,  as it has been in the past, in the computer, engineering, and other technical job categories, and there  we are seeing wage growth at double-digit rates Other wage increases reportedly range in the 3 to  5 percent area and do not seem, at present anyway, to be presenting a problem  Real estate markets are very tight in downtown Boston Speculative building has  picked up in the western suburbs, given the total lack of class A space downtown Rents are up  everywhere Elsewhere in the region, real estate markets are improved and even quite active,  particularly in suburban Providence, but the sizzle remains confined to the Boston metropolitan  area  Asia is a concern and its impacts are felt in different ways Some see delays and  cancellations of existing orders and some decline in new orders from Asian customers Others see  renewed competition from Asian sources This is reflected in the commentary of a Providence  manufacturer of gold jewelry Finally, still others see risks in the chronic structural problems of  China and Japan, but as I noted earlier, our region does tend to be a little less exposed to Asia than  others  Turning to the national scene, our own forecast has overall GDP growth just below 3  percent in 1998 and has it trending down to our estimate of potential in 1999 We see stable  unemployment over the period and, unlike the Greenbook, we have not made any major changes to  our estimate of trend versus cyclical productivity Thus, we see an uptick in core CPI inflation not    5/19/98  unlike what President Moskow was talking about By that measure, inflation ends up somewhere  in the high 2 percent range by the end of 1999, even when adjusted for changes in measurement  I must say that I have some questions about the Greenbook's forecasts of productivity  and unemployment and the related impact on inflation projections It seems to me that if  productivity trends over the past couple of years, as opposed to looking forward, were truly higher  and the economy's potential greater, unemployment should not have declined as much as it did  over the past two years or so But it did decline from the mid 5 percent range to the mid 4 percent  range I do not know how to measure inflation consistently I wonder if this is a metaphysical  question about whether inflation is actually rising even though we cannot see the rise because the  way the CPI is measured has changed so much The nexus between unemployment and the rising  wage pressures and wage costs on the one hand and final prices on the other is a little muddied  But even given that muddiness, I do think that there is reason to be concerned about the risks to the  inflation forecast It is very difficult to see the expansion slowing as much as it does in the  Greenbook projection and frankly easier to see it speeding along as it has been, with some sizable  risks on the upside with regard to inflation  I would like to pick up on President Boehne's comments in terms of not relying on  any of the individual smoking guns in the financial markets, but when viewed altogether they add  up to a sense of a real risk in those markets as well "
3394,1998-05-19," Mr Chairman, at our last meeting I expressed concern that, even in  the absence of clear indications that inflation was rising, both the strength of the domestic economy  and the frothiness in financial markets required some policy tightening to reduce the risk that even  more tightening might be needed later Nothing has happened since the last meeting to change my  perception of that need If anything, the domestic economy has gotten stronger as have financial  markets Price pressures remain low to be sure, but I continue to believe that this is more the result  of temporary rather than permanent factors It may be that the trend rate of productivity has risen,  and certainly your arguments are very persuasive on that, but I wonder whether productivity will  continue to grow at a rate that will offset inflationary pressures stemming from labor and other  resource constraints  In my view monetary policy is accommodative right now I do not think that so much  because of the level of the stock market, and I totally agree with you, Mr Chairman, that we cannot  really target a particular level of the stock market, and we should not attempt to do so My concern  about an accommodative monetary policy is along the lines of what President Poole just referred to  as the costs of being wrong I think the costs of continuing with an accommodative policy are  fairly large As asset prices escalate, not just in the stock market but elsewhere, their impact on  resource allocation can be negative And the escalation of asset prices can be negative in terms of  its impact on credit quality, on the financial sector more generally, and ultimately on the rest of the  real economy So, with a continuing accommodative monetary policy that we are seeing  anecdotally, even if we don't see it in more traditional measures such as the level of the real interest  rate, I think we run the risk of building problems in the financial sector and in the real economy that  will come back to haunt us    5/19/98  I know that conditions internationally are very tenuous I do not know, however, to  what extent increases in our interest rates at this time would affect events in Indonesia or India or  Pakistan, although I do agree they would have an immediate impact on the dollar/yen rate I don't  know how big it would be, but it might be troublesome It may be, and I will defer to your  judgment, Mr Chairman, that now is not the time to move for various reasons, particularly on the  international side But again, I am really worried about the costs of being wrong If I look back, I  wonder how much difference tighter monetary policy would have made over the last couple of  years In fact, looking at the Asian situation as it has unfolded, how much would tighter conditions  here in the United States have impeded the flow of hot money to Asia that turned out, at least in  part, to be the source of some of the problems in that part of the world?  I truly believe that a conservative, well balanced US economy with solid growth,  low inflation, and low risks is the best prescription for the entire world I hope we are not  sacrificing that by waiting I will agree with your recommendation As I said, I hope we're not  sacrificing something "
3441,1998-08-18," Don't tell Dow Jones!   Second   This is an easy question   What exactly did the Russians do?   To a band?   So they excluded foreign official types of debt?   What about private-sector debt?   Just the external private-sector debt--debt to foreign lenders as  opposed to debt within the country?   Yes, with no laws   Just a small follow-up question, which may be harder Why? Were  they really broke?   So, you think they really did have the $10 billion?    8/18/98 "
3442,1998-08-18," I want to go back to your previous comments about folding in  expectations about Y2K problems into the forecasts In looking through a number of forecasts for  this meeting, I noted that DRI seems to be the only one that explicitly deals with the year 2000  problem However, it does so only in the context of a boom/bust scenario and not in their  alternative scenarios--the baseline and the pessimistic scenarios as they call them The scenario  that they have had for some time puts us behind the curve in 1999, has us increasing fed funds  rates to catch up with inflation at that point, and has the boom/bust scenario aggravated by an  inventory accumulation related to the year 2000 problems I had a feeling that their model results  were rather marginal with regard to that inventory swing, at least insofar as they see the data  They already have a swing taking place in the boom/bust scenario and inventories feed into it in  the same direction Otherwise, inventories do not seem to have much of an impact on their  overall statistical analysis, at least as yet    8/18/98   Only those who read or work on the Internet!   Thank you, Mr Chairman The New England economy remains  strong, but weakness related to Asia and the GM strike and increased labor and real estate market  pressures are evident Unemployment rates for the region's states were a full percentage point  below that for the nation in July, and job growth was a full percentage point above the region's  long-term trend Part of the region's labor market tightness is due to sluggish or even negative  labor force growth in the various New England states in recent months Job growth varies from  state to state; it is virtually flat in Connecticut, Maine, and New Hampshire and up about 3 percent  in Massachusetts  The Asian flu has hit New England manufacturing, with exports to South Korea and  Taiwan dropping about one-third and exports to Japan off almost 10 percent Manufacturing jobs  declined in July for the fourth month in a row, largely due to Asia Business confidence, as  measured by one of the surveys in Massachusetts, fell sharply in June and then again in July;  manufacturers were the main contributors to this fall This survey, Beigebook contacts, and  anecdotal reports all suggest that about half the manufacturers in New England have experienced  undesired inventory buildups and layoffs, again with much of this attributed to the impact of Asia  At the same time, labor markets remain extremely tight Regional consumer prices are  thought to be rising slightly faster than the average for the nation Construction, tourism, and  service jobs are expanding rapidly Real estate markets, especially in Boston though elsewhere as  well, are tighter and commercial vacancy rates are lower Technical engineering workers are hard  to find, even for manufacturing jobs, as are workers in the tourism industry where raiding workers    8/18/98  from competitors is becoming commonplace Large and small employers report being forced to  grant broad wage increases to existing staff when new employees are hired at higher salaries,  especially in technical areas Hiring bonuses are commonplace even for fairly low-level jobs such  as restaurant positions and telemarketing  Commercial and industrial lending at the District's large banks grew at rates about  double that of the nation as a whole, and competition among lenders reportedly remains intense  However, of a large national insurance company,  reports that they see some widening of spreads related to credit quality and the beginnings of some  slight restraint in credit markets That view is reflected a bit in the data, but unfortunately it  seems at odds with the System's survey of senior loan officers  On the national scene, we agree with the projection in the Greenbook of a slowing in  the pace of GDP growth from the first half of 1998 to 1999 However, without a tightening in  interest rates, our estimates suggest somewhat stronger growth averaging above 2-1/2 percent over  the period We do see consumers and businesses affected by Asia, by rising labor costs that are  putting a squeeze on profits, and by a sideways if not slightly lower stock market, all of which  dampens consumer enthusiasm and reins in business spending However, we do not see  unemployment rising to 5 percent nor inflation remaining as quiescent as in the Greenbook  forecast These differences partly reflect different estimates of the economy's potential Ours is a  bit lower than the Board staff's We also assume a somewhat slower rise in unemployment when  GDP is growing at rates below potential This reflects, I think, a greater agnosticism on our part  as to whether the higher rates of productivity growth we have seen are cyclical or more structural  in nature Thus, we do not see unemployment rising above the upper four percent range, and our  estimate of inflation rises to just about 3 percent by the fourth quarter of 1999 Clearly, the data in    8/18/98  our projections suggest a good deal more upside risk on the inflation side than that expected by  the Greenbook, but I would confess to some humility about these projections as well  With that in mind, my concerns at prior meetings about the stance of monetary policy  and the risks associated with the current economic situation have revolved around two issues The  first is that the risk of rising inflation, given tight labor markets, is considerable though hard to see  as yet except in the form of wage increases The second is that financial markets were fueling  speculation that, even in the absence of inflation, could present real risks The inflation risks  remain, and I think the recent data on the domestic side suggest that they are at least as strong as  they were at the time of the last meeting But it seems to me that financial markets, both  nationally and especially internationally, have interjected real notes of caution "
3443,1998-08-18," I, too, am in agreement with your recommendation of alternative B  I have mixed feelings about whether or not to change the symmetry of our directive at this  meeting The reason is that I continue to believe that our next move should be to raise the federal    8/18/98  funds rate, and I think we would be better off right now from the point of view of speculation in  financial markets, credit markets, and real estate markets if we had moved to a tighter policy  stance earlier However, there are a lot of worrisome downside risks right now coming from the  external sector of the economy There is a sense of spreading fragility abroad and a possibility of  a feedback to our own financial markets Given the sense of caution that I feel to a greater degree  now than I did at the last meeting, I think the need for a move has been pushed off until we see  what the impact of various evolving events abroad will be on our economy So, I can go along  with what seems to be the consensus so far that we move to an unbiased directive "
3502,1998-09-29," I am very much in agreement with Presidents Hoenig and Guynn I  favor Option 1, prompt release after a meeting, and simpler language I, too, tried to draft  language that would underscore the concept of risk to which both Tom and Jack seemed to be  referring I also believe that the minutes should be released sooner than 2 or 3 days before the  next meeting, if that is at all possible   On the Russian situation, at least as regards people in the First  District, I believe their concern related more to the lack of a clear bailout in July, though I think  opinions have changed about whether that was a good or a bad thing Obviously, people have  responded to the new stories and the rumors that the last tranche of money that the IMF put into  Russia quickly found its way out of Russia I think they now have a better sense of the wisdom  displayed by the IMF in not putting in more money But as far as the Boston markets were  concerned, to whatever extent they played into the general market trend, the trigger was the lack  of a Russian bailout, at least as people in our area tell me  I know money can disappear along the lines that you talked about, but I do wonder  about some of these spread trades Who is on the other side of them? Isn't somebody making  money on a bet that spreads will widen instead of narrowing? Do we have any sense of who or  where that might be?   And they are paying off those loans now?   Some of it may well be   These gains and losses used to be related to trade and now they  seem to be associated mostly with speculation   Somebody is benefiting from these lower yields   I do not disagree with the nonzero sums My point is that at some  level somebody has benefited from all this   The other question I wanted to ask relates to the sharp rise in  volatilities With regard to volatilities in the stock market, we have concluded on the basis of    9/29/98  some of the work we have been doing on mutual funds over the last two or three years that until  recently volatilities had been lower rather than higher than normal We may be wrong about  that, but I am wondering where we are in terms of some normal level of volatility I'm sure we  are still above such a norm, but are we as far above it as some of the recent volatility charts  show?   Yes, very long term Our sense was that until very recently  volatilities, in stock markets in particular, had not been what they were, let's say, 10 years ago   This level of volatility is not necessarily important in terms of its  immediate economic consequences, but I wanted to understand what the relationships were   I wasn't making a remark so much about trend as about what we  have been observing over the last three or four years in particular    9/29/98   Second   Sounds good   I might mention something that we found out that came as a bit of a  surprise, namely that some of the loans made by some of the large lenders were participated out  So, we see shares in banks in our District of both collateralized and uncollateralized lines to  LTCM/P   I realize that but there were at least two syndicated pools   I was wondering whether any of this showed up in the review of  shared national credits last year "
3503,1998-09-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman Not a lot has changed in New England  during the intermeeting period The regional economy continues to expand nicely, with  respectable job growth vis-a-vis the nation's and very low unemployment rates Labor markets  remain very tight despite August job losses in three of our states and anecdotes abound about the  difficulty of finding qualified workers even at the entry level However, signs of potential  weakness have grown as well Manufacturing jobs declined in four out of the last five months,  though there has been some small year-over-year growth in this job category in contrast to the  nation as a whole Regional merchandise exports declined in the second quarter, though not as  steeply as in the first quarter The largest falloff occurred in exports to South Korea Exports to  Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore were also below year-ago levels as were exports to the United  Kingdom and the Netherlands, but exports from our region to France and Germany were  considerably higher  Uncertainty about the future is greater than earlier this year Manufacturers see  problems now and in the near future while retailers are less concerned about the near term but  see downside risks six months off Volatility in the financial markets has affected regional  commercial real estate trends The greater Boston commercial real estate market remains strong,  with rents of about $30 per square foot, adding together markets inside the city and suburban  markets closely related to Boston However, downtown Class A space is now priced above $40  a square foot and vacancy rates are below 4 percent But as REIT financing has moved from    9/29/98  equity to debt markets, as investors have demanded higher yields on paper backed by  commercial real estate, and as banks have tightened lending standards, new and existing real  estate deals have come under increased pressure In greater Boston and some areas of  Connecticut, about half of 20 recent office building deals are being renegotiated Financing has  not totally dried up, but it has become more expensive as lenders raise their rates to match the  demand for increased yields in bond and syndication markets  Since the period of market volatility in mid-August, I have been regularly canvassing  the CEOs of the region's major banks, one of our insurance companies, and a major mutual fund  to determine first-hand how they see their own business risks and the risks facing markets more  generally These conversations have served to underline three themes that seem interesting to  me First, despite worldwide market volatility, flight to quality, and disclosures of losses,  settlements in global markets have been largely unaffected The CEO of one major global  custodian, which settles in more than 50 countries daily, indicated that he believes the changes in  settlement practices brought about by the events of October 1987 have enabled markets around  the world to withstand this period of instability, at least so far The only problem that his firm  has experienced is related to settlements involving Malaysian securities With the imposition of  currency controls in Malaysia, there were distinctions drawn between residents and nonresidents  Those have prompted the introduction of rather complicated administrative measures But that  is something his firm is well capable of handling  Second, the CEO of the region's one major global bank commented on the recent  widening of spreads and what he sees as a rather significant drying up of liquidity in all markets,  the same phenomenon we have seen in our tables and charts on spreads In that bank's view, the  widening of spreads has been exacerbated at least to some extent by some of the supervisory  letters on credit standards Those letters have been interpreted as a warning about REITs or    9/29/98  cautioning about REITs and what the bank sees as an unexplained downgrading by the OCC of  shared national credits Finally, the bank is especially concerned about market turmoil in Brazil  and Latin America more generally This bank traditionally has benefited from a flight to quality  during periods of financial turmoil in Latin America and regards their own positions as more or  less devaluation proof, but their concerns are heightened nonetheless  Finally, while all those contacted believe the current market retrenchment is overdone,  they also believe that spreads were far too narrow previously So, in some sense they regard the  financial market conditions as in part a return to more normal spreads in the markets, though  there clearly is a concern that the attendant deleveraging will have a near-term contractionary  effect Those organizations that are publicly held have seen a sharp deterioration in the value of  their stocks in the market, though they admit that the four to five times earnings reflected in  previous market valuations probably was a bit high Moreover, institutions that have a track  record of growing by acquisition see a time of potential opportunity, with the prices of smaller  banking and financial institutions becoming more realistic Clearly, even the ill winds of global  financial insecurity may blow some good fortune to those who are positioned to recognize it  On the national scene, we have little to quarrel with in the Greenbook's forecast for  1998 and early 1999 However, we and other forecasters are not as pessimistic as the Greenbook  about the full year 1999 We see a bit higher growth, lower unemployment, and a small pickup  in inflation even without the easing of monetary policy embodied in the Greenbook forecast  These differences result from several factors We have not built in a further drop in stock market  prices from current levels Our estimate of the economy's potential is somewhat lower, resulting  in more pressure from tight labor markets Our assessment is that given profit pressures, wage  increases will begin to show through more directly into prices However, this estimate is fraught  with risk, and I must say that we are very humble about our ability to forecast inflation trends in    9/29/98  particular I am not at all sure that we fully accounted for either the contractionary effects of the  current credit squeeze or the feedback effects of low inflation on future prices Also, I must  admit to finding the pessimistic international scenario at the end of the Greenbook more  reflective of my personal assessment of a likely external outcome Thus, I think the risk to the  Bank's forecast and possibly to the Greenbook's as well is decidedly on the downside despite  relatively upbeat domestic conditions currently "
3504,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation for a 25 basis  point cut I would be more comfortable with a symmetric directive at this point simply because I  think we still are not, as you point out, seeing real evidence of a slowing domestic expansion If  the reality of a rate cut, as opposed to its promise, results in calmer markets--and Don Kohn  suggested that they have calmed a little in recent days--we may see a shorter rather than a longer  period of market turmoil and a return to an economic situation resembling the one that we had in  August At that point, the domestic economy was still displaying a good deal of strength, and we  had some concerns on the upside as well as the downside So, I would be significantly in favor  of a symmetric directive, given that I am not entirely convinced that the economy is headed  down an irrevocably slippery slope I say that despite the fact that the market turmoil is  significant and the overreaction in credit markets has been much greater than we anticipated at  the August meeting "
3568,1998-11-17," I would like to apologize to everyone because I really didn't mean  to complicate needlessly or in any event to extend the discussion to yet another alternative  What I thought I was doing in responding to the request for possible rewording was to include a  reference to the balance of risks in the paragraph On the basis of my notes at the September  meeting, that was an idea that Tom Hoenig brought up and that most of the members appeared to  endorse At least that is what my notes say In any event, the inclusion of a reference to the  Committee's view of the balance of risks is the major difference in my alternative  I differentiate between the ""tilt"" and the ""no tilt"" language In the ""no tilt"" language,  there is an explicit reference to the Committee's perception of risks as being balanced at least for  the intermeeting period and a related belief that no change or a slight upward or downward move  might be equally likely In the ""tilt"" language, the perceived balance of risks is not explicitly  mentioned but is implicit in the Committee's adoption of an upside or a downside tilt Also, I  would agree with Presidents Boehne and Parry and with Governor Kelley with regard to the  desirability of dropping the next to last sentence in Option 2 that starts with ""Any potential  changes"" I don't think it is needed I don't have any pride of authorship, but I do have some  warm and fuzzy feeling for the idea of mentioning the balance of risks in the directive    11/17/98   My intention was that the reference to the economic outlook would  be modified by the subsequent phrase about changes in ""economic, financial, and monetary  conditions"" so that the two expressions would be considered to be equivalent in the context of  that sentence But I see the problem that you're talking about   The choice should be ""moderate"" or ""some moderation""   Mr Chairman, I just wanted to weigh in on the time period  question I am fully in agreement with you and Governor Kelley that we should confine the tilt  sentence to the intermeeting period I changed the language in my alternative to be very explicit  about that So, I think the change that you and President Broaddus have suggested--to insert a  reference to the intermeeting period in the tilt or no tilt sentence--is the right way to go I also  favor taking out the next sentence and then qualifying the reference to the aggregates in the last  sentence by providing alternatives such as ""moderate/some moderation"" to get the potential  range of growth into the discussion of M2 and M3 So, I could go with Option 2 the way it has  been revised today   I want to extend this discussion on volatility just a little further I  totally agree I think that volatility has been used in the past as an estimate of whether the Desk  is doing a good job or not But I think it is useful to see how much volatility there is and how  hard it can be on some days for the Desk to achieve the results that it wants; it does tell us  something So I don't regard that as necessarily a measure of the Desk hitting its stride  operationally or not It is useful to have this information, and I think it tells us a good deal about  what has been going on in the fed funds market, and a good deal about the hesitancy to use the  discount window I agree with President Hoenig and President McDonough that we should  review the use of the discount window once again, but I must say that as long as the media can  learn who is using the discount window, or make guesses that turn out to be reasonably accurate,  there is going to be a continuing hesitancy to use the discount window   What test are we going to use for that?   With regard to indexed securities, I must say that I am not  enamored with them I thought that the decision to begin issuing them just as we were getting  inflation under control did not say anything very positive about economic policy in the United  States However, the fact is they exist, and if we are going to get any useful information out of  them, we should treat them like other Treasury securities So, I am in agreement with Peter  Fisher's suggestion Maybe over time they will be useful; I have my doubts but maybe   So move "
3569,1998-11-17," A question for Karen Johnson When the Brazil agreement was  announced recently, although the way it was discussed was confusing, there seemed to be at least  a portion of it that was going to be handled under what might be characterized as a new  philosophy that was incorporated in either the G-7 agreement or the Treasury's statements on the  subject Is some of the financing going to be distributed faster?   So, to get to the heart of the matter, you mentioned the IMF review  in February   They could get money before that   Okay   All derived from by the model, of course   Thank you, Mr Chairman The New England economy continues  to perform quite well, but growth is slowing and uncertainty seems to occupy a larger proportion  of anecdotal conversations Nonetheless, at least for some areas of New England, notably  Greater Boston, some slowing could be welcome if it increases commercial vacancy rates, if it  stabilizes or slows the growth in home prices and apartment rents, if it puts a brake on medical  cost increases, and if it adds a little more breathing room to the labor markets  It is not quite a tale of two cities But with international and financial uncertainty  hitting some firms and others hampered only by their inability to get workers, one can get a very  different picture of New England depending on where the data originate and whom one talks to  New England labor markets remain quite tight, with employment growth slower than the nation's  but a bit faster than historical levels, and unemployment rates well below the national average  Employment growth varies considerably by industry Construction, tourism, finance, insurance,  and real estate employment are growing at solid rates, while manufacturing employment has  declined in six of the last seven months Gillette, Raytheon, and Pratt and Whitney have    11/17/98  announced layoffs as have a number of smaller firms These layoffs appear to be very closely  related to the spreading ripples of the Asian situation  Retail contacts, as well as those in a wide range of high-tech businesses, report  difficulties in attracting and retaining workers even for seasonal jobs, and firms have reported  slowing growth due to a lack of new employees This at least partially reflects a reversal in the  growth of the region's labor force due to a decline in the participation rate and a decrease in net  in-migration from other states There is, however, no translation that we can see from the  arguably tighter-than-average labor market in New England to generally higher wages than those  paid in the nation as a whole, except in certain industries  The Boston CPI rose by 26 percent, a little higher than the national rate, but this  difference seems almost totally the result of medical care cost increases, which climbed almost 9  percent over the past year  As of the second quarter, the region's merchandise exports were 3 percent below a  year earlier, but almost all of this decline was concentrated in Asian markets Consumer and  business confidence, while still positive, reflects the possibility of reduced growth in spending  and economic activity Most of this involves readings of future expectations, however, with both  consumers and businesses positive about the current picture but uncertain about the future  Financial market volatility clearly has played a role in heightening the levels of uncertainty  Some continue to see this period as simply a swing back from the very low spreads of the  summer, while others are concerned that liquidity is not back to normal levels and that funding  constraints could hamper future economic growth But here again the story varies quite a lot  depending on whom you speak to    11/17/98  Money managers are worried, to say the least, but small businesses continue to report  a great deal of competition among banks for their business Some bankers believe that the  supervisory message of concern about REIT and other real estate lending is really affecting their  business, as no New England banker who survived the regulatory travails of the early 1990s  wants to go down that road again On the other hand, a major real estate developer told me  recently ""the markets have saved us from ourselves"" Clearly, speculative real estate deals  throughout the region are now on hold, a welcome sign given the speculative excess that  preceded the early 1990s recession  Commercial and industrial lending shows little in the way of slowing, however Based  on data from the three large banks in the region, C&I loan growth has reached nearly double the  pace of the nation's in recent weeks, with some tightening of standards at one institution but  none at the other two Clearly, First District banks have helped to pick up the slack from the  tightening of bond markets, particularly as it affected non-investment-grade borrowers In sum,  while conditions by industry are mixed and the various states and cities in the region have their  own particular stories, the New England economy continues to grow and thrive--perhaps at a  slower pace--not unlike the national picture  Turning to the nation, we agree with the Greenbook that the economy seems poised to  make a transition to a lower growth path Job growth is slowing; consumer sentiment is off a bit  but still at a rather high level; the personal saving rate may not remain negative; and business  fixed investment should slow given the rise in wages and lower, if not negative, profit margins  We agree that an inventory correction probably looms ahead, but the size of the correction  projected in the Greenbook and its suddenness seem to us a little large We also believe equity    11/17/98  prices may flatten or fall, given the profit picture, and that this will feed back to consumer  spending as families feel less wealthy  However, when we take all these factors together, our forecast puts us about at  potential for the fourth quarter and for 1999, albeit with a lower unemployment rate than the  Greenbook and some uptick in core CPI even without the additional 25 basis point ease that is  incorporated in the Greenbook forecast We do not think this is a particularly bad outcome We  think it is not inconsistent with the rebound in equity prices, the reduction in risk spreads, and the  current strength in motor vehicle sales, durable goods orders, and retail sales In fact, there is  some risk that growth in the near term could be stronger, particularly if the stock market  increases hold, consumer spending remains healthy, inventory accumulation in the third quarter  turns out to be more intended than unintended, and financial panic dissipates as it now seems to  be doing In that event, we might see a good deal stronger picture in 1999 than we project  We do admit that there are downside risks Equity prices could fall further than either  we or the Greenbook project Various aspects of the external environment could turn more  sharply negative, particularly in Brazil and Japan The financial panic could resume  Consumers and businesses could retrench to a greater degree than now seems likely Moreover,  it also seems that financial markets remain fragile, at least for the near term There is some  widespread expectation that we will ease either now or at our next meeting to address that  fragility However, I believe we do not want to go all the way back to the conditions in the credit  market that existed earlier this year Those were no more healthy than the current degree or the  previous degree of fragility    11/17/98  I think we face a delicate balance given the rebound on the equity side and given the  strength in consumer spending, at least in the short run So, in that regard I believe that  vigilance, which has served us well for most of this year, may continue to be the answer now "
3570,1998-11-17," As I noted in my earlier comments, after a difficult balancing  process in thinking about this, I came to this meeting clearly in favor of waiting to see what  happens for the rest of this quarter and considering a possible move in December I have listened  very carefully to all of the arguments I do believe that we face some risks that relate to the  ebullience in the stock market and the feedback from rising levels of stock market prices into  consumer confidence and spending Sooner or later, that is going to come to a halt I think we  are all in agreement on that The prospects for profit margins just are not where they were earlier  in this cycle Sooner or later, reason is going to prevail Governor Kelley's comments earlier on  that topic were right along the line of my thinking If the stock market does not go a whole lot  higher, we are better off than if it does because eventually the rise will come to a halt and the  overall impact on the economy will be worse at that time So, I think that is one of the risks we  face if we move at a time when a lot of the basic signals from the domestic economy, the real  economy, are showing resilience if not strength, which almost everybody has commented on  I also think that almost everything that has happened since our last monetary policy  move--the intermeeting ease that I think was extremely well done in the sense of getting the  markets to function better than they were--has been on the positive side It seems a little strange  at this point to be thinking about a further easing of policy against a lot of the positive  developments, although all of them involve a significant degree of downside risk I see a process  where easing now creates a risk in the short term that things could get a little beyond us  Whereas over the longer term, if the slowdown in the expansion occurs and if financial  conditions turn more negative than we expect, we might see more of a downward ratcheting of  the economy than if we had not moved    11/17/98  Those are my basic concerns My thinking is more in line with that of President  Broaddus, but I am not going to dissent because I think it's a close call The people who are  closer to the markets than I are worried about year-end financing and overall fragility and  uncertainty, and I know that has been factored into your thinking as well, Mr Chairman There  is something to be listened to there, so I will support your proposal to ease, but I am nervous  about it "
3630,1998-12-22," I think the compromise makes a lot of sense as a way to try out a  simple recitation of the reason why no policy change was made I have long felt that no policy  change is as much a decision as a change in policy is--that there is a policy content to whatever  we do at all of our meetings At times it could be very useful, as you have suggested, to release  an explanatory statement I think the experience we had with the short statement after our last  meeting gave us an indication that this could be quite positive in terms of how the market reacts  to what we are doing In that case, the statement was made in the context of a policy change  Still, it provided a little explanation of it, and that gives us some insight into how a simple  discussion of the understandings of the Committee beyond no policy change would be reacted to  in the future So to me it is very definitely a step well worth taking  I also agree with your view that making a major move in what we say to the public  about what we are doing without full consensus, without everybody buying in, could potentially  be a real problem and that we could not go back "
3631,1998-12-22," We had several area academic economists in for a meeting a week  or so ago, including some from MIT and Harvard, and I had some people from the investment  community in for breakfast earlier this week Almost everybody's projection for the fourth    12/22/98 16  quarter is well above 31 percent Many are hedging their bets, saying fourth-quarter growth is  likely to be in the 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent range But at least a couple of people who usually are on  track on this had point projections above 4 percent I wonder what you think about that type of  projection and what it means for early 1999   So you think the balance of the risks is on the upside?   My own investigations in the last couple of weeks would suggest  that they are in Bloomingdales! [Laughter]   I don't know There's lots of inventory there   Thank you, Mr Chairman There is not a whole lot new in New  England, at least since the last Committee meeting The regional economy continues to grow,  albeit at a pace a bit lower than earlier in the year Unemployment varies by state but in the  aggregate is about a percentage point lower than in the rest of the country Job growth, in  contrast, is slower than in the nation as a whole, with New Hampshire having fewer jobs than a  year ago for the second month in a row  As I noted at the last meeting, some of this slowness in job growth reflects the region's  demographic trends Population in New England simply grows more slowly than in the rest of  the nation We frequently hear stories that growth in certain industries, medical care for  example, is hampered by the lack of available labor supply The fastest growing industries in the  region continue to be construction, the general area of finance, and services Manufacturing jobs  declined in all six states again in October, reflecting a decrease, we think, in merchandise exports  to the troubled Asian areas    12/22/98  Defense-intensive industries by contrast added employment, even in the generally  weaker environment for manufacturing We think this is because national defense spending is  scheduled to rise in real terms in fiscal year 1999 after more than a decade of decline The jury  is out on how this will affect the New England defense industry, but there is at least some  prospect that major firms will hold their own  Real estate markets, especially in Boston, remain relatively upbeat Speculative  construction has largely halted but some new space is coming on line nonetheless Wall Street  financing dried up during the late summer and fall market turmoil but other investors filled the  gap, albeit at higher financing rates Outside the Boston metropolitan area, both residential and  commercial real estate markets are more mixed Residential construction slowed a bit and new  home sales were down despite the quite advantageous financing situation  On the commercial side, Hartford continues to be soft That probably explains in part  the city's willingness to give away the store to the New England Patriots! But New Haven and  Stamford, and the State of Rhode Island are all doing well Lending at the region's largest banks  remained quite strong, particularly on the commercial and industrial side, where quarterly  annualized growth rates were 35 percent versus around 20 percent for the nation as a whole  This largely reflects growth in C&I lending at the Bank of Boston where customers chose to  access credit lines in the fall when Wall Street financing became difficult or impossible to come  by  Finally, as I mentioned before, we held a meeting of the Bank's academic advisory  council last week with several of the deans of the economics profession in attendance Opinions  in the group were divided about prospects for the economy Some believed, based on this  quarter's surprising strength, the tightness of labor markets, and the ease in monetary and    12/22/98 29  financial conditions, that 1999 could test whether 39 percent unemployment is compatible with  price stability Others saw the risks more on the downside, with a negative saving rate, declining  corporate profits, and the troubled external sector posing threats and trimming growth to rates  below potential However, there was almost no support for further near-term easing even among  those who perceive the downside risks as significant A wait-and-see policy was counseled  There also was concern that financial and especially stock market conditions might have been  accorded too much weight in monetary policymaking of late  Turning to the national outlook, we were pleased to see the change in the Greenbook  forecast from November The Greenbook now projects rates of GDP growth and levels of  unemployment in 1999 that are quite close to our own We differ a bit on the inflationary path,  as we have over time But we have been continually wrong in that area, so I must say I am a bit  humble in that regard  Overall, both the Greenbook and our own forecast describe an economic picture that  may be the best of all possible outcomes a relatively smooth slowdown in the expansion with  very few downside risks, on the domestic front anyway The question is whether this outcome  will actually occur Others have spoken about risks and I, too, think that there are large risks  And they occur on both sides On the plus side, the momentum from 1998 could propel growth  in 1999 and tighten labor markets further In this scenario, consumers would not retrench and  the negative impact of a slowing economy might not affect corporate profits as significantly If  this coincided with some luck on the external side--if Japan's growth, for example, turned  slightly positive or the euro acted as a major positive for growth in ""Euroland""--then conditions  might be right for an even greater spurt of inflationary pressure than we project    12/22/98 30  On the downside, and maybe more significant in terms of probability, growth could be  slower if consumers did decide that the risks posed by higher layoffs, declining corporate profits,  and a volatile stock market require them to save more and spend less than projected Waning  corporate profits could cause the stock market to decline sharply rather than to move roughly  sideways, as we and the Greenbook have projected, and could encourage further consumer  retrenchment Bad luck on the external side--Brazil, for example--could well add to the negative  effect  As I consider these risks both on the upside and the downside, I must say I am struck  by the high cost of being wrong From where we are now, necessary policy changes to correct  situations could well produce negative results, at least initially If US and world growth is  stronger than projected, it seems inevitable that financial markets will soar and inflationary  pressures will rise The question will be whether we can intervene in time Policy correction  runs the not inconsiderable risk of producing a boom/bust scenario If growth is slower, further  easing might well be necessary However, at least in the short run given current market  conditions, an easing could propel markets to new highs only to risk a sharper correction later  The Greenbook forecast assumes no change in policy and our forecast does as well; and for right  now that seems to be the best course But I think we all better hope that the forecast is right  because it seems, to me anyway, that the room to maneuver in the case of error is very small "
3632,1998-12-22," I also agree with your recommendation of ""B"" symmetric I  agonized before, so I'm not going to do it now   The agony of bananas!   I, too, favor option 3 I feel very strongly about taking out ""in  coming months"" for the reasons that Governor Kelley and President Broaddus stated earlier As  for the M2 and M3 sentence, it could go or stay; I don't have a strong opinion But since  monetary trends do seem to provide us with some information, at least at the present time, on  balance I come down in favor of keeping it in   We need a debate between Governors Meyer and Kelley "
3680,1999-03-30," Mike, in the introduction to your comments you implied that   the forecast does not reflect in some way a belief in the “new economy” But over the   last three or four years I have seen your trend rate of productivity growth first go down to   less than 1 percent--say, to about 07 to 09 percent--and then just about double to where   it is now Two questions If you were a believer in the “new economy,” how high would   that number be?  [Laughter] And second, if in fact productivity growth had been a little   more stable than that and what we are seeing is really more cyclical, how sensitive is the   timing of the inflation increase in your forecast?  Could inflation actually rise by ½   percentage point later this year?    Sorry The second part of the question is If you were to   take a trend productivity number that was slightly less than the one you have now--let’s   say 17 percent--how sensitive is your inflation forecast in terms of the timing?  You have   inflation up by about ½ percentage point or something like that by the end of 2000 With   a lower productivity number would that increase actually occur a lot sooner?    Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity continues   unabated in New England Labor markets continue to be tight, with the unemployment   rate for the region more than a percentage point below that of the nation Employment   growth continues above trend for the region, but it is still below that for the nation   Research done at the Bank attributes this lower level of job growth to a lack of labor   supply This is confirmed by anecdotal reports in which almost every type of worker is   said to be hard to find However, except for high-tech workers, wage increases are in the   3 to 6 percent range, depending on the industry In addition, growth in the Boston area’s   CPI seems to have moderated It had been rising faster than the nation as a whole but it   now appears to be matching the national experience   Staff at the Bank spent some time since the last FOMC meeting talking with   temporary help firms in New England in an effort to understand their perspectives on   local and national labor markets The five firms contacted reported strong demand and   difficult supply conditions; that is, their clients were requesting additional employees and   workers were very hard to come by Nonetheless, firms reported increases both in   workers on assignment and revenues, with wages rising steadily Three of the five firms   noted that they are unable to increase client charges as much as wages, so profits are   being squeezed The tone of these conversations was much more upbeat than when the   last contacts were made in November Several of the firms contacted act both as   recruiters for permanent staff and as suppliers of temporary help They report that the     3/30/99 19   mix of assignments is shifting toward permanent positions Early in the recovery,   temporary help seemed cheaper and labor was more plentiful Now it has become more   difficult and expensive to find temporary workers and to deal with the inevitable issues of   high turnover and training costs   Real estate markets remain strong Residential construction surged in   December and likely in January as well because of good weather Existing home sales   dipped a bit and price increases moderated, at least as reflected in regional data   Anecdotally, however, house prices are said to be rising rapidly in the Boston metro area   And we could use a few of the apartments that they are building in Dallas! Commercial   real estate supplies have expanded a bit with the addition of some new space, and   vacancy rates in Boston have leveled out, albeit at very low numbers As I have noted   before, there is not a lot of speculative building going on; credit market conditions over   the past year have not made financing speculative new projects very easy Thus, the   business of commercial real estate remains “very sweet” in the words of one contact, with   strong demand and high rents   One item of local interest relates to the continuing decline in manufacturing   jobs in the region Manufacturing jobs appeared to be on the rise marginally in early   1998 but now are declining faster than for the nation as a whole This captures the   attention of local people who, despite very low unemployment rates, see this as a   negative trend Growth in construction jobs, albeit from a low base, and in retail trade   and services has more than absorbed the decline in manufacturing jobs However, many   do not see service jobs in particular as the equivalent of those in manufacturing This is a   topic that has engaged local labor leaders and politicians, especially considering that tax   breaks granted over the past two to three years were directed at manufacturing firms and   were given in the expectation of keeping jobs in the states of the region Credit market   conditions continue to be regarded as favorable, with spreads wider than a year ago but   funding readily available Local lending growth has declined since last fall, in line with   national trends I spent some time recently with two partners of local venture capital   firms, one specializing in high-tech start-ups and the other in larger firms in the     3/30/99 20   entertainment and media areas They both noted that deals were being made at extremely   rich prices and that new entrants into their businesses were winning deals based on offers   that to these two contacts seemed nonsensical In the words of one, “This is a time for   selling, not buying” A former Bank director and partner in another very large venture   capital firm corroborated these accounts and noted that his firm is completely out of the   market for the time being, as they were in the late 1980s Several people in the   investment community with whom I meet regularly echoed this cautionary tone They all   view economic conditions and financial markets as frothy, bordering on excessive Their   sense was one of times being too good and a concern about what will happen when the   party stops Certainly, the fact that we were meeting as the bombing in Kosovo was   intensifying did not help this sense of foreboding   On the national scene, our forecast is not terribly different from the   Greenbook’s on the growth side However, we see a bit more stable trend rate of   productivity growth and thus a decline in the unemployment rate to a little less than 4   percent--39 percent in 1999 Q4 We also see inflation rising earlier than does the   Greenbook, though, as I’ve said before, we have to be humble about any projection on   that front   I am puzzled by the moderation in wage inflation in the last couple of months   and confounded by the strength I see everywhere except in pricing power Downside   risks on the international side seem to have moderated considerably and we, like the   Greenbook, have a slightly higher external growth forecast than we did in January   However, we do continue to see a drag on growth of about ½ percentage point or maybe   a little greater than that from the external deficit in 1999 as a whole   On the other hand, considerable risk remains that growth will exceed current   estimates for the first half of this year, driven by consumer spending on houses, cars, and   other durable goods The stock market remains exuberant, to say the least; credit is   plentiful; and the boom in interest-sensitive sectors suggests that the cost of capital is too   low It is true that inflation is also quite low, and therein lies the issue The exuberance   of the economy may well come back to haunt us, even if inflation does not take off in the     3/30/99 21   near term To paraphrase William McChesney Martin The party seems to be in   progress and the question now is, “When can the punch bowl justifiably be taken away?”  "
3681,1999-03-30," I agree with your position on policy, Mr Chairman I might   be a little more comfortable with an asymmetric as opposed to a symmetric directive, but   if I had a vote, I probably could live with a symmetric directive as well For some time I   have been concerned about what I referred to in my comments earlier as a party building   up again, as it clearly was at this time last year I think the stance of policy is   contributing to that I don’t think we are seeing the party as much as we may ultimately   see it in the real estate markets, but we certainly are seeing it in other asset markets The   price-earnings ratios may be appropriate because they do reflect expectations of a better   return on capital going forward than we have had in the past, and that may have to do   with major changes in productivity I am a bit agnostic about all of that But I think it is   possible that we will have significant problems with our economy working itself up   higher and higher without seeing signs of inflation, so that ultimately when conditions do   change--either we tighten or something else happens--the fall may be a lot farther than   we would otherwise experience We saw that in Japan We are not like Japan; a lot of   things separate us, not the least of which is the health of the financial sector in our   economy versus the Japanese situation But I think there are some lessons to be learned   from the Japanese experience   Also, with regard to your comments about Kosovo, I think the rest of the world   is looking to us for leadership That leadership goes to our stance on the economy   broadly speaking, with respect to financial markets as well as everything else And in   that regard I would opt, actually, for a more conservative rather than a less conservative     3/30/99 64   position, given what is going on in the rest of the world So, as I said, I can live with   your recommendation for now I just hope we have our eye on the ball and don’t wait   until we see significant signs of inflation before we decide to move, because at that point   it might well be too late  "
3724,1999-05-18," I think we did some variant of that for smaller institutions at   the time of the New England banking crisis We can do these things fairly fast but it is   hard to do so for multiple institutions fairly fast    The other issue we have been tracking on a monthly basis is   how many banks versus how many thrifts have filed their documentation and pledged   collateral We are at close to 70 percent on the banks The thrifts are the concern    Certainly not on the cash side    We have that worry, too  "
3725,1999-05-18," I have a couple of questions about some issues that have been   talked about already First, on the Y2K effect, you have GDP growth moving from   somewhere in the high 2 percent to the middle 3 percent area through 1999 down   effectively to zero in the first quarter of 2000 That seems to be driven both by the   change in business inventories and the change in consumer expenditures on nondurables,   which in some sense is a double whammy I am sure it is extremely well thought out   [laughter] but it just seems--   I was just wondering whether people will be building up an   inventory at home of some of the same things that businesses will be building and how   much double counting there might be    The other thing I wanted to ask you about is the distinction   you draw between the productivity that is driven by additional demand and that which   reflects some underlying trend increases I am wondering how it is that we can be at all   sure about that I know from our own business advisory councils that in many different   industries people are beginning to say they are in a sense hanging on by their fingernails   They don’t want to add people; they don’t want to add to costs; they are driving their own   production facilities as fast and as hard as they can In our own Bank the volumes in our   check-clearing operations recently are double our normal volumes for a variety of   reasons And I have heard stories from employees at breakfast about staff running pell-  mell to the elevators with cartloads full of checks to try to make the courier times because   processing has been so much heavier than usual I don’t think this has anything to do   with the economy; it has to do with banking reorganization in our District Our own   productivity undoubtedly looks really great right now, but we would not be able to   continue to move this volume of checks out the door for very long Reconcilement issues   and other kinds of issues would come back to bite us if we did that for very long I am   just wondering how you tell the difference    And they would be entry workers    Right     5/18/99 24    Thank you, Mr Chairman New England’s economy   remains much the same as it has been for the last several meetings The region’s job   growth continued to be slower than the nation’s but the unemployment rate is well below   the nation’s as well The supply of labor continues to be a concern Jobs would grow   faster if there were people to fill them Wages, however, still don’t reflect this lack of   supply; in fact, almost everywhere one is greeted with anecdotes about how business is   coping by offering largely non-wage incentives--training and that sort of thing--to keep   employees Manufacturing jobs continue to decline at a faster pace in New England than     5/18/99 41   nationally However, merchandise exports are picking up, particularly to the Asian   region Manufacturers also report raw material cost increases and not just in oil   Aluminum, copper, silicon, oil-based products, chemicals, paper, leather, and other such   inputs are all rising in price Some manufacturers are now beginning to talk about trying   to increase profit margins They are perhaps not ready to raise prices as yet, but there is   talk about price increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent   Residential real estate markets are very active, especially in the Boston area   Rents are rising precipitously and house prices are up New home building, particularly   in the suburbs, is focused on very high-end homes Commercial real estate is healthy as   well We are beginning to see new hotel and office building construction in Boston   proper and in the surrounding areas, as well as some speculative building   Over the course of the last several weeks we’ve had many opportunities to   discuss Y2K issues with banks and businesses, large and small, around New England In   general, banks are confident about their own readiness and that of their large customers   On the inventory side, by no means is there a consensus on the need to build inventories   as the year comes to an end Rather, most comments reflect a rather balanced view, and   many see the challenge not so much in Y2K terms but in the normal inventory planning   for year-end Cash inventories at banks seem to be a special case, however In that   regard there is much concern about consumer panic and much encouragement for   whatever proactive statements or action the Fed can take to calm things down   We recently held a meeting of the Bank’s Academic Advisory Council which,   as you all know, includes two or three Nobel Prize winners and people from Harvard,   MIT, Yale, and so forth The discussion focused on issues related to productivity growth,   labor market tightness, and asset market bubbles The group was lively, to say the least   But some consensus was reached on the need for action that might take the wind out of   asset markets, even in the absence of tighter monetary policy, perhaps through increased   margin requirements or increased supervisory oversight on credit extended, particularly   in the day trading operations   On the national scene, the Greenbook forecast with its higher growth, stable   and very low unemployment rates, and inflation that only creeps up in 2000, strains   credibility Yes, we can agree that productivity has improved over the last two or three     5/18/99 42   years or so, and that for a time anyway the potential of the economy to grow without   inflation might be 3 percent or so versus the roughly 2½ percent we had thought   However, even given that, with about the same growth we see unemployment falling to   the high 3 percent area and inflation ticking up by year-end 1999 Even if that forecast is   viewed with some level of agnosticism--and here I should say “wolf” along with Al   Broaddus--credit conditions are now coming back to the narrower spreads and are   reminiscent of the ease we had last summer At the same time, corporate debt is soaring   along with household debt True, affordability is better than in the late 1980s and banks   are supplying less of the credit and are better capitalized, but the signs of excess are   beginning to show Stock markets, real estate markets, and corporate and personal debt   may not all be similarly extended, but they are getting there Thus, whether one comes at   this economy with concerns about inflation or concerns about imbalances and excesses, I   think the concerns are real and actions related to policy corrections need to be considered,   if not taken  "
3726,1999-05-18," Mr Chairman, I too think that your recommendation is a   step in the right direction But, like President Broaddus, I would be more comfortable     5/18/99 63   with an increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate that would in effect undo the last   decrease that we made last fall I think such a reversal could easily be justified in our   public statement without reference to the CPI increase; we could say that it reflects the   stability--in fact, the improvement--that has occurred in our financial markets since last   fall   Looking back to a year ago, we had an asymmetric directive toward tightening   for three months or so, as Governor Kelley has reminded us We were facing an outlook   at that time that we never expected to be as good as the situation we are facing now We   have witnessed a recovery from many of the problems that the economy was   experiencing during the fall I for one hope they cannot be repeated, at least in terms of   their seriousness At this point I think we are looking at underlying levels of demand and   labor market pressures that are far greater than those we were seeing last year at this time   and a monetary policy that is definitely easier   So in my view there is a good case to be made for increasing the funds rate and   taking back that last decrease If we go ahead with the tilt, which appears to be the likely   action at this meeting, I agree that announcing our decision would be desirable Don   Kohn made one striking comment, I thought, about the fact that there would undoubtedly   be a rally if we did not make an announcement  That is the last thing we need at this   point So, if we go ahead with the tilt, we definitely should publish    Let’s all go away for October!    That’s good It gets in all the elements  "
3781,1999-08-24," Peter, I don’t have a problem with the proposed change in the limits   under the SOMA securities lending program, but I do have a question Apparently you have   identified more than one dealer misusing the program, trying to gain some kind of   dominance in a particular issue at a particular time I know that in such cases you disallow   their participation in the program until they give some evidence of having changed their   strategy, but I just wonder whether that’s a significant enough punishment There are   aspects of this that go to the Salomon situation I wonder whether their primary dealer   relationship should be at stake    That will help    That is basically what was suggested in the memo    I just want to speak to that issue and partly to the issue you raised at   the outset, Mr Chairman My own view is that there is a very big gap at present between   reality and perception, particularly in the markets The reality is that at least with regard to   US domestic markets, things are in really good shape, as you’ve pointed out There’s a   very low probability of a big problem--though we’re likely to see glitches here and there--at   least in my view The perception, however, is focused a little more heavily on that   probability and there is also this self-reinforcing logic in the market that is making   everybody really nervous about having no liquidity in the fourth quarter of the year   I hear this from a lot of different sources--from State Street and other investment   people in the First District I was at a conference last week in Aspen and among the market   people there I heard this sort of chatter It gets worse every time it is discussed in the sense   of feeding into people’s fears So I think this proposal, as well as the others, is a very good   way of closing that gap between reality and perception These actions should make market   participants comfortable that even if there are little glitches, we are going to go out of our   way to make sure that we can either inject or sop up excess liquidity so that funding will be   available in the fourth quarter if they need it In particular, I feel strongly that the use of tri­  party arrangements is a great idea, particularly since it allows us to operate after the close of   the book entry wire If reserves need to be absorbed, the Desk can handle it Bringing this   issue before the Committee was a really good idea The writing of the memo in its entirety   was extremely well done It was very interesting and provided a lot of information for us to   evaluate, and it contained some pretty original and useful suggestions on how to deal with   this problem  The sooner we can announce something to the dealer community along these   lines the better off we are going to be because the gap I mentioned would start to close     8/24/99 16    While I recognize that there is some risk on the opposite side, let me   relay an anecdote from a recent conversation with a very senior person at one of the major   investment banks who is responsible for a lot of their funding operations He said, after an   anguished discussion about all of the fourth-quarter concerns those in the investment bank   community have, and I quote, “We will not be heroes” His comment was quite passionate   and heartfelt By showing that we are willing to be more innovative and a little fleeter of   foot than usual and that we are willing to work with them on the details, I think we could be   a bit of a hero And we should be as the central bank As a side point I would reiterate what   Tom Hoenig said in that I’d love to hear what the details are after you’ve had your   discussions with the dealers Not to be doing this would really risk a lot of potential damage   in the period around the turnover to the new millennium I’m very much in favor of this, as   I’ve said before    Hear, hear!     8/24/99 36  "
3782,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic growth in New England   remains about the same as it has been for some months Employment is expanding at a bit   above what could be considered a normal rate for the region and unemployment rates in all   six states are quite low In fact, New Hampshire is one of only a few states in the country   with an unemployment rate below 3 percent, and the rates in Connecticut and Massachusetts   are close to that level as well The regional labor force grew by about 1 percent during the   first half of the year versus the same period in 1998, as opposed to a decline in 1998 versus   1997 And labor force participation remains above that for the United States as a whole     8/24/99 43   Thus, there may be reasons for less concern that the lack of availability of labor will be a   deterrent to regional growth   Contacts continue to report average wage increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent   notwithstanding tight labor markets As I’ve noted before, there is a wider use of flexible or   performance-based pay increases, as well as non-monetary incentives such as increased   training for staff Recently, we’ve also noticed that some firms are using pay strategies that   seem particularly unsustainable for the longer run For example, one firm noted that it was   attracting new hires with a combination of signing bonuses, performance sharing, stock   options, and relocation packages, while existing employees were getting small or no wage   increases This would not work at a Reserve Bank for very long and I doubt it is going to   work there either!   Regional price growth has recently been moderate The July data now show prices in   the Boston area, as measured by the CPI, growing at a pace somewhat faster than the nation   in almost all categories In particular, medical costs are growing at better than a 4 percent   pace Despite these CPI data, regional contacts still report very little pricing power, given   the competitive nature of the economy There continues to be a real effort to improve   productivity and to control the cost of inputs by managing suppliers’ prices-- “à la Wal-  Mart,” as one contact put it Residential real estate sales slowed a bit, largely because of a   lack of supply and a shortage of construction workers and building supplies Not   surprisingly, the prices of new and existing homes for sale rose at a rate above that for the   nation as a whole Reportedly, some of this increase also reflects high demand for   expensive second homes in the region   Looking forward, measures of state business confidence and consumer confidence are   very high New England consumers apparently continue to view current conditions as either   as good as it gets or perhaps too good to last, since the future expectations component of the   confidence index is lower than the measure of current conditions Finally, business   confidence is close to an all-time high and has not been near current levels since early 1998   Manufacturing as well as nonmanufacturing industries report strong confidence on both the   current and the future basis One very interesting side comment in our contacts with   manufacturers this month was their perspective on inventory building for Y2K Several   mentioned that they saw few problems with domestic suppliers but were concerned about     8/24/99 44   foreign sources Thus, they expected to build inventories largely in the form of imports   Perhaps if this tendency is widespread, it could begin to account for some of the unexpected   worsening in the trade deficit in recent months   On the national scene, we are largely in agreement with the Greenbook forecast We   view the second-quarter slowdown as an aberration, not the beginning of a trend, and see the   rest of the year and 2000 much along the same lines as the Greenbook As I’ve noted   before, we see a bit more inflation risk, largely driven by wage costs, which do seem to be   turning up a bit--whether in the latest ECI data, average hourly earnings, or the purchasing   managers’ data Moreover, I am not as sanguine as is the Greenbook about the recent   increase in oil prices backing off in 2000   Last week I attended a conference that involved public and private sector participants   from a variety of areas around the world One CEO of a major foreign oil company and a   senior investment banker specializing in trading commodities spoke about their expectations   for oil prices Both believe that neither Brent nor West Texas Intermediate prices are likely   to back off much from current levels in 2000 and could overshoot a bit before falling back   as the year-end approaches They regard current levels as not ideal for producers, but as   reflective of a balance between providing sufficient income for the major current suppliers   while not enough to attract new high-cost providers The main concern they cited was   managing production to adapt to expected further increases in world demand while keeping   prices relatively stable   Thus, I think we are seeing the gradual unwinding of many of the temporary factors   that have contributed to the economy’s extended period of success World growth is   accelerating, commodity prices are increasing, the dollar is more likely to weaken, and wage   costs are growing To be sure, continued productivity growth helps, and overall measures of   inflation have not yet accelerated But the need to be proactive and forward thinking   remains It is true, as we discussed earlier, that financial markets have been fragile and   volatile of late Nevertheless, some widening of spreads is not unhealthy nor is a   moderation in the continuing upward trend in stock market indices and PE ratios--though,   given yesterday’s market behavior, one wonders if that actually has happened One antidote   to this volatility, however, may well be a greater certainty about the stance of Fed policy in     8/24/99 45   the short run, both our stance with respect to interest rates and our stance with regard to   Y2K   Finally, one keeps hearing comments about even the small amount of tightening in   monetary policy we’ve implemented already or may be contemplating as being anti-growth   Certainly, I’ve heard it from my own directors  However, there is good reason to believe   that proactive monetary policy--monetary policy that anticipates rather than waits for   inflation to occur--is more supportive of stable growth than the alternative of potentially   letting inflation get out of hand Thank you  "
3783,1999-08-24," I, too, very much agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Although I might be a bit more inclined than others to view the prospects for increases in   interest rates as more probable rather than less probable, at this point in time I think it is   important to make a move and give some indication of then standing pat for a while I   believe that would be very helpful in terms of overall market conditions I think President   McDonough is right on target in saying that it would be to our advantage to have monetary   policy close to where we want it as we go into the last part of the year, which is going to be   a tricky period  "
3830,1999-10-05," Don Kohn in the Bluebook discussion and you in your discussion of the   weekly data referred to the rather positive impact, in terms of spreads and so forth, of your   announcement of these year-end facilities to deal with Y2K uncertainties But there has been a   bounceback subsequent to that What do we know about that?  Is that Y2K-related or is it   reflective of credit market conditions?    But do you really have a sense that some of the--I don’t know how to   characterize it--feeding frenzy or hysteria has abated a bit?    I would prefer to wait, too     I think we should adjust all those things at once    SEVERAL Let’s do it all at one time     Yes   "
3831,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman In line with Al’s comments, I’d say the most   significant thing that has happened in New England recently had nothing to do with floods,   thankfully, but with a golf game, the Ryder Cup tournament We’ve seen the impact on the   economy of that, but certainly there was an impact from national and international press coverage-­  not necessarily all favorable, I should add, for the New England District   The District economy overall continues to expand at a moderate pace In fact, there are a   few straws in the wind that suggest that growth is picking up and that wage and price pressures are   as well In particular, while manufacturing jobs continue to decline on a year-over-year basis, the   August data showed an increase, which likely reflects an upturn in regional merchandise exports   Second-quarter figures show a rebound in exports, particularly to Singapore and the crisis areas of   Asia and to Mexico So this one rather weak part of the New England economy is starting to look   brighter again Indeed, anecdotes from our Beigebook contacts suggest that many manufacturers   believe that the worst is over in terms of their trade with Asia and that the future bodes quite well   Labor markets in the region remain extremely tight and even manufacturing firms report   difficulty in hiring and retaining production workers, a trend that is likely only to get worse as   regional exports grow The regional unemployment rate hit 3 percent in August, which equals its   low for the expansion and is the lowest rate since 1988 Beigebook contacts in every industry   reported shortages of workers at all skill levels, from technical to production to office and   secretarial workers Temporary employment firms contacted in September reported a continuation   and deepening of earlier trends solid growth in their business revenues, with a potential for much   greater returns if an additional supply of labor could possibly be found Temporary help firms are   actually recruiting Some are using signing bonuses but most are trying to tap new sources of   workers such as retirees, the otherwise unemployed--including former welfare recipients--and even     10/5/99 19   refugee populations We also hear from temporary firms that they are doing some retraining of   workers themselves   The tourism industry has been particularly hard hit by labor shortages Members of the   Bank’s small business New England Advisory Council reported that restaurants and other tourist-  related businesses in southern Maine were forced to close a couple of days during the week over   this past summer because there just was not sufficient staff to keep them open This situation   became increasingly difficult in late August when college students left for school Looking at the   other seasonal industry, the ski resorts, one ski area owner reported that he paid the summer   medical insurance premiums for key seasonal workers and their families in order to ensure that the   workers will return this winter   Given the tightness in labor markets, the continued commentary in the Beigebook of   moderate wage increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent remains a bit of a puzzle Indeed, we are   seeing some increase in manufacturing wages in the aggregate regional data and an increase in the   rate of growth in the Boston CPI In addition, manufacturing contacts report that input price   increases are now more prevalent than decreases, which is a shift from earlier reports There is also   a concern about accelerating costs for health insurance Businesses in the region appear to be   fighting to retain control of costs and are linking compensation to revenues as much as possible   While it is hard to see it yet in the aggregate data or to reconcile it with the reports of moderate   wage increases, one gets the sense that they may be slowly in the process of losing that battle on   both the wage and the raw material sides One area of the region where the battle clearly has been   lost is real estate, both residential and commercial  The Boston office market is red hot, with very   low vacancy rates and rising rent prices It is not likely to get much better even with new   construction since the vast majority of new space under construction is already leased  Beyond   Boston, the suburban office markets are vibrant as well Even the long depressed city of Hartford   is staging a comeback, with lower vacancy rates and rising prices Finally, the prices of residential   real estate continue to climb at a faster rate than for the nation as a whole   Turning to the nation, we have no major disagreements with the Greenbook forecast It is   quite similar in shape to our own Incoming data on the real domestic economy are considerably   stronger than we and others had expected earlier in the year, and we see considerable momentum   through the last part of this year and into 2000 Foreign growth is surpassing expectations, and   rising exports are bringing manufacturing back to life after the Asian problem Indeed, it would   seem that all the temporary factors that acted to restrain price increases in the face of extremely     10/5/99 20   tight labor markets and above-trend growth--declining commodity prices, excess world capacity,   the strong dollar, declining health benefit costs--are now slipping away Will increased   productivity growth save the day?  Can we really count on stabilization or decline in the stock   market and widening credit spreads to rein in consumer and business spending?  Even if we can   count on productivity growth and stock market restraint, that really only puts us in line for what   looks like a considerable upturn in prices next year, if one believes the Greenbook forecast Should   one believe the Greenbook forecast? Is this forecast of increasing price pressures more believable   now than it was earlier this year, or a year ago, or even two years ago? My own view is that it is   more believable because of the waning effects of the beneficial temporary factors and the   beginnings of pipeline inflation that Mike Prell referred to in his comments Moreover, we are   clearly running the risk that the very strong rates of near-term growth could exacerbate rather than   damp the imbalances reflected in unrealistic asset prices and in high and growing levels of   consumer and business debt  "
3832,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, could have been enthusiastic about   increasing the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting and going with a symmetric   directive That would have conveyed to the markets our concern about the potential for a pickup in   inflation--recognizing all the problems associated with forecasting--given the strength of the data   and the unwinding of some of the temporary factors  And it would have cleared the decks, in my   view anyway, for year-end   That said, I can support “B” for some of the same reasons that Mike Kelley just noted We   may have some time Certainly, inflation is not going to jump up tomorrow There is the ongoing   question about productivity I’ve spent a long time in the Federal Reserve System associated with   the operations side; and when management gets involved, it’s usually around the issue of   productivity changes from improvements in operations In my view, anyway, those occur in step   functions We make a big change and consolidate for a while, reorganize, and get the benefits out     10/5/99 67   of the change and then go forward from there Not very routinely does productivity keep going up   in a constant arc nor do we routinely get year-after-year continued positive second derivative   changes You mentioned yourself that it will come to an end sometime We don’t know when   But we probably do have some time, because productivity improvements seem to have a   momentum that is deeply engrained in the way the economy is running right now It’s also good   that action in November continues to be a possibility So I can support “B”   I also feel that if we start now to change the process by which we communicate asymmetry   --and I do think we should communicate how we feel about the balance of risks--the outcome   won’t be beneficial It will introduce another level of surprise and uncertainty into the market It   may be that the markets reacted badly to the announcement of asymmetry last May, as we have   discussed But I’d rather stick with that language until we have a firm view on the way to go   forward and can communicate that with some confidence So, I’d go along with Governors   Gramlich and Kelley and others around the table on “B” asymmetric, using the customary   language    But if we say “potential” for cost increases, that gets to your point, I   think  "
3884,1999-11-16," I have a great deal of sympathy for what President Boehne just said   I know rewriting by committee is really hard to do, having done it more than once myself on   things of less importance than this statement But I have two real concerns First of all, I share   Bob McTeer’s concern about using the pool of available workers as the proximate cause for this   change I think we could say something like, “as a consequence, tighter policy is necessary if   inflationary imbalances are to remain in check,” etc Secondly, I agree with Governor Meyer on   the time frame issue Certainly, the second sentence in that paragraph says over the near term,   but I think the first sentence is going to give the markets real reason to rejoice and take things to   new heights over the next couple of months Unless we can find some qualifying words in that   sentence--and I don’t think “likely” does it--we’re going to have some real issues in the markets    This is not how to do it!    Take the “markedly” out    Actually, I find myself more in agreement with Al Broaddus on   other points than on the final one he discussed just now I think the Working Group has done us   a favor by de-linking the discussion of symmetry from the implied authority of the Chairman to   change monetary policy between FOMC meetings My understanding is that the asymmetry   phrase always has been interpreted as having two meanings One is that it gives the Chairman   some latitude and the second is that it conveys some sense of our discussion of the balance of   risks at the meeting It seems to me that unlinking those two things is an obviously good thing to   do As for making the Chairman’s authority explicit, I disagree with Al I think it’s better that it   be explicit than not It offers the Committee the opportunity to object because it requires that the   Committee be consulted afterwards if the Chairman did not find it feasible to do so beforehand   And we do have an opportunity in our annual review process--though I can’t imagine it ever   coming to that--to renew this authorization or not It seems to me a lot better to have this spelled   out rather than have the degree of confusion surrounding the meaning of symmetry or asymmetry   language I have seen in my experience sitting at this table Often in the course of their   comments on policy Committee members would give different interpretations of what they   thought the symmetry or asymmetry phrase implied for policy So I think it’s better to be   explicit about this and give the Committee an opportunity to say yes or no on an annual basis   As for the wording, I’m drawn to alternative I because it is less explicit about possible   policy adjustments And I think the Chairman has a good argument when he says we can go to   alternative II if we find it necessary, but we can’t move back to “I” if we start with “II”  "
3885,1999-11-16," Mike, I was interested in both the Greenbook discussion and your   own comments about your reevaluation of the degree of structural versus cyclical change in   productivity It certainly has an implication for the potential rate of growth of GDP I am   wondering whether the decrease that we have seen in the unemployment rate since the beginning   of the year, which has been about 04 or 05 of a point over the first ten months-- Wasn’t it   somewhere around 46 percent at the end of last year?    No, but we have seen a decline of several tenths in the   unemployment rate over the year    How does one reconcile that with the idea of an increasing level of   potential in the economy?    So you feel that makes it more understandable rather than less   understandable?    Right    No, I realize that    Thank you, Mr Chairman Not a lot has changed in New England   since our last meeting Growth continues to be vibrant Labor markets are very tight, and both   published data and anecdotal evidence point to increasing cost pressures, especially as they   regard health insurance premiums and rising materials costs New England’s unemployment rate   fell slightly in September to 29 percent, equaling the series low since data began to be collected   on a regional basis in 1969 and attained only once before in April 1988 Wage increases have   accelerated this year, at least in manufacturing, by more than a percentage point over 1998   Moreover, the range of average prospective wage increases cited by Beigebook contacts rose as   well, with the upper end now in the 6 percent rather than the 5 percent area Even in the absence   of wage acceleration, employers see compensation costs rising via significant increases in health   benefits costs Half the manufacturers contacted mentioned very substantial increases in health   insurance premiums In addition, while retailers reported vendor and selling prices as steady,   manufacturing contacts reported rising materials costs The most commonly mentioned price   increases were for fuels, plastics, petrochemicals, copper, aluminum, paper, and cardboard   Real estate markets remain relatively strong as well While construction of new   homes has hit a bit of a lull, sales of existing homes remain solid and above year-ago levels   Home prices are a clear sign of market strength The price of a typical home in New England   rose by nearly 8 percent versus 5 or 6 percent for the nation; home prices rose 9 percent in   Massachusetts and about 16 percent in the Boston metropolitan area Office markets continue to   be strong as well, with Class A space in Boston continuing to be the most expensive in the   nation   Turning to the national outlook, both current data and prospects for the near term   continue to defy expectations of a slowdown of any magnitude To be sure, housing and durable   goods sales were a bit slower, as were auto sales, but interest rates have backed off a bit, the   stock market remains positive, and consumer confidence is high We now also seem to have   evidence more firmly in hand to explain the economy’s current ability to grow without undue   strain With the revisions in GDP data, we are now looking back at higher rates of real growth,   higher productivity, and a higher level of potential GDP This is great stuff, but it is backward   looking One can hope the future will look like the recent past, but it may be wise to be a bit   skeptical about whether it will     11/16/99 20   I find the Greenbook forecast to be very interesting, and I think Mike seemed to   indicate that he does as well, because in many ways it’s pessimistic To be sure, it assumes that   productivity is higher not only because of the revisions but also because of a larger share that is   thought to be more structural than cyclical It also assumes that potential is correspondingly   higher, that monetary policy tightens by 50 basis points over the next year or so, and that the   long awaited moderation in consumer demand and stock price growth actually take place And   even with all that, core inflation ticks up nearly ½ point from 1999 to 2000 and a bit more in   2001 It would seem that a rise in prices is baked in the cake, even if all of these moderating   influences actually occur But will they occur?  To me the answer to that question revolves   importantly around whether or not one believes productivity growth can continue to accelerate,   not just as a reflection of output growth but as a reflection of a higher trend rate   I’ve thought a lot about productivity since our last meeting; it would have been hard   not to On the one hand, as I look around my District, it seems obvious that tight labor markets   are bringing entry level workers and others whose skills are marginal into the workforce This is   a good thing for them and for society as a whole, since obviously work provides the best   opportunity for them to improve their chances in life But they are not exactly enhancing the   firms’ productivity, at least in the short run On the other hand, I see wages being linked to   profits more tightly than ever; and even very large companies are continuing to be very cost   conscious My 17-year old son, whom I have mentioned in the past, recently graduated from   selling CDs at Circuit City for $9 plus an hour to selling small electronics After a two-week   training program, he is now totally on commission--no base salary at all unless he fails to make   the minimum wage, in which case he will likely be back selling CDs The company has a real   time system that lets him know at any moment during the day how much he has earned so far   that day or how much in the hole he might be because a customer has returned an item he sold   Believe me, he has become very focused on closing a sale! He knows what he makes from every   single product He may not know the exact price, but he knows his commission, and he is very   focused on selling the right thing to the right customer   I also attended a conference at IBM at which Lou Guerstner talked for two hours or so   about the restructuring of IBM’s internal business processes using web technology, taking $6   billion or so off a $50 billion procurement budget, for example Productivity increases are real   They are embedded in how people are paid and how businesses work That seems undebatable     11/16/99 21   I think what is debatable is how long rising productivity growth will continue to provide the   needed buffer between all the resource pressures in the economy and higher and potentially   rising rates of inflation   In that regard, it would seem that there is an increasing degree of resource pressure   Labor markets show no sign of easing Rising overall costs should cause employees to seek   higher wage increases, and rising profits should lift bonuses, which fell off earlier this year   Benefits costs are rising, especially for medical insurance Export growth is strengthening as   foreign growth takes off, and the dollar is more likely to depreciate than not That is a long-  winded way of pointing out that all of the risks to the forecast seem to me even more firmly   planted on the upside than they were at the last meeting Accelerating rates of productivity   growth may have provided breathing room, and who knows whether they will last But in my   view anyway, the direction if not the timing of the next needed move in monetary policy is less   uncertain than ever Thank you  "
3886,1999-11-16," I certainly agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman I, too,   think one could make a distinction between the economics associated with asymmetry and the   potential for market uncertainties related to Y2K concerns at year-end But on the whole, I’m   persuaded that we’re better off with a symmetric directive for the reasons that President Boehne   articulated  "
3946,1999-12-21," I have one little question    You mentioned a couple of times, Peter, that you think anxieties   about Y2K have shifted from the actual turn-of-the-year period of 12/31/99 to 1/1/00 to the   first couple of weeks in January Is there anything more substantial to it than that? Are   there particular concerns in the market?  I know there is a lot of concern, at least among   some financial institutions I know of, about having more liquidity than they want coming   into the end of the year Do you think that concern is going to disappear quickly at the   beginning of the year, or is there anything more to it than that?    It just got pushed out?    Thank you    Wow, it’s hard to follow that! Let me start with first things first   I’ve long been of the opinion that we should announce something after every meeting And   if it’s the bias discussion or the tilt discussion that gets us to the point where we are at the   end of the meeting, I believe some reflection of that should be incorporated in the public   announcement that will be made after every meeting In fact, at one point or another I think   I was the one who suggested the balance-of-risks language Nevertheless, I must say that a   couple of Bill Poole’s arguments really resonate with me point 5, the possible headline   “Fed sees economic weakness ahead;” and point 6, the idea that we are supposed to be   preemptive If we see economic weakness ahead, shouldn’t we try to do something about it   or shouldn’t we anticipate that we could alter policy so as to offset it, along the lines   President Jordan talked about?  So, I thought I’d be firmly in the Option 1 camp, but I can   see some benefits to Option 2, frankly Option 2 still talks about risks And I don’t think it   commits us to any more than what the market thinks we’re committed to--or not committed   to as the case may be--because time will determine what we’re going to do Whether or not   we in fact move with any greater frequency than we have to date after we change our   language is what ultimately is going to decide how the market accepts this I also believe   that the basic thrust of President Poole’s point 7 is right as well When we started this   announcement policy, we led the market to have unrealistic assumptions about what we   meant by the language And they overreacted We encouraged them to overreact We   didn’t mean to, but we did I think the situation has gotten better since then and there’s an   improved understanding of our consensus on where we are going So, I’m really on the   fence and I could be a marginal Option 2 person   Before I get to Al Broaddus’ second comment, let me just say a few words on my   suggested modifications to the directive language I assume that nobody has major     12/21/99 72   objections, or you would have said so already, about what ends up being just an editorial   perspective about shortening the directive What I tried to do when I was analyzing the   issues for this discussion was to go through all of our public announcements for the year and   rewrite them the way they would have been written under the proposals made at the last   meeting and in Roger Ferguson’s subsequent memo And as I tried to rewrite the directive, I   found that all I was rewriting every month was a paragraph that focused on the monetary   aggregates, which we really don’t talk about at our meetings Well, Don Kohn does--excuse   me, Don I felt that that kind of laser focus on that subject each and every month really   didn’t serve us well So, that was basically where my suggestions for shortening the   directive came from   Finally, turning to what Al was just saying, I am a firm believer that FOMC   decisions ought to be Committee decisions We have a responsibility; making policy   decisions is what we are here for, for all the reasons that Al articulated much better than I   ever could My understanding in terms of this paragraph was that it was codifying an   accepted position of the Committee that has changed over a period of years, but that this   wording basically reflected current Committee practice I had not really asked myself some   of the questions that Al raised in his discussion, and I must admit they bear thinking about   So, I’m a little on the fence in that area, too    That’s a good point  "
3947,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman New England continues its recent   pattern of moderate growth, at least as measured by the increase in employment levels,   which have been a full percentage point below the nation for some time For most of the   region, however, labor force growth has also been slower And it has been slower than the   growth in the number of jobs, which is giving rise to declining rates of unemployment in all   states in the region This also gives credence to the numerous anecdotes that it is the labor   constraint itself that is preventing higher rates of regional job growth Nonetheless, the   region’s employment growth does exceed the nation’s in two areas--construction job   increases and the moderation in manufacturing job losses   In the construction area, job growth reflects very good residential and commercial   real estate markets in Boston and elsewhere  We continue to ask ourselves whether     12/21/99 27   construction job growth could be a precursor to a 1980s type real estate boom But so far,   construction jobs do not comprise nearly as large a fraction of total employment as they did   in the 1980s, and there is very little, though some, speculative construction going on   On the manufacturing side, regional job losses are more moderate than those for the   nation as a whole, probably reflecting a turnaround in merchandise exports Recent reports   indicate that new orders for manufacturing goods in the region accelerated in recent months,   led by a rebound in exports Year over year New England exports grew fastest to South   Korea, Mexico, and the Netherlands, though exports to South Korea are still not back to pre-  crisis levels   As compared with earlier this year, contacts noted a somewhat increased willingness   to pay higher wages and to raise prices, at least for retail goods Consumer confidence is   high and growing, with surveys pointing to especially strong gains in expectations about   future economic conditions This is in marked contrast to earlier this year when such   expectations were more moderate To the extent that expectations were affected earlier by   Y2K uncertainties--and I am not really positive that they were--the apparent lack of concern   in this area may be feeding into higher levels of consumer confidence It is hard to find any   Y2K panic or even deep worries out there, and believe me we’ve tried to find it   In looking around for signs of slowing in the region, I must admit I’ve had a hard   time finding any Bankers do report that mortgage originations are off And while loans in   general have been growing at a better pace than earlier this year, they are rising at only   about half the pace for the nation as a whole Aside from that, however, just about   everything else seems to be going great Stores are packed The highways are jammed   Help in retail stores is extremely hard to come by We held a series of bankers’ forums this   fall and the conversations among those present as well as among the bankers on our board   were very upbeat New England may be growing more slowly than the nation, at least as   measured by overall employment, but our regional economy seems to have a very solid   foundation for the foreseeable future   Turning to the nation, I am struck, as others have been, by the fact that even in the   few weeks since the last meeting things seem to have gotten that much hotter in the overall   economy Growth this quarter will be somewhere close to 5 percent Labor markets are, if   anything, tighter The stock market continues to surprise on the upside, and financial     12/21/99 28   market conditions in general seem quite accommodative, notwithstanding our recent   tightening Foreign growth, despite the weakness in Japan, continues to be stronger than   expected And reflecting all of this, oil and other commodity prices continue on the   upswing True, there seem to be a few signs at the national level of slowing in interest-  sensitive sectors; but we have seen these signs before and they’ve simply been pauses   On the broad wage and price front, the total CPI has leveled off and the core is rising   to fill the gap between the two of them The one thing that remains somewhat puzzling, to   me anyway, is why, given labor market pressures, we haven’t seen much escalation in   overall wages and in fact actually have seen some reduction in the rate of growth If one   believes that is because overall prices were lower last year due to the impact of declining oil   prices, then I think there is reason to assume that the reverse will happen in the coming   months and we will begin to see more wage pressures One has to remain agnostic because   we have expected to see that for some time now But it does give one pause, in light of   everything that has happened--given the stock market and the wealth effect, the change in   overall price levels, and the increase in labor market pressures Even given productivity   changes, one has to wonder when compensation levels are going to be such that they will   outstrip the growth in productivity and start to be a factor in terms of overall prices   In that regard, as we prepared our forecast in Boston, we had some trouble accepting   that trend productivity growth might be somewhere north of 2½ percent and that potential   might be 38 percent or so We are also a little less bullish, especially with regard to PCE   spending But overall, if we look at our forecast with an assumption of no policy change   and compare it to the Greenbook’s flat policy alternative, the differences are not substantial   We are in agreement with the staff that policy does need to be tighter to keep inflation from   rising above 3 percent by late 2000 or early 2001 The questions are by how much--75 basis   points or more--and when It is hard to know the answer to how much since it is difficult to   know what will happen when we make the next move and step on the brakes In my view   anyway, the next move may be seen differently than the last three After all, it could be   argued that those three tightenings were simply taking monetary policy back to where it was   before the Asian crisis The next move would bring short-term rates higher than they were   in the spring of 1998 when we first adopted a bias toward tightening There is at least a bit   of a risk that the market will overreact, particularly given how frothy it has been of late     12/21/99 29   When to move is also an issue largely because of Y2K I, for one, don’t see us putting at   risk all the efforts we have made toward keeping markets calm and liquid through the   century date change by making a policy change now that could just as easily be made early   in 2000 Nonetheless, if it is risky to move now, which it might be, it is also risky to wait   much longer Thank you  "
3948,1999-12-21," You said one of the goals, and I totally agree with you, is to try to   leave the market at 230 today the same way it was at 215    In that regard, since there is a heavy degree of expectation that we   will be asymmetric, it seems to me that asymmetry would be more likely than symmetry to   produce that kind of stability in the market If symmetry is going to be a surprise and gives   an extra boost to the market, isn’t that where the greater risk lies?    But if the expectations are that we see the same risks that the   market sees and that we are alive and functioning here despite Y2K--   I could have gotten by with “Happy Holidays” as well But given   this choice--and not wanting to go into any on-the-fly editing of language--I would feel, for   a lot of reasons, that asymmetry is marginally the better way to go First of all, I don’t like   the additional words in the language for symmetry nor the focus on policy in the   intermeeting period, which is after all very long I believe the asymmetric language is more   honest, as Governor Gramlich said, about where we feel things are  I think it is reflective of   where the market is and where the market thinks we are And it gives us the opportunity to   do something after Y2K and before the next meeting if we want to, whereas the third   paragraph of the symmetric press release I think forecloses that a bit I’d be worried about   that I could go either way, but my concern about the symmetric directive is the wording “in   order to indicate the focus of policy in the intermeeting period” That’s a long period of   time  "
4002,2000-03-21,"  I also am in favor of a study of a broader range of assets that we   may or may not find useful to include in open market operations  I thought that was what Don   and Peter were suggesting  And if some of us or some of our research directors can be helpful in   that regard, I am totally in favor of that  In a way I feel kind of like Alice in Wonderland here   On the one hand, the Treasury is concerned about the GSEs  On the other hand it is restricting   the available amount of 30-year bonds and is effectively creating a brand-new market for Freddie   Mac and Fannie Mae to get into with 30-year benchmark securities  It seems to me that they   cannot have it both ways     Yes, that is their problem     I’m not so sure it is a really good idea for the debt to disappear     No, I know that is not a good idea either  But when one thinks   about the liquidity of the US government securities market and all that it does as a safe haven, a   store of value, and so forth, I don’t know whether it is such a good idea to have it all disappear     Peter, does this mean that until you have the new system in place   you will continue with the tri-party arrangements and so forth?  Have you ever used them?  Did   they work satisfactorily?       Let me ask one follow-up question  One of the reasons you wanted   to go with tri-party custodians was that they were more capable of pricing the broader range of   collateral you were going to be taking  Also, it gave you the capability to do operations later in   the day to mop up reserves, a capability we did not have in our own system  Will the new trade   processing system do all of that?     So, you have not made up your mind whether you are going to--     Yes, or whether you continue to rely on the clearing banks  But   you have not yet made up your mind  "
4003,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  New England continues its pattern of   steady growth, very low unemployment, and a somewhat higher rate of inflation than in the rest   of the country, particularly in the areas of medical, housing, and fuel costs  The annual   benchmark revisions to employment data contained some good news, at least for those who are   observing the regional economy  Prior to the revisions, our employment growth had been   thought to be lagging the nation's by almost a percentage point and many believed that the lack   of labor was really constraining regional growth  The revisions indicated, however, that over the   12 months ending in January employment grew at about the same pace as in the nation, which is   a good strong pace for the region, suggesting that employers were not as constrained as we had   thought  Unemployment rates continue to be low and dropped to 28 percent in January for the   region as a whole   Measured inflation has picked up in Boston  Consumer prices rose faster over the 12   months ending in January than at any time over the last few years and faster than they did   nationally  As noted earlier, fuel, shelter, and medical costs are the primary drivers  I mentioned   at our last meeting that one of the area’s largest and best regarded HMOs was in receivership and   could fail, putting regional hospitals and doctors at risk  It now appears, after considerable effort              - 54 -     on the part of public officials, that this HMO will come out of receivership and, after   renegotiating its rates, has a chance at survival  It is expected that its premiums will rise by 15 to   20 percent over the next two or three years and that Massachusetts will increase its regulatory   oversight to try to insure that this does not happen to this or other HMOs again  No matter how   you look at it, medical insurance costs are on the rise in New England and probably elsewhere as   well   Reflecting this,                                                                                                                                                                               reported to us that wage-bargaining discussions at recent   meetings of                                      were focused on the inadequacy of annual increases of 2-1/2   to 3 percent  He noted that wage gains in that percentage range had seemed sufficient over the   last several years, given the low rate of inflation  But now, particularly in the face of rising   medical and childcare costs, that rate of general wage increase simply didn't seem to be enough    It was interesting to me that he did not mention oil as a factor in the discussions but rather   medical and childcare costs   Local contacts in the temporary employment industry report that business is quite   brisk  While labor shortages make it difficult for them to fill positions, shortages also bring in   business as clients find it increasingly difficult to hire on their own  There is a growing demand   for workers in the Internet-related sectors, and the Internet is increasingly being used to recruit   technologically savvy staff  Wages are rising faster in the temp sector than in manufacturing or   retail, at least as we hear it, but temporary firms are managing to pass on these wage increases    Another director, the chairman of what is considered to be one of the top                                                                                                                                   talked about the stock   market at a recent directors meeting  She noted that, in her experience, CEOs of major firms              - 55 -     across the nation are now more concerned about the stock market than they ever have been  She   noted that this phenomenon goes well beyond stocks and stock options that they might receive as   compensation  Senior managers seem to look at the stock market as the ultimate arbiter of   success and they spend time--time that in earlier periods might have been spent solely focused on   the business--on financial engineering related to the level of their company’s stock  It was an   interesting conversation because it seemed to suggest that today’s period of stock market   ebullience has similarities to the period of the late '70s and early '80s when inflationary excesses   affected corporate and consumer decisionmaking    On the national scene, there continues to be little doubt about the strength of domestic   demand  It is obvious in auto sales, in the continued strength of housing, in oil prices, in labor   markets, in rising consumer and business debt, and in the ever-widening trade deficit  We no   longer have the luxury--if you want to call it that--of slow growth in the rest of the world as a   restraining factor  The Greenbook’s forecast of foreign strength is about on target with our own   and, if anything, recent data would suggest that we might have more rather than less export   growth than is expected in the Greenbook  Domestic demand could slow on its own  We agree   that consumer satiation, the effects of higher interest rates and rising oil prices, and slowing   wealth effects could work in that direction, as suggested by the Greenbook  But I would be a bit   cautious on that front, since we have expected demand to slow on its own for some time and it   has yet to do so   The real issue continues to be on the supply side  Nothing about current labor market   data suggests that the assumption that we are running out of workers is any less true now than at   our last meeting--quite the contrary, despite the vagaries of the monthly data  I think questions   do exist, however, about the degree to which increasing productivity will continue to keep unit              - 56 -     labor costs low and support strong corporate profits  The Greenbook addresses these issues  I   continue to find its assumptions about productivity and potential optimistic  But the overall   forecast, with its embedded need to tighten more now than is expected by the markets, is hard for   me to disagree with  "
4004,2000-03-21,"  I agree with your policy recommendation, Mr Chairman  I   certainly agree with the asymmetry  I probably could have gone with 50 basis points, too  I   don't find a move of 50 basis points all that scary and I think it might not be a bad idea sooner   rather than later to do something that expresses more concern about the imbalances that we see in   demand and supply  I don't necessarily feel, particularly in the environment that we have been              - 88 -     in, that the smoking gun has to be a rise in inflation that is really noticeable in the PCE or the   CPI or whatever measure we are looking at  As you and others have mentioned, the imbalances   that we see in consumers’ continuing willingness to spend more than they are bringing in and to   get into increasing amounts of debt plays out in what President McDonough referred to as the   symptom of the trade deficit  I believe those are all indications that demand is growing at a rate   that is not sustainable and ultimately could be dangerous, depending on what happens in the   future  Also, I would hope that we can soften the link between our policy and the level of the   stock market--because I think that is pretty tricky to do--and get back into the analysis that looks   at supply and demand  So, I am in favor of where we are going  I realize that we don't know   exactly where we will stop, but I think it is going to take more than this  "
4048,2000-05-16,  Texas real estate?  
4049,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mike, I was also interested in your   comment about “too little, too late” or “too much, too long” from a couple of different   perspectives  Your 8 percent funds rate scenario as compared with the baseline case of 7-1/4   percent would seem to provide a range of options  The 7-1/4 percent would give us some   protection against the downward phase of the cycle you talked about, where we are unable to   factor in what will really happen because of the nonlinearities that are involved when the   economy is slowing down  I’m just asking whether I'm interpreting your comments correctly   in terms of the differences between your baseline case and the 8 percent funds rate scenario    With the 8 percent alternative your model doesn't produce a recession, but then again we don't   know how to judge some of the risks associated with the nonlinearities that arise  So am I   right in assuming that at least with regard to the next couple of years, you'd say that there is   some kind of cushion between the baseline and the tighter funds policy alternative that would   absorb some of the risk of the nonlinearities?     Yes     Coming at it another way, though, suppose we start in the next   month or so to move the funds rate up as we approach that total increase of 125 basis points   by the end of the year  At this point you don't consider that a description of too much, too   long?     But if you were going to assess the risks--     What is the risk that it is too little, too late?     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  Growth in New England   remains remarkably strong  Employment continues to grow at a rapid rate, just below the   pace of the nation  And unemployment rates for the region as a whole, as well as for three of   the District’s states, are at all-time lows  Reflecting this and in some ways echoing Al   Broaddus’s comments, it is just not possible to have a conversation about local economic   conditions anywhere in the District without discussing the near impossibility of finding labor    Whether the need is for high-tech personnel or decidedly low-tech blue-collar entry level staff,   these positions are harder to fill and they are more expensive than previously  Local firms,   large and small, continue to be inventive about making capital investments that replace labor   and about using a wide variety of techniques intended to moderate the cost of hiring and   retaining staff  These include the use of temporary help and outsourcing, even to foreign   suppliers  But increasingly these techniques are not enough  And our contacts report that   holding the line on wages--and on benefit costs particularly--is really becoming a losing   battle  Adding to this is the fact that non-personnel costs are also rising, especially if   production inputs are oil-based  Manufacturers using or producing plastic seem particularly   hard hit  So, while widespread price increases still are not the norm, such increases seem to   be much more feasible and closer to happening than in prior months   Looking to the national scene, incoming data since our last meeting once again   suggest that for most, if not all, of this period growth has been not only stronger than expected   but has been accelerating  Moreover, the expected pickup in inflation seems to have begun in   earnest whether one looks at actual price data for goods and services, at wage costs and   especially benefit costs, or at expectations  I think it's important, however, to take a measured      41  response to this uptick in prices  After all, the Greenbook as well as our own forecasts have   been suggesting for some time now that the rate of price increase would accelerate  That's   why we favored a tighter monetary policy  Moreover, we may be seeing the beginning of a   slowdown, as evidenced by the volatile and downward trend of the stock market, rising capital   and debt costs, and the housing and retail sales data     Our forecast, however, like the Greenbook, suggests that in the absence of sizable   further tightening, this slowdown--if in fact it is real and not the “head fake” that is mentioned   in the Greenbook--will not be enough to forestall deepening price problems  We may or may   not be “behind the curve,” as some would say  But I do think it is necessary now to be very   focused on a measured forward direction of policy  "
4050,2000-05-16,"  I, too, support your recommendation  I think we may be seeing   some incipient signs of slowing in the economy but I don't think it's enough  Our own   forecast and the Greenbook forecast say that the slowing will not be enough  Also, I see the   50 basis point move, while different from the moves we have been making, as consistent with   them  We have reached a point in time when that is an appropriate action because of   developments in the market  I disagree a little with President Poole on the volatility and the   downward trends that we've seen in the market  The fact is that other things have   demonstrably not fallen out of bed at the same time--maybe they will down the road--but I   don't get a sense that the volatility and market downturns are having a major impact in a real   sense on the economy  So, I think we have some opportunity to act without fear of unsettling   the market, whereas earlier I was in favor of a gradual approach to tightening because of   concerns about the market and market volatility  Now that we've seen a bit of that and bad   things haven't happened, we have a window of opportunity during which we can move the   funds rate up and send a consistent message that the risks are still on the up side     I think we should limit our statement to the usual language as much as we possibly   can, saying that the risks are tilted toward inflation in the foreseeable future, and not give   anybody room to play with the interpretation of what we meant by this word or that word  I’d   continue with a consistent approach toward tightening monetary conditions and be always   watchful for signs of incipient slowing      96 "
4096,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are a few more hints of a slowdown   in the New England economy since our last meeting  Regional employment growth has slowed   recently, especially in construction, in the finance, insurance, and real estate areas, and in   transportation and public utilities  Residential construction contracts have turned down, as have   single-unit housing permits, and existing home sales have returned to their 1999 level  However, it’s   not clear in either employment trends or in housing whether this observed slowing is fully a demand   phenomenon or still has some supply characteristics to it  Labor markets remain exceedingly tight,   with several New England states recording unemployment rates below 3 percent and the rate for the   region as a whole well below--a percentage point or more--the nation’s  Everywhere I go in the   District, employers complain about the lack of available workers and the potential for faster growth       37  if only a greater supply of labor could be found  Similarly, real estate brokers report that a   diminishing supply of new and existing homes is a factor in declining sales, though reduced   affordability is a factor as well     Contacts continue to report rising wage costs, though the regional data suggest that wage   pressures are off a bit from their high in mid-1999  We also continue to hear reports about novel   adjustments to tight labor markets and increasing investments in productivity-enhancing technology    Firms report using out-of-cycle pay raises, higher starting pay, and greater shift differentials; they   also seek to offset these increased costs by reducing educational requirements for new hires and   compensating for that by providing more training and using more sophisticated technology  Clearly,   they believe the task of both finding and rewarding employees has become more and more difficult   A major question for the region and for the nation as a whole is whether these signs of   slowing really signal a trend  In that regard, I think the national data may be a bit clearer than the   local  In New England, while job growth and housing are less robust, whether because of demand or   supply or some combination of the two, manufacturing is not  Indeed, while manufacturing job   counts are not expanding, they also are not declining as much as they were last year  Moreover,   manufacturing contacts are extremely optimistic about demand, with one diversified capital goods   manufacturer describing business as “sizzling”  Not surprisingly, this is especially true for   manufacturers of high-tech equipment, with one semiconductor business reporting a 90 percent   increase in revenues and a 40 percent increase in orders for the second quarter over a year ago on the   heels of an extraordinary first quarter  For some, this optimism may reflect a sense of relief that   things haven’t been worse, given the interest rate increases  Others, however, firmly attach their   optimism to the growing demand in foreign markets, especially the Asian Pacific region  They also   note rising input prices, especially oil-based inputs  But in general these rising prices are being       38  offset by volume discounts, electronic purchasing using the Internet, and by a continued shifting of   production to foreign locations   I’ve begun to host a series of luncheons with regional high-tech CEOs, focusing primarily   on the subject of productivity  In particular, I’ve asked the CEOs who have attended to assess   whether and when, if at all, trends in productivity growth are likely to level off  And while these   luncheons are only in an early stage, the comments from CEOs producing very different high-tech   products were surprisingly similar  First, they believe that much of the change to date has worked to   create a platform from which further progress can be made or a whole range of new products   produced more easily  That is, productivity growth in their view is not likely even to level off soon    Second, they believe the action--in terms of innovation--is confined almost entirely to the United   States, with not much taking place elsewhere  And finally, they envisage an enormous array of   opportunities in their industries looking forward  Clearly, these CEOs are optimistic about the   enduring and even accelerating pace of productivity growth   As I look at the national scene, and particularly at the Board staff’s forecast, I’m struck by   the fact that the authors of the Greenbook seem to be in close contact with these CEOs [laughter] and   are increasingly optimistic, if not euphoric, about the potential for increased productivity  While it is   increasingly easier and more tempting to become a believer in that outlook, I think some caution is   warranted  Moving the growth of potential from 425 to 475 percent puts the staff’s estimate well   above that of most other forecasters, though recently DRI seems to have drunk from the same water   When I look at our forecast at the Boston Fed, I’m struck by how powerful that   assumption about higher rates of productivity is  Our forecast takes more of a mainstream position   on potential growth--somewhere in the mid- to low 3 percent area; it also assumes the second-  quarter slowing in consumption and housing will continue, and looks ahead without any change in       39  policy  Comparing this to the flat funds rate alternative forecast in the Greenbook, unemployment in   2001 is a half percentage point lower and PCE inflation is almost a full percentage point higher with   a lower estimate of GDP growth     The Greenbook’s optimism about productivity thus makes a large difference in how one   views future prospects and how concerned one is about the state of current policy  Now, I’m not   saying that the Greenbook forecast is seriously flawed  Certainly, the detail and the care with which   it is put together give it great credibility  But what if it’s wrong?  What if the near future brings   slower cyclical productivity, which even the Greenbook acknowledges is possible, and inflation   instead of trending down or sideways, depending on what measure is used, turns upward from its   already elevated levels?   Does anybody really like the fact that the overall CPI number now starts   with a 3 rather than a lower number, even though oil is the main driver of the higher number?    People do look to oil prices in judging their views on inflation and how they think about the future    Or are we really satisfied with the way the core rate has accelerated over the last year or so?    The cost of inflation getting out of hand could be significant in terms of financial market   volatility and lost central bank credibility  Wouldn't it make more sense to be less optimistic about   productivity and expect to tighten policy sooner rather than later?  If we are wrong and the economy   slows too much, reversing course may give markets some confidence rather than causing   disruptions  It seems to me that at present there is a real asymmetry in the risks, where being wrong   by using assumptions that are too optimistic is potentially much more costly than taking a more   conservative, less optimistic approach  Now may not be the time to act  Some tightening is in the   pipeline and the economy has begun to slow a bit  But it is also not the time to think we can throw   in the towel for the rest of the year  "
4097,2000-08-22,"   I am also in agreement with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I   think we should wait to see more data on how the economy is shaping up--slowing perhaps--and how   productivity trends seem to be developing in the latter part of the year  I, too, think that the balance   of risks statement is vitally important  In my view we would send a very difficult message for the   markets to deal with if we did not retain the existing balance of risks statement  I believe the risks are   on the up side  I like the way Governor Meyer put the analysis in terms of questioning why we aren't   seeing inflation moving down with such a productivity surprise and why we aren't seeing that when   we look ahead with such a productivity surprise  And that is worrisome to me  I would not like us to   be associated with fiddling while Rome burns, but I don't think we are  I think this is a time when we   can afford to wait and see  "
4145,2000-10-03,"  I don't think the people who are working on the alternative assets part   of this study have quite taken into account baseball teams!     Yes, I think that is right  That takes me to the real point I wanted to   raise, which is that cash is driving this  And cash not only has an impact on our balance sheet, it has   an impact on our fiscal infrastructure as well     Currency needs, and so forth  Are we doing anything--and maybe I   should answer that question--to look at whether there are ways in the future to diminish the supply of      91  cash that is necessary or reduce the growth rate of currency?  The balance sheet needs on the   liabilities side are driven by the increasing growth in the use of cash in this country     That’s right  I know it's mostly overseas     It's at least worth looking at     There is an implied tax on it     Yes, in terms of all of the vaults that we are building and the   infrastructure that we have     Well, that's right     Okay      92 "
4146,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to add my thanks to the staff   for doing as much work as they did, particularly on the supply side issues, forecasting out further in   time, and the alternative productivity and NAIRU simulations They were helpful to me in thinking   about some of these issues        35  I’m interested in your table on structural labor productivity on page I-9  We used to think   that productivity growth at something around 2 percent, or maybe a little lower, would double the   standard of living of the United States in something like 40 years  In noticing the tick up in   structural labor productivity from 29 to 37 percent over the forecast period, I was struck by the fact   that this would suggest that the time period over which a doubling of the standard of living would   occur is now something closer to 20 years  That is rather awe inspiring, and maybe it’s true  I guess   there have been short periods of time in the past when that kind of productivity growth has occurred    But thinking about it that way struck me     The second issue, with regard to the alternative simulations, involves the feedback effect   from productivity into demand  We’re looking at numbers--at 4 percent or a little better for both    2001 and 2002--that are at least ½ percentage point or a bit more than the consensus of forecasters    If one takes away the assumptions about rising structural productivity, as you mentioned, demand is   down to around the mid 3 percent range  That’s a big change  And it seems to have to do totally   with the feedback from productivity into demand, either positively or negatively  I just thought I’d   mention those points that occurred to me as questions or observations as I looked at this and ask you   to comment on them       So this is sort of temporary?      So do you have any idea where this plateaus?       There has been a bit of a downturn from the very high levels     Yes  Slower growth, higher inflation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As the headline in the Wall Street Journal’s   New England Economic Focus put it  “Economy slows, but very gently”  In fact, it is rather hard to   see the slowing  Housing is off a bit but manufacturing and manufactured exports remain strong    Employment growth, net of strike and Census worker noise, has decelerated but it’s not much   different from the historical norm for the region  Moreover, the size of the New England labor force   has leveled off this year after several years of expansion  And the labor force participation rate, at   least in Massachusetts, is down from the rather high level of the mid-1990s  Both the slow growth in   employment and the very low rate of regional unemployment, which is fully 1-1/3 percentage points   below the national rate, probably reflect the same phenomenon, at least in part--that there aren’t      58  many more workers to go around  This ought to be causing wages to rise and to some extent it is    Manufacturers and retailers report 2 to 5 percent base wage increases, though manufacturers are   granting much higher wages to employees with sought-after skills  Temporary firms also report   higher wages, in the range of 10 to 30 percent above last year, across a wide range of professions    Measures of local inflation continue to reflect a higher rate of increase than in the nation as a whole    In particular, energy costs, both oil and natural gas, rose at better than a 15 percent pace from July   1999 to July 2000  Housing prices as well are up at rates surpassing those of the nation, especially   in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, with prices in metro Boston rising at better than 15 percent     A recent experience provides at least one reflection of this local trend  I host a monthly   breakfast with 8 to 10 more or less randomly chosen employees  The discussion centers around the   challenges employees face at the Bank and issues they believe are of concern  And it follows   whatever direction the employees want to take it  The specifics have varied over time, but this time   there was some focus on prices and rising costs  The question, to quote one employee, was  “Why   does everyone say inflation is not a problem when the costs of many of the things I care most about--  medical care, housing, public transportation, gasoline, heating oil, and education--are all rising   rapidly?”  Now this may have been a play for a higher wage increase [laughter] but I don’t think it   was so specific  It was a generalized concern and the rest of the people in the room seconded the   sentiment   Of course, if we begin to see more of an economic slowing, perhaps some of the pressure   will come off  We’ve just completed our usual round of fall bankers’ forums, three programs in   Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut  A primary question I asked of everyone I talked to was   whether or not activity in their area was slowing down  Answers varied, but the largest share of   bankers believed that strong growth was continuing and that competition, if anything, was more      59  intense  Others, however, were seeing some pullback in residential construction and mortgage   lending  In sum, the New England region may well be slowing, but the process is gentle to say the   least and, depending on the area and industry, perhaps imperceptible     Turning to the national scene, signs of slowing may be a bit more evident than they are in   New England, but the data here are mixed as well  Employment growth is slower, the   unemployment rate is up a tick, and housing measures are off their recent highs  But confidence is   high  Home buying conditions are better, given recent mortgage trends  Retail sales and other signs   of consumption seem to have bounced back in the late summer  The stock market seems to have   bought the idea of an economic slowdown, and earnings warnings are more and more common    Corporate leverage is growing  At the same time, credit markets seem to be distinguishing among   borrowers, with spreads rising for lower quality credit  Tighter financial conditions are likely a   healthy development, however  And profits, while slowing, are doing so from very healthy second-  quarter levels     Looking forward, the Greenbook projects what could only be viewed as nirvana   continued domestic strength, no particular external drag, growing rates of structural productivity, a   slight rise in unemployment, but largely quiescent inflation into 2002  But this forecast seems   surrounded by more than the usual sense of uncertainty  I think that is reflected in the fact that it   took 13 alternative simulations!  [Laughter]  They were great, but there were a lot of them!  The   stock market could be weaker or stronger, oil prices higher or lower, the dollar stronger or weaker,   and the fiscal stimulus greater  But variations in two factors seem to make the most significant   difference in the forecast, in the face of continued relatively strong domestic demand  And these, of   course, are the measurements of supply structural productivity growth and changes in the level of   resource utilization consistent with stable inflation over the medium term--that is, the NAIRU       60  Forecasting with lower structural productivity growth gets higher inflation  In fact, on the basis of   our own forecast in Boston we would argue that there is a possibility at least that demand will not   slow as much as is shown in this lower productivity alternative, and inflation could well rise quite a   bit in that scenario  On the other hand, with a lower NAIRU, we could get significantly slower   inflationary growth     So what are we to make of all of this uncertainty?  Well, to me, common sense suggests   that in the face of uncertainty we should be cautious both in what we do and in what we say    Moreover, while there are a lot of factors at play, a few things seem indisputable in the short run    Labor markets are tight  Domestic demand may be slowing but remains robust  And world demand   is growing as well, with the inevitable impact on the external sector for us  Rising productivity may   well save the day, but it seems unlikely that inflation will go down any time soon and it may well   escalate  That, I think, should be our primary concern  Thank you  "
4147,2000-10-03,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4189,2000-11-15,"  Going back to Mike Moskow’s question, I was interested in your   discussion of risks  On the up side there’s a risk that I don’t think you mentioned  You   mentioned that productivity could grow at a greater rate than you expect  If there’s a cyclical   downturn in productivity or if our estimate of structural productivity is higher than it actually is,   isn’t there a potential, anyway, for some upside inflation risks?  Isn’t it possible to see stable or   declining rates of unemployment, more pressure on labor markets, and more pressure on   inflation with a lower level of potential and some kind of reasonably solid demand?  So, there is   that risk on the up side, which you didn’t really talk much about  And then on the down side, is   there any way of weighting the risk in terms of financial conditions?  I’m told that not only have   risks spreads increased, but also there have been more downgradings   So, there’s a greater   number of companies in lower investment grades than, let’s say, a year or two ago, and it strikes   me as reasonable that that’s actually going on  Is there a way of coming to any assessment of the   overall pressure that development is putting on funding in general?     Did you come up with some assessment of relative financial   tightness?               26        And there’s also some widening of the spreads within the   investment grade, too     Can you look back to, let’s say, 1998 and compare that kind of   weighted average with the weighted average that applied then?               27        I’m trying to figure out the relative tightness in some analytical way   as opposed to an anecdotal way  We hear plenty of anecdotes, but can we in some analytical   way figure out whether the markets are as tight as they were during the credit crunch--or   whatever we called it--after the crises of 1998?  Or are they by some measure less tight than they   were then?     Right     Right, that’s what we hear anecdotally, too  I just wondered if   there’s a way to come to grips with that on an analytical basis     I realize that And you talked about the essence of the downside risk   in a way that I completely agreed with  It certainly is one thing that has increased since the last   meeting     Thank you, Mr Chairman  New England remains on a relatively   steady course of moderate expansion overall, but questions continue as to whether this   moderation is a function of demand or supply factors  On the demand side some weakening is   apparent in consumer buying, particularly of big-ticket items such as autos and high-end houses    Supply constraints, however, continue to dominate most conversations with regional businesses    Labor markets remain very tight and anecdotes abound about the lengths to which local   businesses are going to attract and retain workers  Ski areas in Vermont are importing seasonal   workers from unlikely places like Jamaica, Australia, and New Zealand and, in fact, are building   housing for them because housing is another item that’s in quite short supply               46      One company selling fire alarms and building security systems said its sales growth   was below expectations because its customers lacked the labor to complete construction projects    One                                                          from New Hampshire actually bemoaned the fact that   Cisco had chosen to locate a new plant employing 5,000 workers in the southern part of the state    He noted that existing employers believed the plant could be staffed only by stealing workers   from them  And, if new workers in fact were imported, there wouldn't be enough houses to go   around either  The recent increase in the H-1B visa cap was welcomed in the region, but   concerns remain about the lack of skilled labor across many specific occupations   Beyond labor constraints, contacts also mentioned--actually for the first time--other   supply factors  Several cited insufficient supplier production capacity in paper, chemicals, and   electrical steels as a constraining factor  Others mentioned shortages of raw materials such as   beryllium, copper, and plastic resins  Not surprisingly, in the face of both labor and raw   materials constraints, more companies mentioned upward price pressures or actual price   increases than at other points during this year  Labor costs are rising, as are benefits costs; and   unplanned or accelerated pay increases reflect attempts to keep employees happy and retain them   in the face of market pressures   There are factors at work to restrain costs as well  For one, the recent upheaval among   the dot-coms has begun to make a few more high-tech workers available or at least to moderate   their salary demands  Beyond that, many New England manufacturers are small businesses that   are in the supply chain for large retail customers  They reported incredible downward pressures   on selling prices by the big retail chains, as these customers continue to demand better and better   deals               47      Finally, we are seeing some aspects of what might be termed the destructive side of   creative destruction  One firm said that textbook sales have weakened and noted that they were   likely losing market share in the college market to online education materials  A maker of wood   products used in home construction has been adding capacity to produce vinyl products because   of the ongoing switch from wood to vinyl in construction  In fact, one of the few price   reductions we have heard of this year has been in lumber prices, reportedly because of the   growing substitution of alternative construction materials  Another area of restraint is likely   coming from financial market volatility  Decreased financial wealth is likely to have a   significant effect on spending by high-income workers in the region  Moreover, while small   banks are as profitable and healthy as ever, larger ones are seeing some deterioration in   syndicated and other credits granted in the flush days of 1997 and 1998  Credit standards are   being tightened and, along with the rising spreads in bond markets, should act to restrain growth   in the region and elsewhere looking forward   Turning to the nation, the basic outline of the Greenbook’s GDP forecast for the next   couple of years or so is not terribly different from our own, at least as far as the components of   demand are concerned  We see some near-term slowing, just as the Greenbook does, but we   continue to be somewhat less optimistic about structural productivity--a view others have noted   as well  That also makes us a bit less optimistic about where the potential growth rate is  We   also have a little less feedback from productivity change to demand in our forecast  So, we see   some risk of falling unemployment and rising inflation, somewhat more than the staff might have   mentioned as an upside risk  In fact, in our simulation unemployment in Q4 2002 is a full   percentage point below that in the Greenbook because the Greenbook's goes up and ours goes               48      down a bit  We have fairly similar GDP growth but inflation is a full ½ percentage point higher   in our projection   Abstracting from the models, there does seem to be some reason to believe that   underlying demand remains rather strong and that supply factors could be affecting growth   elsewhere than in New England  Labor markets remain tight, import growth is solid, and real   consumer expenditures bounced back in the third quarter  Growth in the latter may be   moderating in the fourth quarter but that moderation would be from very high levels in the earlier   part of the year  And real spending on computers and software has been strong even in the face   of smaller declines in the price of computing power and an actual acceleration in software prices    Add some caution on the productivity side to this picture and one can see the potential for upside   risks   The downside risks have increased as well since our last meeting  Financial markets   are more volatile and funding is harder to come by, whether in the form of debt or equity    Venture capital remains plentiful but as one of our directors recently cautioned, there is a need   for concern about too much money chasing too few bankable deals  The external picture also   seems less optimistic, with the possibility of financial instability rising in Latin America and   Japan and with non-Japan Asia experiencing a variety of problems   In sum, since our last meeting I think the risks have increased both on the inflation   front and on the down side  Moreover, even in a much slower growth environment, cost   pressures left from labor tightness, rising benefits costs, oil price increases, and the possibility of   a declining dollar have the potential to nudge inflation up even if growth slows more than we   expect  The Greenbook forecast may be the best bet right now, but in my view it's founded more               49      than ever on a great deal of uncertainty  There is still a good slug of upside risks but some   increasing downside risks as well  "
4190,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also agree with both the   direction of your policy recommendation, ie, no change in the funds rate, and with the   tilt recommendation  I think Gary Stern summed up my thoughts about these issues quite   completely  We shouldn't overreact to the fact that the expansion is slowing  We wanted   it to slow  We don’t know where potential is  The financial markets happen to be the   means by which it is slowing  It's important to recognize that in our statement, but it’s   also important to keep our focus on the still remaining inflationary risk and the fact that   we need the economy to slow to address that risk  "
4241,2000-12-19,"  Yes, as opposed to the growth     We think we have moderating growth  "
4242,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Current data suggest that the New England   economy continues to grow at a solid pace, with very low unemployment and higher inflation than   the rest of the nation  But recent Beigebook and other contacts suggest an increasing sense of   caution about the future  In addition, a survey we conducted related to the use of stock options as a   form of compensation raises concerns about increasing wage pressures     New England's rate of unemployment declined again in October to 2-1/2 percent, a new   series low  Connecticut, at 2 percent, recorded the lowest state jobless rate in the nation but   Massachusetts wasn't far behind  And even the two New England states with the highest rates of   unemployment, Rhode Island and Maine, are below the national rate by 1/2 percentage point or   better   We've been watching a new Web-based electronic job monitoring service called “Flip   Dog” that began last spring  According to that index, Massachusetts ranks number one in electronic   job vacancies relative to the size of its labor force and in absolute size is second only to California    In addition, according to this service’s job opportunity index, which ranks highly competitive labor   markets with insufficient pools of qualified labor and the need for new workers from out-of-state, all   New England states ranked in the top 10, with Vermont and Massachusetts numbers one and two    Obviously, this is a new source of data and it's hard to know its accuracy  However, it is completely   in tune with the region's reported unemployment rates and the anecdotes we continue to hear about   labor being extremely hard to find and increasingly expensive  In fact, recent Commerce   Department data on personal income for all workers, not just production workers--including hours,      27  tips, and bonuses, as well as wages--indicate that per employee income rose by 6-1/2 percent in the   region from Q2 1999 to Q2 2000  That is 2 percentage points higher than in the nation as a whole   Looking forward, Beigebook and other contacts were more cautious than they have been,   particularly in the manufacturing and retail areas  Software and temporary agency firms still see   very tight labor markets and view the demise of some dot-coms as an opportunity to get skilled   workers that have been in very short supply  Manufacturers have been doing fairly well, especially   in export markets, but sounded concerns about future prospects  In particular, retailers such as Wal-  Mart have cut back orders, and companies in the high-tech arena mentioned concerns about   softening demand on both the consumer and the business sides  One                                          CEO   of a very large bank, recently held a two-day planning session aimed specifically at reducing costs   by 10 percent or better, given the expectation that revenue growth would be slower than expected in   2001  An investment manager of a local large insurance company reported bond losses in 2000 that   were more sizable than expected and a real sense of caution looking forward  Thus, even in the face   of continued regional job strength, export growth, and rising wages and house prices, it is also   increasingly clear that the future is more in doubt and that expectations are gloomier now than they   have been     This sense of increasing uncertainty has characterized the incoming national data since   our last meeting  We, like the Greenbook, have revised our forecast for consumption over the near   term Given relatively weak personal income and real consumption, a weaker stock market, and a   serious drop in motor vehicle spending, we've revised that forecast to the mid-2s along with the   Greenbook, with GDP growth at about 3 percent or a bit below  This slower pace of growth   continues through the first half of 2001 as it does in the Greenbook, with some pickup in the second      28  half  We're a bit agnostic about the Greenbook's assessment of potential, so we see less of an uptick   in unemployment and a bit more price pressure, but overall not enough to quibble about   The interesting question that Dave Stockton and Bob Parry talked about, regarding what is   the definition of ""weak"" in a high potential economy with growing structural productivity, is   something we've debated a bit, too  And I think some of the numbers in the Greenbook baseline   projection stand out simply because of the way the two factors--the higher productivity and the   slower growth--play out  In particular, I really focused on the degree to which unemployment rises   in a very short period of time; I've never seen that before outside of a recession  So this sense that   we are in different waters and different times, and that it’s harder to use the past as a prologue to the   future, certainly has affected our thinking as well   That takes me to the issue of the risks to this forecast  The economy needed to slow    and seemingly it has  Interestingly, however, reflecting that earlier conversation, most levels of   activity--whether we look at car sales, residential investment, employment, sentiment, or changes in   business investment--would at most other times seem pretty solid  But now, after the truly stunning   growth of 1999 into 2000, formerly respectable levels of activity seem meager  The general tenor of   things has soured  That is clear  Witness the stock market, the credit markets, and the general   feelings of doom and gloom  Downside risks certainly have emerged, as the Greenbook makes   clear  But the biggest risk, I think, is overreacting  Labor markets remain strong and consumer and   business spending could as easily be in a lull as a downturn  And inflationary pressures, while   quiescent, have not disappeared  Holding steady seems to me, anyway, a wiser course than moving   now as we wait to see what the New Year brings  Thank you     It's too cold to go out!  "
4243,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly don't want to be predictable but I   suppose I am in this regard     What do they say about consistency being the hobgoblin of something?    I'm also not in favor of retaining any particular policy solely to move the unemployment rate up  I   don't know where the NAIRU is; I don't know whether anyone really knows where it is right now    But I do continue to see resource constraints in labor markets, and they have been a constraint on   growth for some industries  I think the current slowing could potentially lead to a resolution of this   whole problem   Another issue that people have focused on relates to financial conditions--widening credit   spreads and the level of real interest rates  I'm in harmony with Jack Guynn on the idea that credit   markets right now are reflective of the last loans made when spreads were really narrow in 1997 and   early 1998  And in an environment of generally healthy banking conditions, I don't view them as a   problem  I think that bankable credits are getting banked Where should real interest rates be?    That's a tricky question when we’re moving from a period of very rapid growth to one of slower   growth in an environment of strong underlying productivity  So it's hard for me to look at the level   of the fed funds rate right now and see it as a problem all by itself   I agree that we have to wait and see  I would have been able to vote for a balanced risk   statement, but I can also go with a statement of the growing sense of uncertainty on the down side  I   just think we ought not to let all the strength that's still in the economy be forgotten in the face of   what are largely anecdotal and expectations-related data  They could turn if the market receives   what we do today very favorably  So I think the wait-and-see attitude is the right one  Hopefully we   won't have to stand by our telephones!      79    No, I intend on answering     ""We are not yet panicking!""    "
4285,2001-03-20,  So move     No  [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  For the record!  
4286,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The pace of economic activity in   New England is slowing, but by a number of measures it continues to grow and to grow   at a faster rate than in the rest of the nation  Nonetheless, most contacts indicate a sense   of concern about the future  Consumer and business confidence is off, and many contacts   note that credit market tightness is affecting spending plans  They report a new emphasis   on contingency planning and a concerted focus on increasing productivity and reducing   costs     Benchmark revisions to state employment data this January indicate that the   region’s job base grew faster than previously estimated and faster than US employment   over the same period  While these benchmark revisions are based on complete data only   through mid-2000 and thus do not incorporate data for the last two quarters of the year,     3/20/01 33  they are consistent with other indicators  In particular, regional unemployment rates   continue at a series low, with Connecticut experiencing the lowest state jobless rate in the   nation  Initial unemployment claims have moved sideways rather than upward, and help   wanted advertising, while volatile, remains at a level that suggests reasonably strong   labor demand  In addition, the manufacturing workweek in January was an hour longer   in New England than in the rest of the country and the growth rate of manufacturing   wages has increased as well  Anecdotally, contacts continue to note tight labor markets   as a particular concern, though high-tech employees may now be easier to find     One reason why New England may not be experiencing the job woes of other   parts of the country may be that the region’s manufacturing industry mix is less   concentrated in the auto and steel business and more oriented toward electrical equipment   and industrial machinery--industries that are both adding jobs  Indeed, a majority of the   Bank’s Beige Book manufacturing contacts reported growth in sales and orders, though   many noted some areas of weakness or were making contingency plans in case business   softens     Finally, fourth-quarter merchandise export data reinforce the pattern shown   more broadly in employment  The dollar value of exports has risen more in New   England than nationally, and individual manufacturing industries--electrical equipment   for one--are holding up particularly well     Beyond the job picture, other aspects of the region’s economy retain vibrancy    In particular, real estate markets remain tight, especially in the Boston metropolitan area    Some foresee a softening in commercial real estate as failing dotcoms seek to sublet   space no longer needed  But the forecast of commercial real estate conditions suggests     3/20/01 34  that space will be filled rapidly by firms that have been space constrained in the last   several years  Indeed, rents have not softened and while a good deal of commercial   building is under way, nearly all of it is fully committed     So, the recent pattern of economic growth continues in Boston particularly and   in New England more generally  But there are warning signs  Business confidence   slumped in February after having fallen sharply in December, though the index still   remains above 50  Consumer confidence also fell  In line with national trends, the drop   is largely related to expectations about the future     The recent sharp corrections in technology stocks and warnings about earnings   do not bode well for growing regional technology employers like Cisco, Intel, and EMC    And Massachusetts state withholding taxes and sales tax revenues have been relatively   weak  Thus, contacts repeatedly stress a sense of caution about economic conditions     The Bank’s Small Business Advisory Council met last week and I was again   struck by the cautionary approach being taken even by firms that believe themselves   relatively recession proof, like                                                                         Most have had   spending plans curtailed by tight credit markets and face the increasing pressure of major   customers like Wal-Mart reducing inventory levels and demanding price cuts  Of   particular note in the discussion was the focus on efforts to increase productivity and   reduce costs  Sometimes that involves the use of new technology  But in the context of   tighter credit markets and slowing cash flows, the focus mostly was on using existing   technology better and working “harder and smarter” in many ways, big and small     Turning to the nation, I am sure I’m not alone in being surprised by the degree   to which current consumer spending on big ticket items such as cars and houses is at odds     3/20/01 35  with measures of confidence about the future and with the wealth effect of the declining   stock market  Certainly, given the gloom and doom atmosphere on Wall Street and the   media hype about--as well as the reality of--major layoffs, one would expect consumers   to be increasing their savings, paying down debt, and reducing big purchases more than   seems to be the case right now  Perhaps a larger retrenchment will occur, but the   continuing strong picture for employment and income growth suggests that it might   happen later rather than sooner   In that regard, I recently attended a meeting of the policy board of the Kennedy   School, Harvard University Joint Center on Housing Studies  The group includes   prominent national residential builders and major suppliers of building materials  In the   go-around, the large national builders noted some regional weakness, but for the most   part indicated that they expected 2001 to continue along the lines of 2000, which had   been one of their best years ever  These builders had a sufficient backlog of orders to be   relatively confident about 2001, though 2002, of course, remains a question  Building   materials suppliers, in contrast, faced excess supply conditions, consolidation within their   industries, and falling prices     Reflecting stronger current consumption data we, like the Greenbook, have   revised our GDP forecast upward slightly for Q1, but our projection for 2001 remains   about the same as earlier and quite close to that of the Greenbook  This similarity in   outcome hides a number of differences in the numbers underlying the forecasts, but only   one is significant  We remain less persuaded than the Board’s staff that 4 percent is a   good estimate for long-term potential growth  Thus, our estimate of the rise in the   unemployment rate over the year 2001 is about half the 100-plus basis points projected in     3/20/01 36  the Greenbook and we see measures of inflation flattening out in 2002, not declining    Indeed, some on my staff find it hard to believe that unemployment could rise as much as   in the Greenbook forecast--140 basis points or so from its current level over a couple of   years--without a much bigger impact on demand, confidence, and a host of other things    And those developments, in turn, would necessitate much more policy ease   Clearly, there are reasons to believe that the risks either to the Greenbook   forecast or our own slightly different projections remain on the down side  The stock   market deterioration, the foreign outlook, low readings on business and consumer   confidence, high levels of consumer debt, the slowdown in manufacturing, and the   seemingly endless supply of bad news in the high-tech world all feed into these risks    But I think it’s also important to remember that we are experiencing a very rapid   slowdown from an extended period of extremely rapid economic growth  In part the   gloom and doom--earnings warnings, layoff announcements, and delayed new plant   investments--reflect an adjustment from that period of robust growth  That could get out   of hand, it’s true  But for now, labor market and spending indicators suggest that gloom   and doom should not completely rule the day  "
4287,2001-03-20,"   At the time we put that sentence in our press statement, I   know I did not feel that it committed us to--or any way was a formal nuance regarding--  an intermeeting move  But the fact is that the sentence exists and we did take an   intermeeting action  So it seems to me that the pairing of the two is a lot more powerful   now  In my view we can’t take any comfort from the reaction to our press statement in   December; that is not a valid basis on which to judge what would happen now if we use   something close to that sentence in these circumstances     3/20/01 105     One can’t vote against “especially” doubly?  I was looking   forward to voting  [Laughter]  "

4330,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, was struck by the same distinction   that Don mentioned earlier between the real economy as portrayed in the current Greenbook   forecast and the real economy as viewed by the financial markets  The financial discussion in   the staff briefing material we received last night was quite interesting in terms of the differences   mentioned in how the Board staff and other economists see the economy versus how the markets   see it  The financial markets do seem to expect a bottoming out and then an upturn  All that   played into a question that I’ve been asking myself because depending on who is talking,   particularly among our business contacts, we hear either a lot of doom and gloom or some sense   of optimism  The feelings of gloom and doom seem in some ways--and I’d like your perspective   on this--to be tied to where things were a year ago and how bad they seem now in comparison    And the optimism seems to be coming from people who have gotten over that and see that in fact   some orders are coming in     I was also struck by Chart 2 in the material we got last night, which showed   manufacturing capacity growth rates in the high-tech area  That sector was adding capacity at an   annual rate of 42 percent from 1994 to 2000  High-tech capacity now is expected to grow at a     5/15/01     23   rate of something like 21-1/2 percent--almost 10 percentage points better than the experience in   the decade before 1994  So I’m wondering where it is that activity is really so slow  Or is it the   comparison to how fast the economy was growing that makes the real economy seem so bad   now?  Is that tending to shade the way we think about things?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve been saying for some time that   New England was not experiencing the depth of the national slowdown  This was occurring, I   thought, for a variety of reasons industry mix, the extreme tightness of regional labor markets,   and even what turns out to be a powerful impact of a great ski season on local tourism, just to   name three  It now appears, however, that New England is beginning to catch up--or is that   catch down?--with the rest of the country, though in general the region continues to experience   somewhat less softening than the nation as a whole   Employment growth continued to slow in New England and the unemployment rate   has risen since the March Open Market Committee meeting  However, the rate remains well   below that for the nation  And Connecticut, with an unemployment rate of 19 percent, again   recorded the lowest unemployment in the country  Indeed, the recent softening in the regional   labor market was welcomed by many contacts and was seen as a whole new ballgame for hiring   needed staff  One Connecticut manufacturer said that potential hires are now behaving in a more   normal way--that is, not holding out for a BMW or other signing bonus!  Manufacturing is the   only sector cutting jobs in New England and, unlike the nation, business services in our area   continue to expand, although at a slower rate than earlier  Within manufacturing, industries in   which New England has a traditional concentration--industrial machinery and electrical     5/15/01     53   equipment--have slowed markedly in the nation as a whole but not so much in the region    Indeed, in Massachusetts these industries are still expanding     Looking forward, however, the region’s increasing concentration of information   technology companies, software businesses, and particularly telecommunications and Internet-   related industries does not bode well for a continuation of the region’s comparative good fortune    Depending on the extent and depth of retrenchment in technology spending nationwide, New   England, and especially Boston, may well experience an increasing severity in their downturn    Clearly, this is the region’s largest area of vulnerability and uncertainty     Business confidence in general dropped in April to a level not seen since 1993, after   recovering some ground in March  The index, however, is sharply divided between current and   future sentiment  The current index is below 50, indicating a negative assessment, while the   index for conditions six months ahead, though lower than in March, has remained above 50    Most of the manufacturers contacted for the Beige Book are cutting or postponing capital   spending projects, especially planned expansions of capacity  However, in research and   development, expenditures are being stretched out, not eliminated  Belt tightening, either in the   face of declining business or simply in anticipation of it, seems to be the order of the day     Consumer confidence also dropped in April and is now much lower than it was a year   ago  And unlike the view of business executives, consumers see the current situation as   relatively positive, probably because of a continuing strong jobs picture, but the future has not   looked as bleak to them since the early ’90s  Retail sales in the region seem to have flattened out   in recent months and retailers are cautious about the future  In this relatively high-income   region, concern was expressed about the negative wealth effect of lower stock market values, but   retailers did see continued support from New England’s relatively low unemployment levels     5/15/01     54   In short, while businesses may be holding off on spending, households may continue   to be a source of strength in New England  The potential for this is clearest in the housing   markets  Here prices continue to rise at rates above those of the nation  All six states   experienced such increases, while a year ago three of the six lagged behind the national rate    Beige Book contacts saw regional real estate markets as strong in April, and inventory seemed to   be a constraint, not weakness in demand  Indeed, the rise in consumer prices, as reflected by the   Boston area’s CPI, remained well above the national rate, largely because of increases in the   housing portion of the index     Since our March FOMC meeting, we at the Bank have held a meeting of our   Academic Advisory Council and a series of meetings with bankers in the region, along with our   usual directors’ meetings  The academics were, with few exceptions, surprisingly unfazed by the   current slowdown  They saw some resilience in the consumer and some likelihood that business   capital spending might resume sooner rather than later, given the continuing pace of   technological change  A few saw inflation concerns on the horizon but the majority agreed that   the risks remained a bit on the down side  It was hard to see any sign of slowdown from the   reports we heard in our meetings with bankers  Small banks in the region continue to benefit   from the strong ski season, strong mortgage refinancing, vibrant housing markets, and good   prospects for the summer season  In fact, one banker with the region’s largest beer distributor as   a customer noted that in times of serious economic problems, beer drinkers typically move down   the food chain from expensive imports like Heineken to Bud or even Genesee  [Laughter]  In   that regard, he reported that cases of Heinekens still fly off the distributors’ shelves   Let me turn to the national data and the Greenbook projections  They should give   Heineken distributors and drinkers some pause!  Our projections are quite similar to those of the     5/15/01     55   Greenbook a slow second quarter, hopefully above a negative number but likely below 1 percent   growth; a slower second half than we had earlier projected; and stronger growth in 2002, though   below our earlier expectations  Our estimate of the economy’s potential remains a bit below that   of the Greenbook, though less so since the Greenbook’s downward revision in near-term   structural productivity growth  Thus, our unemployment estimate ticks up a bit less than the   Greenbook’s, under an assumption of unchanged policy, and the CPI moves sideways   It’s also clear that the risks remain predominantly on the down side  The length and   depth of the downturn in technology spending and the related technology investment overhang   remain extremely uncertain  Rising unemployment and sideways stock markets cannot help but   affect consumer spending  And the foreign picture is increasingly negative as well  Thus some   further policy ease may well be necessary  But like others, I also believe it is time for serious   reflection on the pace and size of policy easing--a consideration of how much is too much  I   think this for at least three reasons  First, inflation is not dead  Recent data clearly are driven by   energy costs, but the energy situation doesn’t show signs of going away soon  In the near term   such costs, along with rising benefit costs, may simply bode ill for profit margins and contribute   to rising unemployment and lower stock market prices  In the medium term, however--nine   months to a year out--if demand accelerates more than projected, inflation rising from its current   levels may well be an issue  Indeed, the recent steepening of yield curves may reflect some rise   in inflation expectations, though I realize that is by no means clear     Second, even if higher inflation is not a concern, financial market excesses should be    As we saw in 1994 and in 1997-98, extended periods with interest rates that are arguably too low   for too long or are perceived to move in only one direction can produce a predilection for one-    5/15/01     56   way market bets of one sort or the other  Concerns for the stability of growth in the period   following the current slowdown seem to me to argue for some caution now   Last but not least, I think the fiscal picture is a wild card  It has been a while since   fiscal policy has been available for use as countercyclical tool  The Greenbook’s estimates may   or may not be right, but with both government spending increases and tax cuts in the mix going   forward, I think a measure of uncertainty abounds here  Let me be very clear I don’t disagree   with the Greenbook’s assessment of current and near-term conditions  They do seem to be   weaker than is optimal, even recognizing that the slowdown the economy is experiencing is one   that was needed  Moreover, the slowdown now seems to be hitting the economy’s primary   source of earlier strength the hardest, namely high-tech investment  And that has a potential   range of effects that go well beyond spending and perhaps into productivity  But now is also the   time to begin to consider carefully the environment nine to twelve months out and to reflect on   what the level of real interest rates should be to ensure that that environment is a good one    Some would argue that it’s easy to reverse the final policy move if it seems to be one step too   far  I think that is hard to do in part because so much of the data we see are backward-looking,   not forward-looking  It could also be argued that we are one or two moves away from going too   far  That may be true but, like others, I think the time has come for caution  Thank you  "
4331,2001-05-15,"  I agree with both of your recommendations, Mr Chairman  But I   would like to associate myself very closely with everything that President Broaddus just said  I   could have supported a move of 50 basis points with a balanced risk statement; I could have   supported 25 basis points with a statement that the risks continue to be weighted toward economic   weakness  I could have supported and argued for--although Al did a much better job than I would   have--either one of those positions     I think it is critical, though, if we are going to send a signal, that we send it in a   message from the Committee and not in various speeches  I am not in any way denigrating your   efforts in that regard, Mr Chairman, but if we want to send a message from the Committee I   believe it is important that we in fact send it from the Committee  So I would reiterate --      Instead of now?      Well, I think Al Broaddus has a point, and it may be worthwhile in   the statement we put out today to say something about the limits on how far we can go in one   direction     5/15/01     86     I have two suggestions  First, take the second and the third   paragraphs out and go from the statement of action to the statement of risks  Second, add a     5/15/01     97   sentence to that last paragraph which says, “In that regard, the Committee recognizes that 250   basis points of easing is now in the pipeline”  Period       Considerably!     Could I just add a comment?  I’m getting increasingly nervous   about these statements  They are getting longer and longer and we have a total of five minutes to   look at them yet they end up making a big difference in how our policy action is received  We   spent it seemed to me months working on a statement of risks, which now gets totally lost in the   wordage that is being added to the statement  And as a Committee we don’t really get a chance   to talk about that enough  I’m very concerned about that  "
4373,2001-08-21, Second  
4374,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, what a difference six weeks   make!  Or maybe I should say what a difference one additional month of data and some revisions   of past data make  You will recall that New England’s headline economic data had been a bit   better than those for the nation as a whole, though anecdotes from regional businesses had been   turning increasingly gloomy  That gloom seems now to be justified  With the state and regional   employment data that were released last Friday, the region looks considerably different, with   levels of employment declining month to month and year-over-year growth at a fraction of its     8/21/01 23   long-term trend  The unemployment rate also tipped up from month to month by 03 percentage   point Add to that the escalating costs in the Boston metropolitan area and the fact that the   anecdotes have turned from gloomy to almost ugly and we have a region that no longer appears   to be Teflon coated Where is the downturn occurring?  In the usual places--primarily   manufacturing, particularly high-tech manufacturing, though retailers also describe consumer   activity as anemic    Several themes run through our discussions with manufacturers  First, most in the   high-tech arena are convinced now that the turnaround is not likely to come anytime soon  Some   firms don't expect a resumption of ""normal"" activity, however that is defined right now, until the   second half of 2002 In the face of weak demand and no signs of a pickup, the emphasis is on   reducing costs Even the unusual firm that continues to do well is being much more cautious on   the cost side Businesses of all sizes are putting enormous pressure on their supply chains    We've heard this before but demands for price concessions reportedly have accelerated   The second theme has to do with IT spending  Almost all high-tech manufacturers   noted that one major reason IT spending will pick up only very slowly is that many companies   are quite a ways from growing into the infrastructure they already own  Also, obsolescence is   being carefully managed  Desktops, once obsolete in two years, can be left in place for five   years One of the Bank's directors referred to this as a lack of “killer apps”  That is, in the face   of slow demand, considerable IT investment already in place, as well as cost pressures, the new   technology that will drive new spending has yet to surface and may well be greeted with some   skepticism when it does   Finally, among both large and small firms the availability of bank credit has become a   concern Even when firms have found financing in the bond market not much of a problem,     8/21/01 24   they’ve seen credit market difficulties impact partner companies and joint ventures and have   experienced difficulties in renewing their own revolving credit arrangements  Big firms with   lower credit ratings are reportedly shut out of credit markets and smaller healthy firms are facing   higher rates   There are a few brighter spots in the region  Residential construction and real estate   markets have held up well, albeit with some deterioration at the high end of the market  In   addition, labor market tightness has eased  This seems to be helping area firms keep costs in   check, as there is much less upward pressure on compensation  Firms that are still hiring say   they are able to be much more selective; it is easier to get new hires, and the recruits are of better   caliber   Turning to the nation, I think it is possible to read the current economy in two ways    First, some data may be in the process of plateauing  Employment levels seem to be declining at   a slower rate And perhaps some comfort can be taken in the single month of flat, not declining,   industrial production Consumer sentiment is hanging in there, as are residential investment and   consumer spending  Businesses are continuing to work on increasing productivity largely by   reducing costs, and they have reacted to profit pressures by digging in, not by raising prices   Indeed, at least one source of cost pressures, energy prices, has provided some relief already and   should continue to do so going forward No one knows when high-tech spending will pick up,   but one gets the sense that a huge premium is being put on using existing capital to its fullest,   which augurs well for future productivity   Looking back over the postwar period, it's unusual to find two or more quarters of   GDP growth at more than 1 percentage point below potential without a recession occurring either   immediately or one or two quarters later  Arguably, one of the only times such a period of slow     8/21/01 25   growth was followed by an enduring pickup was in the 1994-95 period, the so-called “soft   landing” With the monetary ease now in place and whatever more is needed and the tax cut as   well, this period may turn out to be a similar landing--perhaps not so soft--prior to the takeoff of   business investment  It may be that the economy, and particularly the consumer, will continue to   muddle through until then   Certainly that's what the Greenbook expects, as does the Boston Fed’s forecast  Our   forecast dynamics may be a little different in regard to the stability of structural productivity and   the level of the NAIRU, but the overall forecast is remarkably similar  We anticipate slower   growth this year than we had expected earlier, a gradual return to growth near potential--growth   at 3 percent or maybe a bit lower by year-end 2002--with an uptick in unemployment not as large   as in the Greenbook projection, and easing inflation  This isn't a bad outcome  In fact, again   historically speaking, it would be unusually positive  But such a forecast does require some   confidence in the more positive readings of the situation that I just delineated   Obviously, the other way to read the current situation is to focus on the worsening   profit situation Unless relieved by slower compensation growth and damped energy costs, profit   pressures do not bode well for the stock market, business investment, or job growth  If   consumers are hit by rapidly rising joblessness, all bets are off on housing, auto sales, and   consumption of services, as a slowdown of manufacturing spreads and becomes a wider   slowdown, and economic history repeats itself  Moreover, the other dark cloud--the external   situation, with slowing growth and regional crisis conditions--cannot help matters  As I said, the   issue is how much credibility one gives to the muddling-through hypothesis  I come out on that   side, but I think it's a close call  Thank you  "
4375,2001-08-21," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I have had   concerns similar to President Stern’s and possibly others around the table that we won’t quickly   recognize when the economy has turned around and that policy will be too easy too long  But   given where we are, it seems to me that policy needs to be a little easier in order to provide the   appropriate level of support I was struck by your comment that virtually the whole world   economy is supported by consumer spending and the residential housing markets in the United   States It’s a powerful thought and one that occurred to me as well  So I am in favor of this   move but I think we need to be very careful going forward for all the reasons that President Stern   mentioned    That was actually me!    Yes  "
4420,2001-10-02," Just to switch the subject a bit, Dino, you passed over the   changes in the yield curve rather quickly  I’m interested in your perception of what the   market is thinking about the shape of the yield curve these days and whether the outer   end of the curve is a supply issue totally or if it is conveying other information    Any thoughts on how to do that?  "
4421,2001-10-02," Dave, I was intrigued by the changes in your estimates of   structural productivity--19 percent in 2001, slowing to 15 percent in 2002, and picking   up to 18 percent in 2003 I know there are close relationships between productivity,   capital deepening, and business fixed investment and so forth  We’ve been looking   backward, but suppose we look forward and make the assumption that the impetus to be     10/2/01 27   more and more productive and more focused on the cost side is still very much present in   US industries If we assume that this is not as much a function of capital deepening but   increasingly a function of industrial reorganization or a sheer desire to do things better   and cheaper all the time, what would a slightly higher and more stable level of   productivity growth do to your projections? I know you have that feedback effect into   demand  I’m interested in how that might look in the 2002-2003 time frame    And slightly lower unemployment?    Thank you, Mr Chairman All of the available data on New   England suggest that the regional economy slowed, possibly at an increasing rate, in the   period since our last Open Market Committee meeting  Employment declined between   July and August; each of the states in our District registered a higher unemployment rate    The value of manufactured exports declined, especially computers and electronics, and   consumer and business confidence fell substantially  But these data almost entirely   predate the tragic events of September 11th   What feel we have for developments in the region since that time therefore   relies more on anecdotal sources than science  I certainly understand Dave Stockton’s   comment about the desire to speak less when there is little science on one’s side, but I   feel compelled to explore the anecdotal reports that we have heard  At our Bank we had   the benefit of hearing from those who attended two regularly scheduled advisory   committee meetings--our small business and our academic advisory councils--and two   regularly scheduled bankers’ forums, all of which took place after September 11th In   addition, both before and after the tragedy, I spoke personally to several of the Bank’s   directors outside of regular meetings and to the CEOs of several large manufacturing and   financial services companies  And, of course, we had the additional post-September 11th   calls to Beige Book contacts Several themes emerged from these interactions   First, economic activity across a wide sample of firms and industries was   slowing even in advance of September 11th, though not all the news was bad The strong   dollar and slowing demand had contributed to problems at many regional manufacturers,   including one large worldwide manufacturer of consumer products  The US forest   product industry was reported by one contact to be on the verge of collapse, despite the        10/2/01 46   strong housing market, largely because of increased foreign competition related to the   strong dollar and excess capacity put in place in the early to mid-1990s  The head of a   regional software industry council reported on the demise of hundreds of firms in the   wake of the drying up of demand, especially for Internet-related software  But she also   reported that new start-ups were being formed as well, in fields such as wireless   communication and teleconferencing  Similarly, regional businesses in the field of   security saw the potential for some benefit in the near term, and a few had already seen a   pickup in demand  Many contacts reported a very welcome softening in labor markets   and the ability to attract technical staff easily for the first time in recent years  Housing   markets reportedly had slowed, particularly at the high end, but the slowing reflected   reductions from very high levels of activity earlier   Second, the impact of the tragedy of September 11th was significant both   culturally and economically but at least some aspects of the economic jolt will be short   lived A highly rated large manufacturer of airplane engines and consumer and industrial   building products commented that access to commercial paper markets had been difficult   during the week of the tragedy but that markets had more or less returned to normal, at   least for very short maturity paper  Small manufacturers and suppliers of retail goods had   experienced an immediate drop-off in demand  And bankers noted that traffic in   branches came to a halt in the days following the tragedy  By the following weekend,   however, shoppers had returned to malls One specialty food and flower vendor, whose   business had been disrupted by a lack of airplane shipments of imported goods, reported   that sales for Rosh Hashanah broke all previous records  Families crowded his stores,     10/2/01 47   apparently in a desire both to be together and to enjoy the simple process of getting ready   for the holiday   There were, of course, important exceptions to this impression of short-term   disruption The airline engine manufacturer I mentioned noted that each engine is sold   three times--once as a new product and twice in the form of parts in the after-market    With airline traffic down and likely to stay depressed, this executive thought that new   orders would be curtailed sharply and that the number of parked aircraft would swell to   perhaps twice the current number, which was already at the level of the last recession    He also expressed some concerns about the amount of supplier credit his firm had   extended to airlines   Another hard hit area is likely to be the New England tourism industry  The   economic slowdown had already eaten into the “leaf peeping” season, but the dramatic   decline in airline traffic, particularly from foreign countries, had brought the flow of large   buses of tourists to a halt Reportedly there has been an increase in Eastern seaboard   tourists looking to relax a car drive away rather than an airplane flight away  But tourism   in the region and particularly in Boston remains low  The fall tourist inflow is a mainstay   to the region and its demise may involve more than short-run disruption   Finally, all contacts saw prospects for the immediate future as more than   unusually uncertain  Members of the academic advisory group noted the difficulty of   finding a historical comparison on which to base forecasts and they debated both the   possible size and impact of fiscal stimulus  Some felt that the potential for spending on   homeland defense and on new military weapons, such as destroyers and planes, could be   considerable A few also saw the potential for an inflationary impact from a supply     10/2/01 48   shock related to moving substantial resources to fighting terrorism, if demand for more   usual consumer products did not abate considerably  Most, however, did not see inflation   as a current worry and focused more on the likelihood of negative rates of economic   growth for two to three quarters   In sum, shock, increased uncertainty, and turmoil, however short-lived, have   been piled onto a regional economy that had been holding on to growth by its fingernails    It’s not a pretty picture   Turning to the national scene, the picture doesn’t get much better  Whether   one looks at the Greenbook or the forecasts of DRI, the Blue Chip, or our Bank, the   outlook is the same--two or three quarters of mildly negative growth, a rebound over   2002 to rates of growth at about potential in 2003, and sharply rising unemployment    Even without the tragic events of September 11th, the prospects for this year and next   would have been less positive today than they appeared in August  This was clear from   the summer’s industrial production data and employment and confidence indicators   But sadly, the events of September 11th happened and the slowing economy   received a serious negative shock The obvious questions are how serious and how   negative, but the answers are more than normally uncertain  We have very little data as   yet to go on and not much in the way of history to guide us  The Greenbook expects the   dip into negative territory to be relatively short and mild in nature, with consumption   never actually turning negative  That’s fairly unusual if in fact this is to be the first   recession of the new millennium  I’m forced to wonder whether we are not engaged in a   form of wishful thinking--the same process that has pushed the recovery out further in   time in our forecast at every successive meeting this year  Corporate profits,     10/2/01 49   employment, asset markets, consumer spending, business investment, and confidence all   present elements of increasing downside risk  Moreover, the confluence of weakness   both here and abroad, while not unprecedented, is not comforting either  Thus, there are   real risks that the baseline forecast has more than the normal amount of downside   potential   Offsetting this, of course, is the likelihood of additional fiscal stimulus  Again,   questions abound  How much stimulus will be enacted, when will it affect the economy,   and how will it be seen by financial markets?  The Greenbook provides a reasoned   estimate of the amount of such stimulus  But even the amount included in that forecast   seems small relative to the rhetoric coming out of Washington  In that regard, I wish I   understood better what the shape of the yield curve might be telling us about the risks   over the medium term          The other potential offset is the degree of monetary ease  We’ve reduced the   federal funds target by 350 basis points since January  That’s a much faster pace than in   the early 1990s when it took a couple of years to implement about that same amount of   change Moreover, 75 basis points of that easing was done over the last few weeks and   arguably has not worked its way into the economy  But with the decline in the stock   market and the widening of risk spreads, financial conditions are not as accommodative   as our degree of policy easing might imply  Earlier this year the consumer was the   mainstay of the economy, bolstered by lower interest rates, and it was reasonable to be   concerned about overdoing such low rates over the near term  Now, both consumption   and investment face the headwinds of further diminished confidence, growing     10/2/01 50   uncertainty, and falling demand  Fiscal stimulus, if properly fashioned and temporary,   can help But at least in the near term, monetary policy should do more as well    "
4422,2001-10-02," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, could I add a comment to that?    It isn’t always necessary to be speaking to the press in order   to be seen as visible within the District  I’ve done more outreach than usual since   September 11th to any number of groups without appearing in the press one time  And I   feel comfortable, though I know the range of uncertainty is wide, that because of that   activity I have some feel of what is going on--much more so than if I had made a dozen   speeches That’s because these interactions give us more information and they involve   less effort and worry than speaking to the press, with all the preparation that goes into   that So I think it’s something that we all ought to think about carefully as we balance   how to spend our time            "
4465,2001-11-06," I don’t have any good stories about the Alamo or anything similar  On   the Friday morning before Open Market Committee meetings, I usually meet with a group of local   investment professionals and economists from the District’s largest banks  This group has a pretty   good take on credit conditions locally and nationally, on market realities and expectations, and on   risks in general After a fairly gloomy go-around about near-term prospects, I asked if anyone saw   light at the end of the tunnel  The only response was that by the fourth quarter profit comparisons   should start to be made against the slowing economy of late 2000, making otherwise dismal behavior   look a little better Their take on the prospects for substantial fiscal stimulus was equally downbeat    They viewed the current situation in Washington as political gridlock and didn’t expect anything like   the near-term fiscal stimulus shown in the Greenbook  Monetary policy seemed to them to hold out   the only hope  But they also seemed to believe that lower interest rates could do only so much to   spur demand on the part of consumers who were either experiencing or fearing layoffs or on the part   of businesses faced with sizable excess capacity, inventories to work off, and declining profits     This overall assessment may be a bit gloomy for the nation as a whole  Auto sales in   particular suggest that consumers have not gone into total hibernation and will react to a good--or   maybe I should say spectacular--deal on interest rates, albeit largely by changing the timing of their   expenditures Moreover, the stock market is upbeat, all things considered  And I am a bit more   confident than the group about the prospects for at least some fiscal stimulus       11/6/01 32   Their outlook, however, is completely consistent with everything we know about the First   District economy  We do not yet have any regional employment data past September 11, but   available indicators suggest that New England’s economy has declined recently, likely at a sharper   pace than that for the nation  In part this is because the slowdown in the region occurred later than   that in the country as a whole and our area is to some extent playing catch-up, but it also reflects the   growing impact of a fall-off in high-tech equipment and software spending     Both consumer and business confidence about the current economy are off substantially,   and non-manufacturing respondents to recent business surveys are now seeing sales declines and   have joined manufacturers in a negative overall assessment of business conditions  Initial claims for   unemployment insurance rose sharply, and help-wanted advertising both in print and online   deteriorated markedly as well  Sales of existing homes fell sharply in September and permits for   new homebuilding trended down through August  Similarly, office vacancies were up substantially,   to 8-1/2 percent in downtown Boston and to nearly 14 percent in the suburban markets  These   vacancy rates might not seem high in an absolute sense, but, relatively, they are multiples of the rates   prevailing a year ago and represent a sea change in Boston real estate markets   Business conditions are not expected to get better any time soon  Surveys of business   confidence see no recovery until well into 2002 A University of Massachusetts leading indicator   index points to declining economic activity in Massachusetts for the next six months  And the New   England economic project, in which our Bank participates, forecasts a sharp drop in regional activity   continuing into the first half of 2002 followed by very slow growth   On the national scene, the question no longer seems to be whether the economy is in   recession The latest employment and durable goods data seem to seal that  The questions now     11/6/01 33   focus on how deep and how long the turndown will be and what appropriate further policy action   should be taken   We see a similar trajectory in near-term economic activity as the Greenbook, even with its   latest revisions that take into account last Friday’s unemployment data  Negative growth is expected   to be relatively short-lived--three quarters--even with that change in the employment picture,   followed by a snapback induced by fiscal stimulus, monetary ease, and a revival of inventory   spending If cyclical turns are a fact of life at some point, and I think they are, the Greenbook and   many other forecasts as well suggest that this contraction might not be such a bad one  But   uncertainties abound The unemployment report was unexpectedly negative  Claims data suggest   that another jump in the unemployment rate may be a foregone conclusion  And the drop in durable   goods orders doesn’t bode well My breakfast group may be overly gloomy but the risks to   consumption and business spending that they discussed I think are real  Corporate profits have   deteriorated significantly and analysts have been revising what had been overly optimistic forecasts    External sources of demand don’t add much in what now appears to be a global recession  Fiscal   stimulus may save the day, as the Greenbook suggests, but the possibilities for political gridlock are   there, creating uncertainty both about the amount of stimulus and its timing  State and local   government spending almost certainly will contract in early 2002, as these bodies dig in to rainy day   funds and cut back spending in the face of decreased revenue  Monetary policy has eased   aggressively and the stock market seems to have leveled off But other aspects of financial markets--  spreads and commercial bank credit tightening--suggest financing conditions that may be tougher   than the level of real short-term interest rates implies   That said, I keep arguing with myself about how to view these undeniably downside risks   in terms of the stance of policy  How low should rates go?  How fast should they get there?  And     11/6/01 34   how easy will it be to tighten conditions when that is necessary?  Much of the data we have on the   current economy continue to reflect the tragedy of September 11th Confidence, consumer spending,   and even business investment might begin to look better with a little more time  Further monetary   easing might help, but I think we also need to be careful not to overreact  I realize that inflation is   not a current worry and that growth is now far below potential and will likely be so for some time to   come  But policy easing has been particularly forceful to date  And I confess to some misgivings   about rapidly approaching the point where nominal rates can no longer be reduced    "
4466,2001-11-06," My question is along the same line  You’ve drawn--and maybe this is   just my perspective--what seems to me to be a fairly stark difference between a cut of 25 versus a cut   of 50 basis points I must say I was troubled by your comment about getting ourselves into a   liquidity trap without a 50 basis point cut  I understood you to say that a 25 basis point cut would     11/6/01 75   not work to avoid that problem  I found the starkness of your argument a little off-putting and I   thought you might expound a bit more on that    Let me say a little about the implicit comparison to the Japanese   situation We’ve been so much more aggressive in a very much shorter period of time than the Bank   of Japan was And our economy is so much more resilient--people use that word over and over--   than their economy seems to be in terms of the expectations of consumers and the innovation of   businesses and so forth I recognize that there is a potential for all of the academic work we’ve put   into the zero bound on nominal interest rates to come into play here, but I question the reality of   those expectations or those worries in the context of where rates are now    Right    I don’t put that out of the bounds of possibilities  It’s a question of how   much control we use in the process of getting there    I, like President Hoenig, would be much more comfortable with a move   of 25 basis points or even no change versus your recommendation of 50 basis points  I want to go   through some of my thinking on this  I think it’s right to ease further  I had the same kind of battle   with myself over the weekend that a couple of other people in this room, including you, Mr   Chairman, have talked about  But I continue to believe that there’s some need for caution  We have   a lot of monetary policy ease in the pipeline and potential fiscal stimulus as well  It’s important not   to overreact  The recession seems to be baked in the cake now; the incoming data will be negative    But the process has to play itself out And as Dave Stockton mentioned, recessions do inevitably   come to an end     There’s not a lot we can do about the near term  Monetary policy doesn’t work in the near   term  It can be a support for confidence And I think we provided support through our policy   actions after the terrorist attacks; we put enough into the pipeline to bolster confidence  But right   now I don’t see further easing as a confidence-bolstering move  I think it is likely to work in the   direction of confirming people’s thoughts about the impotence of monetary policy because there   won’t be much effect in the near term  Instead, most of the impact will be felt next year--around the   end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter perhaps--when the economy is   expected to be picking up anyway  And I have great faith that it will be picking up  How, when,   and to what degree, I don’t know, but I think this economy has a lot of resilience  In fact, people     11/6/01 89   have mentioned that lower rates now could actually increase long rates because the market   apparently sees a quicker pickup than does our forecast   There’s probably not a lot of difference between a move of 25 or 50 basis points today  I   don’t see big differences in outcomes  I don’t see the stark distinctions that Don was drawing and I   don’t see major differences in being wrong here  But I do think that a 25 basis point cut would   suggest a bit more control on our part  I think it would show that we are being more forward-  looking rather than focusing on the recent incoming data  To me it would indicate that wherever we   stop the policy position might be a little less stimulative to the inevitable upturn than otherwise  I   don’t see the comparison to the current Japanese situation, though I fully understand the front-  loading part of that argument  I don’t think going 25 basis points versus 50 would indicate that the   central bank in the United States is part of the problem rather than part of the solution  But all that   said, I do take your points on the feedback effects of the international situation now and the potential   for a downward spiral And if the psychology doesn’t work domestically, I think it does work a little   on the international side  It’s a tough call for me right now but I am willing to go with your   leadership    Do you need a vote on this statement?    I just want to ask whether it’s really necessary to make what could be   interpreted as derogatory references to enhancing security  It’s clear that the diversion of resources   to security enhancement will have a negative effect on productivity, but do we really need to say that   in this statement?  After all, the whole world is dependent upon people feeling comfortable with the   security measures being taken because the world has changed forever, in my view anyway  People   need to feel that these measures will be beneficial for the long term  I don’t think we need to say   this    Can we just say that because of the economic slowdown or the cyclical   impact or something like that productivity growth will slow?    Yes, I know what you mean  But I don’t think this is the time to be   sounding quite so negative about security    But the economic slowdown all by itself produces a reduction in   productivity    Yes    No, I realize that    That’s my point exactly  You stated it so much better than I did     I don’t think that takes away the negative tenor    We’re trying to get across a very sophisticated concept here    Yes, right    Did you keep in “advances in productivity” or did you say “measured   productivity”?    But one could argue, along the lines that President Jordan did, that the   actual productivity of the US economy is better because of what might have been looked at as   overhead expenditures on clean air and clean water  This reallocation of resources may turn out not   to be a terrible development    Right    The improved quality of life could make the overall labor force more   efficient     11/6/01 97    I know    No, we don’t But I also don’t think we want to come out with a   statement that could be interpreted negatively  Granted, there are a zillion different sophisticated   arguments one can make about why this statement is true  I still think the public interpretation of it   will be negative with regard to security    Well, maybe it’s just an interpretation  I think investment in security is   a good thing right now That’s what we need    Yes     11/6/01 98    How about “may restrain advances in near-term measurements of   productivity”    That’s shorter  "
4513,2001-12-11, Second  
4514,2001-12-11," Let me explore a couple of related issues  Dino talked about the different   explanations various market participants are giving regarding the jump in the yield curves  A couple   of people that I’ve talked to in the Boston area really have been affected, in terms of the way they look   at the market, by the level of volatility  They view the uncertainty quotient relating to some of the   yields as significant, particularly on the bond side where they see a market that is not as deep because   of corporate supply conditions  On the equity side, the question of how to interpret what the equity   markets are saying is a very interesting one, given the drop in inflation expectations and the rise in   equity prices and in yields on the bond side I’m wondering whether, if instead of extreme optimism,   we’re seeing as well a degree of real uncertainty  There’s perhaps a desire to climb on and not be left   behind but also--if one combines the volatility and the lack of depth of markets--some underlying   uncertainty about where things are going  Those market moves may not be as clear a message of   strength as one might be inclined to interpret them  I wonder how one factors that into one’s thinking     12/11/01 20    A related issue, I think, involves what you said in answer to President Jordan’s question   when you talked about excess capacity and your forecast of the unemployment rate and a declining   rate of inflation even into 2003 The declining rate of inflation is at odds with most of the other major   forecasts and may be at odds with the way the market sees it as well  Could you comment on both of   those points?    Right    Yes, it was the bond market volatility    Yes     12/11/01 22     Just one follow-up question I wasn’t very clear before on the issue of   the drop in inflation expectations  With inflation being a measure of resource capacity use--whether or   not we have excess capacity--is it possible that the declining inflation expectations are telling us   something about people’s expectations about unemployment rates and pressures on capacity in the   future that is significantly different from what the stock market is telling us about the optimism for   real growth?    They haven’t dropped at all?    The same bounce as the shorter-term expectations    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The New England economy slowed further   since our last meeting and remains largely in sync with national trends  That is, the nation is now   officially in a recession and so by extension is New England  Payroll employment for the region   declined in October and job levels in every state are below their earlier highs, though for the region as   a whole employment still remains slightly above its year-ago level  The regional unemployment rate   continues to be below that of the nation but the regional rate has jumped up at a faster pace recently    Looking forward, a significant increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance suggests that the   unemployment rate will rise even further  In addition, help-wanted advertising deteriorated markedly   in October, with print ads falling about 40 percent on a year-over-year basis  Online job listings have     12/11/01 40   not fallen as much and their rate of decline has abated a bit  That may signal some bottoming out in   the market for high-tech workers, but overall prospects for the job situation in New England seem   weak   Our Beige Book contacts reported in November that the region’s commercial real estate   markets deteriorated in the last few months, with the Boston area affected most significantly  After   almost a decade of markedly below average vacancies as compared with the nation as a whole,   Boston’s rates have converged to national averages over a period of only four quarters and in the   process have tripled Rental rates, not surprisingly, have come down as well, especially in the   suburban markets Contacts say that commercial markets outside the Boston area have been less tight   during the previous few years and as a result have felt the slowdown in recent months to a lesser   degree   Manufacturing continues to be weak, with employment declining by 4 percent in October   on a year-over-year basis In particular, the value of manufactured exports has fallen significantly and   at a much faster pace than in the nation as a whole  So, the situation in the region is looking much   gloomier than only a few short months ago--in the early to mid-summer    One striking indication of this is the downturn of Massachusetts State revenues  Through   the end of fiscal 2001 in May, revenues were growing at a pace of 4 percent--below plan but solid    Beginning in June, revenues stopped growing and in fact dropped by 3 percent; that drop has   continued through today That is a sharp and sudden swing, which I think reflects the broader   experience in the region--a mild slowdown in the spring and then a sudden negative jolt as the summer   began Obviously September 11th did not help but it now seems that the slowdown was well at hand   before that tragic day     12/11/01 41    One key question after such a drop in activity is  When will things get better?  We held   several meetings in the last few weeks aimed at gauging answers to that question  We met with local   business people to talk about business prospects, particularly with regard to technology spending  In   addition, we reviewed several measures of regional sentiment--consumer, manufacturing, and high-  tech business confidence--along with a set of economic indicators for Massachusetts alone  Finally,   along with our Beige Book calls we also contacted a series of temporary help agencies in the region     Taken together, the data and anecdotes suggest that New England consumers,   manufacturers, and high-tech sector executives do not expect an improvement in economic conditions   before the second half of next year, nor do the leading indicators forecast a turnaround  Many contacts   in temporary staffing firms indicate that business may improve late in the second quarter or possibly   early in the third quarter Manufacturers and retailers see the upturn further out in the second half    But contacts in software and IT firms are much more uncertain, and the predictions they give when   pushed are generally concentrated in late 2002 or early 2003  Some tech executives say the   technology recession will be longer and deeper than that of the rest of the economy and report that   more shakeout is still to come among technology firms    Finally, to end the regional discussion on a bit more upbeat note, our New England   Advisory Council met last Friday and that group of small business people clearly sees this period as   not only a time of uncertainty and challenge but also a time of opportunity  Most members of the   group reported that one or more product lines remain strong and commented on this being a period   when attention to customers and/or innovative products or services would pay off in terms of   increased market share  A member of the group from a technology consulting company reported a   very recent major positive change in US bookings  Based on his personal contacts, he believes this   spate of new business was shared by the major consulting firms like McKinsey and Bain as well      12/11/01 42    Business remains poor outside the United States, however  He attributed these increased bookings to   the stock market upturn, which he regards as a leading indicator for the consulting business  Several   members noted an increased ability to hire skilled workers, which had enabled them to be more   innovative and source new products and services in house  The two problems faced by all were the   increasing costs of insurance--not just for health care but for property and unemployment insurance as   well--and a lack of bank financing except on a fully secured basis  In sum, these small businesses in   New England seem at this point to be weathering the recession well and preparing to be stronger   competitors when the economy turns up    Turning to the national scene, certainly the equity markets seem to think the time is near   when economic activity will turn up  But I wonder whether that seeming confidence is a bit   premature  My reading of the incoming data, particularly as they relate to employment, is that the   upturn may be further out than the market expects  And my confidence in the strength of the upturn in   2002 projected by both the Greenbook and our own staff forecast is less than 100 percent     After a first-quarter pause in spending, the consumer continues to be the mainstay of the   forecast, with the dramatic surge in motor vehicle sales in October and November evidence of their   resiliency and confidence Even outside of autos, real durable goods spending rose over 1 percent in   October However, real income fell sharply and the only recently elevated saving rate collapsed    Consumer borrowing may not be growing at the same pace as it had been, but debt service as a share   of disposable personal income is rising to levels that are historically quite high, at least relative to the   last 20 years or so Combine falling income, rising debt burdens, and the potential for rising   unemployment as seen in initial claims data and layoff announcements, and it may be a recipe for the   sharp consumer retrenchment we have yet to see in this recession  In fact, our Bank’s forecast sees     12/11/01 43    unemployment rising about 1/2 percentage point higher in 2002 than does the Greenbook, which   combined with falling inflation suggests a potential for considerable excess capacity     The inventory swing from 2001 Q4 to 2002 embodied in this Greenbook projection really is   quite significant, particularly given how little data we have on inventories as yet  That swing, along   with fiscal stimulus, drives a relatively robust upturn in 2002  We see a similar though smaller version   of this mechanism at work  But there are certainly risks that the inventory depletion and rebound will   be much milder and, as I noted, there are risks with respect to consumer spending  Corporate profits   are dismal and the high P/E ratios in the S&P 500 reflect both rising Ps and rapidly dropping Es  I   think the very euphoria of the stock market right now is a risk in and of itself and not so much an   indicator of optimism  If the market were to adjust to more normal P/E ratios with a drop in price, that   could well feed back to even slower business spending and declines in consumer wealth and   confidence   Finally, both the Greenbook and our own forecast contain a rather sizable amount of fiscal   stimulus  As each day passes without some consensus in Congress, both the timing and the amount of   such stimulus come into question  The alternative Greenbook scenarios suggest that a lack of fiscal   stimulus could negatively affect 2002 growth and unemployment rates in a significant way    Moreover, whether or not the federal government acts, state and local government spending likely   would need to be contractionary in early 2002 to bring state budgets into balance   At our last meeting I argued that while the economic picture was clearly negative and the   risks remained on the downside, I thought the more cautious forward-looking policy would be to move   rates downward in small steps  I recognize the logic in aggressively addressing economic weakness in   the absence of inflation, but I believe we have done that  I continue to believe that the resilience of   our economy and the health of our banking system, just to name two factors, make it less likely that     12/11/01 44    we will face a deflationary spiral  I also think it’s generally not wise to move policy in fear of   potential disruptions that have not yet occurred   In that regard, there are glimmers of light at the end of the tunnel  Durable goods orders   and semiconductor chip sales may be signaling a turnaround in business spending  But I think they’re   only glimmers as yet, no matter how they are received by the equity markets  Risks remain weighted   toward weakness beyond that incorporated in our forecast, and inflation is quiescent if not declining    Given the uncertainties on the fiscal side, there may well be room for a bit more policy ease, though I   do have some measure of agreement with several of my Reserve Bank President colleagues about how   close a call this is I still favor the cautious approach, but taking out a bit more insurance right now   against the downside risks strikes me as a reasonable and measured step  Thank you  "
4515,2001-12-11," Distaste    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Hopefully we don’t all have to comment on   transparency because I’m not going to!  I am in agreement with your recommendation  Given the hard   time I had with the 50 basis point reduction last time, some might ask how I could be and, frankly, on   the case for standing pat I think President Stern has some good arguments  But as I view the data that   have come out since the last meeting, there are not only glimmers of a turnaround but some enhanced   downside risks as well I thought you covered them well in your statement the trajectory of the   unemployment rate, the euphoria in the stock market, the potential for no fiscal policy or one that’s not   effective in any way like what is in our forecast, downturns in corporate profits, and so forth  So I see   some new risks here  I agree with the statement that the risks are biased to the downside, certainly   over the near term  So with that logic, I come down on the side of a 25 basis point decline in rates as   you have suggested In some ways I think it is a measure of insurance and in fact I’m hopeful that it   is I’m also hopeful that the positives we’re now seeing do turn out to outweigh the potential for   negative developments and that the next time we meet policy will be stable and the risks will be   balanced  "
4568,2002-03-19," Well, if you wait long enough to speak, somebody says all the good   stuff! I must associate myself with the views of President Santomero and Vice Chairman     March 19, 2002 Page 21 of 117  McDonough on this I would also encourage us to get the work done on the contingency plans   sooner rather than later It’s too easy as time goes by to let things slide  The further we get away   from a tragedy in this case, the easier it is to forget about all the bells and whistles that need to be   included so that we can react in a timely way if, God forbid, something else happens  Let’s get   that work done and then work on these other issues in the future    Well, I’m going to tilt at windmills here  I recognize that it’s tilting at   windmills, but I do want to be on the record with my concerns about this   I have been in a lot of discussions about FOIA items  This is an unusual one  Usually the   question is about whether or not information must be released or should be released  This is a   debate about information we already release on a routine basis  So the debate is really around   concepts of reasonable and prompt when applied to the timing of the information released  I   think Virgil and his colleague have done a nice job of explaining to us how in the context of   FOIA law “reasonable and prompt” can only be defined as relatively short periods of time  I also   see the relevance of existing procedures with regard to the discount rate and other non-exempt   matters  But he also noted that some delay in releasing the information might be allowed if an           March 19, 2002 Page 101 of 117  earlier release were shown to have adverse effects on the accomplishment of the Committee’s   objectives And here’s where I have questions and concerns   Clearly, we cannot, should not, and do not refuse to disclose the vote  We already make   it available  But we, like all other central banks that vote and disclose the vote, make that   information available after the passage of some time  Why?  Well, to borrow Tom Melzer’s   words when this was discussed in early 1994, it was perhaps so as not to focus attention on the   minority view rather than the consensus view of the Committee  We’re a consensual Committee,   to use Alan Blinder’s terms  We release a vote that reflects the best sense of the Committee as a   unit at the time  That is our objective at least in part  To encourage the media and markets to   spend time on the dissenters is to take away from that objective, at least in my view    Virgil’s note argues that not disclosing the vote may serve to deprive markets of   information that is useful about future policy  I think the reality is that that’s not always the case    The policy decisions at the next Open Market Committee meeting are not directed by the dissents   at the previous meeting  Events occur Things change—sometimes relatively fast  And people’s   perspectives change as well In fact, I think there’s at least a chance that releasing the vote will   serve to harden people’s opinions in ways that frustrate the operations of the Committee     If we make this change, several things could happen  Members could become   increasingly unwilling to dissent, dreading the media onslaught  And in that regard, I question   whether it is feasible to constrain members from speaking about dissents, even for as short a   period of time as about a week  The second thing that could happen, on the opposite side, is that   members could find the spotlight and this extra bit of attention to their liking  They might   welcome the focus on the minority, which could create real schisms in the Committee  Of   course, I’m not talking about present members!  [Laughter]     March 19, 2002 Page 102 of 117  In sum, if we believe that our current disclosure policies serve to meet the objectives of    this Committee and if we make information available in a time frame that again meets our   objectives—as do other central banks that disclose as much as we do—I don’t see why we   shouldn’t be willing to stand up for those policies If we get a FOIA request and are required to   defend our current practices, I think we should do so  In fact, I don’t see how we get out of this   bind when the next step in this process is legislation, as has been proposed in the past, on the   desirability of televising our procedures  I don’t know how we get off this slippery slope if we   go down it this far How do we justify not bringing the television cameras in here?  I don’t see   what it is that we’re going to be talking about, with the possible exception of a limited amount of   confidential material, that would be so highly confidential  I’m not sure that anybody reading the   transcripts of our meetings five years after the fact would be convinced that what we talk about at   the meetings here is all that confidential  How far are we down the slippery slope to the   television cameras?  That’s my tilting at windmills    Is that the way it will be done for the discount rate, Roger?  "
4569,2002-03-19," I had a question similar to Michael’s, and maybe I should just wait for   Vince to talk Basically I want to ask you what you think the markets are telling us about   inflation expectations, which we seem to think will continue to be low at the end of 2003  They   fit my definition of low, let me put it that way  Any inflation rate that starts with a 1 strikes me   as low, and inflation doesn’t seem to be going anywhere  I recognize that 2004 is still up for   grabs, but the fed funds market seems to be implying more tightening than we have in our   forecast Certainly we’ve seen a good deal of movement in the yield curve as incoming data   have started to be more positive  It just strikes me that everybody either really believes that a   higher rate of return is necessary because of higher rates of productivity or that there is some   inflation risk that nobody is talking about or that we don’t see in inflation expectations out there    So that was one question, and probably Vince is going to answer that      March 19, 2002 Page 36 of 117  My other question had to do with this mystery of consumption  Why does it stay so   strong?  Granted, the levels aren’t strong compared with other recoveries, but given that there is   reason to believe there is no pent-up demand, your  forecast for consumption seems rather strong    When one looks at it relative to disposable income, it is pretty strong  Relative to wealth perhaps   it isn’t all that strong, so maybe there is some room  But you mentioned some considerations   with regard to the risks in the outlook for consumption  So I thought I’d just ask you about that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I look over the incoming data on the   New England economy and consider the views expressed at various meetings I’ve attended in the   period since the FOMC last met—meetings of our various advisory councils, our board of   directors, and a variety of community groups of which I’m a member—I’m struck by a couple of   things First, as compared with the situation at our last meeting, not a lot has changed  The   current situation remains challenging, but the economy appears to have bottomed out in an   increasing number of areas  And the six-month horizon appears if not bright then considerably   better than the present But second, as we look back over 2001, what has changed since our last   meeting—along the lines of what Bob McTeer just said—is our appreciation of what went on     March 19, 2002 Page 52 of 117  during the past year It now appears that the region experienced a larger hit to growth than had   been thought, and this is playing out in most states, particularly in Massachusetts, in the form of   a fiscal crisis     Employment rose in New England in January, and unemployment fell  And while the   unemployment rate remains significantly below that of the nation, labor markets are said to be   much easier, with temp firms especially commenting on the increased availability of supply    Business is still quite weak for the staffing firms; the fourth quarter was characterized as the   worst ever by one contact But signs of a pickup in 2002 are emerging  Software and IT firms   said demand rose in recent weeks, as customers began to activate dormant investment plans    Discretionary IT spending continues to be on hold, but some software niches are growing,   particularly in the areas of security, supply chain management, and bio informatics  Small   businesses and manufacturers say they are investing in must-do projects, especially those that   increase productivity But in general they’re trying to make do with existing technology  In   some cases, and this was particularly interesting, officials of small firms that are part of our New   England Advisory Council—more than a couple of them—reported that they actually were using   new technology to bring manufacturing back to the United States from places like India    Apparently they’ve run into innovations that have enabled them to offset the higher local salary   and benefit costs, particularly in New England, and to improve the profitability and quality of   their products as well   Real estate markets in the region seem to have survived the worst of the downturn, with   increases in commercial vacancy rates flattening out and residential markets gaining a bit, though   it should be noted that residential markets in the region never really softened all that much    Similarly, consumer and business confidence has continued to pick up, though most of the     March 19, 2002 Page 53 of 117  increase is focused on future expectations rather than current conditions  Indeed, at the most   recent meeting of our Bank’s board of directors, I found the sentiment to be similar to what   others have mentioned  Businesses and bankers represented on the board were singularly more   cautious—more conservative, if you will—and more concerned about the current situation than   the economic data might warrant, particularly the economic data at the national level   Recent annual revisions to regional employment data help to answer a few questions   about the nature of the region’s downturn over the past year or so  Given the concentration   within the region of high-tech manufacturing and software firms, one would have expected New   England to have experienced the recession earlier, more like the West Coast, and to be hit harder   than the rest of the country Earlier data did not indicate steeper employment losses than in the   nation as a whole, but benchmark revisions now suggest that this was in fact the case  Such   losses seem to have been concentrated in Massachusetts and primarily in business services,   particularly in the area of computer services  The fact that the new data draw a bit different   picture than the old likely relates to the number of small high-tech businesses in the region and   the difficulty of accurately capturing the data from such firms in the ongoing employment   information     The revised trajectory of employment also helps to explain the severity of the state fiscal   crises in New England and especially in Massachusetts  Outsized state revenue increases in the   late ’90s, fueled largely by capital gains and taxes on realized stock options, had financed   expanded Medicaid benefits and cuts in state income taxes  Stock market related revenues   stopped growing in 2001 Indeed, in Massachusetts overall state revenue grew at a rate of   7 percent or so in fiscal 2001 and is actually contracting at a rate of 10 percent in fiscal 2002    Given the pace of Medicaid cost increases this year and the yet-to-be-implemented phases of     March 19, 2002 Page 54 of 117  state income tax cuts, large gaps in state finances are expected to continue well beyond fiscal   2003, even assuming that a solid recovery in the region is in place  Given the size of state rainy   day reserves, which grew substantially during the ’90s, some amount of the gap can be filled    But filling the rest won’t be easy and will likely involve sizable cuts in state spending and the   collection of new revenues of one sort or another    Turning to the national picture, nearly every data release since our last Federal Open   Market Committee meeting has brought with it good news about the growing strength of the   economy  From the upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP to the surprising growth in   productivity, the beginnings of job growth in 2002, the flattening of inventory depletion, the   continued willingness of consumers to buy autos and houses, and the glimmers of a reenergized   manufacturing sector, the situation is better now than I certainly expected it would be when we   met in January   Looking forward, the shape of our forecast is not unlike that of the Greenbook’s  Given   the surprising strength of Q4 and now Q1, we see GDP growth moderating a bit for the rest of   the year, with growth Q4 over Q4 at about our estimate of potential—3¼ percent or so—and   then faster growth in 2003  Given the moderate pace of the economy’s rebound, unemployment   in our forecast trends down slowly and inflation stays about the same, no matter what measure   we use Obviously then, I don’t see much to find fault with in the general parameters of the   Greenbook forecast   I would raise two questions about the outlook, however  The first involves the risks to   the forecast  As I see it, the risks, along the lines of Dave Stockton’s comments, are becoming   much more balanced than they were  On the downside, I think the very heights of the equity   markets and PE ratios suggest some level of fragility and risk in that area  There is also some     March 19, 2002 Page 55 of 117  downside risk in consumer spending, particularly given the moderating personal income growth   and high debt levels There is certainly some uncertainty about business spending other than that   related to inventory depletion given the high levels of excess capacity  Clearly the new   depreciation allowances work only if businesses want and need new equipment  I don’t think a   2 percent reduction in the cost of capital is enough to drive new spending on its own  Finally, I   think there is some downside risk in the state and local sector; I don’t think Massachusetts is   alone in experiencing a fiscal crisis    But unlike the situation at the last meeting, there are upside risks as well  Consumer   spending could be more ebullient than the modest growth pattern in the forecast  Indeed,   comparisons of spending to wealth relationships suggest the possibility of some upside risk in   that regard So, unlike Dave, in terms of the consumer I see risks on both the downside and the   upside Contacts at Thomson First Call have stopped their bearish comments and seem to feel   that analysts’ projections of profits, even in technology, are believable  Except for Japan, the rest   of the world seems to be pulling out of the downturn, and the potential for pressure on oil and   other commodity prices is there So the bets are not all one way at last     This leads me to the second question—and a lot of people have made reference to this—   and it’s a policy-related question  By any measure, the stance of policy right now is stimulative    Real interest rates are at or below zero  This is appropriate for an economy in a downturn with   lots of downside risks Such risks prevail, but the strength of incoming data and the existence of   upside risks as well seem to me to argue for a measured return to a more neutral stance  That   would require a move back to a nominal rate somewhere in the 4 percent area, at least on the   basis of the Bluebook analysis of equilibrium real rates The question is how fast that move   should be The Greenbook forecast and the markets as well assume that the move will begin             March 19, 2002 Page 56 of 117  relatively soon and will extend over 2003  However, that happens against the background of   only slowly falling unemployment and inflation that, if anything, eases     Clearly, we need to be forward-looking in policy, and we need to be concerned about the   potential for the economy to overshoot  But I think we also need to be asking ourselves basic   questions about whether or not unemployment rates in the low 5s, with inflation somewhere in   the 1s, is what we’re aiming for  Is that really the target of policy?  We need to be talking about   those questions in a more explicit fashion as we move ahead  For right now, I think there’s   probably a little time yet to engage in conversation about our objectives  "
4570,2002-03-19," My first thought when I saw this chart was “be careful what you wish   for” because I had indicated in my comments that we need to talk about these issues  I’m not   sure I was prepared to talk about them at this meeting!  In any event, I would totally want to   avoid being associated with the red line because I do not believe that two years is the appropriate   waiting period now I believe that our policy stance is stimulative, and I think we have to raise   rates And I do take your point that once we start, the markets are going to assume that the   trajectory will be fairly rapid   Even looking at the blue line, the issue that I have is, Have we settled in on a number   below 2 percent on the inflation side and an unemployment rate around 5 percent or so as being   the ideal?  Or are we willing—since events put us there in the late ’90s—to say that maybe some   number in the 4s, the high 4s perhaps, is a better settling point for unemployment, given changes   in productivity and given a whole range of things that are perhaps different within the economy?   I don’t know the answer to that question  I just wonder about continually focusing on numbers   for inflation that start with 1 and whether or not that brings into play the issue of measurement   problems  The usual assessment of the extent of the measurement error is around 1 percentage   point So if we really have a number that begins with 1, there is very, very little inflation in the   economy  Is that our goal?  Again, I’m happy with the outcome in the blue line though I don’t   think we should wait two years before we tighten  I don’t think we should wait even one year I   know we have to bring the funds rate up from the current 175 percent  The questions are when,   how fast, and what our ultimate goals are    Right    I know    Yes, I know he had to make assumptions    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4619,2002-05-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, economic   conditions in New England on balance seem to have stabilized  The region continues to lose   jobs but at a slower pace than before, and its unemployment rate, while rising, remains well   below that of the nation Consumer and business confidence surged recently, and in contrast to   earlier data, most of the increase in confidence relates to current rather than future conditions    New Englanders haven’t lost faith in the future; they just see the present a bit more positively   than they once did            May 7, 2002 29 of 81  Similarly, inflation data for Boston have eased, largely on the basis of reductions in fuel   costs Housing indicators are strong  Actually I was surprised to see data in the confidential   repeat-sales house-price indexes sent to us with the pre-Open Market Committee material that   suggested that real estate prices in New England have moderated This is greatly at odds with all   the anecdotal reports we have, which suggest that demand exceeds supply and that pricing is   quite strong Moreover, as compared with the nation as a whole, construction job growth has   been both positive and strong  We know the growth is not related to nonresidential building   activity So it has to reflect surging demand for houses as well as the very mild winter weather   we’ve had   Finally, moving ever more firmly into the arena of anecdotes, one cannot help but notice   the uptick in traffic on the Mass Pike coming into Boston  The contrast in the time it takes to get   to work now versus only a couple of months ago is significant, for what that says about the   resurgence of the local economy  And almost everybody agrees with me on this one!  [Laughter]    Everybody on my staff, I should say  Manufacturing remains the one   major area in which caution is the byword  Contacts continue to report disappointing revenues,   negative profit growth, and continued laser-like focus on cost reduction  Some manufacturers,   especially those in the defense and consumer goods businesses, are a bit optimistic that things   may be getting better  But capital goods manufacturers remain gloomy  For them the   turnaround seems further off, not this year but some time in 2003   The investment professionals I meet with before each FOMC meeting commented on the   contrast between the surprising strength of the real economic data and the uncertainty and lack of   confidence they see in markets  They believe the negative tone of markets acts to offset the         May 7, 2002 30 of 81  stimulus of monetary and fiscal policy  Enron and all the concern about corporate accounting, of   course, are part of this, and investment managers are characterized as nervous and unwilling to   hold anything with even a hint of an accounting taint about it Finally, they commented on the   market uncertainty that accompanies event risk  Given the state of the world and the stance of   US policy, the risk of an event that changes all the dynamics of the market and the economy is   more than negligible     Turning to the national data—since our last meeting, incoming information has   underlined the strength of the inventory-led rebound in the first quarter and provided a sense of   continuing improvement going forward, but at a distinctly slower pace  Our forecast in Boston   tracks the Greenbook closely  We see a much slower Q2, reflecting a lesser effect of inventory   de-accumulation, a drag from the external sector, and somewhat slower growth in consumption    After this current quarter, growth improves in our forecast so Q4 over Q4 just matches the   numbers shown in the Greenbook  In 2003 we see a bit stronger growth, but this is largely   because our forecast sees unemployment remaining above our estimate of the natural rate and as   a baseline we incorporate no tightening  I’m not advocating that as a policy prescription, but I   do find it interesting that PCE and CPI inflation stay low—that is, in the range of numbers that   begin with 1—even with monetary policy remaining at its current accommodative position    Solid productivity growth and an estimate of potential not unlike the Greenbook’s new numbers   play a role here, and we’ve assumed some stability in equity and foreign exchange markets     There are, of course, risks to this forecast, and the Greenbook covers that spectrum quite   well On the one hand, consumption and business investment growth could be underestimated in   an environment of monetary and fiscal ease and rising productivity  We’ve gotten growth wrong   before—actually rather recently  On the other hand, business investment could stall in the         May 7, 2002 31 of 81  context of final consumer demand that is damped by unemployment that goes higher before it   moves lower, a weak profits picture, slow growth abroad, and skittish financial markets    Another risk of some significance is state and local spending, which has remained healthy so far   but seems poised to be cut significantly—or taxes raised—in the wake of much slower state   revenue growth   Overall, however, I’m not convinced that the weight of these risks on either side is   enough not to have some level of confidence in the Greenbook forecast—obviously, absent any   outsized external event that tips the scales  Thus, as I think about the stance of policy, I find   myself facing a small conundrum  Zero real interest rates are too low for an expanding economy   that is also being stimulated by fiscal deficits  But inflationary growth is low as well and is   expected to stay so There are uncertainties regarding how strong the recovery will be  Financial   markets are providing a few headwinds; and external growth, while better, remains tepid as well    Once again there seems to be time to sort out the right answer here, so waiting and reflecting a   bit may be just what is called for  Thank you    "
4620,2002-05-07, Go down the list    I agree    Believe me I know that!  
4669,2002-08-13," They both have the same importance, right, Vince?  "
4670,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  If at our last meeting the recovery in New   England seemed to be bubbling along, albeit unevenly, it now seems that the heat really has been   turned down Activity hasn’t ground to a complete halt, but areas that seemed poised to improve   in May now seem to be pausing or perhaps even stalling out as the effect of weaker national   economic growth and the overhang of financial market uncertainty and risk aversion have cast a   considerable pall   New England lost jobs in June relative to a year earlier, and on a month-to-month basis   the region registered its sharpest employment declines since last October  In May it seemed that   regional job levels were poised to grow, and two states actually had employment levels above   their pre-recession peaks Now only one state—the smallest, Rhode Island—is above its earlier            August 13, 2002 35 of 92  high, and the largest states in the region are both below their peaks and below year-earlier job   totals The District’s steepest job losses continue to be in manufacturing, especially in the high-  tech arena These employment losses reflect not only weak domestic demand for manufactured   goods but also falling exports  Data available for the first quarter show merchandise exports for   the region down 21 percent versus 15 percent for the nation as a whole, with all six New England   states and virtually all major industries and export destinations registering declines  Contacts in   manufacturing expressed considerable uncertainty and see cost cutting, not revenue growth, as   key to their near-term survival  They see the stock market affecting both capital goods demand   and consumer willingness to spend Some view this as a race between a collapse in consumer   sentiment that could undermine growth and an improvement in employment that could buoy   confidence   Residential real estate markets are vibrant  Indeed, some contacts fear a bubble is   growing there and report price increases in some areas that border on those of the late 1980s    Commercial real estate markets remain weak, however, especially in Boston  Data from three   sources all point in the same direction  Vacancy rates have multiplied and are likely to get worse   before they get better This is not a real estate problem affecting the major banks as it was in the   1980s since overbuilding using bank credit is not the issue  Over-committing on the part of   tenants is the problem  Rental rates are falling  Considerable amounts of unused space have   been sublet or currently remain unused, and new tenants could be hard to find as lease terms   expire   Both consumer and business confidence dropped in July after a modest decline in June    Consumers registered pessimism about current as well as future conditions, and perhaps   reflecting this pessimism, retail sales were reported to be flat or down in June and July  Business         August 13, 2002 36 of 92  confidence, as measured by a local index, fell below 50 into negative territory  The drop was   said to be related to the fact that the expected third-quarter upturn was not materializing and that   prospects for sustained growth seem to be receding into the future  An index of leading   indicators from Massachusetts moved down in tandem with the confidence index  Both point to   the delayed turnaround in technology industries as a key source of the region’s economic   softness While the pace of job layoffs nationwide seems to have abated, industries that are key   in our region such as telecommunications, computers, and electronics continue to register large   layoffs A review of job postings on Monstercom and a quarterly confidence survey of   technology executives conducted by the Massachusetts high-tech council pointed to a continuing   employment drought within the region’s technology sectors   The gloom, doom, and volatility in the financial markets have taken a toll as well  Equity   mutual funds in the region experienced large outflows in July, though much of this flow found its   way to bond or money market funds in the same family  One contact reported a marked change   in the attitudes and even voices of individuals as they called customer service centers in July  In   this person’s words, fear seemed to predominate  An executive at a major insurance company   reported the worst losses in the company’s corporate bond portfolio in its long history  Finally,   the perfect storm of Latin American turmoil, the demise of the dot-com world, and continuing   negative credit surprises have taken a toll on one major regional banking organization  In sum,   it’s not a pretty picture in New England   Incoming data for the nation as a whole haven’t been that pretty either, with booming   auto sales—albeit at discounts—and residential investment the major exceptions Whether it was   slow or nonexistent employment growth, downward projections for corporate profits, falling   nondefense capital orders, dropping confidence and sentiment indicators, or the cooling off in            August 13, 2002 37 of 92  foreign markets and economies, the data have been downbeat on the state of the real economy    But the 300-pound gorilla is clearly the volatility and negative direction of US capital and   equity markets  Reflecting the data and the overhang of market sentiment, the Greenbook   authors have written down their forecast, and we have, too, in Boston  Since we both use many   of the same frameworks, it’s not surprising that our forecasts for 2002 and 2003 look very   similar, with below-potential growth for much of the period  But we show somewhat lower   inflation and higher unemployment in 2003 than does the Greenbook   More important than a particular forecast, however, is where the risks are and whether we   are adequately poised to address them  It’s hard to see how the consumer can continue to be the   mainstay of economic growth without better news on the job front  And without that, I think the   confidence indicators are telling us that spending on residential investment will slow  Businesses   seem so preoccupied with market volatility and cost cutting in order to maintain some profit   margin that new hiring and new investment seem further off in time  And as we’ve seen, if the   US economy does not bounce back, foreign economies won’t either  Real economic data no   longer seem at variance with the markets  Together they both paint a darker picture of the future     So I see the risks largely on the downside to a forecast that, given usual post-recession   patterns, is pretty downbeat already Is monetary policy poised to address a slowly growing   economy with downside risks?  I wonder Until recently I thought the current historically low   level of the federal funds rate was more than accommodative and not consistent with price   stability over time  I thought that our next move had to be up as conditions in labor and other   resource markets began to tighten  Now, however, the financial market headwinds of equity   downturns and widening credit market spreads combined with the sense that the real economy   has stalled call into question how accommodative policy is  The Bluebook assessment of               August 13, 2002 38 of 92  equilibrium rates seems to indicate that current real rates are less accommodative than earlier    The perfect foresight modeling indicates that further reductions in rates would be consistent with   maintaining and even lowering inflation over the next couple of years  Now, models need to be   taken with a grain of salt But the direction of this analysis and what we’re seeing in the   economy and the markets seem to me to point to the possibility that further policy support, a bit   of insurance perhaps, might spur growth without inflation risk  When and how to ease policy   further and what to say about it—even if we don’t do it right away—without causing further   market uncertainty are obvious questions    "
4671,2002-08-13," Well, I have almost the opposite take  I think I would have been—if I   were voting today—one among perhaps not many at this table who could have voted for an   easing in policy But I am perfectly willing to go along with your recommendation  I do think   that things have changed significantly enough to bring into question whether or not monetary   policy is sufficiently accommodative at this point  There are strong headwinds, and not to   recognize them in our statement—whether by a change in the tilt or some language in the   statement—would be to ignore what is out there and seem to be a little behind the curve  So I   agree with your statement, and I agree with what you want to do with regard to the tilt  "
4722,2002-09-24," Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  New England’s recovery   appears to have stalled out  Employment continues to decline  Joblessness reached a high for     September 24, 2002 44 of 115  the year, and hiring surveys indicate that most employers are not planning to add jobs  And   forward-looking indicators embodied in consumer and business confidence surveys are not   improving  However, these regional data tend to be driven by conditions in Massachusetts and   more specifically by the information technology industry broadly speaking  Elsewhere the   picture is not great, but it is not quite as bleak as it is in the Bay State   As compared with the nation as a whole—where there has been some recent job growth,   albeit small on a month-to-month basis—New England’s month-to-month pattern reflects job   losses at an increasing pace  This pattern is driven by Massachusetts, which lost jobs steadily   this year and last Total employment for the state now stands better than 2½ percent below its   pre-recession peak  Reflecting this, unemployment in Massachusetts rose to over 5 percent in   July while in the rest of the states in the region it remained between ½ and 1 percentage point   lower   That Massachusetts is hardest hit by the recession and slow recovery that is grounded in a   fallout in information technology spending is hardly a surprise, given the significance of that   industry for the state as a whole What is of concern is that there seem to be very few lights at   the end of the technology tunnel, at least according to local contacts  Overall postings for   technology jobs in the region continue downward  Only 4,500 such jobs were listed on   Monstercom at the end of June versus nearly 26,000 a year ago  Hardest hit skilled areas were   hardware technicians, Internet or e-commerce specialists, and telecom workers  A survey of tech   executives concludes that overall confidence in expected growth in the sector fell from the first   quarter to the second quarter, despite the headline GDP growth in information technology during   Q2 In this survey, software executives were least confident, followed by telecom and Internet   executives, but confidence among those in bio and med-tech industries did show greater strength      September 24, 2002 45 of 115  Finally, a leading index for Massachusetts suggested that economic activity in the state was   likely to move sideways at best in the next six months or so, reflecting the fact that a widespread   recovery in technology has not yet begun   Moving away from technology, however, there may be signs that growth has not stalled   completely  Job growth in services, retail, finance and insurance, government, and construction   is holding its own Manufactured exports staged a modest turnaround in Q2 after a drop in Q1 of   some size  And residential real estate markets remain vibrant, with perhaps some softening in   the upper-end price range   Commercial real estate markets remain deeply in contraction, with vacancy rates in   Boston proper and its suburbs stabilized at high levels  Demand is said to be virtually zero, and   we have negative absorption rates Rents have come down substantially from their levels of   2000, which were quite high, and are poised to fall further as leases expire on unused space    Even here, however, contacts report that a strong market exists for purchasing office and   apartment buildings, albeit at a healthy discount  This market is spurred by low interest rates,   volatile equity markets, and it is said, confidence in the longer-term fundamentals of the area    That is, there’s confidence that the space market will recover in time to provide some return on   these investments   We held a meeting of our regional Small Business Advisory Council last week and its   members, too, provided some reason to believe that all is not quite as bad as the Massachusetts-  dominated regional data might suggest  While they were not as confident as they had been   earlier in the year, they did suggest that across a wide range of manufacturing and service   businesses there was moderate underlying strength  Unlike the small-business people in Jerry   Jordan’s District, they did not seem afraid  In fact, they reported that they were being courted to        September 24, 2002 46 of 115  a greater degree by regional banks and were being offered loan terms that they hadn’t seen in   recent years  All the members of the council continue to be highly focused on cost control and   have benefited from greater labor availability  One lumber supplier reported concern about   whether housing construction could continue to grow but also noted plenty of work going on in   building schools, bridges, and housing for the elderly, despite the very sharp cutbacks in state   spending that all of the New England states are undergoing     Saw mills are experiencing increased profits in part because there’s less of a supply of   forest products in the market owing to a drop in imports from Canada as a result of increased   tariffs A vegetable and flower wholesaler and retailer reported record sales over the Jewish   holidays, and a fabric manufacturer is having his best year ever  And a bit against the tide of bad   news in the technology sector, the director of a local software council reported member   companies seeing activity in the pipeline—not yet realized in sales, but in the pipeline—that is   stronger than a year ago   Turning to the nation, I’ve been struck by what seem to me to be two marked changes in   incoming data and sentiment since our last meeting  At that meeting I was concerned about the   impact that negative financial conditions were having on the prospects for a continued recovery    And I was concerned about whether or not monetary policy was accommodative enough to act as   a balance to those headwinds  These financial market conditions seemed to ease a bit after   August 14 Incoming data on durable goods orders and shipments, retail sales—especially for   autos but in other areas as well—home sales and permits as well as the perhaps fluky drop in   unemployment seemed to point to firmer prospects for growth  Then as geopolitical fears grew,   even after an uneventful day of remembrance on September 11, market volatility increased with   new rounds of investigations of corporate wrongdoing  Incoming data on unemployment claims,         September 24, 2002 47 of 115  purchasing managers’ sentiment, industrial production, and an expected drop in motor vehicle   sales seemed to signal that growth prospects had dimmed more than a bit     All of us who have been speaking during this intermeeting period have commented on the   bumps in the road to recovery  Currently those bumps seem particularly large, at least to me    Reflecting these shifting sands, our forecast, assuming an unchanged federal funds rate, has   weakened a bit for the last quarter of this year and for 2003  We now see Q4-over-Q4 growth in   2002 at 28 percent and at 3 percent in 2003  This is a bit below our estimate of potential in both   years, so we see unemployment moving up to 62 percent by the end of 2003 and inflation   moving down   These headline numbers don’t differ a lot from the projections in the Greenbook, but   frankly I find both of these forecasts a bit worrisome  They suggest that three years of below-  potential growth, no progress in reducing unemployment, and falling inflation represent an   outcome with which we might be comfortable enough to leave policy unchanged  Moreover, all   of these forecasts reflect, at least in my view, the best case  Downside risks predominate, and   people have talked about them  Just to name a few  Will consumers stay the course on spending   if job growth doesn’t accelerate? Will technology spending turn the corner any time soon, given   slow to moderate growth here and abroad and plenty of excess capacity?  And I have to say that   the increasing risk of a war with Iraq and continuing turmoil around issues having to do with   corporate governance suggest that equity market risks abound     It is true that policy may be poised to address at least some of these risks  Low interest   rates buoy the consumer as do tax cuts  Changes in tax incentives may help boost lackluster   business spending at some point  But unless good reasons to invest emerge, it is hard to believe     September 24, 2002 48 of 115  that tax incentives, or for that matter lower interest rates, will drive spending all by themselves    Productivity growth remains strong, though that has exacerbated the joblessness of this recovery     The economy may in fact heal itself, as the Greenbook suggests, without further policy   stimulus  But I think there is at least some reason to believe that that won’t happen any time   soon Now, it’s possible that lower interest rates now could have unforeseen consequences—not   just in terms of inflationary growth over the longer term but in the nature of the bets being taken   in financial markets and perhaps in real estate markets as well—along the lines referred to by   President Guynn And it is also true that if a war on Iraq or some other as yet unrevealed   corporate malfeasance produces some untoward economic response, we will need a bit of   ammunition to work with These may well be reasons to hold off  But in my view the policy   choice isn’t easy My personal preference would be for policy that encourages stronger growth   in this environment of even lower projected inflation, though I would agree that such a stance is   not without its own risks  "
4723,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I concur  I can be patient as well I must   say, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, that I’ve had concerns similar to those that President   Guynn just mentioned about the downside risks of moving interest rates ever lower  But I am   concerned as well about the persistent economic gaps we have, gaps from what I would consider   to be a more optimal rate of economic growth, pace of employment growth, and inflationary   change I don’t view the outcomes we’re seeing in the Greenbook baseline and the alternative   simulations as optimal  And those, I think, are sort of the best case outcomes we can hope for    So I am concerned about that            September 24, 2002 97 of 115  I have to agree with Governor Ferguson about this issue of data clarification  I’d be   surprised if there were a smoking gun in any of the data over the next two or three weeks that’s   going to tell us unequivocally that we should either maintain our current stance or move rates   lower And, frankly, I have a deep preference for moving at a meeting as opposed to outside of a   meeting  But that’s something we’ll just have to talk about when the time  comes  I think that’s   all I have to say    Mr Chairman, may I just say one word about this phrase “owing in   part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks”?  Is this committing us to take a policy   action based on something that is happening outside of the United States?    If something is done in Iraq?    I just worry that that is how it’s going to be interpreted  My own sense   is that there are a lot broader reasons, even beyond geopolitical risks—and you covered some of   them before—for the considerable uncertainty that exists  I think highlighting it this way almost           September 24, 2002 103 of 115  puts a spin on it that says, in effect, if something happens out there we definitely will do   something and if nothing happens out there we won’t  And I don’t think that was the sense of   the Committee    All right I knew I’d be in the minority, but I’m worried about it      I know you can read the sentence that way, but I guess I’d feel better if   the “in part” clause had something beyond geopolitical risks or if that were just left out and the   sentence stopped with the word “employment”  "
4777,2002-11-06," I’m in favor of what Governor Ferguson, Governor Kohn, and   President Moskow said I’d do the work on the Ginnie Maes first and learn from our ACF effort   but put it on the shelf If people have comments on it, fine, submit them  Also, when we put the   staff studies out, they do mention an ACF type facility, though nowhere near 137 pages are   devoted to it as in the paper we received recently!  [Laughter] It is mentioned, so perhaps we’ll   get some response from those in academia or others on how they see some of those facilities  I   think that might be instructive    On the Ginnie Maes, you mean?  "
4778,2002-11-06," Mr Chairman, I have a question for Dave  You described your   numbers on equipment spending as—maybe this isn’t the term to use—shots in the dark to some   extent At least that’s how I interpreted it, though that’s probably playing fast and loose with   what you really said But what I’ve been struck by in the Greenbook and in our own forecast is   the strength of such spending, particularly in the computer area The actual numbers for the third   quarter involve something like a 30 percent growth rate for computer expenditures, and a   40 percent growth rate is embedded in the forecast  That is so at odds with what business people   tell us they’re doing and the downbeat nature of their comments  I’m going to talk a bit about         November 6, 2002 14 of 122  some meetings we’ve had with software executives and officials from large companies in   reference to their plans for equipment spending next year  We don’t hear anybody telling us that   they’re doing much of anything  Maybe that just means that there’s such a huge amount of   computing equipment out there that the replacement that’s going on is producing those figures   right now, given the year-over-year contrast with 2001  But even the language in the Greenbook   has a more hopeful cast to it than what I hear from anybody I talk to who is out there actually   spending money for business equipment    But when you ask a question about that, everybody in business says   that the equipment is just fine and we’re making it do more than we ever made it do before         November 6, 2002 15 of 122   Yes    Right    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as we can see, the recovery is on   hold in New England Employment declined in August and September, and the region’s   unemployment rate has moved up  Both consumer and business confidence are off; reports from   retailers are mixed; and office vacancies in the Boston area continue to rise, albeit at a slower   pace than earlier in the year  About the only bright spot, like everywhere else, is continuing   strength in residential real estate markets, which has led to home prices rising faster in New   England than elsewhere in the nation  State and local governments face large gaps between   incoming revenue and ongoing program expenditures, with Massachusetts alone facing a   structural deficit of better than $1 billion on an annual basis after eating through its entire   $2 billion rainy day fund Looking forward, the New England Economic Project recently   downgraded its forecast for the region  Regional job growth is now not expected until well into   2003, and unemployment next year is expected to be higher than this year  That about sums up   the headline data for the region We’ve also held a couple of advisory council meetings at the         November 6, 2002 31 of 122  Bank since the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and there has been more than the   normal flow of downbeat anecdotal commentary  In sum, all of these inputs seem to reinforce   the sense of downside risk both to investment spending and to consumption     Just after our last meeting we held a gathering of software executives at the Bank and had   a go-around as to their impressions about their markets  The companies represented   telecommunications providers, biotech, data storage, network software providers, high-tech   security, web-based career placement, and venture capital  Their perspectives ranged from being   in the depths of “nuclear winter” in telecommunications to a sense of resigned soldiering on,   albeit while laying off staff and reducing costs if at all possible They all noted that their own   spending criterion was, Will the business fall apart if we don’t do it?  And they believe their   customers are employing the same rule  Even in the biotech arena, funds have dried up for   research and development; only if a product is sellable can financing be found  Venture capital   was said to be in a depression, not a recession, with many venture firms returning capital to   investors  No one saw any recovery until late 2003 or 2004  This is what I mean about the   downbeat nature of the anecdotes we’ve been hearing   Recent contacts with the large industrial firms in the region reflect a similarly downbeat   perspective A large diversified manufacturer of a wide range of goods from appliances to   aircraft engines reported increasing layoffs, little pricing power, and considerable excess   capacity within its various industries both nationally and globally  A large manufacturer of   consumer goods sees little improvement over the next twelve to eighteen months  A   manufacturer of defense electronics and consumer goods plans a reduction in capital spending in   2003 and sees no circumstances under which its capital spending plans will be revised upward    A manufacturer of elevators, aircraft engines, and flight systems plans to reduce capital spending         November 6, 2002 32 of 122  by 10 percent in 2003 This company’s customers are experiencing restricted access to credit   and are more frequently asking for supplier financing  Finally, a large manufacturer of data   storage systems is in the midst of a third wave of layoffs, with nine out of ten of his customers   expecting IT budgets to be at best flat in 2003  None of these large manufacturing contacts saw   much in the way of help from further monetary policy ease, seeing the current situation as one   requiring a long workout period of restraint and caution   On the consumer side, one large local bank reported that retailers appear to be   maintaining very low inventories in response to expectations of weak sales  This bank also   reported that its credit card outstandings took a sharp downward turn in mid-September and   continued to be weak in October as well Both the number of cardholders using credit cards for   purchases and the average sales per cardholder declined from August to September  This is quite   an unusual event for this company  October was trending lower as well, auguring poorly for the   holiday season This bank is the ninth largest credit card issuer in the country, with about   80 percent of its business national in scope rather than regionally based  Moreover, according to   this bank, representatives of other large credit card issuers spoke of similar weakness at an   industry meeting held at the end of October   Finally, we also held a meeting of the Bank’s Academic Advisory Council in late   October They were similarly downbeat about economic prospects  There were, of course, many   debates among the group on the ins and outs of the current situation but surprising unanimity on   one thing Some wondered about the utility of further interest rate cuts, but no one debated that   the risks in making such cuts, at least within reason, were small  In other words, further policy   ease might not be a panacea, but it was not likely to hurt, and it might help a bit                    November 6, 2002 33 of 122  Looking at the Greenbook forecast and our own as well, I’m reminded of the phrase from    Alice in Wonderland, “jam yesterday, jam tomorrow, but never jam today”  Our forecasts this   year have followed a regular pattern of pushing off into the future the needed upturn in business   fixed investment, the jam in the forecast  Weak data on industrial production and durable goods   orders and anecdotes reflecting business unwillingness to spend have pushed the expected upturn   out to mid-2003  The proximate causes for this pickup would appear to be some lessening of   uncertainty, the projected easing of excess capacity, particularly in the computer arena, and the   continuation of an accommodative fiscal policy  All of these are open to debate, at least in my   view   First, it’s not clear when uncertainty will ease or what role a conflict with Iraq might   play Excess capacity in computers may be declining—certainly the pace of real spending in the   third quarter suggests this—but excesses in telecommunications remain high, and measures of   current manufacturing strength and industrial production are not overly comforting  Fiscal   policy, embodied in the partial-expensing provision for capital goods, may be accommodative,   but my contacts have questioned whether any tax provision might make them willing to spend   absent rising demand or some real indication of a new technological trend of some value     Frankly, further easing in monetary policy might not trigger spending either, though it   probably wouldn’t hurt Thus, I think it’s possible that capital spending won’t increase at the   rate embodied in either the Greenbook forecast or our own  So to return to Alice in Wonderland,   will the jam really be there?  Moreover, now even the bread of the forecast—the base of   consumer spending—is in question with the recent falloff in broad retail sales, spending on   autos, and confidence indicators  It seems clear that consumer spending will weaken   considerably in Q4, particularly relative to Q3, and then grow relatively modestly in the first half         November 6, 2002 34 of 122  of 2003—or at least that’s our forecast and the Greenbook’s as well  And at midyear, economic   activity begins to turn up in the forecast in a substantial way, reflecting increasing corporate   stability, rising job prospects if not job growth, and rising equity markets  Clearly these two   forecasts, one for business investment and one for consumption, feed on one another  If one is   gaining strength, the other comes along  But the reverse is true as well  Businesses won’t invest   if consumers won’t buy, and consumers won’t buy if they don’t have jobs  The key question   here is, What starts the process?  Given the situation in the rest  of world, help is not on its way   from the external sector  That leaves only two major exogenous drivers of the forecast outside of   an increase exogenously in animal spirits—accommodative fiscal and money policy  At their   current levels, are these enough?       Fiscal policy in the form of further tax cuts is likely to be too little too late, at least for   consumer spending  As I noted earlier, perhaps a change in tax provisions will be a shot in the   arm to investment spending, maybe not  Then there is the issue of whether monetary policy   really is accommodative  The Bluebook analysis suggests that it is increasingly less so  Credit   spreads suggest that financing is harder to come by for more industries  And even the   Greenbook forecast doesn’t show much increased growth for interest-sensitive sectors, at least in   the near term Policy has to prime the pump of this dragging recovery, but I think it may not be   poised to do so without some further change  This may be risky, as we’ve discussed in the past    But the greater risk may be leaving things the way they are  I don’t know about the rest of you,   but even if this forecast is right on the mark, another year of rising unemployment, most of the   year to wait before GDP grows at potential, and inflation that falls to the low 1 percent range   suggests to me that we’re not doing enough  "
4779,2002-11-06," I’m not necessarily in favor of this position, but I guess I was a little   put off or confused by your dismissal of a 25 basis point move  Isn’t it possible, in light of the   way the Committee has used 25 basis points in the past, that the markets would take that as an   indication—particularly with a downside risk statement—that we’re going to move more than   once?         November 6, 2002 78 of 122   The macroeconomic impact can’t be much different    Probably nothing different than when we didn’t lower rates but said   that the risks were unevenly balanced toward the downside    Right    At the last meeting or maybe even at the last two meetings, I could   have gone with a 25 basis point reduction in rates and called it insurance  So I’m clearly in the   camp of reducing rates  And given the incoming data, 50 basis points probably is a better   insurance policy than 25   I find this discussion of the balance of risks pretty tricky  On the point that Vincent   included in exhibit 4—that the Committee might retain unbalanced risks if in the near term   resource slack is expected to build—whether we reduce the funds rate by 50 basis points or not,   resource slack is expected to build in the near term  Even the GDP growth numbers shown in the   forecast for 2003H2 are not robust, though I guess they do get back to 4 percent by then  But         November 6, 2002 90 of 122  GDP growth in H1 is still going to seem rather slow, and that time frame is my definition of the   near term     As you know, I meet with a group of investment professionals before each FOMC   meeting, and I have to echo a little of what Bill Poole said about a move of 50 basis points    These observers felt that the outlook was dicey enough that their sense was a cut of 50 as   opposed to 25 might make a negative splash in the market  In their view, 50 might make people   even more uncertain and concerned, and they might think that we see something worse than they   see I think the balanced risk statement helps to offset that  So I’m a little at odds with the logic   and the market impact of your recommendation, but I’m willing to go along with it  "
4829,2002-12-10," To turn to the upside risks to the forecast, I certainly agree that they   reside mainly in what the Congress might do with regard to fiscal stimulus  But I would note   that the Greenbook forecast all the way through 2004 is considerably more optimistic than most   private-sector forecasts on the state and local side—and by some multiple depending on what   period one is looking at I assume that others were impressed as I was by the gulf between where   state revenues are and where they need to be to achieve anything close to a balanced-budget   requirement, which I think exists in every state except Vermont  Major cuts will have to occur in   state spending to achieve those balanced budgets over the next couple of years  I know you have   a number of staff working on the state and local side, and I thought you might want to comment   on that    Yes    But the politics of that might not be all that attractive    Right, and securitizing tobacco settlements    I agree with all that I just was struck that the Greenbook estimate of   growth in the state and local sector even in 2004 is at least double that of DRI  And other   forecasts are below DRI’s forecast I know reasonable people can differ on this, but that seemed   like a big difference    Yes, that’s true    Thank you, Mr Chairman  “Bumping along” may be about the best   way to characterize economic activity in New England  Unemployment rose in October, and the   region lost jobs But most of the employment weakness seems to be centered in Massachusetts,   where the pace of job losses over the last year has been more than double that of the nation as a   whole Jobs in the other five New England states are either flat year over year or growing   slightly   Other indicators beyond the employment data are mixed  Commercial real estate markets   remain in the doldrums, especially in metropolitan Boston  But reportedly the Boston downtown   situation is not getting any worse, while the suburban situation continues to deteriorate    Consumer confidence rose in November, especially as it relates to future conditions, and            December 10, 2002 35 of 87  manufactured exports across a wide range of industries increased markedly in both the second   and the third quarters   Last month I reported that October credit card outstandings were off significantly at a   large local bank That business is no longer deteriorating, though it has not returned to previous   levels Most analyses of forward-looking indicators on the region suggest that a near-term   recovery of any strength is not likely  Rather, the last half of 2003 is projected as the earliest   point at which a recovery might occur  Similarly, reported hiring plans for the first quarter of   2003 have deteriorated from where they were three months ago but remain stronger for 2003   than they were last year at this time for 2002  As I said, things are kind of bumping along              In meetings with our Small Business Advisory Council and with members of a high-tech   center for quality of management to which the bank belongs and in ad hoc discussions with a   variety of local business leaders the themes sounded are similar Business is growing but not   strongly, and everyone is entirely cost focused  Capital spending plans echo the results of the   special Beige Book questionnaire  On the whole, spending will take place but will not be   particularly aggressive  Some companies that have been deferring equipment maintenance or   upgrades plan to increase spending in 2003 Others say that they have little need to spend and   that almost nothing is being done that does not relate to a specific new product or to efficiency   improvements  One interesting note is that manufacturing business is being moved from Mexico   to China Apparently the cost advantages are large enough that even small manufacturers of a   variety of items from golf clubs to high-tech gear are making that move     Looking at the national scene, it would appear that a bit of the uncertainty plaguing the   financial markets has eased; equity markets on balance are higher and a bit less volatile, and   credit spreads have narrowed slightly I assume that one proximate cause of more hospitable               December 10, 2002 36 of 87  markets—aside from our 50 basis point move—has been the dearth of any new, really bad,   corporate scandals Of course, the uncertainty associated with war plans clearly remains     The nature of these markets seems to me to reflect a little brighter economic news as   well Consumer confidence was up a bit, housing remained strong, some business spending was   occurring, particularly if we take out aircraft, and—until last Friday anyway—there was a firmer   feel to labor markets  So I thought there was some cause for a bit of optimism, and I still see   things as marginally better, though clearly we remain plagued by considerable excess capacity, a   soft spot to be sure   Our forecast is very close to the Greenbook’s—a slow first half of 2003, growth picking   up in the second half, and 2004 clocking in at better than our estimate of potential, reflecting   both easier monetary policy and a bit more fiscal stimulus  Even so, unemployment remains   stubbornly high, at least by recent experience; and by any measure, inflation continues quite low    This is not necessarily a forecast I like  But for now the stance of policy embodied in it is one   with which I am comfortable  That’s because for the first time there is a risk on the upside that   seems rather likely to materialize—namely, a good deal more fiscal stimulus at the federal level   than is built into the baseline  In fact, I quite like the shape of the alternative scenario that   incorporates fiscal stimulus along the lines being discussed by Administration strategists  I only   hope a way can be found to make a lot of that stimulus temporary so that the implications for   future deficits are not overly negative Thank you  "
4830,2002-12-10," I support the recommendation I was intrigued by the conversation on   the perfect foresight model because I am a bit concerned that we keep aiming the baseline of   policy at an outcome that, to me anyway, has a little too much excess capacity for too long a   period of time  But I was very taken with President Poole’s and Governor Bernanke’s discussion   of the upside risks Aside from fiscal stimulus, I hadn’t really given a lot of thought to other   upside risks I am convinced that the risks are pretty balanced and that in fact we’re going to   have some fiscal stimulus that may take things in the direction my two colleagues mentioned  So   I’m happy to be where we are  "
4880,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought Dave and Karen did a fabulous   job, both in the written material and in the presentation, of covering in effect the entire   waterfront of risks and possibilities to consider as we sit here and try to determine how this   situation is going to turn out  I know I was impressed by the complexities involved in trying to   do it over the past couple of weeks  You certainly have indicated how varied the possibilities are   and how great the risks are—perhaps on both sides  That brings me to the question I would like   to pose   Looking just at the Greenbook baseline forecast, absent the alternative simulations and   absent the really interesting discussion of ups and downs and ins and outs of oil prices and   whatnot, it seems to me that one would have to say—though I know you won’t say this—  [laughter] that the risks almost have to be on the downside of the Greenbook projection    March 18, 2003 21 of 101    Everything has to go very well for that forecast to work out  The war has to be short, and it has   to be relatively cheap  Consumers and businesses have to leap right back into the saddle  Even   if everything works out so well that this forecast does materialize, then we still have a good deal   of excess capacity lingering on through 2004  Aren’t the risks on the downside?       Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the last couple of meetings I’ve   tempered my remarks about the New England economy with references to a light at the end of   the tunnel, however dim  This had been seen in confidence indicators, in a leading index of the   Massachusetts economy, and in many anecdotal references  I hesitate to say that the light has   gone out, but the most significant change in New England between this meeting and the last one   is that nobody talks about that light anymore     The data suggest that recovery may be further away than had been expected  Many areas   of the New England economy either weakened recently or are showing no signs of growth    Month-to-month job losses accelerated in December, and benchmark revisions to employment   data that will be released later this month are likely to move employment totals down further    Massachusetts has been losing jobs steadily while other states are resuming a downward trend    Moreover, long-term unemployment is an increasing problem  A recent analysis tells us that, in   our region, the number unemployed for over six months was about five times greater in 2002   than in 2000; that number doubled for the nation as a whole  Consumer confidence tracked the   March 18, 2003 46 of 101    move downward that was evident in the national data  Business confidence, which had seen   small increases in late 2002 and in January, dropped in February to levels last seen in late 2001    Future conditions data dropped below 50, indicating that survey respondents no longer foresee   positive conditions within six months  Similarly, an index of leading indicators prepared by   University of Massachusetts economists—which had been predicting some growth by midyear—  turned negative, suggesting that the Massachusetts economy will shrink about 1 percent rather   than grow  Finally, confidence among New England technology executives plummeted in the   last quarter of 2002, as reported by a local survey  These executives had experienced some   growth in their businesses early in the year, but prospects dimmed by year-end, particularly in   the telecommunications and software sectors  Commercial real estate markets apparently   softened even further around the turn of the year  Office vacancies rose both in downtown   Boston and in the suburbs, but we’re told that reported vacancy data apparently do not even   come close to capturing the extent of available space  Observers say that, even in the slowdown   of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Boston market did not experience two years back-to-back   of negative absorption  Contacts now predict that 2003 will be the third consecutive year that   has occurred   We spent some time trying to sort out what is perhaps the unsortable—whether   geopolitical uncertainty or underlying economic fundamentals are the cause of the ever softer   patch in New England’s economic activity  Not surprisingly, this is really hard to determine    Our Beige Book, advisory council, and other contacts note that geopolitical uncertainty is clearly   having some effect but that it’s hard to quantify  The one channel that seemed most clearly   affected was consumer behavior  But most contacts also argued that, while the military situation   in Iraq and other geopolitical concerns were an issue at the margin, the economy would not be   March 18, 2003 47 of 101    showing solid growth even in the absence of war  Other factors, such as excess capacity in a   variety of industries and a murky picture for the high-tech sector, have contributed strongly to   economic weakness  Furthermore, while one would expect that war-related spending in military   intensive New England might have a positive effect, no significant effect has yet been reported    The comment was made that, if your business was not involved in the mobilization effort, the   effect of military spending was actually negative in that steps were being taken to offset   mobilization costs wherever possible   Finally, I can’t leave the subject of New England without some mention of the deepening   state fiscal crises, especially in Massachusetts and Maine  The drop in employment and a bleak   outlook for many businesses suggest that cuts now projected by the states to achieve fiscal   balance may not be sufficient and that their effects may reverberate on the regional economy    Indeed, a month ago we thought Massachusetts tax revenue was likely to grow at just under   3 percent in fiscal 2004, which matched the projections of the new state administration  It now   appears that a scenario of no revenue increase has a greater probability  One area of the state’s   economy that so far has not experienced much of a downturn is the health care sector, which   accounts for 10 to 15 percent of the local economy  That could change  Further cuts in state   funding for Medicaid and the related loss of federal matching funds would eliminate the positive   margins hospitals overall have been experiencing and would send a number of institutions into   negative territory  Obviously, this will come back to haunt in the form of higher medical   insurance costs already noted as a serious concern by regional businesses, large and small     On the national scene, incoming data most recently have been disappointing  Labor   market conditions seem to have deteriorated  Consumer spending on housing has held up, but   spending in other areas—on autos in particular—is lackluster  One of our directors has a   March 18, 2003 48 of 101    company that is involved in providing audio equipment for high-end cars  Throughout most of   the 2002 period he has seen resilience in his forecast three and six months out  Obviously, he   has to get forecasts directly from the automakers  In February that resilience came to an end, and   the forecast looking forward dropped significantly  His experience over thirty years or so in the   industry suggests that this is a unique break with the past, and it portends quite a bit of softness   going forward in projections of auto sales  Of course, it’s hard to separate the effects of the   mobilization of reservists and the blizzard that occurred in the New England area, and all down   the East Coast as well, on the critical Presidents’ Day weekend  But overall, the data are not   particularly encouraging in my view  Of course the real question facing us now is not what is   happening currently, because it’s hard to sort that out, but what is likely to happen over the rest   of the year  In some ways that is even harder to disentangle     I have to say, as I said earlier, that I think the baseline forecast in the Greenbook is about   as optimistic a case as can be made  In that forecast the war is short and relatively cheap    Uncertainty about geopolitical events drops markedly, taking with it much of the economic   restraint we’re currently experiencing  Consumer spending and residential investment rebound   solidly  Oil prices drop rapidly through the year  Productivity is well maintained  Key parts of   the Administration’s tax package are passed  Interest rates remain low  Equity markets show   steady positive improvement; and by year-end, business profits and investment spending are on   track for double-digit growth in 2004  Frankly, I think the risks to this forecast have to lie on the   downside   The degree to which both business spending and consumer spending rebound in the last   half of this year is debatable, and I think it’s debatable not just because of oil prices  I do wonder   about the effect of developments in Venezuela and Nigeria and about the excess capacity or lack   March 18, 2003 49 of 101    thereof in Saudi Arabia and other places around the Gulf  I wonder whether oil prices will drop   as fast as they do in the forecast and stay low  Is that expectation realizable?  With regard to   auto sales, the projections in the Greenbook seem particularly robust, going from the current   pace of 15½ million to 16 million to 17 million plus in the second half of the year  Moreover,   it’s by no means clear that the Administration’s tax plan will be passed in any form  Finally, the   strength of housing in the forecast is remarkable as well  The projection of 2 million starts by   early 2004 suggests a housing boom comparable to that in the early to mid-1980s, when arguably   the demographics were quite different     Lots of things have to go really well in a very short time for the Greenbook forecast to be   realized  Indeed, it’s more optimistic about both growth and inflation—particularly by 2004—   than most other forecasts, including our own in Boston, for whatever that’s worth  Clearly the   Greenbook staff, outside forecasters, and we in Boston face a greater-than-normal degree of   uncertainty  But I’m uncomfortable with a baseline that seems to resolve most questions on the   optimistic side  Even if we were to take the Greenbook forecast as the most likely outcome,   where does that leave us as we move from 2003 to 2004?  The Greenbook is explicit about this    Excess capacity persists with the unemployment rate at 5½ percent and output about   ¾ percentage point below potential  The only alternative scenario that changes that picture   involves a 50 basis point reduction in rates   What should we do about this?  High levels of uncertainty clearly call for caution  It is   arguable that an easing in policy right now won’t affect business investment and that the decline   in ten-year Treasury yields, if sustained for any time, should act to keep the residential and   mortgage refinancing markets alive  However, given the uncertainty—and I would argue the   longer-term undesirability—of additional fiscal policy stimulus, monetary policy is the only tool   March 18, 2003 50 of 101    left to support an economy that may face fundamental problems  The conservative, prudent   central banker in me agrees with Vice Chair McDonough that, given current levels of uncertainty   and the imminent war, the right thing to do may be to say little, stay put, and keep our powder   dry  But I am concerned about how long it really will be prudent to continue in this posture  "
4881,2003-03-18,"  There’s no uncertainty about the risk of doing that!     That’s a great idea     I agree that we should not make a policy change at this meeting  Now   is not the time to move  My desire would be to stay as low key as we possibly can and let things   play out over the next couple of weeks whatever way they’re going to play out  The second part   of your recommendation I have a bit more trouble with  I do think the risks are on the downside,   and I don’t see a big problem with saying that  When we characterize the risks, we talk about   them for the “foreseeable future”  Certainly the long-term fundamentals continue to be good—  productivity, inflation credibility—but for the foreseeable future, some of the short-term   fundamentals are kind of dicey  There are concerns about excess capacity in the case of business   investment and concerns about employment, income, and the potential for declines in house   prices on the consumer side  So I do think that the risks are on the downside, recognizing that   uncertainty clouds our ability to assess exactly where the risks are   I can go along with the recommendation to change the format in our press statement  I   think the market is going to read that, particularly in the context of your recent testimony or one   of your speeches—I forget which—as basically saying that there is a probability of an uptick   March 18, 2003 87 of 101    after uncertainty abates and attributing that uncertainty clearly to the war  In my view, the   markets are going to read the fact that we don’t make a statement about the risks as effectively a   move to the downside, so I guess I don’t have much of a problem with that  But frankly, I think   saying that the risks are to the downside is better because it keeps us closer to the norm and takes   us more out of play  To me doing something different puts a little more focus on the central   bank than I think is desirable at this point, but on balance I don’t have a big problem with it   I’d also like to associate myself with Ned Gramlich’s perspective that uncertainty itself   can be paralyzing  I remember reading the discussion from the last meeting where we thought   we’d have a lot more information by March 18  As it turns out, we don’t have a lot more   information     Well, we don’t have a lot more information as of March 18, and I don’t   know whether we’re going to have a lot more information by early May     More negative information     The war is starting     That’s right     That’s right I shouldn’t have laid it so much at your doorstep  That   was what we said in our forecasts as of the January meeting because those forecasts picked up   the trend from the end of last year and into the early weeks of this year  That’s clear  But I think   the market is going to read the absence of a statement of risks as effectively a move slightly to   the downside  I’m okay with that, but I would hope, along the line of Ned’s comments, that   uncertainty does not paralyze us  "
4929,2003-05-06,"  Dave, you referred to narrowing credit spreads, and President Moskow   did as well, as a positive aspect of financial markets  I’m wondering a little about that  People   tell me that some of the reduction in credit spreads is due to the fact that there’s a lot of money   out there chasing very few good deals  If one looks at the continuing pace of corporate   downgrades and at the declining volume of corporate bond issuance and C&I loans, the question   arises as to whether this is as favorable an aspect of the financial markets as we may be giving it   credit for  I’m wondering if credit spreads might widen before they start to narrow again     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There’s little in the recent data regarding   economic activity in New England that suggests much in the way of forward momentum  Recent   employment data, especially the benchmark revisions in the early spring, indicate much steeper   employment losses than previously thought  These losses were more significant in size in 2001   to be sure, but in the period from the supposed end of the recession at year-end 2001 to the   May 6, 2003 45 of 115    present, regional job losses have been relatively severe in New England compared with   elsewhere  Indeed, while the region is roughly 5 percent of the nation’s population and   economic activity, its job losses over the past year have equaled about 10 percent of the total for   the country as a whole  Massachusetts has been hardest hit among the New England states and   has lost more jobs in percentage terms from pre-recession peaks than any other state  To those   New Englanders who gauge conditions by comparing them to the worst recession in memory, the   1990-91 recession—and the number of those is not trivial—there is some reassuring news    Relatively speaking, things are not as bad as they were then  This time the pain is more evenly   shared, albeit with New England clearly on the low side in terms of jobs     Other, more forward-looking indicators on the regional economy have a brighter tone    Like the nation, consumer confidence in the region improved in April, and business confidence   rose a bit as well, largely because of improved expectations about the future  An index of   leading indicators for Massachusetts remained in negative territory, however, pushing off   thoughts of positive growth for the state until later in the fall     In our last telephone conference call, I shared with members of the Committee a great   deal of anecdotal information that we had gathered over the intermeeting period  As you’ll   recall, those anecdotes reflected little near-term optimism about the outlook and not much in the   way of plans for new capital spending, particularly domestically  Contacts since the last phone   call have echoed many of the same themes  In talking with a senior official at CVS, which is a   pharmacy chain with a fairly broad nationwide presence, I heard comments similar to those that   President Poole heard from his Wal-Mart contacts  My source said that CVS sees no sign of a   postwar pickup in spending and a continuation of the trend toward buying smaller rather than   bigger sizes of items—despite what we might read about the popularity of economy sizes  He   May 6, 2003 46 of 115    also noted that fewer customers are buying multiple refills of their prescriptions; people are   purchasing only the exact amount they need or sometimes not even a full month’s prescription    So, there is clearly a trend toward less spending  Most of our contacts don’t see a significant   rebound in activity this year  They are all hoping that 2004 will be better     On the national front, labor markets remain quite slack, labor force participation is down,   unemployment is up, and industrial production and business investment remain subpar despite   some signs of life in the telecom world  About the only good news since our last meeting came   from equity markets, buoyed by the end of the war, better-than-expected corporate profits, falling   oil prices, and rising consumer confidence  These bright spots seem fragile, however  Contacts   at Thompson First Call expect corporate profit growth to slow substantially in the second   quarter, as energy company earnings reflect lower oil prices and as the beneficial effect of   currency translation diminishes  It is questionable whether markets will continue to surprise on   the upside and whether confidence will buoy spending, given the impact of real economic data,   job losses, and the inevitable reduction in the sense of postwar relief     Most people I’ve talked to over the last several weeks have had one question in common    They ask, How is it that standard forecasts for economic growth over the next year or so all have   a sizable rebound in the last half of this year?  People ask this based on their own perspectives   and what they see in their industries  They wonder what will happen to turn things around    Well, one answer is fiscal policy in the form of increased defense spending and tax reduction, if   any of the plans now being debated in Washington are in fact enacted into law  But when I say   that, the reply usually is, What about state and local spending?  Taken together, state and local   government spending accounts for about 12 percent of real GDP—almost as much as business   investment and nearly twice as much as federal government spending  Given state deficits of   May 6, 2003 47 of 115    about $100 billion or so in the aggregate for fiscal 2004, it seems clear that either spending will   decline or local taxes will increase by amounts that eat significantly into disposable income    Either way there would be some offset, however sizable, to federal stimulus    Another answer to the question of what will foster a pickup in the economy is that   monetary policy is accommodative and that the markets expect it to stay so  But is it really?    With declining inflation rates, real interest rates are no more accommodative than they were   before our last 50 basis point move in November, at least according to the Bluebook analysis    “Is the Fed really doing enough?” these questioners ask   The final answer to the question lies in the fact that three years have passed, technology   has become obsolete, productivity remains strong, and businesses will soon be forced to invest   more  That’s the same logic used in last May’s Greenbook which forecast GDP growth, led by   optimism about both consumption and investment, by the end of the year to be about   2½ percentage points higher than it in fact was  Clearly we were wrong then  Perhaps the   passage of time has raised the likelihood of our being right this time  That is, an additional year   of spending deferral may have made a second-half of 2003 spurt of growth more likely   But it’s hard to find many business people—except in the biotech arena, which has   mostly small firms, or in direct defense contracting—who think that the kind of growth projected   in the Greenbook is a good bet, especially by the end of this year  They may simply be myopic    Nonetheless, I remain skeptical about the strength of the Greenbook forecast for the rest of 2003,   even recognizing that it has been tempered a bit  I wonder as well about the projection of a   nearly 5 percent pace of GDP growth by year-end 2004  This forecast seems to have more than   its share of risks on the downside  But even if it is realized, we will have had nearly four years   of below-potential growth and an output gap even into 2005  Unemployment rises through most   May 6, 2003 48 of 115    of the forecast period, falling only in the last quarter of 2004  And inflation trends downward to   below at least my definition of price stability, given the uncertainties of measurement  While   I’m concerned about the potential for deflation, for many of the reasons President Guynn   mentioned I don’t think that all aspects of deflation and deflationary psychology are as likely as   the Greenbook suggests    That said, the degree of expected price decline and its implications for slack resource use   are not ideal nor in my view consistent with our dual mandate  As I noted before, with falling   inflation, monetary policy has become less accommodative  It may be time now—and if not   now, soon—to adjust policy so that it provides continuing support during this long, gradual   recovery period  In my view, there’s little risk, and there could be considerable gains in doing   that; and I think there is a way to explain it neutrally  "
4930,2003-05-06,"  So much on the table here!  First, with regard to the policy action,   obviously I’m not a voting member; but if I were, I could have voted for an easing in policy, and   I could have done it on the basis of the concerns you expressed at the end of your testimony last   week  That is, we may need a more stimulative stance of monetary policy in the situation of   lower-than-expected inflation because policy is less, rather than more, accommodative than we   had planned  So, in order to keep the status quo, we might need to ease a bit to take real interest   rates to a position that is as accommodative as policy was, let’s say, immediately after our last   move  I thought that might be a way to explain an easing action—to say that it was more or less   an attempt to keep the status quo—that would not affect the markets so directly    I certainly can go along with your proposal and I understand what your concerns are  On   the matter of straws in the wind, the economy is going to grow, so sooner or later we’re going to   see these little straws  The question is, When are they going to cumulate to be enough to make a   difference in terms of an economy that is growing sufficiently to absorb all the excess capacity   May 6, 2003 93 of 115    that is out there?  To me the problem is not that inflation is falling so much as that we have an   output gap  The declining rate of inflation is related to that output gap, and I think we ought to   be concerned about that gap  Our best guess at forecasting suggests that the gap will remain for   more than the next few quarters that are mentioned in the first sentence of the third paragraph of   the statement  So, I’m a little uncomfortable with this approach, but I’m willing to go along with   it     I totally agree with you that the balance of risks statement has gotten us into the pickle of   too tightly coupling inflation and growth or disinflation and no growth  So I like the idea of   splitting them apart  I’m a little troubled by the wording “upside and downside risks to the   attainment of sustainable growth”  What do we mean by the term “sustainable growth” in the   context of that sentence?  I usually think of sustainable growth as noninflationary growth, but I   don’t know what upside and downside risks mean in the context of noninflationary growth    Inflation is going down by all of our best guesses  Do we just mean growth at potential?  I don’t   understand what we mean  You probably do     No debate     I’m not suggesting that we put a number down  I’m just wondering   what we mean by it   SPEAKER(?)  It means what is acceptable     Right     Well, if we’re talking about growth that is close to potential and   doesn’t contain the seeds of its own destruction—ie, it’s not inflationary and is not straining   resources—my own view is that there are more downside risks to that forecast in the near future   than upside risks  One can debate that, I suppose  There is certainly the possibility of a fall in   inflation, and I like the delinking of growth and inflation in this statement, so I guess I can live   with it   With regard to the June agenda, I would hope that we don’t talk just about strategies to   deal with the zero bound issue  We had an extended discussion of that at a meeting not too long   ago, so there is considerable material available to us on that issue, and all of us have thought a lot   about the zero bound  We do need strategies, I agree, and we need to think about them in the   environment in which we might actually employ them  But in my view it also would be   worthwhile to explain the concept that people have raised here  I think President Stern was the   first to say a couple of meetings ago that all price declines are not necessarily bad  What does   that mean?  What is the distinction between disinflation and deflation?  What does it really mean   to operate in such a low interest rate environment separate from whether we buy securities out on   the yield curve or whatever?  Are there other factors that we haven’t given a lot of thought to that   are going to affect us or the economy in such an environment?  Maybe that’s too much!     Mr Chairman, I agree with that  And I would like to associate myself   with President Moskow’s thoughts about appointing a subcommittee rather than waiting to get   staff memos and so forth in January  Put a group together sooner rather than later, and let’s get   to it    "
4981,2003-08-12,"  This may be a question that’s impossible to answer, but I’m going to   ask it anyway  You mentioned that the downward trend in ten-year yields had a lot to do with   our move of only 25 basis points and the discussion of deflation in our statement  But ten-year   yields and mortgage rates had been coming down for some time  The big mortgage lenders had   to have been wrong in their hedging activities  Does anybody have any sense, independent of   our comments about deflation and so forth, what the bounceback in yields might have been   solely as a result of the improvement in the economic data?  I recognize that it’s very hard to say     That had to be the frosting on the cake or the fuel for the fire because I   think there was something already there  "
4982,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have another question about the shape of   your forecast versus the shape of others  The strength of producers’ durable equipment spending   in both halves of 2004, but particularly in the second half, and the overall Q4-over-Q4 increase is   quite remarkable  Now, I grant you that the investment tax credit works its way into the   calculations here  But most business people tell me that, regardless of the investment tax credit,   they really want to spend money on equipment only when they actually need the equipment   During the 1990s there was a pretty sizable run-up in the level of spending on equipment and   software as a share of overall spending  It blipped up in association with Y2K and came back   down again  But it’s at a fairly high level still  I wonder about the acceleration in E&S   expenditures that’s built into this forecast; a 19 percent increase in the second half of next year   seems like a lot     Right     Yes, and then the numbers, at the top level anyway, would start to look   more like the mainstream of the Blue Chip forecasts           Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  Not a lot has changed in the   New England economy, but the tone of comments and attitudes, especially about prospects for   the second half, has brightened a bit  To be sure, the labor market remains in the doldrums, with   unemployment stable in June and employment levels still on the decline  Other measures of the   August 12, 2003 37 of 110    labor market are weak as well, with initial claims rising and help wanted advertising suggesting   that hiring activity is declining  Residential real estate markets remain strong even in the face of   rising interest rates, likely because people are trying to get their mortgage loans before interest   rates go up further  And commercial vacancy rates have stabilized, albeit at high levels   State and local governments continue to deal with deficit problems by significant   reductions in services and increases in revenue  There may be no new taxes, but as an example,   about $05 billion in new fees and charges helped to narrow the deficit of something like   $3 billion in Massachusetts for 2004  So a significant amount of funds are coming in the form of   new sources of money from the state’s populace   As with the nation, gloom about current conditions appears to be offset somewhat by a   modest optimism regarding the future  Consumer and business confidence suggest expectations   of better conditions by year-end  In addition, the index of leading indicators for the   Massachusetts economy has been in positive territory for four months, predicting growth in the   economy over the second half  This pattern of less stellar current growth with some optimism   about the future was particularly evident in conversations with regional manufacturers  For most   of the more than one dozen companies contacted, current results were either flat or marginally   lower in the first half of 2003, but losses were abating  Obviously, the results varied by industry,   with pharmaceuticals and medical products experiencing solid rates of revenue growth,   aerospace business mixed, and revenues at manufacturers of technology-related goods,   chemicals, and business services products unchanged or lower   Despite current conditions, optimism about growth in the next two quarters and beyond   prevailed among these manufacturers  Competition remains keen, and companies believe that   their cost-cutting and restructuring has been significant enough to enable better profit growth   August 12, 2003 38 of 110    through the rest of this year and into 2004  In that regard, many believe that sales have reached a   trough in their industries and that slow but steady growth could be on the horizon  Technology   again is the exception  Many software and equipment manufacturers spoke about two issues that   have been mentioned by others today  The first, as President Parry said about California, is that   the high-tech jobs that are leaving the New England region are not likely to come back  The   second, as mentioned by President Pianalto, is the concern in the technology industry about   China and India  That’s where the jobs are going, and most people don’t expect those jobs to   come back  So there are concerns about the long-term ability of the economy to expand in the   technology area, in equipment and software in particular  Uncertainty is a factor for everyone, to   be sure  As one contact put it, “Things aren’t getting worse, and they may be getting marginally   better, but it’s too soon to tell”         There may also be tentative signs of a pickup in local economic activity that we see   through the banking system  Large New England banks are beginning to see some increase in   loan demand, and the shift of loans into problem status continues to decrease  This contrasts a   bit with the discussion about bank credit in the Bluebook and other staff material  In part there   may be some bifurcation between lenders to shared national credit borrowers and other C&I   lending  For the shared national credit loans, there continues to be a greatly reduced willingness   to lend, especially by foreign banks, which played a relatively larger role in these credits in the   ’90s and experienced a greater share of the losses as well  For smaller C&I loans, banks seem to   be ready and willing to lend, as witnessed both by the anecdotes we hear and by comments from   respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  Whether this willingness to lend   portends a much brighter picture going forward, however, remains unclear     August 12, 2003 39 of 110    For the national economy there are uncertainties as well  Growth in the second quarter   was surprisingly strong, but most of the surprise was in automobile purchases and government   spending, though it is true that equipment and software purchases showed some signs of life as   well  But we’ve seen growth surprises before in this bumpy recovery  One is reminded of the   third quarter of last year, when GDP jumped to a 4 percent pace on the back of consumer   spending on durables—again, autos—and then slid to a 14 percent pace in the fourth quarter  I   don’t think that’s necessarily going to happen again, but it does bear keeping in mind     Certainly, federal government spending has been strong, and fiscal policy remains in a   highly stimulative position, though state and local spending cuts subtract from this  Monetary   policy is stimulative as well, though market volatility and a steeper yield curve have subtracted   from that as well  Combined with policy stimulus, consumer spending indicators, new orders   data, improvements in some confidence measures, low inventory levels, rising profits, and   productivity all suggest that increased strength in the second half of this year is all but baked in   the cake  Labor markets remain weak, to be sure, and growth during the second half is not likely   to eat much into excess capacity  Thus, the unemployment rate seems likely to stay at its   relatively elevated state, and inflation could trend down     The big question is, After a third-quarter and maybe fourth-quarter burst, where is this   economy going?  Will it proceed on the path described in the Greenbook, with a sharp   acceleration in 2004, or on a path that settles down to about potential along the lines of most   private forecasts and ours in Boston as well?  I don’t have a clear answer to this question, but I’m   not sure one is necessary right now  For now, a policy-driven acceleration seems assured  It will   not be sufficient to absorb much excess capacity or to reduce unemployment, but it could   accelerate the process of easing the restraint and caution that is so palpable in corporate America    August 12, 2003 40 of 110    Markets took a bit of a wild ride in May and June in part because they became convinced, for   whatever reason, that yields would move only in one direction  But they appear to have   stabilized a bit and the current level of rates does reflect, at least to some extent, a sense of   market optimism about future growth The best thing we could do right now, in my view, is to   leave well enough alone   That takes me to the issue of communication  Clearly, what we say has assumed an   importance that is in many ways unfortunate  In part that’s because the outlook has been so   uncertain; an inflection point is near by most people’s estimates, and the markets are looking for   a sense of guidance about it  Thus the entire body of our communication—the post-meeting   statements, speeches, testimony, and news articles—is being perused more closely than ever   before, at least during my time on the Committee  We’re going to have a chance to talk about   this issue in September; and I, like a lot of you, am looking forward to it  However, whatever   our decision today, this scrutiny of our communications places a higher premium than usual on   what we say in our public statements  I would strongly suggest that we keep our statement as   short, simple, and familiar as possible     That’s a leading indicator!  "
4983,2003-08-12,"  I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I had a reaction   to your discussion about the potential for an inventory swing to be a source of upside risk  I’ve   heard discussions in the technology arena about long supply lines, very low inventories, and the   possibility that when demand begins to accelerate—people in the industry say “if”—there will be   the potential for a strong reaction to that demand so that it can be supplied  An offset to that, and   one that I worry about a little, is the increasing proportion of foreign goods that are used in our   overall capital investment process  I’m not sure how much that would offset the pickup from an   inventory swing  With regard to the communication process, I don’t think we should change   anything about the last statement as you have recommended  But I do agree with Bill Poole that   developing a mechanism whereby we try to assure the market that we are going to do one thing   or another for a long period of time is a recipe for the kind of market volatility we’ve had  And I   think we ought to be very careful about that     Could I reflect an opposite concern?  Our statement the last time said   something along the lines of this wording  The probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall   in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation  Therefore, we believe that, on balance, the risk of   inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable   future  Now we’ve added a third sentence that not only talks about disinflation again but also   mentions warding off unwelcome disinflation for a considerable period  I’m just wondering   whether that’s veering a little too much toward the commitment side than we need to or ought to   do at this point  I would be happy if we stayed more or less with the way we worded it the last   time—that is, ending after the second sentence of the last paragraph  As the statement is drafted   here, we now have three sentences emphasizing the disinflation concern, and I think that’s hitting   it too hard   August 12, 2003 86 of 110      I thought we’d come up with a statement from the Committee for this   meeting that was as identical to the last one as we could get  That’s what I had in mind when I   supported the recommendation     Yes     I realize that  But the big surprise of your recent testimony was not   this statement about disinflation  It was the relative optimism about the prospects that the   economy was going to get better  I thought it was a very balanced statement on your part  The   optimism, combined with the ranges of our expectations for growth, which under most people’s   assessment of potential and so forth were surprisingly upbeat, was conveyed in the context of all   the hand wringing we had been doing over several weeks about further disinflation or deflation    So to me that sense of optimism was the surprise in your testimony  Therefore, to go back in this   statement to three sentences of emphasis on disinflation seems to me to be changing a bit the   sense of our outlook in an environment in which I don’t think we should change it   August 12, 2003 87 of 110      I really worry about our trying to target anything in any market with   this statement     Yes     I don’t debate that at all  I think that’s totally accurate  My concern is   that this statement introduces yet another slight variance in a market environment that has   already been volatile  So I think we’d be better off making the statement plain and simple and   letting the market sort things out  Then we can figure out in a little more organized way in   September how we want to communicate some of these points       That would go a long way     It is     Yes     Why doesn’t “foreseeable future” do that for you in the context of   taking out the third sentence?     Right   August 12, 2003 92 of 110   "
5018,2003-09-15,"  Thursday, now that it’s sent electronically     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This has been a fascinating discussion, and   there are lots of things to say about a lot of issues, but I want to focus on just a few  First of all, I   think anyone who has observed the Fed over the last three or four months—including any person   in the markets who has criticized us about our communications—would find it a little odd that   much of tonight’s discussion has been focused on what should be in the Bluebook rather than   what should be in the press statement  I think the real problem is that we take the announcement   out of the context of the wide variety of issues we all talk about at an FOMC meeting  The   problem is not just the announcement  In fact, the problem probably isn’t really the   announcement at all—though there are some things that we could do at the margin to improve   it—but the context into which the announcement is put  To a large extent we create that context   ourselves  I think you talked about that a bit     Just looking at the period from January until the June meeting, there were 103 speeches   or testimonies—public appearances—by members of the Board of Governors and Reserve Bank   presidents  In those speeches and testimonies the term “deflation” was cited 200 times, and 116   of those references occurred between the May and the June meetings  Now, I ask you  Is that   not an environment that’s just asking for people to over-interpret what was in our official   statement?  People in the market think that there’s a big communication machine here in   Washington that tells us all what to say  Even when we tell them there isn’t, they still believe   September 15, 2003 47 of 78    that there is  So I think that’s partly what fed into the market response and it reflects whatever   degree we were responsible for the market’s overreaction either on the downside or the upside     Well, it’s not so much that they added them up     Exactly     I am not suggesting that at all  I’m just saying that that was the   happenstance  We inadvertently added to market volatility     My recommendation is to proceed very carefully  I don’t think there’s   so much wrong with the current process and the statements we issue that we should jump   immediately to a different solution  I have some sympathy for President Hoenig’s comments and   President Parry’s, too, in terms of an easy-to-handle formulaic approach  Where Tom was   coming out—on the side of the Bank of England approach—has some appeal to me, too,   although there are clearly some downside risks to that  I would hate to see us move to either of   those approaches overnight  I would like us to give this more thought and discuss it further,   beyond tonight  I hope we will do that     September 15, 2003 48 of 78    On the subject of inflation targeting I am very much in agreement with you, Mr   Chairman  Along the lines of looking at what might happen when the Treasury bond goes away   or at what might happen if we had to use nontraditional monetary policy measures, if we kill a   few trees looking at inflation targeting, everybody is going to think we’re going to be moving to   that  I personally feel that it would not be the right thing to do and it would not buy us anything    I would hope that sooner or later we could come to a meeting of the minds on that subject and   not enter into a long, drawn-out process of trying to find out whether or not it makes any   difference to any policy objective we care about  That’s all I will say, though there are lots of   other things I could say     It’s not only the market that doesn’t know what we mean!  [Laughter]  "
5059,2003-09-16,"  I actually didn’t raise my hand, and I’m certainly not going to now!    [Laughter]  But I think this is proof positive that editing by nineteen people is really too hard to   do  So I’m happy with this, Mr Chairman  "
5060,2003-09-16,"  This is coming at the same questions we’ve been bouncing around here   from a little different angle  Compared with most forecasters, you are still right up there with   Genetskicom in terms of your growth expectations, but you have diminishing inflation and less   progress on the unemployment side  Clearly, it seems to me that you have a higher productivity   number embedded in your forecast than the market does  That fundamental difference that we’re   talking about here seems to be driving the market’s expectations for when we’re going to raise   interest rates  I’m wondering when a better shared sense of that will occur, if it happens at all    What kind of time frame do you think we might be working with here?     To anybody who has watched the economy over the last several   decades, it’s hard to say that the forecast is for 5 percent GDP growth on the one side and an   increasing output gap, inflation going down, and a need for accommodative monetary policy on   the other side  There’s something about it that just doesn’t go together     The markets could be wrong     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Ever so gradually, things seem to be   turning around in the First District  To be sure, labor markets remain weak, and confidence   about current conditions is uneven  But there is a sense that the regional economy may have   bottomed out, and forward-looking indicators of both business and consumer confidence are   positive  Contacts in the business services area—IT and software providers and temporary help   firms— report more-upbeat conditions  Venture capital financing for software and Internet firms   has increased, and the market for this financing has become competitive  Sales cycles have   shortened; advertising by IT firms is up; and the number of software companies is rising after a   sharp decline over the past several years     The head of a large semiconductor manufacturer located in New Hampshire commented   earlier this year that demand showed signs of increasing and, absent any further shocks this   summer, production would follow  National data seem to reflect the accuracy of that remark    September 16, 2003 40 of 106    Still, job postings remain at record lows relative to total positions in the software and IT industry,   indicating that job growth in this area is still very slow  Similarly, although vacancy rates in   major metropolitan and suburban areas remain high, contacts report that these markets have   stabilized though they may not be growing overall  In fact, more vacant space is expected to   come on the market; but some positive absorption has been registered, and the rate of   deterioration is slowing  Obviously, the employment situation has to brighten to significantly   reduce vacancy rates, and industry contacts clearly see the current situation as requiring a long,   slow workout  Still the overall sense seems to be more positive, at least compared with recent   months       Other areas of the District’s economy also seem to be coming along  Residential real   estate sales remain strong, and the prices of repeat-sale homes are rising considerably faster in   the region than in the nation as a whole  Retail contacts were more upbeat than they have been;   and after a very slow, rainy midsummer, tourism seemed to have picked up in August, bringing   needed income to many areas in the region  Finally, New England remains relatively more   defense industry intensive than the rest of the nation despite many base closings and downsizings   over the last several years  Each of our District states saw healthy increases in defense contracts   in 2002, and we expect that to be the case in 2003 as well  This has not halted layoffs by defense   contractors; the increase in business is important nonetheless   Turning to the nation, I have been pleased to see that the acceleration in economic   activity we expected at the time of our last meeting is beginning to appear in earnest  Consumers   are increasingly confident and continue to be willing to buy big-ticket items such as houses and   cars  Businesses have begun to spend more, and their laser-like focus on costs has prompted a   productivity boom  Profit growth has accelerated, and analysts are now writing up projections   September 16, 2003 41 of 106    for the third and fourth quarters rather than writing them down  Financial markets have been   positive as well, with narrowing credit spreads, growth in equity markets, and some flattening of   the yield curve  Moreover, the external world seems to be on the mend, though domestic   demand growth in most of our trading partners remains slow  The major continuing issue is the   strength of US labor markets   It must be said, however, that the pace of this economic acceleration is due a lot to the   aggressiveness of both monetary and fiscal policy  Even with the rise in ten-year yields since   our June meeting, mortgage rates continue to be at the low end of decades of experience  The   drop-off in refinancing activity may simply be a temporary lull until credit markets stabilize   further and yields retreat, as they have begun to do     Tax cuts and investment tax credits have buoyed both the consumer and businesses    Without tax changes, disposable personal income growth would have been nearly flat  Instead it   jumped 13 percent during the month of July alone, allowing—in my view anyway—both growth   in expenditures and a small pickup in the saving rate  It’s not clear from either the data or   anecdotal reports that tax credits by themselves are boosting business spending on equipment   and software right now, but certainly growing consumption plays a role here  In the high-tech   world in particular, spending plans seem stronger than they were, though caution is still the   byword   That takes me to what I believe continues to be the primary challenge facing this   economy, namely an excess of business caution and uncertainty that brings into question the   durability of the current acceleration in growth beyond the coming two quarters  Will businesses   increase spending even after consumers’ income growth and their desire to spend is no longer   September 16, 2003 42 of 106    bolstered by tax cuts?  Will consumers continue to spend if labor market prospects don’t   brighten?     The forecast we’ve done at the Boston Fed for the period between now and the end of   2004—as we’ve talked about, many other private forecasts for that period as well—differs a bit   from the Greenbook projection  The Greenbook sees real GDP growth in 2004 at 5 percent on a   Q4-over-Q4 basis  In Boston, our forecast for GDP is a bit above our estimate of potential,   somewhere in the upper 3s  The Greenbook sees consumption staying particularly strong after   outsized increases in federal spending this year and has growth in private domestic final   purchases nearly double our projection by the second half of next year  This growth in 2004 is   stronger than the staff projected at our last meeting, even despite a forecast—comparing   Greenbook to Greenbook—of about 800,000 fewer jobs  As Dave noted, rising equity markets   and productivity growth act not only to buoy demand but also to increase potential, resulting in   little progress in reducing the output gap or increasing employment, at least in 2004  Not   surprisingly, inflation trends downward  Thus, the Greenbook sees what could be termed very   strong GDP growth, especially in a large developed country like ours; but in the end excess   capacity remains until 2005  In our Bank’s forecast we reach much the same conclusion   although on a lower growth path   It seems to me that this is a very interesting time from a policy perspective  Conditions   are improving  But even with the Greenbook’s optimism, the improvement is not enough to   close the output gap for a considerable period of time  If one thinks the risks are that growth will   be slower than in the Greenbook but productivity will still be healthy, the gap grows even wider    So there is support for remaining accommodative for some period, as we’ve been saying, or   maybe becoming even more so  But as logical and defensible as that approach is, I think it is   September 16, 2003 43 of 106    right to be a bit agnostic now that the momentum in the economy seems to have shifted    Certainly the market is agnostic about this  I think we need to be humble, as Dave has clearly   said, about our ability to see out to 2004 and 2005, given this unique confluence of very high   productivity growth and an increasing output gap in the context—at least historically speaking—  of high demand and high GDP growth     In particular, I take note of the surge in profit growth  Absent any further major   corporate governance issues or geopolitical events, I think this profit growth could give   businesses an incentive to hire faster than even the Greenbook is predicting  Obviously the   initial effect would be reduced productivity but increased employment and a flattened   inflationary pattern  So I think there is some balance out there in terms of the possibilities  I’m a   little agnostic about the growth of potential that the staff has in its forecast  But I’m also a bit   agnostic on the issue of whether the output gap will grow as fast as projected  In any event, I   think we have some time to consider the possibilities here    "
5061,2003-09-16,"  But who’s counting?     I’m obviously in agreement with your recommendation on the funds   rate  Actually, I don’t see any alternative to keeping the language on the risks—the risks to   sustainable economic growth, the risks of inflation, and the balance of risks—the same as the last   time  Not enough has changed  Growth is clearly a little stronger, but we have labor market   constraints  So I think it would be difficult to change that wording, even though it brings to mind   last night’s discussion about how none of this language is particularly satisfactory right now    Nevertheless, I don’t see a case for changing it at this time, which was one of my basic points   last night  The last sentence in the draft is ungainly; there’s no question about it  But I follow   your logic that this approach is a way, over a meeting or two, to back away from prescribing a   time period and move toward mentioning a set of circumstances—or however we want to   characterize it—that would affect our future policy course  I think this sentence is probably a   good way of doing that  So I’m in agreement with all three parts of your recommendation  "
5117,2003-10-28,"  In preparation for this discussion I reread the verbatim transcript of our   dinner meeting last month  It was very interesting and informative  I realized how much I miss   sometimes when I’m thinking about what I want to say as opposed to what other people are   saying  I was one of the people who at that time did not want to change much in our statement   October 28, 2003 102 of 126    and for the near term I’m still in that camp  But I’ve come around a lot, to somewhere near   where President Poole is, and I certainly agree with Presidents Guynn and Hoenig that we need   to give this a lot more thought  We definitely have to say what we did and why we did it  And   in saying why we took whatever action we did, we ought to give some sense of the things that   concern us about the current outlook  I really question—I’m sorry, Don—the assumption that it   helps the markets at all for us to go further than that and talk about the risks of various   developments in the future  I’m not sure it helps them  I think it just gives them more to chew   on in terms of what we said, why we said it, and who said what, and they think about that rather   than doing their job in the market  They shouldn’t be spending as much time second-guessing us   as they are  They should be out there doing whatever it is markets do  [Laughter]    SPEAKER(?)  But we’re the 800-pound gorilla in the market     Well, I know we’re the 800-pound gorilla, but I think we should avoid   a commitment about the future  We should clearly avoid any sense—and somehow try to correct   the belief—that we sit around this table trying to figure out what the markets are likely to do and   what we’re going to say to make them do something different  The markets are going to do what   they’re going to do  We have to make our policy the way we call the cards  We may be right, or   we may be wrong; but we should not be making policy—or even talking about policy—that’s   aimed at changing how the markets operate  They have to operate a bit independently of us, I   think  So in the short term I think we did the right thing today  Between now and January we   probably will be coming to an appreciation of the risks being more balanced  That will change   the language  That will help us get out of the “considerable period” terminology  In January—  my personal preference is to take a real step back and think long and hard about what the risk   statement does for us  If we’re convinced that it does something good, then we have any number   October 28, 2003 103 of 126    of formulations of language to go with  If we’re not convinced, then maybe we can find a way to   tell the markets that they will find out what we did and why, but we’re going to stop speculating   on the risks  I don’t care if we use a task force in the interim  That’s fine by me     Count the years to retirement, Vincent!  "
5118,2003-10-28,"  I had the same question about the degree of difference between this   forecast and ones we see from major outside forecasters  At our Bank we usually construct a   little chart that plots the Greenbook forecast relative to other forecasts  We have the respective   forecasts for real GDP on the x axis and the change in the CPI or some other measure of inflation   on the y axis  Normally, the Greenbook is somewhere in the middle, but now it is clearly an   outlier for any quarter one looks at  It’s in the bottom right-hand quadrant, with high GDP   growth and very low rates of inflation  If we do a similar comparison with respect to changes in   the fed funds rate, we see very big differences as well  That’s also true if one goes deeper into   the forecast details and looks at what outsiders think the gap is versus what the staff believes    Even forecasts that have a higher gap—through 2004 anyway—still show rising rates of inflation   and rising fed funds rates  So it seems that the construct you are using is really different from the   vast majority of other forecasters  That could mean that you’re right  But it also puts us in the   unusual position of being the optimistic central bank       The other question I wanted to raise relates to a statement by one   contact—one of what seems like a zillion I’ve talked with over the last four or five weeks—who   likened the uptick in consumption over the summer to a sugar high associated with the greater   fiscal stimulus  We’re a little more downbeat in New England than nearly everybody else, as   everyone could see from the Beige Book, and maybe that’s just a reflection of our environment    I don’t know  You did mention, however, a few things that seemed to be coming in a bit on the   weaker side in September and early October  I must say that, in talking with the people from   First Call, while the profit numbers have been exceeding analysts’ expectations, there seem to be   a number of warnings that it is not going to continue and some concerns expressed about that    Maybe you could elaborate on this, though you talked about it a little in your presentation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in New England have   neither deteriorated nor improved very much since our last meeting, at least as far as we can tell    The intermeeting interval has been a rather busy period of regional outreach for us  In addition   to the Beige Book survey, we’ve had meetings of our academic and small business councils    We’ve also had several bankers’ forums, a gathering of local software executives, and a wide   range of conversations with business leaders  There are clearly some positive notes in the reports   from these contacts   Chipmakers and storage equipment manufacturers are increasing production and even are   hiring  Our UPS contact for the New England area sees an uptrend in the firm’s domestic   business  But on balance the overall tone is a bit flat or even downbeat from where it was in the   October 28, 2003 43 of 126    summer  Businesses are working hard to maintain margins and are looking forward to spending   more and to hiring locally as well as outsourcing  But the point at which a majority will feel   comfortable doing so doesn’t seem to be here yet   Regional employment levels declined in September, with a decrease compared with a   year ago of around 1 percent, and that’s a good deal more than the small, 03 percent, decline for   the nation as a whole  Manufacturing has about 12 percent of overall jobs, but that sector   represented about 50 percent of the job losses over the past twelve months, with the remainder   primarily in the construction and the information technology industries    As most of you have seen, our Beige Book contacts in manufacturing seemed a bit out of   step with others in the nation in reporting flat or deteriorating demand  That was due in part to   the fact that a few of our contacts were unavailable or much less communicative than usual given   the proximity of Q3 earnings reports  Had the full group been reflected in our report, it likely   would have noted flat or slightly rising demand and revenues but would have sounded a similar   note of caution  Companies in the life sciences area have seen good growth in the third quarter,   and defense department spending has proven beneficial to some other firms  But the region’s   largest manufacturers and a range of smaller industries do not expect much of a boost from the   economy in coming quarters  Most have cut employment, plan to continue doing so, and are   currently outsourcing production to foreign countries Those expecting improvement in their   businesses are depending on product innovation, increasing market share by acquisitions, and a   continuing keen focus on cost control   The region’s small and medium-size banks remain in good shape financially, with good   asset quality, strong capital ratios, and very little in the way of delinquencies or chargeoffs    Their major complaint involves a drop in refinancing business and very tight margins    October 28, 2003 44 of 126    Residential real estate markets remain strong in the region, with robust demand, somewhat   slower sales growth, and steady home construction  Depending on the bank and the area, small   business borrowing is reported to be either flat or slowly improving, though many bankers note   that the improvements they see mainly involve firms leaving larger companies or sometimes   newly merged institutions  In those cases, the size of the larger institution has made it less   willing to meet the demands of smaller businesses   Software firms report some signs of growth, though there’s a lot of variation in how   companies are doing depending on their areas of specialization  Some—for example, those   involved in portal applications, which enable easy use of data storage and multiple legacy   systems—report record growth  Others involved in areas that were overbought in the ’90s   continue to see problems in terms of their revenues, though the latter are perhaps at a point of   bottoming out  Tech firms report that access to capital markets is varied as well  Money is   available in equity markets and from venture capitalists, but revenue prospects and stability have   to be very solid  Cost control is seen as a critical element for these companies, and they find   advantages in using overseas labor, particularly in India, China, and Russia  Reportedly the   outsourced software work tends to be the more routine tasks, with higher-level jobs remaining in   New England   Finally, commercial real estate markets could be stabilizing a bit  CB Richard Ellis   reports an increased number of tenants looking for space in the market  Indeed, we at the Bank   have seen an increase in the number of calls about and walk-throughs of our available space    However, most of these prospective tenants have a number of properties to choose from  Indeed,   regionwide the availability of office space increased a bit from the second to the third quarter,   October 28, 2003 45 of 126    and per-square-foot asking prices declined slightly  But overall the picture looks a little better   than it did     In sum, the recovery in the region seems to be muddling along  Things looked brighter   earlier in the third quarter and a bit less so as September wore on  Employment is a real concern   in the region  Consumer confidence about the present situation has softened, and business   confidence has stayed barely positive  Hope for stronger growth remains, but there is a sense of   underlying concern that real improvement is taking too long to materialize   Turning to the nation, clearly the incoming data on the third quarter have been stronger   than expected  Consumer and business spending has accelerated, driven in large part by the   additions to disposable personal income from tax cuts and child tax credits and the availability of   partial tax expensing for equipment  Profit margins overall appear to have held up well, at least   in part because of favorable currency translations  Business spending on equipment and software   began to accelerate, too, and likely will continue to grow, though at what pace it’s hard to   determine  Profit growth ought to lead to hiring as well; but that hasn’t happened much yet, and   labor markets remain soft  Financial markets have strengthened, and credit spreads have become   more accommodative  Inventories have been drawn down, auguring well for some impetus to   Q4 growth; and the declining dollar, assuming that the decline continues to be orderly, augurs   favorably for some net export support in the current quarter as well  Moreover, the outlook isn’t   quite as gloomy on the external side, particularly in non-Japan Asia, the United Kingdom, and   Canada  But the question remains as to whether the growth we are seeing is self-sustaining  The   answer to that has to center on whether or not we will see job creation sufficient to begin to close   the output gap     October 28, 2003 46 of 126    We talked a lot before, and I won’t go into it further, about the optimistic outlook in the   Greenbook for GDP, unemployment, and inflation—at least relative to other forecasters    President Stern mentioned the job growth figures  The Greenbook is projecting an increase of   8 million jobs over 2004 and 2005  In a typical recovery that amount of job growth would occur   over a four-year period rather than in two years  Normally we see a jump in job growth as the   recovery begins; we haven’t seen that this time  But in the Greenbook forecast, the job growth   projected for 2004 and 2005 will make up the shortfall we’ve had in this jobless recovery and   take about half the time  That’s a lot of jobs in a short period of time  We in Boston don’t see   the same pace of GDP growth in 2004 that the Board staff projects  Our estimate is in the upper   3s, with a small downtick in unemployment and a flat price trend  There are upside risks—  others have mentioned them—especially if we turn out to be more optimistic about the   underlying inflation process than is warranted  In a way, seeing risks on both sides of the   Greenbook forecast gives me a bit of reassurance, though I believe that the potential downside   developments, if realized, would be a bit more costly and problematic—at least in terms of the   initial effects—than those on the upside  For now I would advocate no change in our policy   position, and I would hope as little change as possible in what we say about it  But I’ll say more   about communication later when, I assume, we will take up that subject separately  "
5119,2003-10-28,"  The more we go into how to slice and dice and stress-test all of these   various formulations—whether it’s the current one or the one Vincent proposed in his   October 17 memo—the more difficult and complicated this whole process becomes  It is fraught   with untoward circumstances or unintended consequences  I think we need to take a big step   back—not today, for purposes of this meeting—in considering these various proposals  As I and   a lot of other people around the table suggested, given that we’re not likely to change policy,   let’s stay as close as we can to what we have been saying  Maybe we can fiddle with it or add   October 28, 2003 78 of 126    words to the “considerable period” or maybe not, depending on how we come out on that  But   I’d say leave it alone    The atmosphere is really difficult out there, and I don’t think the recent newspaper   articles did us one bit of good in terms of providing us with some flexibility to change things    Even if that were desirable now—and I wouldn’t agree that it is—I believe we really need to   think about this a lot longer and a lot harder  I for one would want to take a big step back and   even think about whether we want to continue with a formulation that came out of the old tilt    Why do we want to continue doing that?  Why do we want to put out information about the   future that we’re all uncomfortable with?  Saying why we did what we did has enough of a future   impact without adding all this information about risks when we realize that there’s a great deal of   uncertainty about the risks  That’s a discussion for another time—maybe at lunch or in January    I just want to encourage us, please, not to do anything very different this time  There’s so much   to talk about just in terms of this grid, let alone the seven or eight variations that you put in your   October 17 memo  Also there’s Ned’s proposal, which I think has some attractiveness to it    Let’s just stop now and try to figure out what we’re going to do  We can have a little   conversation over lunch and take it up again in January     I very much agree with your suggestion, Mr Chairman, and I also like   Tom’s metaphor  "
5184,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Roger  I’m a little worried here  I would just go back to   what I said earlier  We have gotten ourselves into a situation where—in the terminology I used   before—we have a lot of moving parts in this statement  None of these proposals that you have   presented—without going into details on any of them—diminishes those moving parts at all  It’s   possible, based on a brief glance, that these proposals actually may add moving parts  I don’t   think that’s the direction we want to go  I think we should be aiming to minimize rather than   maximize the number of things we talk about in the statement we release after every meeting  I   believe we get into increasing amounts of trouble as we try to expand on what we cover yet keep   the wording short and pithy enough—that is, without the logic and back-and-forth discussion that   went on in the Committee meeting—to be in the press statement for each meeting   In my view, and you and I had this conversation on the telephone, the endeavors of the   working group should not preclude a discussion in January of having the statement be shorter   and sweeter—perhaps confining it to what we did and why we did it  We could let some other   vehicle—perhaps the minutes released on an earlier schedule—convey all the ins and outs and   ups and downs of the Committee’s discussion  You indicated that the January discussion would   not preclude that possibility  My concern is that an intensive amount of stress-testing of three   December 9, 2003 108 of 133    alternatives with the same amount of moving parts—albeit phrased somewhat differently or   focused somewhat differently—will result in our receiving huge papers on this topic five days,   say, before the two-day meeting  We have enormous amounts of material to assimilate anyway,   and this will give us no time to discuss any other proposal or perspective that might not be as   well fleshed out as these  I’m worried that we’re going to continue along a line here that I don’t   think has been very fruitful for us     Oh, I’m sorry  Did I speak out of turn?     But we’re likely to do so after having pored over a fifty-page paper!   December 9, 2003 110 of 133      But, Roger, I think it’s important to recognize that for any of us who   favor a shorter, simpler statement, the length of the meeting has nothing whatsoever to do with   that preference  If we had to spend ten hours arguing over policy, I’d be happy to do that  "
5185,2003-12-09,"  No, I think it’s going to be the Red Sox  [Laughter]     I realize that this discussion is going on a little longer than we probably   all expected, but let me just follow up with one more question  In the ’90s I think all of us were   struck by the degree to which companies said that they were never going to raise prices  They   felt that global competition or domestic competition or whatever one wants to call it had put   them in a position of not viewing price increases as an option available to them  There were a lot   of factors helping them in that regard, particularly in terms of the cost of labor  They were   paying people with stock options, which they didn’t have to account for  The stock market was   helping on benefit costs  The rate of increase in health costs was going down at the time  There   were any number of accounting tricks that we now know companies were using to figure out   how to show a level of earnings and revenues and so forth that the market expected    More recently we’ve had slow growth in demand, but at the same time the factors that   kept the costs associated with hiring people low have all disappeared  Firms don’t have the same   beneficial impact from benefit programs  Health costs are clearly escalating  Businesses can no   longer pay people in ways that are not transparent; those costs have to be accounted for in some   fashion or another, at least for most companies  Clearly the emphasis on improving productivity   is a reflection of the desire not to increase prices  But I’m wondering if we are still hearing with   the same intensity the view that raising prices is just not something that firms would ever   consider doing again       Right     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in New England   continues to lag that of the nation, but much of the regional slowness seems concentrated in   Massachusetts  Elsewhere there are indications that a more solid pace of growth is taking hold    For one, merchandise exports for the region climbed almost 13 percent in the last quarter from   their low point in early 2002, with the largest growth in chemicals and computer and electronic   products  More notably perhaps, despite the downbeat nature of some of the regional data,   consumer confidence rose sharply in November, with improvement in views regarding both the   present situation as well as future expectations  Confidence is now back to levels seen just as the   recession ended  Hopefully that’s a precursor to a brighter tone overall     December 9, 2003 52 of 133    I say “hopefully” because some important data remain relatively downbeat  Employment   levels in the region dropped again in October  The two most populous and richest states,   Massachusetts and Connecticut, led the way with year-over-year job losses of nearly 1½ percent    For the other states in the region, however, the job count was either unchanged or marginally   positive versus a year ago  Moreover, even though Massachusetts and Connecticut employment   declines over the year were comparable, Massachusetts accounts for nearly all the recent drop    Thus there is some reason to believe that five out of the six New England states are moving in a   positive direction, with only Massachusetts stuck in contraction mode   Commercial real estate markets remain weak in the region, with office rents falling    Again, the Boston market seems to be the most sluggish, with contacts reporting stability   elsewhere  Not surprisingly, a survey indicated that business confidence in Massachusetts   slipped a bit as well, falling slightly below 50 in October after strengthening through most of the   summer  Employers were reported to have significant concerns about the present and a wait-  and-see attitude regarding the future  Similarly, an economic index of Massachusetts growth fell   off a bit from both a month and a year earlier  The state’s economy is nonetheless expected to   grow over the next six months but at a slower pace   Moving beyond the data, and particularly the data from Massachusetts, there are uneven   signs of vitality  Beige Book contacts in retail and manufacturing were more upbeat than they   were the previous time we talked to them  Temporary-help firms report that activity has picked   up in recent months  Revenues are up, and the excess supply of available labor may be   moderating  Software firms were more upbeat as well, with more specialties showing better   growth than earlier  Contacts in the chip-making industry say growth should be at 10 percent   globally in the fourth quarter, a good pickup for that sizable industry  Paper mills and packaging   December 9, 2003 53 of 133    industries continue to see only slow growth in demand, and consumer electronic sales through   October seem to signal a reasonable but not a great Christmas season  Nevertheless, consumers   continue to be willing to spend relatively large amounts on entertainment  One large sports   venue reports high per capita spending at recent games  In sum, New England still faces   challenges, though for the most part Massachusetts seems worse off, with the other states on a   more positive trend  Conditions are slowly improving though the degree to which this is   happening varies     On the national scene there are many more signs of a solidly growing economy  Clearly   the 82 percent pace of growth in the third quarter won’t be repeated if only because consumers   won’t find their pockets lined as greatly with tax cuts and child tax credits again  It does seem   now that, while consumer spending is ebbing a bit, the business sector is picking up  New orders   data, a surge in corporate profits, and continuing favorable financial market conditions all   suggest that business spending will continue on the upward growth path seen in the second and   third quarters  In this context I was a bit dismayed by the November jobs data  It seemed clear   that the benefits of the recent productivity surge—that is, high real incomes for those people who   are working and low price pressures—are likely to remain fixtures on the landscape for a while    But I do think the caution that has characterized labor markets recently is ebbing  Businesses   have begun the hiring process  We’ve seen that over the last three or four months, and I think   it’s likely that process will accelerate and create a sustainable growth pattern for 2004     Outside the United States, prospects for growth have picked up as well  Most of the   world’s economies registered an uptick in growth in the third quarter, and monetary and financial   conditions in the big three developed areas—the United States, the euro area, and Japan—are   December 9, 2003 54 of 133    stimulative as we head into 2004  There are geopolitical risks, but the world overall seems to be   dealing with the uncertainties they present in ways that less and less affect the growth process     I continue to find the Greenbook’s estimates of growth in the 4s and 5s for this year and   next and into 2005 with declining inflation rather optimistic  Our calculations in Boston suggest   a more moderate path  But I have to admit to a great deal of uncertainty about any particular   forecast  It’s clear that activity is growing solidly, but given the slow pace at which the output   gap is likely to close in almost any scenario, price pressures are low and may remain so  But   there are sizable risks around that  I am less concerned than I ever was, and that was not much,   about a period of truly harmful deflation  The risks around the inflation forecast appear   balanced, as several others have mentioned  On the other hand, there are some upside risks to   what could be an overly sanguine view of the inflation process if stronger growth than projected   in the Greenbook actually occurs  In that regard, I found the policy tightening embedded in the   Greenbook comforting  I think we may need to begin taking rates to a more neutral place faster   than is expected in the Greenbook  For now I continue to believe that we have some time to wait   and that policy may continue on an even keel for a time  But what we say about it has become   more of a concern  I expect we’ll talk about that a little later  "
5186,2003-12-09,"  At the end of the earlier discussion I was going to say that the policy   decision continues to be a “no-brainer” but that what we say about policy has become a   headache  I’m not sure about the no-brainer part anymore, but I am sure about the headache!  I   agree with you that we don’t want to move policy now  I think the uptick in the economy is just   beginning to be sustainable on its own without an excessive amount of policy stimulus, and I’d   like to see that play out  Whatever we do in the future, I agree with President Guynn that, when   we do decide to move, the risks inherent in raising rates in large steps early on are quite sizable    So I think we ought to be willing to begin earlier in order to move the funds rate up slowly when   we do begin to tighten     When one thinks of the number of what might be called “moving parts” we now are   dealing with in our statement, as discussed in Brian’s presentation and in the Bluebook, the   complexity is really quite stunning  We’re not looking at a 2 by 2 matrix  There are some extra   dimensions of this that are beyond my capability to describe correctly in mathematical terms  As   far as I can tell, something like six or seven moving parts are involved  They include what we   did, why we did it, where the risks are on growth, what we mean by sustainable growth, what the   December 9, 2003 93 of 133    risks are on inflation, the balance of the risks, and now the “considerable period” language    There can be a number of variations on those six or seven moving parts, and that profusion is   multiplying and increasing the headache associated with how to talk about our policy decision     I agree with the thrust of your recommendation, Mr Chairman, which is to reduce the   number of moving parts  I’m not sure I would have started with the references to the balance of   risks  My preference as a place to start would be with the “considerable period” sentence—by   modifying it or even taking it out  As a central banker I am growing more and more concerned   that we’re in a very difficult place with that language  President Geithner’s remarks on the   credibility within financial markets at a time of a declining value of the dollar and other   developments suggest to me that we should start to look a bit more conservative than we have   been—even recognizing that the evidence points to a wide output gap  That said, I am happy   you are willing to start modifying this language and reduce the number of moving parts  I think   the steps toward modifying it could be taken faster than you’ve outlined, but I am willing to go   along with your proposal at this time  "
5232,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dino, I was intrigued by your thoughts   regarding the beginning of a risk-reduction phase  How strongly do you feel about that?  I may   be slightly behind the curve in terms of the way market participants are looking at this; but from   people in the investment business around Boston, I seem to be getting more comments about the   amount of risk that is out there     Right       Thank you  "
5233,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  New England mirrors the nation in that it   seems to be experiencing both rising growth and a continued soft labor market  Positive reports   from businesses large and small, rising sales and profits, gradually improving state budget   pictures, and business and consumer optimism all are at odds with the employment situation    Massachusetts seems particularly hard hit on the employment side  Reflecting this, there are   increasing calls for legislation to prevent outsourcing—or offshoring or whatever one wants to   call it—or at a minimum to prevent the state government from dealing with companies who   locate jobs in other countries  One hopes calmer heads will prevail on this   On the labor market side, recently released employment benchmark revisions suggest that   employment losses in 2003 were greater than previously thought, especially in Massachusetts    However, the new data also suggest that most recently the pace of job loss may have moderated a   bit; while still declining, it may be falling by a lesser amount  Massachusetts has had the   sharpest percentage drop in employment of any state during the recovery, and employment levels   now are more than 6 percent below their pre-recession peak  The other New England states have   fared less poorly, and some have done even better than the nation as a whole; but only one state,   Rhode Island, has recouped to the point where employment is at its level prior to the recession    At the same time, businesses report that some skills are extremely hard to find, including at the   March 16, 2004 30 of 107    low end for hospitality jobs and at the high end for certain types of software support and for   positions in health care and biotech   New England’s rate of inflation, as measured by the Boston CPI, is rising much faster   than the nation’s, largely because of a 63 percent increase in shelter costs versus a year ago    The high price of housing worries many in the region who find that hiring the skilled workers   they need in health care, for example, is made even more difficult by high housing costs   Moving away from the employment picture, the District’s situation seems a lot brighter    Beige Book contacts were considerably more upbeat about current sales and profit margins    Manufacturers say the recovery has taken hold, while retailers expect steady growth over the   next six to twelve months  The Bank’s Small Business Advisory Council members also were   generally upbeat at their recent meeting  Across a wide group of industries—from metal casting   and stamping to home products, hospitality, and software development—most firms reported   increasing revenues in 2004, rising net income, and plans both to increase capital spending and   even to hire new staff  Many of these firms commented on the intense competition in their   industries and on their current or planned investments in Mexico or China to improve their cost   pictures and to meet foreign demand, particularly in the Chinese economy   High-tech firms are reporting solid levels of growth, especially in security software,   storage, and hardware  Boston area software job postings are up 16 percent from a year ago as   compared with a reported 8 percent increase in the Silicon Valley  And the software industry   group sees labor market tightening, particularly for certain jobs  These businesses all   commented on rising insurance costs, and some pointed to the rising cost of nickel, cobalt, and   steel scrap as limiting their potential profit growth but not causing prices of final goods to   escalate  Apparently concerns about a lack of pricing power remain   March 16, 2004 31 of 107    Our Bank’s directors also noted an improving situation, though one that remains uneven    On the weak side are businesses that serve commercial real estate, which report declining sales   and jobs  On the positive side, manufacturers of trucks and semiconductors are quite optimistic    In the latter case, businesses both locally and nationally are expanding solidly, with book-to-  build ratios growing and some shortages building  Manufactured exports in the region were up   sharply for the last quarter of 2003  Business confidence has brightened, and even the   commercial real estate markets have shown a little stabilization or improvement  In short, New   England is growing, and all would be well if only the job picture were a bit brighter   On the national scene, the puzzle about the slow rate of growth in employment continues   Incoming data on business spending are positive for the most part  Corporate earnings are   strong, credit quality has improved, and businesses have increased borrowing in early 2004,   presumably to add to inventories  So, why aren’t firms hiring?  We’ve said all along that the   recovery would be sustainable when businesses began to spend again, under the assumption that   hiring would resume as well  The business spending part has happened  The big question is   whether the consumer might falter before the second part, increased hiring, begins in earnest     Our projections, like those of the Greenbook, suggest that the answer to when labor   markets will improve is “sometime soon”  [Laughter]  Thus we agree with the overall trajectory   of the Greenbook forecast, with GDP growth in the 4½ to 5 percent range in the first half of this   year, assisted by continued fiscal and monetary policy accommodation  The impetus of fiscal   stimulus eases in the second half of this year and in 2005, but private-sector demand takes over    We’re a little less optimistic about the second half of this year than the Greenbook, but by 2005   our forecasts converge nicely, with GDP growth around 3 to 4 percent, the unemployment rate in   March 16, 2004 32 of 107    the low 5s, and inflation stable or slightly rising  It’s not a bad picture  However, I wish I had   some way of pinning down that “sometime soon” forecast for employment growth     One hears anecdotes from all sides about the unwillingness of businesses to hire   additional workers until doing so is absolutely necessary  In that regard, I read with some   interest the article—I think it was in Monday’s Wall Street Journal—about the surveys that ask   about hiring intentions  Apparently responses to such surveys may be based more than usual on   good intentions rather than firm plans  I don’t know whether those surveys are really good   predictors of future employment growth, but I would say that they are a source of some of the   optimism about employment growth occurring soon    In our pre-FOMC briefing at the Bank, one of the economists noted that something has to   give That is, the current situation of high productivity, strong demand, and zero job growth just   doesn’t seem sustainable  On the downside, if productivity growth continues to increase as it   has, employment could languish further—even if demand is relatively good—and inflation could   trend downward as well  This could happen, too, if consumers become disheartened by the job   scene and stop buying houses and cars regardless of the low interest rates  Demand would falter   despite solid productivity growth, and the output gap would widen   On the upside, business uncertainty could well dissipate faster than we expect    Employment growth could come faster or be stronger than either our forecast or the Greenbook   expects, pushing productivity down in the short run and pushing wages up, particularly for   workers with hard-to-find skills  Prices of oil, certain metals, steel scrap, and other commodities   have risen  The dollar seems bound to depreciate a bit further  And health insurance costs   continue to accelerate  As one contact put it, the cost of all the “nice to have” things continues to   drop while the cost of things people really need— like houses, health care, and education—keeps   March 16, 2004 33 of 107    rising  I recognize that this is not how our measures of price trends capture what is happening,   but it may say something about both the popularity of Treasury inflation-protected securities and   the resiliency of inflationary expectations   I also remain concerned that the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy   and the assurance that markets seem to have that we are on hold has increased leverage across all   markets  When rates return to a more neutral place, as they ultimately will, this could create a   burst of financial instability  Contacts tell me, as I noted before, that market participants are   reaching out the risk curve for returns in this low interest rate environment  It’s understandable   that the risks that are being taken make these contacts increasingly nervous  In an environment   of excess capacity, these concerns don’t suggest to me that we should change policy in short   order  But as I balance the risks of slower-than-expected growth against the risks of faster   growth, rising costs, and financial instability, I am more concerned about the upside  My view is   that maintaining a policy with interest rates too low for too long is in the end a bigger concern   than the possibility of a widening output gap  To be sure, we have the tools to deal with either   case  But I think the costs to us in terms of credibility would be greater if the situation got out of   hand on the upside  Thus, assuming that the economy continues on track as projected, I think we   need to begin to reflect in our statements a willingness to move the funds rate up  Then at some   point after that, I hope we can begin a gradual move to more neutral territory  Thank you  "
5234,2004-03-16,"  I just want to clarify that I was not advocating that we move rates at   this meeting or even at the next meeting  But I do think there are developments that we ought to   keep in the back of our minds as we consider the stance of policy  Clearly, there continues to be   an output gap  And clearly, the incoming information suggests that economic activity has been   less strong than it was earlier, though it continues to be strong  And like everybody else, I don’t   know why the pace of hiring has been as slow as it has been or whether it will get slower or   speed up more quickly than we expect   I could go along with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, but I fall more into President   Poole’s camp, and to some extent I agree with what Ned just said  I’d rather say that the   probability of a rise in inflation is about equal to that of an unwelcome decline—use the phrasing   in alternative C—because to me that more closely describes what the markets and others are   seeing  I think it also conveys a very slight edging up in our concern—not a promise of a move   the next time or the time after that or even the time after that—about how long interest rates have   been as low as they are  So, on the margin, I would come down with President Poole on this one  "
5286,2004-05-04,  So moved     So moved  
5287,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Things continue to improve in New England    In particular, comments from manufacturers were more upbeat than we’ve seen in a long time    Though business confidence in Massachusetts is slightly off previous highs, recent surveys indicate   particularly positive assessments of national business conditions  Consumer confidence is well   above its level a year ago—a bit bouncy but well above  Retail contacts report improving sales, and   residential real estate markets remain strong   You may have noticed that I have not added the caveat about job growth that has become   standard in discussions of the recovery in New England  Labor markets have in fact improved—   not wildly, to be sure, but they are beginning to look up  This marks a real change even from our   last meeting  Data for the region indicate that nonfarm employment rose in March, only the fifth   monthly increase in the last three years  The increase was small and the year-over-year trend   remains negative, but anecdotes suggest that it’s not a fluke  Similarly, the unemployment rate for   the region moved down slightly and now is below 5 percent  Beige Book contacts are more likely   to say that they’re hiring, particularly in manufacturing and related services  One of the Bank’s   tenants, a large intellectual property law firm, reported a jump in patent work in the biotech and   computer services areas as well as an increase in legal work related to patent litigation  They’ve   taken more space in our building and are adding to staff  Small businesses report increasing activity   even in firms associated with commercial real estate  And after the extremely cold winter, contacts   May 4, 2004 31 of 112       in tourism and hospitality report expanding business and some new hiring  Thus, economic activity   clearly seems to be on the uptick   Prices are on the uptick as well  Almost all Beige Book contacts reported concerns about   rising costs for metals, wood, plastic, rubber, fuel and other petroleum products as well as rising   health care and other insurance costs  Concerns about pricing power remain, but some firms do   seem to believe that cost increases can be passed on  Planned salary increases are moderate, at   3 percent or so, and capital spending is increasing but also at a moderate pace   One thing I found really surprising—and I read through all the notes from our calls with   individual contacts—was the number of times that the upcoming presidential election was   mentioned as a concern regarding the economic future  A lot of people out there seem to believe   that the economy is being pumped up to be primed for October but then will slide after the election    I’m sure that’s not the intent of any of us, but I think it probably does reflect some concerns related   to the sustainability of the recovery   In that regard the national data received since our last meeting have been particularly   encouraging  While one month’s report on employment is not a complete panacea to the labor   market softness, the numbers are clearly moving in the right direction  To be sure unemployment   insurance claims are moving sideways, and hours worked still have a way to go, but all the surveys   that Dave talked about in his presentation suggest that firms expect to pick up their hiring rates    Combine this with rising personal income and expenditures, rising retail sales, a strong housing   market, and solid consumer confidence, and continued strength in consumption seems assured, at   least over the near to medium term  Business strength is evident as well  Strong profit growth and   reasonably accommodative financial markets have led to rising capital goods orders and double-  digit growth in investment spending  Despite the increasing value of the dollar, trade seems to have   May 4, 2004 32 of 112       been only a small drag on economic activity in the first quarter, reflecting stronger growth in many   countries around the world     Does all of this good news answer the question about how sustainable the recovery will be,   especially after the dose of fiscal stimulus during the first half of this year wears off?  In that regard,   our forecast in Boston is a bit less optimistic than the Greenbook’s for the second half of ’04, but the   basic trajectory of the data—solid growth, stronger labor markets, a slowly declining output gap,   and flattening price increases—is the same  Our bet as well as the Greenbook’s is that the economy   will generate enough steam on its own to realize, after what has happened over the past three years,   a very favorable trend   So if we think the recovery is sustainable, the next question is what the stance of policy   should be  I realize that there are a couple of ways to look at this question  Looking at employment   and inflation trends against what might be accomplished in this high-performance economy, the   Greenbook, Boston, and other analysts see an output gap that lasts into 2005  That suggests that   caution is warranted before moving rates up, though I agree with a lot of the comments around the   table that we have to be really humble about our ability to know either the size of the current output   gap or how fast it might close, given the strength that we see going into the rest of this year     There is another gap as well, the gap between a funds rate at 1 percent and even our lowest   guess of a neutral funds rate  I think that gap is something like 150 basis points  Again, it’s hard to   know how to measure “neutral,” and we have to be humble about our ability to do that  But even   with a great deal of humility we know we’re pretty far away from neutral now  Market risk-taking   in an environment of very accommodative policy, combined with what likely is a bottoming out—  or probably a turning up at least in the near term—of the path for inflation, seems to me to argue   that we ought to start closing the interest rate gap fairly soon  We might need an additional couple   May 4, 2004 33 of 112       of data points to be sure the recovery is sustainable, and we surely need to take a look at the   language in our press statement this time around  But my view is that we ought to be thinking about   moving sooner rather than later    "
5288,2004-05-04,"  We’re beating to death the issue that I want to raise here, so it’s probably   not helpful for me to raise it again  We are debating the term “measured”  If we take the phrase   that includes “measured” out of sentence 8, we’re left with a statement that says we think the policy   accommodation can be removed  That raises the question  Well, if that’s what you think, why   didn’t you do it?  So we’d have to take out the whole sentence if we want to get rid of “patience”   and “measured” altogether  But I’m not sure what the market reaction would be to something like   alternative B without sentence 8—without any statement whatsoever that reflects, as we’ve been   May 4, 2004 79 of 112       doing all along, some sense of bias in our policy intentions  As much as I am in agreement with the   view that putting yet another phrase into our quiver will perhaps raise all kinds of consternation   about what we mean by it, I think we’re left with a hard choice here  So given that hard choice, I   think maybe “measured” has to stay     I support your recommendation  I think we may need to move sooner   than the markets now expect  But that is going to depend largely on the strength of the incoming   data, even in the next week  So I look forward to seeing what is in store for us   I very much agree with what Don just said  I think if we left out sentence 8, we would be   sending the wrong message  We actually could be sending the wrong message in another way  We   May 4, 2004 92 of 112       could be interpreted as saying that everything is hunky-dory and that we don’t have plans to remove   the policy accommodation  That could be read as the message in the statement that the risks to the   outlook are balanced, whereas sentence 8 does say positively that, all other things being equal,   we’re going to take the policy accommodation away  We plan to do it in a measured way, but we’re   going to do it  I think that’s an important follow-up to your testimony as well  Whatever way we   look at it, I think we’re stuck with sentence 8  We’re probably going to take grief from some   quarters for this new language, but I think we’re stuck with doing this  So I agree with your   recommendation  "
5337,2004-08-10,  So moved   
5338,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  New England seems to be experiencing what   we hope is the same summer lull as the rest of the country  The job market didn’t improve from   May to June, and some companies—most notably in the technology and consumer product   sectors—saw weaker demand than expected  As one director put it, “technology spending stopped   to take a breath in June and July”  Still, overall the regional economy continues to expand and in   many areas, such as heavy equipment, paper and packaging, and medical products, growth remains   strong  Consumer and business confidence remain at high levels, and coincident indicators of   economic activity remain positive  High energy prices, expectations of higher interest rates, not to   August 10, 2004 36 of 103          mention the security surrounding the Democratic National Convention, certainly took a bite out of   local demand, but we think it is a temporary one  So far, no one expects that bite out of demand to   derail what continues to appear to be a self-sustaining recovery   Similarly, incoming data on the national economy have been soft lately, especially when   compared with the growth rates needed to eat into excess capacity in a significant way over the next   year to year and a half  Indeed, the baseline Greenbook forecast, and ours in Boston as well, sees   excess capacity remaining at the end of 2005, and this was expected prior to the surprise in the   employment data of last Friday and the latest revision of the Greenbook  Despite the relative   softness, at least compared with forecasts, the absolute state of the economy doesn’t seem that bad    Housing markets are still strong  Indeed, as the Greenbook points out, recent readings on business   spending and profits remain positive—not ebullient, to be sure, but solid  In particular, I, too, find   the increase in spending on nonresidential structures and the recent implied increases in   manufacturing activity and manufacturing employment interesting  It is too early to draw a   conclusion on this, I suppose, but it may be that businesses took the June falloff in consumption   with a grain of salt in July  Perhaps they aren’t hiring until things become clearer, but they may also   be relatively comfortable in spending as they and the rest of us continue to believe that this lull in   activity will be short lived   In that regard, outside of the payroll jobs data, the consumer does seem well equipped to   continue spending  Readings on overall confidence are good, employment claims are down, hours   worked are up a little, layoffs are down, and surveys both of consumer attitudes toward the labor   market and of business hiring plans are positive  In addition, for whatever reason, jobs as measured   by the household survey have surged lately, and the unemployment rate recently dropped a bit  It is   hard to know exactly how to figure in the household survey or what to make of it  It may, in fact, be   August 10, 2004 37 of 103          noise  As Dave suggested, one of the reasons for not knowing how to interpret the latest report is   that it may be noise, but my interpretation is that at least this is positive noise  [Laughter]     The big question going forward is whether the lull in activity, as most prominently   represented in the payroll employment picture and data on June consumption, will be transient or   whether it portends a much slower pace of economic growth going forward  Higher oil and   gasoline prices, higher steel and copper costs, the rising cost of health care, and required   contributions to underfunded retirement plans probably have been the proximate causes of the   decline in consumption and the moderation in wage growth and in business spending  Some of   these factors have begun to ease off  Certainly, the three-month rates of annual change in overall   measures of inflation, whether for the CPI or PCE, have subsided from their first-quarter surge    Core measures have also pulled back to a pace of less than 2 percent—plus or minus depending on   the series one is looking at     Strong global demand and geopolitical uncertainty in Russia and the Middle East have   driven up oil and other commodity costs, especially metals  And oil prices seem more likely than   not to stay high  But productivity growth remains solid, business profits are healthy, and markups   are higher than trend  Fiscal policy remains stimulative, and monetary policy accommodation is   significant as well  So it is not a bad bet that growth at a pace of 3½ percent or better will resume   and that inflation pressures will continue to ebb  It’s the bet the Greenbook is making, and it’s the   bet we are making in Boston as well, though I should say that our GDP forecast, particularly as it   relates to consumption in the near term, is a bit less optimistic than the Greenbook’s  There are   risks to that forecast, to be sure, but I still tend to see the risks as relatively balanced     Is the current level of policy accommodation correct for a US economy growing at trend,   give or take a bit?  As I noted earlier, both the Greenbook and our Boston forecast expect excess   August 10, 2004 38 of 103          capacity to remain by the end of 2005, and if anything, the anticipated level of excess capacity has   gotten larger since our last meeting  But a great deal of uncertainty surrounds that calculation    Relatively less uncertainty surrounds the current stance of policy  Real federal funds rates are   negative and will remain so even if we make a move of 25 basis points today  Highly   accommodative policy was appropriate as we faced the recession and the low probability event of   serious deflation  In my view, such accommodation is no longer appropriate for the US economy   even as it experiences what I assume is a hiccup on an otherwise solid growth path Thus, I believe   that, absent signs of a major prolonged slowdown, we should continue to adjust policy gradually   upward  I’m not sure where we need to pause along the way or even whether such a pause might be   helpful, but I don’t think that’s the question at this meeting  "
5339,2004-08-10,"  I certainly agree that your proposal is the right thing to do at this time  I   like your concept of “opportunistic disaccommodation”  I don’t know exactly what it means, but I   like that concept!  We are in a position to move now, and a move today will be well understood    It’s well priced into the market  It won’t have a big market effect, and it takes us in the direction we   want to go  You mentioned toward the end of your remarks “going to neutral,” wherever that might   be  That’s a really interesting question right now  Where is neutral?  I find the chart in the   Bluebook, with the wiggly shaded area that goes up and down again on the estimated ranges of   equilibrium rates of interest, somewhat of a puzzle  I know I need to think about that more, but it   doesn’t affect how I feel about the policy decision today  I think a ¼ point increase in the funds rate   target is the right thing to do   I don’t know what to do about the statement  I have some sympathy for trying to get out of   giving the market too much confidence about what we’re doing  You seemed to reflect a bit of   concern about that in your questions earlier  I’m worried about that because I think we need to look   at the data as they come in and we need to have some flexibility in how we assess conditions   moving forward  I worry about the market continually believing that it knows exactly how we’re   going to act  But at this stage of the game, maybe it’s okay that the market knows what to expect in   terms of our policy  So I guess I’d go with your recommendations on the alternative B formulation    I certainly hope that we can get ourselves to a situation in which Vincent’s recommended language,   or something like it, is where we end our statements  I’d prefer to leave people hanging a little as   August 10, 2004 78 of 103          we go forward and not be quite so confident about what we’re going to do  But for now this   approach is good  "
5387,2004-09-21," So moved      I’m totally confused here  I thought the volatility came about as a   result of Dino’s implementing the existing directive of the Federal Open Market Committee  I   would not like to see him implement anything other than that until the Committee meets and   adopts a new directive  Maybe I’m misunderstanding you  I must be     Correct  It hasn’t     Yes  I tend to think of it as two forces at work; there’s the market and   then there’s Dino  Dino is trying to do what we told him to do, and the market is trying to do   what it wants to do  I agree with you that there may be some way to look at an average target   over a period of days  I just thought you were saying that he—      I’m not sure     Why not?      When is this?  Today?  "
5388,2004-09-21,"  I have many of the same questions  Let me just raise a couple of   issues The first is on the investment income swing that shows up in the capital account  I don’t   profess to be anywhere near an expert on this, but I had always thought that those numbers are   typically positive because we generally make more money abroad than foreigners make here    Does that swing from time to time, and is this just a normal swing, or is this telling us something   significant?     I have just one other question  For many countries around the world, a   lot of their growth ends up being export oriented and we’re the big importer  So there is a kind   of codependence between us and the rest of the world as regards the value of the dollar  The   numbers get awful, but how does that codependence unwind?     We’ve raised an issue of very outsized numbers and the potential for   financial instability  But there seems little we can do here in this country on the monetary policy   side—possibly a lot we could do on the fiscal policy side but not on the monetary policy side      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The New England economy is in a growth   mode, but the pace of that growth is a bit subdued  Employment levels for the region as a whole   are now above those of a year ago  It’s the first time in the last two or three years that that has   been the case  Most industries and states have added jobs over the last year, and we have even   had some positive recent reports on manufacturing employment  We think that reflects the   strong growth that has occurred in merchandise exports—probably in response to the decline in   September 21, 2004 43 of 100          the dollar, however small it has been, that has already occurred  The tourism industry appears to   have done fairly well this summer, though cool weather affected both the Maine coastal region   and Cape Cod  Finally, commercial real estate markets remain flat in terms of vacancy and   rental rates  This hasn’t affected prices on premier office buildings, however, which remain in   the stratosphere, according to one contact   Discussions with our Bank’s board of directors and a group of the region’s small   businesses revealed considerable variation  Most of our directors, whether they were bankers or   industrialists, focused on the recent slowdown with concern  Their collective level of caution is   higher now than earlier  The smaller businesses on our advisory council, however, mostly had   more business than they could handle and complained of shortages of technical staff, high   benefit costs, and rising prices for energy, steel, rare metals and alloys, plastics, and paper   products  Similarly, discussions with temporary-help firms suggest a good deal of regional   strength, but readings of business confidence overall have been lumpy  Business confidence is   better than last year but reflects a great deal of uncertainty and some concerns about rising costs    Clearly, some businesses and industries are doing quite well, especially smaller firms and those   with military and export markets; others are more cautious and defensive in outlook  And   uncertainty about geopolitical events, terrorism, and the upcoming election continues to be a   factor   Turning to the nation, incoming data have been mixed as well  We in Boston have had   for some time a take on overall growth that is a little less optimistic than the Greenbook, and we   now find that our two forecasts are just about identical  So I can’t find much to object to  Both   forecasts depend greatly on a rate of employment growth that remains, at this point, more a hope   than a reality  And we see this as an important source of downside risk     September 21, 2004 44 of 100          As I think about policy at this point, I find myself in a bit of an internal argument  On the   one hand, as Part 2 of the Greenbook makes very clear—as did Dave at the beginning of his   comments—the expansion has regained some vigor  There is continued labor market slack, to be   sure, but it’s also not clear where things such as the labor force participation rate and the   employment–population ratio ought to settle after the employment boom years of the late ’90s   Productivity growth continues to be relatively strong, and industrial production has picked up   except for high-tech goods  And in some areas such as truck and rail shipping, as well as   primary processing industries, capacity is in short supply  Consumers seem ready to spend on   autos and houses, and they’re willing to take saving rates to record lows in the wake of   substantial appreciation in housing prices  Clearly, this could turn around and is a potential   source of downside risk   Businesses have probably added enough to inventories to hold them for a while  They   are likely to purchase non-high-tech equipment at a faster pace over the rest of the year to get in   under the wire of the investment tax credit change of next year, and that will borrow some   strength from 2005  But overall the underlying fundamentals don’t suggest a complete washout   in business spending in 2005—not by a long shot  So the economy seems poised to grow over   the coming quarters at 3½ percent or better according to almost all forecasts, with unemployment   in the low to mid-5s and negligible inflation  Not a bad outcome at all   Clearly, there are some challenges  I think the fiscal deficit poses a problem, and we’ve   talked about the external deficit as well  But in this context, I ask myself, Is this an economy   that still needs negative real fed funds rates as a stimulus?  Or do such rates have the potential to   cause real problems for both inflation and financial stability?  The answer to the latter question   may be “not any time soon,” but we may now have an opportunity to avoid those problems at   September 21, 2004 45 of 100          little cost  So that’s one side of my internal argument  The other side takes into account how far   we are in terms of economic growth from where we could, and maybe should, be  Every forecast   I know of, the Greenbook included, has significantly written down growth for the last half of this   year and for 2005  Estimates of excess capacity, whether that is measured in output or by   employment, have been raised a bit over the summer  And now the Greenbook expects that such   gaps will not close until later in the forecast time period—mid-2006—with less tightening than   that expected by the markets    Inflation has fallen off a bit in the first half and seems likely to stay low absent a major   acceleration in oil prices, which likely would have more of an effect on growth than inflation   With the fiscal stimulus from the partial-expensing tax provisions removed next year and with   profit growth moderating, the forecast seems to hinge primarily on levels of employment growth   that we just haven’t seen yet   I usually conclude this part of my internal argument with this question  Aside from the   fact that we’ve just about told the markets that we’re going to increase rates by 25 basis points   today, why is that necessary?  In the end, I find myself continuing to come down on the side of   removing policy accommodation slowly, at least for now  I don’t think negative real rates are   consistent with an economy that is growing at the solid pace ours is  Real funds rates are   marginally negative, depending on how one calculates them, and will be less so, or even slightly   positive, after a 25 basis point move   As I said at the August meeting, I really don’t know where neutral is, and I think it would   be good to have a discussion about this whole concept of neutral at some point  But to quote   President Santomero from the last meeting, it is probably above where we are  I don’t think we   should go to neutral soon, but getting out of negative territory has appeal to me  Markets expect   September 21, 2004 46 of 100          a change today, and halting now could make things seem worse than they are  I must say,   though, that if the data don’t start to get better soon, especially as they relate to employment, I   think we should take the pause that the Greenbook anticipates  "
5389,2004-09-21,"  I see that you made a slight change in B5 where the proposed language   is “to be roughly equal” as opposed to “are roughly equal”       Okay  So that really is unchanged, so to speak, from the current   statement?  I was reading it and wondering, What am I reading here?     One never knows  Another change, which I had submitted as a   suggestion and I guess no one likes it but I’ll raise it anyway, is whether or not we want to make   B6 look more like A6 by referring to sustainable growth as well as maintaining price stability   Now, maybe I should leave that to the Chairman to recommend  That may be a subject for the   next part of the meeting     We would stop?     Okay  I sort of figured that, but I also thought that might not be a bad   thing  But, again, that’s a subject for our discussion a few minutes from now       I support your recommendation as to the policy change  I take your   point about the language of the statement  As I said in my comments—and other people have   mentioned it as well—the big unknown is how much employment is going to grow  I certainly   hope your predictions are on the mark  I’m rooting for us to be successful     Oh, yes  I’ll buy the Greenbook employment projections  "
5442,2004-11-10,  So moved     Other than good job?  
5443,2004-11-10,"  Two of the questions I had teed up to ask have been asked and answered    Let me just focus on one  The staff continues to have an assumption of less tightening in the fed   funds rate than is expected in the markets  I’m not sure if that has changed a lot since the   September meeting on either side  You are saying, I think, that with last Friday’s labor market   report in hand you would have raised the forecast in this month’s Greenbook a bit  I was   wondering if you would also suggest a different trajectory for the fed funds rate embedded in your   forecast    November 10, 2004 25 of 107      Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  The Red Sox win certainly   helped  [Laughter]  There’s no question about that  But after allowing for that, I would say that the   economy in New England is expanding even independently of the Red Sox  Employment is   growing or is at least stable versus a year ago in all six states, and the unemployment rate is down    Even measured rates of inflation in the District are trending down, and inflation is moderating more   in the Boston area than nationally  Consumer and business confidence have picked up and remain   higher than they were a year ago  Tourism in Boston has been very strong, though elsewhere in   New England it has been affected by cool and rainy weather  Residential real estate markets in all   November 10, 2004 31 of 107    major metropolitan areas continue to be strong, particularly for low to moderately priced homes,   and both manufacturing and retail contacts were for the most part upbeat and projected reasonable   to strong demand and revenue growth  Concerns and uncertainty remain, to be sure  And growth is   variable, with firms in the health care and defense areas growing more rapidly than others  But   overall the expansion does seem to have entered a period in which it is on relatively solid footing   During the period since our last meeting, we’ve been rather busy at the Boston Fed  We’ve   held four forums for local bankers and businessmen around the District; we’ve met with our   Academic Advisory Council as well as with a group from local software companies; we’ve had two   meetings of our directors in a relatively short period of time; and we’ve talked with our regular   Beige Book contacts and focused a lot of attention on local manufacturers and their concerns    Pulling the data from all these sources together, I wanted to touch on a few common themes that   were evident to us in this period of extensive outreach    In manufacturing particularly, but elsewhere as well, rising oil and natural gas prices and   rising prices for commodities such as copper, aluminum, and resin emerged as a concern  One   person in electrical and electronics manufacturing referred to an environment of—and I quote—  “hyperinflation,” noting that price increases could at times be passed on even to big box retailers    According to this source, rapidly rising input prices have made planning ahead quite difficult  This   contact was admittedly an outlier, but most manufacturers and retailers expressed concern about the   impact of higher oil prices on both demand and costs   Contacts continue to be cautious about hiring, even when expected growth and net revenue   gains are positive  They report seeing a new employee as an addition to “fixed costs,” given the   difficulty they had experienced in downsizing during the recession  And I would agree with   President Moskow about the impact of Sarbanes–Oxley  That is contributing to a lot more caution   on the part of businesses, particularly in the hiring arena and to some degree in the spending arena   November 10, 2004 32 of 107    as well  Moreover, depending on the business, finding new employees with the right technical   skills was seen to be both difficult and expensive  And most contacts also mentioned rising benefit   costs as a further deterrent to hiring   Plans for increased capital spending ranged from modest to relatively strong, with a   continued focus on reducing costs and improving productivity  Most contacts expect profit margins   to continue to be solid, especially in the biotech area  The region’s exporters have benefited   considerably from the slowly falling—less slowly than before—dollar  One paper and pulp   producer reported record overseas sales and the ability to make price increases stick in high-grade   products   High-tech contacts both in software and in manufacturing reported on what they saw as a   large inventory swing this year from which the industry was still in the process of emerging  In late   2003, very short supply chains and rapidly rising demand lengthened delivery times and prompted a   degree of over-ordering  When the semiconductor industry, in particular, caught up late in the first   quarter of 2004, inventories swelled and orders stopped, giving the impression of a large falloff in   demand  Our contacts described this as more of a supply chain phenomenon than a weakening of   underlying demand, which they at least believe remains not great but relatively solid   Finally, in many types of industries concerns were voiced about US immigration policy,   which has added to the problem of finding qualified labor even in low-value-added service   industries  For small software companies, restrictions on immigration combined with the   impending requirement to expense stock options even in a start-up, privately held company will   prove difficult as the talent needed will either choose to return to their native countries or never   come to this country at all  In sum, New England has had its challenges, to be sure  But overall,   economic activity in the District seems to be good—not great as yet, but gaining traction much like   in the rest of the country   November 10, 2004 33 of 107    On the national scene, data received prior to last week had been good but also not great    Obviously, consumption bounced back in the third quarter from depressed second-quarter levels    Housing investment had remained strong, and purchases of autos had continued to surge whenever   incentives were offered  However, new hiring had been slow, and both the Michigan and the   Conference Board indicators of consumer confidence had moved down, particularly in the area of   future expectations  Business investment was okay, particularly for non-high-tech goods, but some   of the strength was likely borrowed from next year, and as I noted before, businesses remained   cautious  Rising oil prices seemed poised to take a bite out of both consumer and business   spending and to damp foreign demand as well, though as yet such price increases have not had an   enduring effect on growth  And we continued to hit new highs in terms of the external deficit,   which has been a drag on economic growth and has contributed to a somewhat faster pace of dollar   depreciation   Last week things began to look a bit brighter  Whether you come from a red state or a blue   state, you have to be happy that the election is finally over  Results notwithstanding, that has to   take one element of uncertainty out of the mix  And of course, Friday’s employment news was very   welcome  Obviously one month, even with revisions to prior months, does not a trend make, but   the news of 337,000 new jobs surely brightened my outlook  Our forecast in Boston is pretty close   to that of the Greenbook, and we had made it prior to Friday based on the hope, not the reality, of   better employment data in the short run  Now that forecast seems, at least for the present, to have   fewer downside risks, and I’m beginning to think about whether we might find ourselves wanting to   move a bit faster toward that elusive neutral stance of policy  But that is certainly a discussion for   another meeting  For now, matching market expectations seems the sensible thing to do  Thank   you  "
5444,2004-11-10,"  I just had a quick question  Have we given some thought to whether by   being clearer about what we expect to do in the future we are, in effect, getting information back   from the market that is what we told them, as opposed to what the market’s own expectations are?    November 10, 2004 73 of 107    Do we know what the market thinks with regard to the need, in this case, for an increase in interest   rates?  Or are we involved in a self-fulfilling situation here where we are clear and, therefore, the   market says, “The Fed is saying this, so we’re going to give them back the same information they’re   giving us,” without a lot of added market intelligence?     Thank you very much  I’m in strong agreement with what you have   proposed, Mr Chairman, both the move of 25 basis points and the selection of the language that   does not attempt to signal anything for December  I understand the logic in the Greenbook  We in   Boston have the same kind of perspective about the future  So I realize that there is an   identifiable—maybe even baseline—probability that even with a relatively flat fed funds rate over   the next year or so, we’ll still have an output gap  I recognize all that economic logic  But my basic   instinct says that we need to get out of the zero zone on the real fed funds rate and to a positive rate   for any number of reasons, which you’ve done a better job of touching on than I ever could   I also would like to say that I think our use of language over the last year or so was   prompted by a set of extraordinary circumstances  Whether one views those circumstances as   related to the extraordinary productivity performance or to the unusual market volatility when   deflation concerns were very prominent, we needed to do something to calm things down  We did   calm things down for a good period of time  I really feel that in our communication we now need   to move back to something that says what we did, why we did it, maybe gives some perspective on   November 10, 2004 81 of 107    the balance of risks, and leaves it at that  Whether we move there in December or in February—or   in March, April, or May of next year—I don’t care, but I’d like us to move there  To be explicit, I’d   get rid of paragraph 6  Thank you  "
5500,2004-12-14,"  With the possible exception of these positions vis-à-vis the dollar, there   seem to be a remarkable number of indications—spreads are narrower, the yield curve is flatter, and   so forth—that suggest that market participants see less risk  Yet the risks seem to be out there  We   hear people talking about that all the time  Some of this betting against the dollar reflects the   international risks having to do with the size of our deficit and the way the currency markets are   going  There is a potential for markets to get upset about fiscal deficits going forward  There seem   to be a lot of risks out there, but we don’t see it in the curves much  Do people talk about that at all?     Yes  A couple of people I talked to in the investment world characterized   the situation as a sort of tight equilibrium that was balanced off against risk on both sides  They   approach it with a sense of unease because they view it as not necessarily stable     I think the experiment to date has been a very good one  It has produced   a much higher quality initial product because it’s written closer to the time of the meeting    Personally, I have had no problem keeping with the tight schedule, despite a couple of late   comments on my part, and I want to congratulate the staff on the work they’ve done to make the   process more efficient  I think we really have—no matter what we do with it—a higher quality   product for both the transcript and the minutes as a result  So I would continue doing what we’re   doing, no matter what decision comes out of this discussion today   On the issue of early release, I think we’ve been conducting this experiment in the best of   times, as President Poole mentioned  Our statement has provided what the market has seen as near-  term assurance; absent really off-the-chart data, market participants have some sense that policy will   continue in a particular direction  So, in that regard, releasing the minutes early in this environment   probably wouldn’t have had a whole lot of effect  They would generally have confirmed what the   market knew already   Now, I’d always looked at releasing the minutes early as kind of a quid pro quo for taking   out of the statement the wording that we’ve had in there for the best part of the last year or so   orienting the market toward the gradual nature of our doing what we’re going to do  As I think back   over my years on the Committee, when we started to mention the tilt and then the measured pace   and gradual nature of removing policy accommodation, it was basically to give the markets a sense   of some conditioning around our actions   December 14, 2004 84 of 118           I have felt that, if we release the minutes early, the markets will get their conditioning from   the minutes; they wouldn’t need it in the statement released after the meeting  We wouldn’t have to   try to figure out all the delicate wording that’s a shorthand way of trying to tell the market more than   we need to tell them  I think the recent past has been a period of time when we’ve needed to tell the   market something about our expected policy path, but going forward that need is not likely to be so   great  The future direction of policy won’t be so clear to us  And the market, in fact, ought to be   arriving at its own thoughts about the direction of policy and taking out insurance in case it is wrong   rather than looking to particular statements of ours for the reasons to go in a certain direction    So I view the two communications as a package  I thought we’d take a lot of the forward-  looking commentary out of the statement—the “measured pace” language, certainly—in return for   releasing the minutes earlier  That could have some good effects; Don has gone into them  It could   have some bad effects  There could be a timing issue where we end up releasing the minutes when   something else is going on and we’d have two additional points of noise  But I thought of this as a   package  So I’m finding it hard to think about releasing the minutes with the continuation of the   “measured pace” language in the statement  I’d rather change the two things at the same time    In that regard, if it’s going to take us a while to decide how to change the statement, I would   continue the experiment on the minutes and keep asking ourselves the question that President Poole   mentioned, both for now and in the past  Are there reasons that expediting the release of the   minutes has more of a downside risk than we now appreciate?  So I’d be in favor of the middle road   here  I recognize that it’s a difficult decision to make, and I wouldn’t make it now  I’d make it   when we’re ready to change the statement, which I hope we’ll be able to do sooner rather than later    And in the interim, I’d continue the experiment     Could I just say something?  We are really discussing two things here    One is the issue of members versus nonmembers—I would use the terms voting members and other   members, but be that as it may—and whether you discuss all of their perspectives in the last part of   the minutes on the policy discussion  Then there’s the other question, which relates to the change   that Vincent and Debbie proposed, about whether to call certain people “other participants” in the   first part of the discussion  I think that’s pushing it a bit  I don’t mind, if I’m not a voting member,   not having my views included in the comments on policy  That doesn’t bother me  But to draw a   distinction between members and other participants in—   December 14, 2004 91 of 118             That’s exactly what I am suggesting to you to do     Right       Are you using “members” in that different way now?     Yes, right  Why not call them voting members as opposed to members?   December 14, 2004 92 of 118             That works     You’re a member, right  Okay     Exactly   December 14, 2004 99 of 118             May I suggest one possible benefit of waiting?       You can all shout it down, but it occurs to me that one possible benefit is   to give people who follow our every word—and there are many people around who do—a longer   period of time to get used to the idea and to read the minutes of some previous meetings in the   context of what was going on at the time  They could calm themselves down in time to get the   February minutes three weeks after the meeting     All right  I’m willing to be shouted down on that  But that’s the only   reason I can think of for waiting   December 14, 2004 101 of 118             We can expect to be asked if we are one of the “few” or one of the   “many”  "
5501,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  New England’s economy continues to   improve at a reasonable pace  Employment is growing, and all states report job levels above those   of a year ago  Unemployment dropped sharply in the region in September and maintained a rate   about 1 percentage point below that of the nation in October as well, so it wasn’t just a fluke   Despite this, concerns remain, as reflected in a new softening in consumer and business confidence    Major industry groups, in particular manufacturing and information services, continue to lose jobs   compared with a year ago  Financial activities posted a small loss as well, and the large   professional and business services sector was flat, in major contrast to the picture nationally  The   region seems to be buffeted by the ups and downs in IT spending on both equipment and software   and the impact of continued consolidation in financial services  Manufacturing export growth   slowed in the third quarter after a strong second quarter, even with the decline in the dollar  With   the Fleet/Bank of America and Manulife/John Hancock mergers, downtown office vacancy rates in   Boston widened a bit, in contrast with the nation as a whole, and rents declined   On a more positive note, the fall tourism season was apparently a good one  And casual   observations of malls during this holiday season suggest that consumers are spending at a good clip,   despite the confidence readings  Retail contacts report solid readings on sales, and housing markets   remain strong, though some softness at the high end continues  First District business service   companies report improved conditions, with demand strengthening for temporary employment   firms, particularly in the areas of engineering and IT  Beyond temporary services, software and IT   December 14, 2004 29 of 118           employers also saw demand growth, though the uncertainty I noted before continued to weigh on   their outlook  Even with the overall rather tepid employment picture, especially as it relates to   levels of job growth, highly skilled labor remains in short supply, and firms report difficulty in   hiring the right employee for key positions   Turning to the nation, growth seems remarkably good  After a pause on the consumer side   in the late spring or early summer, consumer spending and business investment show considerable   strength overall  High-tech spending has fallen off a bit, to be sure, but that apparently reflects an   inventory turn in that industry  Labor markets are bouncy, but for the past six to nine months or so   they seem to have been delivering an average monthly level of job growth that will actually reduce,   if not eliminate, slack in labor markets over the next year and a half to two years  Increased housing   wealth and a decrease in the price of oil puts money in consumer pockets as well  Financial markets   are supportive of continuing growth, with equity markets turning up and longer-term interest rates   and spreads low  Indeed, the proliferation of hedge funds and the narrowness of credit spreads   suggest that liquidity abounds, which could have its obvious downside  Even the fall of the dollar   hasn’t seemed to do much more than provide, through its stimulative effect, some greater assurance   that output will not be overly affected by waning fiscal stimulus in 2005   Our forecast, like that of the Greenbook, sees this rather halcyon current situation continuing   through 2005 and into 2006, with excess capacity gradually disappearing, unemployment at least   stable but likely trending down, core inflation relatively flat, and overall inflation at less than   2 percent  Now, as I consider both of these forecasts, I am reminded of Dave’s crossed fingers and   also the reggae tune “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”  Even when the Greenbook considers alternative   scenarios, it has to work to get much variation in outcome  Yet real risks are out there; it’s just not   easy to see them in the context and period of our forecasts  For one, anecdotes continue to abound   December 14, 2004 30 of 118           about increased pricing pressure due to rising import prices—not only for oil but other commodities   as well—and increased costs of labor  It’s hard to make our forecasts anticipate much inflation   pressure, however, largely because of the embedded assumptions about the size of the output gap   and the related strong structural productivity growth  I think it may be wise to be humble about   those assumptions  Another risk involves the fiscal deficit  The latest government appropriations   bill may have reined in spending and reduced the deficit in the short run  But it’s hard to see how   the federal deficit can remain contained, given reasonable assumptions about discretionary spending   growth; the resolution of the growing negative effect of the AMT (alternative minimum tax); the   likely continuation of the Bush tax cuts; and the likely continuation, unfortunately, of the Iraq War,   not to mention plans to address Social Security   In part reflecting this, the value of the dollar has declined  It may be likely to fall more as   the country’s current account deficit approaches new highs as a percent of GDP  The differential   impact of this depreciation, boosting US growth but hitting the euro and the euro-area growth   harder than elsewhere, can only exacerbate a very touchy international situation strained already by   differing attitudes toward the war, among other things  Growth in the rest of the world has slipped   in the context of rising oil prices and the dollar’s decline  And a needed adjustment in the Chinese   currency, which could help things in Asia, seems unlikely or at least remote    So I find myself in a bit of a quandary  Are things as good as they seem in the forecast   before us, or do we stand an increasing chance of a very unpleasant, though possibly unforecastable,   surprise?  And in what direction will that surprise push economic activity—to increased inflation,   slower growth, increased market instability, or some combination of all of these?   I’m having some trouble figuring out how to close this  [Laughter]  I do sense increased   risks out there  On the other hand, I don’t think there’s any choice for us at this meeting  I think   December 14, 2004 31 of 118           that the US economy is on an upward trajectory and that policy has to come out of its current very   accommodative stance  In effect, as I look at both sides of the risks here, I think our moving in that   direction makes the economy internally a little more resilient  It takes a bit more thinking on the   part of markets to deal with risks in an environment of rising interest rates  And I believe that’s the   right way for us to go over the near term, though I do think we need to be cautious about an   increasing set of risks, both nationally and internationally  Frankly, as for what we say, I would like   to take it down to as little as possible about forward-looking things and make it as clean and clear as   we possibly can  "
5502,2004-12-14,"  Just a clarification  You have alternative C and then you actually have an   alternative C′, with alternative C focusing on energy prices as a growth issue—or at least having a   potential impact on growth—and C′ focusing on energy prices and business costs as an inflation   issue     What would sentence 3 look like under alternative C′?  That wasn’t very   clear     So you’d have “moderate pace” and “prices” juxtaposed there  Then   you’d have, “Labor market conditions continue to improve”      I support your recommendation  I could have gone with a simpler   version of sentence 3 that would say, “Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, and labor   market conditions continue to improve,” because I think the reference to the earlier rise in energy   prices and the gradual nature of the improvement in labor market conditions tends to soften that   statement  I’d prefer something that’s a bit more “middle of the road”  But that said, I’m willing to   go with your recommendation   December 14, 2004 66 of 118             I don’t want to debate the data with you because you’re far better at   analyzing them than I am  [Laughter]  But I do take some comfort in the average monthly growth in   payroll employment over the entire year  "
5555,2005-03-22, There’s a definition of these indexes in a footnote in Part 2 of the   Greenbook on page 33  
5556,2005-03-22," This is probably going on a little long, but I’ll ask one quick question   I see that you have gone from a negative contribution to growth in the first quarter from   equipment spending to a positive one  But in terms of the growth rate for the first quarter, you   end up with a projection that’s on the order of 10 percentage points under the growth rates   predicted elsewhere in the Blue Chip and the Wall Street forecasts, and so forth  I know you’ve   probably done some hand-wringing about that  Any thoughts?    So, do you think these other forecasts are not incorporating that?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity seems definitely on the   upswing in New England As we discussed conditions with our Beige Book contacts, met with our   small business advisory group, and talked in some depth with local temporary-help agencies and   software developers—as we did our usual round of contacts—the themes of solid growth and   increasing confidence were repeated with some frequency   Manufacturers, especially those that have some defense business, report very good sales,   and, at least in the case of one large manufacturer, an inability to keep up with demand  Labor   markets have strengthened as well, and benchmark revisions to employment data indicate that 2004   was a better period for job growth in New England than previously thought  Temporary help   agencies report good demand for labor, and help-wanted is stronger, as judged by both traditional   measures and the indexed data on the region that are available from Monstercom  Housing remains   strong, though we don’t see much sign of speculation and there is some softness at the upper end of   the price range Retail business is reported to be good, and both business and consumer confidence   has increased   Contacts in the regional economy appear to be moving from a focus on concerns about   demand to a greater focus on emerging issues around supply and cost increases  We talked to a lot                    March 22, 2005 45 of 116  of small businesses in the period since our February meeting, and they almost uniformly report   rising costs of raw materials and labor that are starting to impact their prices  In a growing number   of cases, these firms have been able to make price increases stick, even to big buyers like Wal-Mart,   though, largely, the price increases have been in the form of surcharges     Skilled workers are becoming difficult to find  Businesses report that they’re in a hiring   mode and have to pay up to get the people they need  Some companies have begun to hire in   advance of need, simply to have a pool of available workers  Capital spending plans seem quite   solid, and now there is a mixture of firms spending not only to further increase productivity but also   to expand to handle increased business   Two areas of concern emerged beyond those related to rising costs  The first involves   tourism in northern New England  Evidently, while this was a snowy year in the southern part of   our region, the northern areas have suffered from both too little snow and the timing of storms,   which created weekend travel problems  The second is a continued sluggishness in commercial real   estate markets  Given the number of large mergers affecting the region, both in the financial   services industry and elsewhere, and the reduction of headquarters staff that has resulted,   commercial vacancy rates remain high and rents low—especially in downtown and suburban   Boston I should say the rents are relatively low, since Boston rents tend to be high anyway This   has not, however, seemed to put much of a crimp in the market for purchasing commercial buildings,   which continues to be quite strong   Turning to the national scene, I’ve been struck by the strength of the incoming economic   data, as has everyone else We in Boston have adjusted our forecast upward, especially in the near   term, as has the Greenbook  Using the same assumptions about policy, we end up fairly close to the                    March 22, 2005 46 of 116  Greenbook over the forecast horizon, though our calculations suggest some greater economic   capacity and less downward pressure on the unemployment rate   However, there is not a lot to argue about here, given the continuing upside surprises in   overall economic growth and in price pressures  Indeed, it seems clear to me that the underlying   rationale we have used in moving policy slowly and gradually to a less accommodative place is   becoming questionable  Unlike last year when growth seemed fragile and uncertain, economic   growth now seems solid and resilient and in less need of policy accommodation  Overall credit and   financial conditions are supportive, if not encouraging, to spending and growth  Business   investment is not taking a breather with the ending of the tax incentive, and consumers aren’t either,   except in their post-holiday purchases of autos   Surely it is possible to see downside risks from a rise in the saving rate, from an untoward   increase in oil prices that impacts demand, or from an impact arising out of the external deficit  But   I think it’s even easier to imagine upside inflation surprises as rising energy, raw material, import,   and labor costs get embedded into economic activity  In that regard, I found the Greenbook   alternatives focused on a spending boom and on a boom with rising inflation expectations very   interesting I should also note that while my admiration for the FRB/US model is enormous, I think   it’s difficult for any model to correctly anticipate the full interplay of economic factors once the   unexpected happens   The baseline, I think, is still pretty much a good, solid forecast  Continued solid productivity   growth will keep nascent cost pressures and inflation expectations under control However, the risks   that this will not happen seem to me to have grown and to have become a bit more one-sided  That   is, I think we need to be more focused on the risks that rising cost pressures will get out of hand    Perhaps it’s not a probable outcome, but, if it does happen, it would be costly Accordingly, I think a                       March 22, 2005 47 of 116  case could be made for moving faster rather than slower toward that so-called neutral place  Taking   larger steps now would have the benefit of affecting market attitudes toward risk in a positive way,   largely because it is not what markets expect us to do     That option has some attraction to me  But it could be too much of a surprise and indicate   too much concern about future prospects than perhaps is necessary  However, we could take   advantage of this point in time by preparing the markets for greater policy flexibility  That is, we   could change the language of the announcement by following the Chairman’s example in taking out   the reference to a measured pace  In my view, anyway, that would have two benefits  It would   continue the process of removing policy accommodation, and it would focus markets better on the   uncertainties of the future  "
5557,2005-03-22," I had similar concerns to Governor Gramlich’s about the “appropriate   policy action” language And given the length of your discourse, Vincent, which certainly was   interesting in supporting the language, and the level of detail that you just went into in describing it,   I think it’s going to be very hard to explain to others what the heck we’re talking about here I really   think all “appropriate policy action” is saying is that we can do our job We’ve dealt with situations   before where we’ve moved policy but continued to say that the risks were balanced  And with the   “accommodative” language, I think we could continue to say that the risks are balanced and the   whole statement would still flow logically   I’m also concerned in alternative B about the rise in energy prices not notably feeding   through to core consumer prices  Core consumer prices are up a full percentage point on a year-  over-year basis, and there has been some feed-through  We think it’s going to slacken, and maybe   you want to put that reference in the future, but I’m not sure that this is what we want to say in this   statement  I think we’d be better off leaving that sentence out and just going with “pressures on   inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident”    A doubling in the rate of core inflation on a year-over-year basis—    I guess my point is that I wouldn’t make that particular statement  I think   that pressures on inflation have picked up and pricing power is more evident  After all, we have to   believe that underlying inflation can be contained or else we’d be moving a lot more strongly now    So, I don’t think it’s inconsistent to stop the sentence—    Yes, I was worried about that, too    I just want to be sure I understand what you mean by leaving the   statement the way it is  I assume you mean taking the alternative B language and leaving it the way   it is    Okay, though I’m not real happy with that  But I get your point that a   move of 25 basis points, with an emphasis on inflation pressures that haven’t been there in the past   and a reference to how difficult the decision was not to take away the “measured” language will   prepare everybody for what we might do at the May meeting  In that case, if all goes as we expect it   to go—and that’s a big “if,” I know—we probably will be able then to talk about removing the   “measured pace” language  I also hope, along the lines of President Lacker’s suggestion, we can   talk about taking away the balance-of-risk language I don’t think it’s serving us well anymore    I also agree with President Guynn that just having the weekend to look   this over was not enough time  It was a little like ordering Chinese food—choose two from Column                           March 22, 2005 87 of 116  A, two from Column B, and two from Column C  We can’t do this with only a day or two to review   it    Of course, the public wouldn’t expect us to be commenting on it, either    Presumably, we’d not address that too much in the minutes; we can leave   it to the transcript that will be released five years from now   I’m in agreement with the 25 basis points  As I said before, I can go along with keeping   alternative B the way it is I have some concerns about it, and I’m not alone, but I think we’ve spent   enough time on that   I want to address, however, this issue that has been raised about the balance-of-risk   statement, just preparatory to our May discussion  I think we should look at the time period from the   middle of 2003 to now as being a very different, almost unique, period—at least it is in the 10 or 11   years that I’ve been around the Federal Open Market Committee  We knew with some certainty that                                March 22, 2005 101 of 116  we were at a place where the fed funds rate and interest rates at the short end—everywhere on the   curve, in general—were at historical lows We knew that there was an incredible degree of   uncertainty from a lot of things  And we knew that wherever neutral was, as my colleague President   Santomero said at one point, it was above where we were  So the direction of the path for policy   was clear, and we could convey that with some level of certainty  In my years on the Committee,   that is a rare event We sometimes know with a reasonable degree of certainty our likely next move,   but we don’t know what policy will be six or eight months down the road  We can’t confirm the   course of the fed funds curve   So, if we say what our policy action was and why we did it, I think that has enough forward   content to it If one looks at the statements of the late 1990s, before we got into the balance-of-risk   assessment, they had enough forward-looking content to them  We could add or subtract from that,   depending on where we are, but that would keep it short and simple  We wouldn’t have six or seven   sentences that we’d have to mix and match in order to come up with something that, individually,   we feel comfortable with   In my view we need to think about our communication with the outside world as a broad   range of things We have testimony; we have speeches; we have an earlier release of the minutes;   and we have our announcements  We have a whole range of vehicles to use to help us   communicate  The announcement after the meeting doesn’t have to do everything all in one place    And since it’s coming out in a very timely way, I think it’s better to make it short and give it a little   bit of forward context I’d say as much as needed to tell why we took the action we did but then   leave it at that That to me would be the best approach—unless it’s absolutely necessary, as it has   been over the last year and a half or more, to say something that’s more forward-looking  "
5603,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  New England and the nation seem to have hit   a couple of bumps along the road to steady growth  We, like the Greenbook, don’t expect the bumps   to turn into potholes or disturb much except the speed of travel slightly  But we were again   reminded that there is a level of uncertainty about a range of economic variables                                 May 3, 2005 31 of 116  In New England, Beige Book contacts were remarkably upbeat in early April, and available   data reported a sense of solid growth in the region However, several recent indicators and a sense   of caution suggest the possibility of an emerging slowdown in the region   On the positive side, employers added jobs in February and March, and the quarterly total   was positive as well Unemployment rose slightly, but this was due entirely to a stabilization in the   regional labor force after a period of decline Unemployment claims moved down, and both the   traditional help-wanted index and Monstercom’s index of online job postings increased at a solid   pace As the weather brightened, tourism did as well; and business travel in Boston has been strong,   at least relative to last year With average revenue per room rising at a nearly 13 percent pace, hotels   looked poised for a good year Surprisingly, even in this service industry, productivity   improvements are possible, as average hotel staffing reportedly has dropped from 80 per 100 rooms   in 2000 to 62 per 100 rooms in 2004  This is said to be the result of technological change and the   growing popularity of online booking   Beige Book contacts in retail and manufacturing were, on the whole, rather optimistic    Moderately growing demand and increased pricing power were keeping margins strong, and a   continued emphasis on productivity growth and conservative capital spending left most of our   contacts confident of meeting their revenue and profit goals for the year  Higher costs for oil and   oil-related inputs and for certain types of skilled labor were a concern, and many contacts   commented on a generally more inflationary business environment  Indeed, providers of business   and strategic consulting services reported strong growth, with one contact stating that cost   containment is not as big an issue as it was but that strategic matters were becoming more important    Overall, confidence seemed good, and that was reflected in the various regional surveys of   business confidence On the negative side, consumer confidence slumped badly in April, reflecting                                    May 3, 2005 32 of 116  doubt about both current conditions and the future This was likely due to concerns about rising oil   prices, as local prices for home heating oil rose at a 14½ percent pace, double the national average,   and gasoline prices rose sharply, as they did elsewhere   Residential real estate markets, while still strong, leveled off and softened at high price   points Actually, I think President Lacker is probably not asking enough for his home  [Laughter] I   don’t find that I’m getting as many offers for mine     And a regional index of leading economic indicators pointed to slower growth ahead  These   tentative indications of a slowdown could well evaporate, however, and some moderation in demand   may be good, particularly given the stronger pricing environment   Data for the nation have been disappointing in April, both on the demand side and on the   price side The latest news in labor markets is three days away, and while that could surprise on the   upside, given recent claims and help-wanted data, the numbers for March were more subdued than   we had expected Equally disappointing were durable goods orders and trends in manufacturing   output, though as a partial offset to this I found the April loan officer survey data interesting in that   they suggested strength in C&I [commercial and industrial] lending  Contractions were also seen in   retail sales, with and without autos, and in home building, although from a fairly strong base    Advance GDP data suggest unintended inventories accumulated as the first quarter ended, reflecting   a slowdown in final demand and a drag from net exports   As in New England, this could well be just a bump in the road  And given the unwelcome   nudging up of core price data, it might be helpful in curbing further inflation  It does bear watching,   however, as we gauge how fast to adjust policy At this point, my view is that it would be unwise to   overreact to the recent indications of softening They could well be temporary, as many have noted    Indeed, I thought Dave’s comments on the resilience of the US economy against a number of                                    May 3, 2005 33 of 116  challenges over the past year or so quite important to keep in mind  Whatever its cause, I think the   resilience of the US economy has been a hallmark for at least most of the last decade, and I think   we would be wise to keep that in the front of our forecast   Right now, given the uptick in prices, we aren’t making much progress in getting back to   some sense of neutral as far as policy is concerned  Our forecast in Boston and that in the   Greenbook suggest that growth will continue at a pace that will use up at least some excess capacity   by the end of the forecast period Recognizing that estimating precisely when an output gap will   close is chancy at best, I believe we need to continue to move policy to a point that is not stimulative   by the time that gap closes and that doing so gradually will help to ease the impact on the economy   If incoming data continue to disappoint, we may find it necessary to pause along the lines   that the fed funds markets expect  Conversely, upside surprises, particularly on the price front, are   also possible So I would not rule out a faster pace of upward policy movement if circumstances   warrant later in this year The point is, I think, that our vision of the future is now a bit cloudier than   it was That takes me to the real action at this meeting—not so much what we do but what we say   about it I’ve been uneasy with our use of the “measured pace” language because it seems to   provide a level of certainty to market participants that could encourage inappropriate risk-taking    Indeed, while risk spreads have widened from their low points, they still remain quite low   However, there has been concern that taking away the “measured pace” language would be   disruptive in that it would seem to say only one thing that policy accommodation would be removed   at a faster pace than previously But weaker-than-expected incoming data may have provided a   greater sense of two-sided risk, and that may have offered us a good opportunity  We may now have   the chance to drop “measured” from our lexicon, while preserving the flexibility to take any action   necessary at our next meetings without the sense that we have somehow not prepared the market                                 May 3, 2005 34 of 116  I think we ought to make the most of this opportunity and get out of what has been perceived   as a policy pledge The economy has become more uncertain  Our commitment to price stability   and maximum sustainable growth continues unabated, of course, but we are less certain about the   policy path we will need to take to fulfill those goals  Let’s go back now to simply saying what   we’re doing and why and let the market assign its own probabilities to future policy changes  Thank   you  "
5604,2005-05-03," I know I’m in the minority here—not of the last several speakers, but   overall in the minority  But I’m starting to feel like Alice in Wonderland with this statement—you   know, jam tomorrow, jam yesterday, but never jam today  It’s never the time to change the   statement  And frankly, I do feel that we have a unique opportunity here, with a situation in which   the risks are more two-sided  I think that would enable us to stop giving an implicit pledge about   policy going forward   Now, I’m in agreement on the 25 basis points  And though I’m not a voting member, if I   were, I would take your guidance on the language But I really feel that what you’ve said is that we   have to wait until we’re willing to stop raising the funds rate before we change this language And   I’m afraid of what will get embedded in the markets with that sort of guarantee out there    Well, that’s what I interpreted you as saying, and obviously I was wrong     I apologize as well In any event, I’ve probably said enough before on   what I’m concerned about  I do think we need to get out of promising to do something about which   there is a greater degree of uncertainty at this meeting, and presumably at subsequent meetings, than   we felt two or three meetings ago  I don’t think that language is serving us well anymore, but one   more meeting is not going to kill anything   I do think the process issue needs further discussion I communicated with Vincent,   probably not adequately, over the weekend I didn’t bring a copy of my suggested language with   me  It was different in some ways from what Bill had  I was more or less a “four from column B”   and “two from column C” person, choosing as if ordering from a Chinese menu here  Granted, I   take the point that this is not the place to get into a discussion of moving this sentence here and that   sentence there and trying to get 19 people to agree on it Given the complexity of the statement, I   just don’t know what process we should use I’m not sure, even if we spent an entire two-day   meeting, that we’d come up with a statement that is adequate, given all the moving parts we now   have in it As I said earlier, going back to something that’s shorter—something that says what we   did and why we did it and lets the minutes convey the range of views—is where I think we ought to   be headed But, again, that just may not be in the cards anytime soon  "
5649,2005-08-09," To move from the mortgage-backed market to Treasuries, there was an   interesting article over the weekend regarding a squeeze on the 10-year note  I’m wondering   what you have seen on that and what you think about it                               August 9, 2005 12 of 110   Does that have any implications for where the 10-year rate is on the   yield curve?    So you think it’s a supply issue and not comparable to the Salomon   Brothers situation where there was some actual desire to keep stock off the market                            August 9, 2005 13 of 110   Right I notice that the Treasury is looking into it    "
5650,2005-08-09," For a variety of reasons, I’ve had some inclination to look over the   intricacies of the work that you’ve been doing on the labor force participation rate  I find it very                   August 9, 2005 30 of 110  interesting, and I think there are a number of ways one can look at data in this area and separate   out cyclical and trend developments  Looking at the forecasts we have and the important impact   of the labor force participation rate, I’m wondering what your band of uncertainty is regarding   your projection on the trend rate I, for one, would hope that what we’re seeing in the early years   of this century is not indicative of future female labor force participation  Maybe there is an   economic reason for why that pattern of female participation is occurring, but I have yet to see   one that really strikes me as reasonable  So, I’d like to know what your range of uncertainty is    I don’t think it’s worthwhile to get into a discussion of the two   approaches—granted that the statistical methods are very interesting and I’ve yet to really   understand them all  That’s my problem; it’s not your problem  I’m just asking about your   sense of a confidence interval or band of uncertainty    That’s the range of uncertainty    Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In assessing all of the information about   the District that our Bank staff had gathered for this Open Market Committee meeting, and in my   own interactions with contacts around the region, a few words stand out because they were   repeated so often And they are different words than would come to mind from many of the   previous discussions The words are “lackluster,” “underwhelming,” and even “blah”     New England’s growth has been lagging that of the nation through the entire 2001-2005   period, largely because of the impact of the technology downturn in Massachusetts  For most of   2005, however, it has seemed that the region might be gaining a bit—with employment growing   at a pace only slightly behind that of the nation, signs of life in manufacturing, and strong   residential real estate markets   We noticed a lull, as almost everybody else did, in the early spring  We thought that lull   would dissipate, but it seems that the forward momentum that existed earlier has faltered a bit  It   could be the recent hot weather and its impact on retail sales  It could be the impact of high gas   prices on areas that depend on travel and tourism and on consumer pocketbooks in general  It                   August 9, 2005 51 of 110  could be the continuing sense of business caution about hiring and prospective demand  And it   could be the effect of the proposed base closings, especially in Maine  But whatever it is,   economic activity seems to have flattened out, and one can see this in the consumer confidence   and business confidence data   Indeed, consumer confidence in New England fell to 79 in July, with readings on current   sentiment about normal—a little bit lower, but still in the normal range  But expectations about   future activity were down to their lowest reading since 2001  Now, it’s only a month’s data, and   it’s difficult to get excited about one month’s data on consumer confidence, but I think it does   tend to pick up the mood in the region   That’s not to say that the region’s economic health is not moving in a positive direction    Employment is growing; it’s just growing slowly  Unemployment is down, but that’s largely   because the labor force is down Moreover, manufacturers and related service companies do   report growth Demand is just not as strong as they once expected, and they’ve been working   hard to contain costs and increase market share through acquisitions to maintain revenue growth   Indeed, even the once-hot residential real estate market seems to have moderated a bit    Region-wide inventories of homes for sale have risen, and Freddie Mac home price indexes for   the region indicate price appreciation about at the national level, except in Rhode Island where   the residential real estate boom continues  Sales of existing homes decreased in the first quarter   of 2005 from the previous quarter and levels are below those seen in 2004   Perhaps the lull in economic activity that ushered in the second quarter lingers on in the   minds of New England businesses, and maybe the stronger trends that are evident now nationally   will be reflected in data and anecdotes later this year  But there is a sense that this period of                      August 9, 2005 52 of 110  growth is not so much a rising tide that’s lifting all boats but a continual struggle to survive by   the businesses within the region   People keep asking where the next new thing is that will fill the downtown office space   and get the region really humming again  There’s no good answer to that question except that   the region’s history is replete with cycles of downturn and rebirth and reinvention  Indeed,   looking at the glass as half full, one benefit of a period of slower but positive growth is that a lot   of attention is placed on productivity enhancements in the private sector and on creating more   incentives for business growth in the public sector   Turning to the nation, our forecast for the rest of ’05 and ’06 is quite similar to that of the   Greenbook, using the same monetary policy and government spending assumptions  We could   argue a bit about the Greenbook’s lowered rate of potential growth, and we end up with slightly   less inflation and slightly more unemployment, given our sense that the output gap is slightly   wider and will not be fully closed by the end of 2006  But a lot of this is splitting hairs  Recent   economic data, the seemingly stronger health of the labor markets, and the expected flattening   out of oil prices are all good news  The economy is doing well, and inflation seems pretty much   in check And both the Greenbook and we in Boston see that picture continuing into 2006   A key question, of course, in such a halcyon environment, is how one sees the risks to   that environment  Concerns abound about upside inflation risks  But in my view, anyway, the   risks seemed fairly balanced  As the alternative scenarios point out, the Greenbook might be   wrong about the amount of slack in the economy, and the projections of potential might have   been shaded lower than is actually the case—that is, should we ever really be able to perceive   what the economy’s actual potential is                 August 9, 2005 53 of 110  Indeed, one can read a variety of labor market indicators—not just labor force   participation, but also long unemployment duration, a low job-finding rate, a low job-separation   rate, moderate ECI [Employment Cost Index] wage growth, and overall a continuing subdued   pace of employment growth relative to GDP—as suggesting greater levels of labor market slack    Productivity as well could be stronger rather than weaker, as reflected in conversations with   every business contact I have; they all continue to emphasize their unflinching focus on cost   control and innovation And profit margins remain quite high by historical standards  We could   well have more room to grow without igniting inflationary pressures and over time need less,   rather than more, policy constraint   But the fact remains that we have not yet arrived at a place where most would say policy   is neutral, let alone a constraint on activity  And cost pressures do reflect some upside risk to   inflation Recent data on banks’ consumer, industrial, and construction lending could be a   harbinger of more rather than less strength  Spending on equipment and software could surprise,   given anecdotes from the tech sector  So, growth above potential is possible, and that could   nudge resource usage upward Even now, various measures of wage pressures are sending   contrary signals The better reading may be the ECI data, but the upward trend in unit labor   costs should not be ignored Energy costs could well be a problem, though they are as likely to   take a bite out of growth as they are to feed an inflation spiral   The projected current account imbalance of 7 percent of GDP is an even larger concern in   my view, as the risk of a significant and perhaps sudden adjustment looms larger  If the   adjustment takes the form of a large depreciation in the dollar and more pass-through to   consumer prices occurs, the consequences for inflation could be serious                     August 9, 2005 54 of 110  And I remain concerned that abnormally low interest rates produce greater risk-taking   that could come home to roost in an unpredictable way  I meet with a group of investment   managers prior to the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, mostly to understand better   how those individuals are reading markets  One quote from this week’s meeting “The biggest   risk markets face right now is their belief that there is no risk”  With equity volatilities at a very   low level and bond risk spreads very narrow, market participants seem to believe things are rosy   as far as the eye can see, and they seem to be reaching out the risk spectrum for return   And it would seem that consumers continue to reflect the “don’t worry, be happy”   perspective in their spending and saving habits We know from experience that such confidence   can be a harbinger of financial instability to come  Thus, I continue to believe that while the   risks to our forecast may be balanced, it would be more costly if we were to err on the side of   more rather than less accommodation  It seems clear to me that the move to a less   accommodative posture should continue  And if current trends persist, that process possibly   should accelerate   It also seems clear to me that the move today that the markets expect is the right move to   be taking And I think we should begin to give some thought to how we ought to start the   process of changing our statement  Maybe we don’t need to change it today, but we should set in   process some movement toward thinking about how that statement should change  Continuing to   reassure markets with the “measured pace” language may be providing too much in the way of   certainty Arguably, markets don’t need this anymore and would benefit from a more realistic   assessment of uncertainty  Some would argue, I know, that the ideal time to change is either   when we see a need to pause or to accelerate  It’s hard to know when that will be, and I worry   that our continued use of this reassuring language is presenting its own problems                                August 9, 2005 55 of 110  I think it’s very difficult to react three or four days before a meeting to alternative   language and to come up with something that’s satisfactory and moving in the direction of   change If we are going to change our language, I would hope we have a chance, prior to the   week before the meeting, to contribute to the underlying thinking that goes into that  And I   would argue that we ought to begin that process sooner rather than later    Okay    I think that would be a helpful thing to do  I, by no means, think I   have the perfect answer Probably none of us does  "
5651,2005-08-09," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I look forward to   working on evolving the statement language for use at some point  "
5692,2005-09-20, Is this what the Treasury is looking at?  Or is it something else that the   Treasury has its task force studying?    So they are looking at this situation?  
5693,2005-09-20," Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  For the past couple of meetings   I’ve been reporting a lull in economic activity in New England, with little employment growth   and muted readings on confidence  Perhaps it was the weather or the impact of the Pentagon’s   base realignment and closure (BRAC) proposals on fragile labor markets such as those in Maine   but, whatever it was, the region appeared to pull out of it in late July and make some further   progress in August The weather turned bright and sunny, tourists filled the beaches, and hopes   for fall tourism rose  Employment surged by more than 13,000 jobs over the two months—that’s   big in New England—with most broad industry categories showing gains  Consumer confidence   rose, as did business confidence And the BRAC Commission decided not to follow the   Pentagon’s recommendation to close two major bases in the region                           September 20, 2005 55 of 117  With the exception of commercial real estate, which remains in the doldrums in Boston,   the outlook turned positive overall, with most contacts expecting continued growth for the   remainder of 2005 and into 2006  But, of course, this was pre-Katrina  Since that devastating   disaster, we’ve tried hard to understand the impact on the region and the nation  Our small   business advisory group met as scheduled the week after the hurricane hit, as did our board of   directors At that point things, indeed, seemed gloomy  But as the recovery effort got on a better   footing, the underlying resilience of the US economy began to show through   To capture a sense of this changing scene, we made calls late last week to large national   retailers and manufacturers headquartered in the First District  Overall there were several   common themes  First, most contacts believed the pace of underlying growth had been solid and   was likely to stay that way, with some negative hurricane effects this quarter and next but some   positive impact thereafter  Indeed, one of our directors whose company is a large manufacturer   of semiconductor chips reported worldwide expansion on the heels of a major inventory   drawdown during the first half of the year He reported semiconductor plants everywhere   working at an 85 to 90 percent capacity most recently, with strong demands for PCs and hand   sets driving chip production A major regional bank with offices throughout New England and   the eastern Midwest and down to Philadelphia reported that given the yield curve, the banking   business had been a bit tough, but most bank customers seemed to be doing great  This bank and   other employers reported increasing problems in finding skilled labor, even people to fill teller   positions   Second, while Katrina’s devastation was terrible, our contacts were especially concerned   about the effect of high oil, gasoline, and natural gas prices on their input costs for oil-based                    September 20, 2005 56 of 117  materials and on consumer pocketbooks  Consumer prices in the Boston area were on the rise   prior to Katrina, with the region’s headline rate of inflation at 4 percent and core at 3 percent   The biggest area of price growth even then was for fuel and utilities, which rose almost twice as   fast as nationwide over the 12 months from July ’04 to July ’05  Given the region’s lack of   homegrown energy supplies, its reliance on oil for home heating purposes, and the fact that over   half of its electrical generators are now fired by natural gas brought in from outside the region, it   seems clear that Boston price growth, driven by energy costs, will continue to outstrip the nation   at least through the winter months  Moreover, a pre-Katrina Federal Energy Regulatory   Commission report, which I think I’ve talked about before, sees the region’s power supply at risk   of widespread brownouts this winter if very cold weather puts stress on generators working at   capacity More broadly, contacts also reported that Katrina’s impact on energy costs may give   them cover for price increases that prior to Katrina they’ve lacked the power to make stick   The third common theme related to the possible upside potential for reconstruction-  related demand in 2006  Manufacturers of capital goods and consumer durables anticipate a   hurricane-related uptick next year  Companies with stores and manufacturing or major   distribution points in the hurricane area will have some losses, though most expect them to be   covered by insurance And one large retailer reported that while 7 to 10 out of its 120 stores in   the region appeared to be total losses, business was extremely strong at stores just outside the   devastated areas, such as in Baton Rouge That company has been moving employees in the   affected areas to stores in areas where business is booming  A supplier of capital goods to the   defense industry was concerned that the spending on recovery from Katrina could squeeze out                      September 20, 2005 57 of 117  other defense spending but they, on balance, thought the probability was that sales to the   government and other major contractors might be delayed but not canceled   Finally, there was a theme of outreach and support to employees in the affected area and   of helping with disaster recovery Almost all contacts were doing whatever they could—   supplying generators and giving out free medicine and other supplies at evacuation locations  In   fact, one drugstore reported that on a daily basis they were handing out about $500,000 worth of   free drugs Supplying water purification equipment and technology to restore communications   was also noted   Most companies have continued to pay their personnel and have made efforts to locate   them all  Several have made grants to those who lost everything  They expect insurance to   cover some of this and perhaps some government reimbursement, but the general attitude seemed   to be to do as much as they could and to worry about how to cover the costs later  Just as within   the Reserve Banks, the reported generosity of employees in areas beyond the hurricane was   amazing, with one major company alone raising at least $17 million in donations to Katrina   victims in the reconstruction efforts  So it’s not just government money that’s going into the   area There’s a lot of money from everywhere   In sum, the New England economy seems on a stronger footing than it was earlier in the   summer, though the dark clouds of rising energy costs are almost certain to take a bite out of   regional pocketbooks, especially if the winter is a cold one as is predicted  This likely would   have been the case without Katrina, but the related energy supply shock has made the short-term   outlook a bit worse Aside from energy, the economic effect of Katrina seems likely to be small,   certainly by comparison with the human effect  By 2006, if energy costs moderate as predicted,                      September 20, 2005 58 of 117  the outlook could well be positive for the larger retailers and capital goods manufacturers in the   region   Turning to the Greenbook, there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty clouding   the very near-term outlook  We in Boston, probably like everybody else around the table and   elsewhere, have tried our hand at estimating the impact of Katrina  But I can’t imagine that   we’re any better at it than the Board staff is  In fact, despite the ups and downs in the quarter-to­  quarter projections, the Q4-over-Q4 GDP growth rates we see for both this year and next differ   from the Greenbook only marginally  Our forecast for the unemployment rate is the same as the   Greenbook’s and, given that we see a bit more excess labor capacity, we’re a little less   pessimistic about increases in core inflation next year   So despite the near-term uncertainty, the medium-term outlook seems less in question    While it seemed impossible a couple of weeks ago, as we were all riveted to the horrifying   scenes on national TV, Katrina’s effect on the economy is likely to be very short term—a slower   pace now and a somewhat faster pace later as reconstruction takes place    The real issue is what was happening pre-Katrina and how that plays out going forward,   and we have a somewhat greater sense of certainty about that picture—or, I should say, the same   level of certainty we have about any forecast  Prior to Katrina most everything in the economy   seemed to be running on all fours, though not without some causes for concern  Shipments data   for July suggested some softness in P&E spending, and inventory rebuilding at the wholesale   level was less than expected, but labor markets had shown solid progress  Financial markets had   been and continued to be supportive of growth, if a bit too complacent about risk for my taste                    September 20, 2005 59 of 117  External growth was showing signs of life A slowly closing output gap and higher energy costs   raised concerns both about inflation down the road and possible negative effects on spending     Assuming the instant effect of Katrina on energy prices moderates, the broad economic   picture seems about the same as it was before the hurricane  That is, the best guess is growth at   around potential for the next year or so, lower unemployment as labor markets continue to   tighten, and more rather than less pressure on prices  Additional fiscal stimulus from Katrina   recovery efforts could be a bit of a wild card here, as there seems to be a growing tendency to   throw money at the problem—money we can ill afford, given medium-term deficit expectations   Don’t get me wrong  I think the federal government should help in the rebuilding process, but it   has to be done in the context of overall fiscal discipline, which at this point seems a bit lacking   There are surely risks to the forecast  On the downside, the higher energy prices that   prevailed before Katrina might have a bigger impact on consumer spending and overall growth,   particularly if the supply shock of the hurricane doesn’t ease off as expected  Pre-Katrina   shipments and orders data may foretell a flattening rather than a rebound of capital spending  On   the other hand, greater fiscal ease will certainly be an additional stimulant, and the hurricane   could provide additional cover for more widespread pricing power   Productivity growth has slowed, and we hear reports of labor being hard to find    Combine these reports with the slowly falling unemployment rate, and a surge in wage and   salary growth as measured by the ECI, which we haven’t seen yet, may not be far off the mark   As a matter of risk management, it seems to me for now that appearing to be complacent   about simultaneous energy demand and supply shocks and diminishing excess capacity might   well be more costly in terms of expectations and central bank credibility than dealing with                          September 20, 2005 60 of 117  greater downside effects if they were to emerge  Those effects could be addressed in a timely   way by pausing, but at this point I don’t see a need to take that step   Thus, I’m in favor of continuing our process of removing policy accommodation at this   meeting  Incoming economic data could well convince us of the need to stay put some time   soon, or we might find it necessary to continue our upward trek longer or at a faster pace than we   now are expecting But at this point, continuing to remove policy accommodation at the   “measured pace” we’ve been doing seems about right  "
5694,2005-09-20," I support your recommendation  I think it’s the best way to manage   the risks that we currently face  I agree with you that if in the future the downside risks   predominate, there are ways to deal with that Now, though, I think the risks to our credibility   and to inflation expectations—in light of the various inflation scenarios we face—are sufficient   that keeping on our path of continuing to remove policy accommodation is the best way to go   I also wish I had watched a little bit more of C-SPAN and spent a few minutes less on the   12-box matrix on our policy announcement  [Laughter]  I’m happy to go with your   recommendation  "
5739,2005-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in New England have   bounced around a little bit over the last year or so  Right now they show a few signs of flattening   out  Surveys of both consumer and business confidence show some current strength, but opinions   about activity six months from now either remain at a low level in the case of consumers or, for   businesses, turned negative for the first time in the last five years   Worries about fuel and benefits costs, interest rate increases, and the war in Iraq are most   often mentioned by contacts as shaping a less-than-rosy outlook  And when you talk to them about   big profit margins, they look at you with a puzzled expression, wondering what business you are   talking about because that’s certainly not the case for their business  I think there’s some difference   of opinion when looking at your own numbers versus the numbers in the aggregate   Anyway, for the present, most firms do report profits, with those serving the defense industry   making notable headway  Consumers are spending, if not on cars then on housing, though at least   according to one survey they perceive rising pressures on their personal finances  And core   inflation in the Boston area is surprisingly low relative to the nation  It’s usually higher  Thus,   there’s a sense in which the region may be experiencing a period of calm before a possible storm of   negative trends   Employment in the region dropped in September, and the unemployment rate rose  The   employment decline was widespread by state and involved, in part, the usual suspects of trade and   manufacturing, but about half reflected government workers in Maine  September government   employment can move around a lot, depending on the hiring of teachers for kindergarten through   12th grade  So it’s probably wise to take this drop in jobs with a grain of salt  Many of our contacts                                  November 1, 2005 42 of 114  report that skilled labor is hard to find and expensive  There are continuing references to caution in   hiring and a desire not to add a single new employee until it’s necessary to do so   Both businesses and consumers are concerned about the impact of high heating oil, natural   gas, and gasoline prices  Local heating oil companies that have provided lock-in rates for the winter   in the past will not do so now, likely feeding into concerns  Despite many fervent prayers for the   opposite, the winter is expected to be a bad one  And that forecast was underlined by the early   snowfalls in northern New England a couple weeks ago and by the flurries in Massachusetts over   the weekend Certainly this is good in terms of prospects for skiing revenues, but not so good for   general optimism, given concerns about energy   Finally, let me say a word about residential real estate markets  The Boston area is often   mentioned as having bubble-like characteristics  This is an obvious concern, given the problems the   region experienced with falling prices and related banking failures in the early ’90s  However,   there’s good reason to assume that recent rising prices in New England reflect a lack of supply and   an older, wealthier population capable of supporting both a primary and a secondary residence,   rather than a fundamentally unstable situation  And some of the froth is fading  Home prices   continue to escalate but are currently increasing at about the same pace as in the nation as a whole   rather than leading it  Four out of the eight other regions of the country are now experiencing more   rapid escalation   Contacts in the real estate industry report two trends  First, there was a rather abrupt softening   in the high-end suburban markets this summer, with escalating supply and the advent of a buyer’s   market—something not seen in several years  The other trend is an increase in the supply of   multifamily units, particularly condominiums, and a marked upturn in condo inventory  Thus, most   contacts think real estate markets appear to be returning to a more reasonable place gradually, with                                        November 1, 2005 43 of 114  much of the change at the high end  This could feed into some concerns about spending in the   future and could certainly make people feel less wealthy  But given where it seems to be centered,   it doesn’t appear likely to do a lot of near-term damage   Turning to the national scene, incoming data appear to confirm the underlying strength of the   US economy Separating out the impact of several hurricanes is not easy  Readings on   unemployment and business spending net of hurricane effects seem consistent with the continuation   of solid growth through the remainder of 2005  The strength of consumer outlays remains a   question, given the now 2-month downturn in confidence and the fact that the outsized motor   vehicle purchases that had supported such outlays in the third quarter are falling off their highs    However, labor market data seem consistent with continued strength in hiring  One would suppose   that, at least in the near term, working consumers will be spending consumers, especially if   confidence improves in the face of waning energy prices—or at least prices for gasoline  Finally, I   take the continued strength in housing as a sign that, under it all, consumers still have the confidence   to make rather long-term investments   Our forecast in Boston for the next year and into ’07 differs little from the Greenbook’s    Assuming energy prices subside, or at a minimum that we don’t have any new shocks, growth   should pick up in the spring, as the impact of the energy tax on consumers eases and as rebuilding in   hurricane-ravaged areas accelerates  Over the same 6-month or so period through the winter into   spring, low inventory levels are likely to be replenished, feeding factory activity  Growth outside   the United States is, on balance, expected to be positive as well  Employment growth should return   to its pre-Katrina monthly pace, and the remaining slack in the US economy should wane  The   post-Katrina “throw money at it” attitude in Washington seems to have moderated, but a fiscal   stimulus of some size appears likely  Our best guess on inflation mirrors the Greenbook’s as well                            November 1, 2005 44 of 114  The worrisome headline numbers on both the CPI and the PCE moderate; the feed-through to core   inflation ticks up but then moderates through the year; and this process pulls in on the upward   trajectory of near-term inflation expectations   There are obvious risks here  Energy-based headline inflation could feed more strongly into   the core, and inflation expectations could remain elevated  We could see the moderate trends in   wage and salary growth, as measured by the ECI, begin to take off  However, I’m hopeful, along   the same lines that President Yellen is, that inflation expectations will moderate, as gasoline prices   have, and that we won’t see even as big a feed-through to the ECI data as the Greenbook projects    However, if a big rise in wages were to occur, it would set red lights flashing on everybody’s   economic dashboard   If we are lucky, our rather benign forecast for the next year will work out  If we’re not, we   could be looking at both rising inflation and falling growth, as one of the alternative scenarios   highlights  In that regard, we need to pay careful attention to incoming data on expectations,   compensation, and core inflation  If they’re blinking yellow or green, we may be on track  If red   predominates, the risks have clearly escalated     It certainly seems clear that managing such risks in the near term involves placing a premium   on remaining credible regarding inflation  Doing so should moderate price growth by tightening   financial conditions and should result in better pricing of risk  It should also convince consumers   that inflation will not continue to exacerbate the growing strain on their pocketbooks  It should   moderate inflation expectations and limit the feed-through into wage and salary growth   But we also need to take care not to overdo  There are downside risks  With a small amount   of additional tightening in the mix, the Greenbook sees growth at below potential in late ’06, a   widening output gap in ’07, and a tick up in unemployment  One key cause of this is a general                                      November 1, 2005 45 of 114  slowing in real estate markets and a decline in relative household wealth  The related expected rise   in personal saving may be just what the doctor ordered to start the process of reining in the excesses   in the US economy, but I think we do need to take care about dispensing excessive amounts of   inflation medicine     In my view, we’re not at a tipping point as yet  Our process of measured steps toward   removing the remaining accommodation should continue for a time, taking us closer to the middle   of the range of equilibrium rates  But we should also begin to consider when we might have moved   enough and how we might prepare markets for that  In that regard, I was interested in the proposal   that President Yellen had for an evolution in our statement  I think it’s going to take some time to   absorb what she has recommended  Maybe this meeting is not the meeting to make a change  I’m   probably comfortable with alternative B  A couple of meetings ago, the Chairman suggested that I   take on the task—because I was opening my mouth at the time—of putting some proposals on the   table, and I’ve been dragging my heels  I’m more than happy to work with President Yellen on the   direction she’s trying to take the statement  Thank you  "
5740,2005-11-01,"  I support your recommendation as well  And I’d like to think that this   discussion will get in the minutes so that if the words change in December—let me put some odds   on the fact that they will change somehow—it won’t come as a big surprise to people     Well, should we take some of your thoughts in terms of how the minutes   are written?  My understanding of what you said—and what I think I heard around the table,                                         November 1, 2005 94 of 114  although not explicitly—was that the statement would have a sense of greater uncertainty about it    It would be moving in the direction of not promising as much going forward  Now, maybe I’m   reading too much into what you said    Yes    Then it’s not a surprise; if something different comes out, it would be the   result of an ongoing discussion  "
5784,2005-12-13,"  Well, at the risk of going back into a discussion that I think President   Santomero began and President Poole picked up on, I was struck by the slow pace of hiring that is in   your projection  You have job gains going from 85,000 a month in the second half of next year to   50,000 per month in 2007  Having come through the last three or four years, numbers like that in   monthly employment data would be cause for concern, and yet we still have growth not that far below   potential  We have structural productivity growing, a narrowing of the output gap, and   unemployment staying about stable—the difference being this rise in compensation per hour creating   enough income to support the demand side of it  You probably have talked enough about this but I   found that slowness in the pace of hiring a little disturbing after what we’ve been through  And I   wondered what your thoughts were about it  Maybe I’m just asking the same question that Tony was   asking in terms of the risks to consumer spending    To keep pace with the growth in the labor force    Right    Yes I wondered about that as a downside risk  The numbers jumped out at   me, even recognizing your take on labor force participation  Thank you     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I think a fair reading of New   England’s economy is that it continues to be a bit weaker than the nation’s as a whole  To be sure,   this sense is skewed by conditions in Massachusetts, which alone accounts for about half of the   region’s employment  Nonfarm employment declined again in October after a somewhat bigger drop   in September, softening the region’s year-over-year job growth rate to about half of the nation’s as a   whole But Massachusetts accounted for more than the recent net losses, with job gains in all of the   other states acting to offset drops in the Bay State  Other indicators of state health show similar   patterns  In particular, the Philadelphia Fed’s coincident index shows growth in Massachusetts   flattening while growth in the other five states is accelerating   A question one could ask, and one that I’ve been asking myself, is whether employment data   and indices derived largely from measures of job growth correctly provide the best sense of the   overall climate of a regional economy—and in the case of Massachusetts, a state economy—that is   driven increasingly by high value-added industries whose employment patterns reflect cycles of   innovation more than traditional business cycles  Contacts in the high-tech, biotech, and software   worlds all indicate that business is solid and that money to expand is freely available  Depending on   the product, growth is either occurring or in the works, but often the related hiring is planned for   lower-cost states outside New England or other countries  These businesses want their headquarters   to remain in New England  They want to strengthen their links to the research being done in the   major universities, and they regard the highly skilled labor that they need in their research activities as                      December 13, 2005 39 of 100  hard to find and increasingly expensive  But when they expand more broadly, they are choosing to   expand elsewhere   Thus, there are areas of strength and weakness in some of the regional data  The states of the   region seem to be doing pretty well fiscally, and that reflects the profitability of many of these high-  tech types of businesses But businesses that thrive on growing job counts, like commercial office   markets, seem quite slow  And personal income tax collections are lagging a bit, at least relative to   what the states have projected in their budgets  Somewhat surprisingly, consumer confidence has   ticked up a bit despite the flat job picture, and residential real estate markets still seem strong, though   the high end has lost a bit of steam  Travel and tourism has its tos and fros  The fall wasn’t   particularly good for leaf peeping, but the winter looks not bad because there has been some early   snowfall for skiing   The region is going to bear the brunt of high energy costs this winter, given its dependence on   heating oil and expensive natural gas for electricity generation  That probably is the reason why   overall business confidence has softened a bit  In my expectation, the region may well continue to lag   the nation in job growth, but should prove resilient through the winter months  I think the mix of its   industries is not only providing resilience to the region but also an ongoing impetus to the productivity   growth we see for the nation as a whole   Incoming data since the last Committee meeting were on the high side of our expectations and   provided welcome assurance that at least for the time being the energy shock, hurricane destruction,   and slight softening in housing markets did little to impede the underlying forward momentum of the   national economy  And the recent robust data on productivity growth provide even more assurance   that this pace of underlying momentum is occurring at a time when there may be more rather than less   capacity  Indeed, if one assumes less of a downward trend in labor force participation than the                                  December 13, 2005 40 of 100  Greenbook projection, which is certainly in the realm of the possible, available capacity could be even   greater   Our forecast is perhaps not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook’s, but it does see the same   two rather distinct economic phases over the forecast horizon  In the near term, after a bit of a dip in   the fourth quarter, which may not be much of a dip at this point, growth accelerates as hurricane   rebuilding proceeds, federal spending increases, energy price growth rates flatten, and inventories are   rebuilt Then by mid-2006, the economy slows, as tighter monetary policy puts a crimp in real estate   markets, the personal saving rate ticks up, as we hope it does, and the fiscal impulse wanes  During   the near term, inflation pressures are expected to be more significant, with some pass-through of high   energy costs to core inflation  Over the medium term, these pressures ease   It’s certainly possible for surprises on either side of this baseline  That is, we could see   inflation around longer than we now expect or, on the opposite side, we could see demand falter, with   consumer retrenchment in the face of slower hiring  I continue to believe that managing the risks of   rising prices reduces the potential cost of mistakes, and that suggests some further tightening  But   how long that will be necessary, in my view anyway, is uncertain  "
5785,2005-12-13,"  I support your recommendation, too  You know, in the e-mail discussions   that have gone on with regard to the various iterations of this statement, I think a lot of interesting   ideas have come out  And they all revolve around where we are on the spectrum in terms of the   question Are we close to the end of this current tightening cycle?  Has the campaign really changed?   And it’s a campaign with a lot more forward momentum than some of us might have agreed with   For quite a while I have been of the view that inflation trends, though they popped up with   energy, seemed moderate overall on the core rate  I’ve felt that low underlying interest rates were   encouraging risk-taking in markets that would be inappropriate at some point  And that’s been one   reason why I’ve thought that the track we’ve been on now for thirteen meetings or so was the right   track I continue to believe that  And I was picking up some flavor of that in your discussion of your   thinking; I have some sense of agreement with what you said, to the extent that I followed all of it   So I’m in the camp that’s perfectly comfortable with the alternative B formulation  I’m not in   the camp that thinks we might need a new campaign here  I would think that some further tightening   is consistent with risk minimization, given overall market psychology right now and given what we   see in our forecast   As I thought about the various formulations of alternative B that we’ve been presented with, I   thought there were a lot of different issues at stake, not just the word “measured”  One was whether   we should remove the reference to “accommodative”  I came out on balance that we should remove   “accommodative,” given that I think we’re currently in a range where we’re unsure that we will need   a whole lot more tightening and, therefore, we’re probably less accommodative than we were two or                                       December 13, 2005 74 of 100  three meetings ago  Removing “accommodative” could be taken in the other direction, though  By   taking out “accommodative” markets could say, “Aha!  They are on a campaign upwards”   Regardless of where they think the current sense of policy is, they could believe that we might want to   be even more aggressive  But I think the rest of the statement moderates that possibility sufficiently   that taking out “accommodative” is consistent with my thinking   Then there were some other alternatives that came up in the discussions back and forth  We   had been using productivity growth on the demand side as a demand accelerator  You can think of   the way we see productivity growth currently as an expansion of supply and, therefore, a cushion   against inflation  And a couple of people did suggest that  To me that had some appeal  I’m not   going to suggest modifying the statement online or in the meeting here, but if we continue to see an   expansion of productivity moving forward and it is a cushion against inflation, this is something we   might want to think about as a factor to add to our assessment of the current situation   Should we use the word “some” to modify “measured policy firming”?  A lot of people   thought we should, and it ended up getting into alternative B  I think that’s the right way to go    Should we retain “measured”?  I could live with “measured” being there; I could live with taking it   out With the use of “some,” I think it’s a little easier to keep it in because to me it has less of a   feeling that “measured” means more than a couple additional policy tightenings   And finally, the statement uses “likely” in the reference to further tightening moves—that   “some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed”  That may be a little more positive   about the number of further moves than I’m comfortable with  I can go with it  I could also go with   something like “some further measured policy firming may be needed,” which I think was President   Fisher’s formulation                                     December 13, 2005 75 of 100  So all in all, I’m in agreement  I think we could go either way on five or six of these different   words  Taken together, the proposed language says what I’d like to say  That is, it says we’re at a   point where there’s enough uncertainty about whether we’re accommodative or not that we can take   “accommodative” out And we’re sending a message that we may tighten a couple more times, but   we’re certainly going to look at the data and weigh both of our underlying goals  So that’s a long-  winded way of saying I agree with you  [Laughter]  "
5829,2006-01-31,"  I just wanted to note that I meet on Monday mornings before Open   Market Committee meetings with a few pension fund managers and mutual fund managers just to   hear what they’re hearing in the markets  They are very much on the same wave length that you   were, Mr Chairman, in feeling that the flatness of the yield curve was largely due to the desire for   long-dated securities in the pension fund arena to better match assets and liabilities and that it was   not at all, or at least not in major part, a comment about the economy but more a function of   institutional and market demand for these long-dated securities  Now, I don’t know whether they   think that the legislation now in the Congress is going to pass, but they seem to be very focused on   the fact that they need more longer-dated securities and that supplies of the thirty-year would, in   effect, create more demand for the thirty-year       I agree with you, but the fund managers that I have talked with would   frame the problem in the context of increasing pressure from the outside     Yes  That’s certainly what the fund managers were saying  "
5830,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There’s not a lot new in New England  So I   thought I’d just skip over my usual probably more-lengthy-than-necessary comments on the region    Let me just mention a couple of things, though  Employment growth is still slower, and income   growth is still slower than that of the nation  Our regional unemployment rate went up rather than   down over the past year, and we have seen some slowing in residential real estate markets    However, surprisingly enough, there seems to be a good deal of optimism in discussions we have   had with people about business spending and about commercial real estate markets  So, for the first   time in five or six years, we’ve actually had net absorption of space, both downtown and in the   suburbs  That situation is making a big difference in the smiles on people’s faces around town  I   hope it means that New England is getting back and moving along the same trajectory as the nation   Turning to the nation, we, like most observers, were surprised at the modest growth rate of   the economy in the fourth quarter  But we, like almost everybody else, believe that the reduced   pace of government spending and smaller-than-expected inventory investment that affected the   fourth quarter are likely to be temporary and reflect issues of timing rather than overall economic   strength  Thus, we, too, anticipate a slightly stronger first quarter this year than we had before  But   our forecast takes the same basic trajectory over the balance of ’06 and ’07—that is, strength in the   January 31, 2006 37 of 106    first half of ’06 and then moderation as the effect of tighter monetary policy, cooling housing   markets, and less fiscal stimulus takes hold  This is the same trajectory as that in the Greenbook   However, as we look at GDP, our forecast for ’07 is slower—½ percent or a little bit less—  than the forecast for ’06, reflecting an expected outright decline in housing investment  We also see   inflation trending off both this year and next, with core PCE inflation never above 2 percent over the   two-year period  I mean, not “never,” which is a strong word, but at the points we’re mapping    Some of this difference in price pressures is accounted for by a sense of a somewhat greater supply   of labor resources, as reflected in a slightly lower NAIRU and a higher labor force participation rate   Looking at these forecasts and assessing all the data and anecdotal inputs I have received   since the last meeting, I am struck by a couple of things  First, these forecasts, and the vast majority   of those available from other sources, describe an almost ideal outcome  US demand is strong but   slowing, as consumers save more and borrow less  Fiscal stimulus diminishes, business spending   remains solid, employment grows, inflation edges off, and foreign growth is spurred by domestic   demand at last and acts to create some export growth, though we continue to have a widening   current account deficit  If these forecasts were to be realized, it would truly be just about the best of   outcomes, and I would agree with President Yellen—a major sweet spot as the Chairman hands   over the reins   But that scenario sort of begs the question of risks, both large and small, and how they are   balanced  We could certainly be surprised by new energy shocks or geopolitical events of such   magnitude to cause financial turmoil and consumer and business retrenchment  We could also   witness the turbulence that could accompany a sharp unwinding of the nation’s ever-growing   external deficit  But you don’t have to focus on major upsets  Risks of a lesser proportion loom as   well  We could very well be wrong about the remaining capacity in labor markets, and the resulting   January 31, 2006 38 of 106    upward pressure on wages and salaries could create a more rapid pace of inflation, particularly   given the solid pace of external growth and pressures on a range of commodity prices  To date,   however, the growth of wages and salaries has been on the slow side, particularly relative to   productivity, and there is little evidence that firms believe they have the pricing power to pass on   much more than energy surcharges  Indeed, their profit margins suggest that they have a cushion   against increases in input costs  Alternatively, the impact of a cooling housing market could take a   larger bite out of consumption than we now expect and cause a greater-than-projected, though   welcome, increase in personal saving  This would, of course, slow the economy from baseline and   damp price pressures  We haven’t seen this yet either, but it could be just as likely as missing on the   inflation side   Thus, as I look at both the upside and downside risks, they seem to me to be more balanced   than they have been  As some evidence of this, both the Greenbook and the fed funds futures   markets anticipate that policy is near a tipping point—move a bit more now and then retrench in late   ’06 or early ’07   I also find myself beginning to wonder about the cost of being wrong  When policy was   arguably much more accommodative, it seemed to me that letting inflation get out of hand might be   harder to deal with and ultimately more damaging to the economy than if growth slipped a bit  That   may still be true  But just as our credibility regarding price stability is important in setting market   expectations so, too, is some sense that policy will be supportive of growth when the threat of rising   inflation is less imminent  In short, we need to be credible about achieving both our goals  At this   point, another nudge toward a policy rate that neither stimulates nor restrains the economy seems   appropriate  But the need for further moves seems to me to be increasingly driven by the incoming   data   January 31, 2006 39 of 106   "
5831,2006-01-31,"  The clock, I mean, it has stopped [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am comfortable with your proposal to   move 25 basis points today  I am also comfortable with this language  I actually could have gone   with an even shorter formulation that was on page 22 of the Bluebook, which basically combined   rows four and five and didn’t make reference to the need to move further  But all things being   January 31, 2006 74 of 106    equal, taking “well” out probably goes a bit in that direction  So I’m comfortable with the way it is    Fifty-fifty?  I don’t know  I am not sure that it is a 50–50 chance, but maybe it is  So I am okay   with that   On the ownership of the statement, what President Santomero said resonated with me  I   think there is a halfway path here, and the issue needs a little more conversation  I don’t think it’s   something we should decide now  So we should stay with the status quo   I’d also like to raise some concern if Monday–Tuesday is going to become commonplace    Monday is a hard day, particularly if you’re not going to give us the Greenbooks and the Bluebooks   until late the week before  I think the timing puts a lot of pressure on everybody that we could   alleviate by going with Tuesday–Wednesday     Okay  Thank you  "
