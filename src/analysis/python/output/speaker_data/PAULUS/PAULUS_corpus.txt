  I think President Balles is absolutely right, that there are severe limitations  imposed on the analysis by the type of experiment that we undertook  Without designing a  different kind of experiment, I think it’s very difficult to say with any certainty what the  cumulative effect of hitting the nonborrowed reserves target would be on control of the monetary  aggregates  But I have no disagreements with anything that he said    SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, I think I should add, if we did circulate the paper that was  circulated to the Committee about last June or July by Mr Kalchbrenner, [it would] demonstrate  that over a six-month period, nonborrowed reserve targets would permit you to hit the aggregates  reasonably well  However, that paper also demonstrated that a federal funds target would have  about the same results  We couldn’t differentiate between the two in any significant way on the  basis of the data presented there
