277,1988-08-16," I'm completely in agreement with the analysis of the strength of the economy I feel a little bit like I was in a vehicle that was accelerating down the road and I have an instinctive desire to hit the brakes a little bit and snub it down But the thing that worries me is that I think the road's a little slipperier than it looks in the sense that there's some fragility in the infrastructure of the economy  First of all, consumers have a heck of a lot of debt And the most recent instruments of that debt--equity credit lines, as we call them--I think have been abused in the granting throughout a large part of the industry I think there's a significant danger that if we got into any kind of a downturn in the economy we could have a lot of consumers in a considerable amount of trouble in that particular area, because they've converted other kinds of debt to equity credit lines  Probably more important, however, is the heavy debt structure in the corporate sector If you were to look at as many of these leveraged buyouts and takeover schemes as I have, you would find that in a lot of these the cash flows that are designed to service the debt that's involved are very skinny indeed And they depend on a relatively stable interest rate structure and the ability over a reasonably short period of time to liquidate assets in order to get debt down to manageable levels Well, it seems to me that a significant increase in interest rates--even one as modest as the one described in the Greenbook--over the next 12 months or so could create some major problems, at least for some of the situations that I've seen And that could have a very sobering effect, it seems to me, on the overall economy through the problems that would be incurred by some very large companies  Another one that I guess tends to slip out of our minds occasionally is the real estate situation It has been getting better, not only in the banks--which have increased their capital in order to sustain the possible losses in this area--but also in the country generally The country has been benefiting from lower interest rates and the ability to restructure some of that It seems to me that a lot of that ground that has been gained could be lost if the cost of servicing that debt goes up significantly, as it would because much of it is denominated in variable rates Finally, this thrift situation--an aspect of which we intend to discuss at the luncheon today--has not gone away It's getting worse And a significant increase in the cost of money to these troubled thrifts is just going to accelerate the rate of loss in that industry  When you take all of those in the aggregate, it seems to me if we snub the brakes too hard and too fast, or oversteer this vehicle, we have a risk of going into the ditch All I'm suggesting is that, while I think snubbing the brakes and being prepared to do so is important, I think we have to keep a very close eye on what the effects of significantly higher interest rates could be and be ready to ease up quickly if that happens I'm not sure I understand all of the terms like asymmetrical language and so forth, but I certainly  -41-    8/16/88  would support the $600 million target on borrowings And I'd lean more toward the borrowings and reserve targets as opposed to either the funds rates or, with due respect to my friend Governor Angell, the aggregates "
328,1988-09-20, No 
329,1988-09-20," Mike, I'm having difficulty understanding the consistency between your interest rate forecast and the forecast for further downward pressure on the dollar Help me with that one   Thank you "
330,1988-09-20," I do, too No comments "
389,1988-11-01," Mr Truman, the oil projection is a very important part of this whole forecast and I heard you as you were going through your conjectures about OPEC talking about I think three different levels of projections and prices Could you replay that for me just so I'm sure I understand what you said   From the 21 million?   I guess I share the feeling of several of you that inflation is more likely to create a need for further tightening as we go forward rather than the other way around But I don't think that the decision is going to be any easier when we finally have to take it I think it's going to be more difficult because of the increasing elements of fragility in our financial system, which would react very badly to anything that threw us into any kind of recession These leveraged buyouts and takeover loans are so delicately balanced, in terms of cash flow on certain assumptions about revenue flows and interest rate levels and the ability to dispose of assets in order to get debt back down to manageable levels, that if there's any hesitation in the economy or any significant downturn in the economy, those could be thrown into very bad straits And I don't think that's going to get any better as it goes along, nor is the thrift crisis going to be less sensitive to that kind of thing I don't think there's enough evidence to move in a tighter direction at the moment, but it's going to be a tough decision to make if and when we have to make it because of these other elements  The second thing that worries me is whether we are able to control or manage the decline of the dollar by nominal intervention in the foreign exchange markets If these markets ever become persuaded that intervention isn't going to do the job, and there is a real flight from dollar-denominated assets, particularly securities, it seems to me that either we're going to have to begin consciously to defend the dollar with interest rates or it's going to get automatically defended because the financing of our deficit is going to be thrown back into domestic markets that will drive interest rates up in any case Those are the two things that worry me most about the current situation, and yet I'm not persuaded that we should significantly change our course at this stage of the game "
390,1988-11-01, I agree and support the asymmetric language 
450,1989-03-28," I have a question Sam, is the $12 billion a big enough kitty for you or do you--?   You don't see any immediate circumstances that would likely put you in a position where you'd have to ask for a special meeting in order to enlarge that limit?   Okay I wasn't trying to sell you anything   Thank you, Mr Chairman "
451,1989-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman I can't remember when I was more concerned about the confusion of the signals that I'm reading or as uncertain about my own conclusions But I guess I feel  -38-    3/28/89  that the economy is a lot mushier and that there are more risks inherent in it than most of you around the table do I'm kind of like the guy who's gone into the saloon to play poker and is willing to check his sixgun at the door and accept the key as the alternative But I'd like to keep a derringer in my watch pocket So, I'm in favor of the asymmetric language   Yes, sir "
513,1989-05-16," Exactly   As so often happens, Governor Johnson has made most of my speech for me I would only like to add that I think further tightness may only aggravate some of the problems that we have In the first place, I don't feel that the wage and price pressures that are already there are going to respond or be damped by higher interest rates I think the pressures for wage increases were built in a year ago And some of the price pressures are really not part of a controllable environment because they are related to oil prices or to drought-increased food prices It doesn't seem to me that further restraint helps those pressures; on the other hand, [additional restraint] may be counterproductive in that it discourages further investment and may result in further price increases because of the higher cost of capital So I think this is not the time either to ease up on the brakes or to stamp down on them any harder I agree with your balance concept "
514,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman ""B;"" $600 million; symmetry  -42-    5/16/89   That's really symmetric "
571,1989-08-22," Yes, I've been sitting here trying to figure out how I could get through this without having to say anything, because of the sense of--   Well, that's about right too There is a sense of frustration that one gets having sat here now for a year in these meetings We have done so well on so much of this, yet we are still looking at inflation levels which are unacceptable, I think, and that is the principal thing that frustrates me and makes me feel kind of helpless in this process At the same time, I am convinced that if the only way to really knock inflation down is to have a recession, that's a very unwelcomed alternative option We talk about a soft landing, but this kind of landing looks more to me like being stuck in the mud I question whether the very low rate of growth and the relatively high rate of inflation create the kind of environment that encourages the investment in the economy that we need to get out of our trade deficit problems and to generate the kind of growth that we all are anxious to have, with improvement in productivity and so forth So, I'm at a loss to make that fatal decision as to which are the more important considerations and where the greater risk lies On balance, I'm more concerned that the risk is greater on the down side than it is on the up side So, I'm more worried at the moment about an acceleration in the decline of the rate of growth than I am about stimulating further inflationary pressures But in the context of all that, I am concerned that we can't make any progress on the inflation front, at least during the time horizon that we are looking at here in the Greenbook   No, we need some help "
572,1989-08-22," I strongly support ""B"" and I would prefer asymmetric language toward ease because I think if we need flexibility during this period it's probably going to be in that direction So, why not build it into the directive?   Question Which is bigger, ""somewhat"" or ""slightly""?   ""Somewhat"" is bigger Okay then, do we really want to use ""somewhat"" or do we want to use ""slightly""?   And ""slightly lesser reserve restraint"" on the other side   No, asymmetric  -46-    8/22/89   Yes   Probably "
633,1989-10-03," We are not all going to answer that separately, are we?   They might come to that conclusion anyway if they examine the costs of getting there They may say ""Oh, no way are we going to pay that price"" That's the danger on the other side "
634,1989-10-03," Well, I'm kind of sorry I didn't get in ahead of President Corrigan because he summed up so perfectly my own views of what some of the risk factors are in the near future--accidents looking for a place to happen I'm very concerned about the fact that the outlook is for sluggishness with no real progress on any of our major problems It seems to me that the greatest fragility in what we see going on right now is the possible effects of the dollar's behavior While I understand that solving the current account crisis and the trade crisis is a necessary part of our planning, or hopeful planning, it seems to me that it is not going to get solved all by itself just by driving the value of the dollar down The dollar is behaving right now like a strong swimmer But sooner or later, even the strongest swimmer is going to go the bottom if you push his head under water again every time he comes to the surface And I worry that any kind of a free fall in the dollar in the near future could drive people away from dollar-denominated securities and reverse this interest rate structure very dramatically by forcing the financing of our deficits back into our own markets And that would rob us of the monetary policy flexibility that we need in order to keep some sort of an even keel through this perilous period So I'm worried, and that's the issue that I have come to focus on--worried and frustrated, I guess, sums it up "
635,1989-10-03," I'm strongly in favor of alternative B I think the risks of easing because of the dollar situation are significant Therefore, I would prefer the symmetrical language   Martha, the Bluebook says that ""A"" is related to a 50 basis point drop Would that change your view on that?   Okay "
690,1989-11-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman I must say that I can't find any fault with the Greenbook projection except that it's not what I'd like to see   It's particularly discouraging to see a projection of further significant deterioration in the employment numbers coupled with no projected improvement in the inflation rate, at least as measured by the CPI We have in the Greenbook here a two- year look toward the near nirvana of stable prices that we have subscribed to, with no progress toward that end And that means that we're 40 percent of the way there without having gotten there yet It makes one wonder, given the lackluster economy that's projected here, if the only way to see less inflation is recession And I don't like that At the same time, that's coupled with information about corporate profits that, even adjusted for the losses of the banks in the third quarter due to [loan loss] provisioning, are certainly not very robust And when corporate profits are being constrained by narrower margins [unintelligible]--and these are not just confined to the automobile industry, they are widespread across American industry today--then you have to start hacking away at the costs And the first place you start that is with employment We're seeing it in computers; we're seeing it in autos; we're seeing it in banks; and we're beginning to see some evidence of it, I think, in the defense industry If we haven't already, it certainly looks like it's coming down the trail At the same time, we have a number of fragilities that remain out there the banks; the overhang in the real estate markets with the RTC situation; and even some other areas which have looked until very recently to be a lot healthier And then of course  -25-    11/14/89  you have the punk-junk market, which I think is balanced on a very thin knife's edge Recession to my way of thinking is a decidedly dangerous alternative because I think the bulwarks by which we try to insulate ourselves or our industries against external shock are very thin And if the economy in fact is any softer underneath than the Greenbook would seem to indicate, then we may be closer to the edge of the abyss than was indicated And with that, I'm sure you can hear my dove-like wings flapping on the bridges "
691,1989-11-14," Yes, Mr Chairman, I favor ""B"" asymmetric; I probably could tilt a little more toward asymmetric than we have in the past, but I'll leave it the way it is   Yes "
752,1990-03-27, I withdraw 
753,1990-03-27," Mr Chairman, I'm persuaded that the Greenbook forecast is a very reasonable one, given the underlying assumptions; the interest rate construct, which is part of that, is certainly reasonable I'm dismayed at the lack of progress that it reflects with regard to inflation But my underlying concern at the moment-- and this may sound like a disbeliever in the omnipotence of monetary policy--is that we may have witnessed here a transfer of at least part of the control of the growth of the economy as a result of this extraordinarily stringent application of examination standards to the banks I'm concerned that that will, in fact, cause a contraction of credit that may deal a greater blow to inflation than our current policy I think that in that kind of environment the supplying of  -34-    3/27/90  reserves and reducing of rates will not necessarily encourage expansion I guess I'd end by paraphrasing an old saw and say ""You can offer a banker wider spreads, but you can't make him lend"" "
754,1990-03-27," ""B"" symmetric "
810,1990-05-15, I'll move it 
811,1990-05-15," At a higher price   Mr Chairman, on the local economy Potomac, Maryland is generally doing quite well However, the residential market is way overbuilt, overdesigned, and overpriced But consumer confidence remains high and the public is generally blase about inflation as evidenced by the continued good business done by the Sutton Place Gourmet!   I continue to be concerned, though, about the ability of policy to deal with inflation At the same time, I don't believe we have a lot of maneuvering room because we are in a precarious position I believe on the one hand that we have the risk of higher inflation and on the other hand that we're very close to the possibility of tipping over into recession I think the risk, if we go into recession, is greater than the risk of more inflation because I suspect that the underlying structure of inflation is not as firm or as high as may have been indicated by some of the recent statistics  I think that the credit crunch is real, and I don't think it's necessarily confined to real estate I'm convinced that it's going to get worse and that it is not necessarily the result of the regulators; I think it's a general concern on the part of lenders about lending, about capital ratios, as well as about tougher examination standards So, I just don't see that going away, with all due respect for the regulators recently urging the lenders to lend more money I think the real estate market is under identified pressure and also some that hasn't shown up yet Included in the latter, I would say, is the RTC situation; if this accelerates, short term we're going to get an even further depression of real estate values And I think there's some real buyer resistance out there with regard to the price structure, particularly with that RTC overhang I don't think that has adjusted itself And I'm concerned that in a recession situation, the change in revenue flows would really tank some of these [firms involved heavily in] junk [financing] situations and that the ripple effect of that kind of a credit problem would be very severe On the whole, I think the downside risks are quite severe, and I'm frustrated about inflation on the other side On balance, I just don't think this is the time to make a change  -20-    5/15/90 "
812,1990-05-15," ""B"" symmetric "
854,1990-08-21," In general, I would like to identify myself with President Boehne's remarks In spite of the fact that the consumer confidence figures are terribly volatile and not necessarily reliable in the long term, they are cause for a reasonable amount of alarm on my part because we have such a consumer-driven economy I think we're very close to the edge of that cliff; if it's not a cliff, it's a steep decline I'm concerned that if we do lapse into recession, certain weak elements in the economy could accelerate The real estate mess could be a real collapse on a much broader front than it currently is The further losses that a recession would imply for the banking system would further undermine the banks at a time when many of them are on skinny ground as it is Corporate profits remain very disappointing The debt burden of the private sector is heavy and, obviously, the burden of servicing that debt in a declining economy is going to be much greater I have no confidence that the oil price  -28-    8/21/90  rise will be contained or that it will begin to decline due to offsets from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates, etc I'm not sure that they really are going to come on stream as advertised and that they will be sustained Part of it depends on the duration of the Iraq crisis and I think that's an imponderable Short is obviously good even if it's a shooter; long is very serious whether or not it's a shooter because of the effect on the economy and the possibility of permanent or at least longer-term impairment of the flow of oil The dilemma is that the external circumstances have threatened growth and at the same time stimulated inflation And the challenge for us is that movement against one exacerbates the other, whichever way we go And the whole situation is seriously complicated by the vulnerability of the dollar and the possible consequences of a free fall in the dollar to the financing of the deficit--and the deficit may be growing at the same time So, those are comments that don't lead us anywhere, but they describe what I am thinking about at any rate "
855,1990-08-21," Well, instinct and intuition both tilt me toward ease and sooner rather than later But the cautionary comments that you made persuade me that, as long as we monitor the situation carefully and closely and are prepared to move quickly, your recommendation is appropriate So I join in supporting it "
913,1990-10-02," Sam, at the other end of the spectrum, what set of circumstances might create a run on the dollar?   Thank you "
914,1990-10-02," I won't presume on the Committee to try to restate or recite all of my views at this point You have all heard my concerns about the fragility of the financial system Perhaps I can shorten my remarks by simply associating myself strongly with both Ed Boehne's statement and Jerry Corrigan's statement In addition, I think that the banks are really scared and have become super cautious I think bankers are demoralized I've been talking to a lot of bankers in all parts of the country over the last several weeks and I have never seen them [exhibit] a lower sense of optimism and    10/2/90  bewilderment as to where to go from here And that will make the credit crunch worse in the future than it is at present, particularly if there are signs that the economy actually is going into a period of recession Perhaps under those conditions, the momentum in a downturn might be very surprising and might cause the recession to last longer and go deeper  I have to say that, being a cynic, I believe that the budget deal is a sham and a delusion If you had walked across the Sahara Desert without a canteen, you would think the water in Boston Harbor was [potable] [Laughter] And yet, in thinking or contemplating any move toward ease as a result of the perceived window that we have here because the markets have reacted favorably to this budget agreement, I worry about the dollar because we have an environment of rising interest rates elsewhere in the world against the contrast of perhaps lower rates here and a softer economy, which is less inviting to investors Yet I think a case might be made that perhaps at least some modest move toward ease has already been discounted in the exchange value of the dollar So, I'm concerned that perhaps this is the time to make a very slight move toward a bit more accommodation "
915,1990-10-02," But you are suggesting a second 25 basis point [move] when the budget agreement is wrapped up?   Well, I favor your recommendation, Mr Chairman, but I regret deeply that it will look like an endorsement of this non- agreement, which I cynically still have great doubts about   Excuse me, are you suggesting that whatever second move might happen would be subject to a [conference] call? "
977,1990-11-13," How big would the discount window borrowing have to be in order to create a problem? Assuming, let's say, that all or rather a quarter of the collateral wasn't as nice as you'd like to see--   If you have the leeway to call for consultation any time you wish in any case, I don't see that we need the sentence at all On the other hand--I'm learning, Bob, about what economists mean by ""on the other hand""--if it is necessary to say something it seems to me that we could use option 4 with one word change We could say ""The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if economic and financial developments appear to be diverging significantly from Committee expectations"" Significantly is a qualitative word rather than a quantitative word; substantially is quantitative And that gives you complete flexibility to determine that some trend line is significant or not significant and doesn't in any way inhibit you; and at the same time it does say something if we feel compelled to say something But I could vote for eliminating it completely "
978,1990-11-13," Ted, in your analysis you referred to a 5 percent further drop in the value of the dollar I presume that that's based on the same interest rate assumption that is, that we keep the fed funds rate and other rates about where they are   Okay Now, the Bluebook refers to a further sharp drop in the dollar if we go to a sharp reduction in rates Can you give us some idea of what that expectation is--what quantification you put on that?   All right, but I'm still trying to pin you down a little  -20-    11/13/90   All right, let me ask a simpler question To what extent does the current level of the dollar reflect a forward discounting of expectations of further easing--in other words, another quarter point on the funds rate?   Yet it's a very important part of making this decision today   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Potomac district is decidedly mixed Real estate is very sloppy with hardly any construction going on and over 100 houses on the market with no bidders Retail sales are very soft and gasoline prices are much too high   This is the Potomac district, so it is the 13th district   Turning to the national economy, I guess I'm in a policy quandary at the moment I'm convinced that these gloomy consumer attitudes will be reflected this quarter in retail sales, with the exception perhaps of the luxury items that will be subject to tax after the first of the year and may be moved back into the quarter But perhaps that argues that the first quarter will be a little softer Corporate profits, although they're a little better in the third quarter than predicted, are still far from robust and are very spotty Add to that the problems of the airlines and anybody else involved with energy and it seems to me that there is a lot of pressure there Capital markets at least in the near term are increasingly closed to the banks and I think that potentially is going to create some very severe problems for the banking system, not just in real capital but also perhaps in short-term funding In all probability, I don't believe that the banks will lend us back into growth at least until they see some improvement in earnings, understand and know how to deal with the current regulatory constraints, and feel comfortable with their capital ratios What I'm implying is that this downsizing that is being undertaken to either get capital ratios to the minimums or to build additional cushions is going to continue And that's not consistent with pro-growth lending in my opinion I think recession obviously has real downside risks due to the often cited fragilities, and I've probably cited them more often than anybody On the other hand, an easier policy would put the dollar at risk, and I'm convinced that the implications of a very weak dollar--a flight from dollar securities--in the midst of this bad image that we have projected of disarray in terms of political leadership could have long-term consequences that would be uncontrollable from the standpoint of monetary or even fiscal policy And I think that the psychological attitudes out there right now, which we hear being expressed not only by consumers but also by businessmen and bankers, may prevent any ease from being stimulative in the long run So, the possible contradictory effects of policy moves in either direction leave me in a quandary as to where to go from here I guess that sums up where I am "
979,1990-11-13, I support it   They'll assume that we're going back to Ml 
1038,1990-12-18," Mr Chairman, one of the advantages of waiting until almost the end is that you could just say ""Me too"" because everything has pretty much been said But I can't resist the opportunity to make a comment or two about the Greenbook forecast It seems to me that oil is the major wild card in that forecast And I'm uncomfortable with the assumptions that either the situation is going to stabilize in the Middle East or get better, which would bring oil prices down and keep them down That seems to be an important part of the recovery [forecast] It might have been useful in this special case to have had an alternative forecast that might suggest what would happen if there were hostilities in the Middle East or if the Saudi production capacity had been damaged in some fashion which would create, for example, an oil price of $40 a barrel and keep it there for a while I think that would significantly prolong the timing of the recovery The other wild card, it seems to me, is the credit crunch, which I think except for the comments around the table has been dismissed rather casually And yet we have in at least one part of the country a credit paralysis that is affecting the whole economy and shows no signs of reversal And I think that serious impairment is spreading down the East coast Bankers clearly are worried and scared and certainly are unwilling to lend in major parts of the country And consumers are worried And Messrs Littan, Brumbaugh, and Seidman and the media are doing their best to raise that worry to the level of sheer terror I think that terror relates to consumer attitudes toward banks and toward investment and spending and getting further in debt And since we have such a consumer-driven economy, it's hard for me to see a rapid upturn until those consumer attitudes have changed My best guess would be that those consumer attitudes will not change significantly until the Middle East situation is settled one way or another and until the banking situation is  -26-    12/18/90  perceived as being stabilized I think those are the underlying concerns that are haunting consumers, and I don't think those attitudes are going to turn markedly more optimistic until those two factors have been addressed "
1039,1990-12-18," I'm not clear on why you think they must move in lock step There has been a disparate relationship as long as I can remember between the discount rate and the fed funds rate We've been operating for two weeks at least at a 1/4 point [spread between the two rates] We operated at 300 basis points for a while Why would the assumption be that we would drop both by the same amount?   Well, I don't know why we should feel our hands are tied because of that   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman The only thing I'd add is that I feel quite strongly that under the circumstances there is very little chance that this particular policy directive would lead us to overshoot the mark "
1094,1991-03-26," Well, like everyone around the table, I guess, I have some sense of encouragement that we are hearing some good news Certainly, the return of consumer confidence has some promise The decline in oil prices and the projected level of oil prices has to be good for economic activity The slight uptick in retail sales is encouraging, but I have a little skepticism about it; this confidence may be enough to get people smiling and walking to the mall, but whether it has them reaching deep into their pockets for the big ticket items is another question The housing starts look better but we're still a long way from what anyone would describe as an ebullient housing market Sales of existing homes are probably one of the brightest lights and really give some glimmer of hope, even up in darkest New England On the other hand, auto sales, which are such an  -38-    3/26/91  important part of the economy, are still absolutely lousy I think that industry is considerably worried because we see all these leasing opportunities as an inducement to try to get people to do something without having to commit a lot of money up front I'm skeptical of what I've heard, at least spottily around the table, about business confidence I don't see the signs of business confidence; business profits are lousy And I think that has contributed to the fact that there is not widespread significant credit demand from the business sector In fact, we see businesses restructuring--not restructuring in the '80s style of piling on a lot of debt but rather restructuring in terms of selling assets to pay down debt, cutting expenses, laying off people, and shutting down plants And that's not exactly the kind of environment in which one expects an immediate return of a high level of business activity The very high levels of debt of both businesses and consumers are a further deterrent, particularly if people are concerned about unemployment and the possibility of being laid off All of this coupled with the remaining unsettled conditions in the banks raises some questions I think confidence is being significantly undermined by the FDIC floundering around trying to figure out how to refinance itself--and with no clear public policy direction coming from any part of the government with regard to how to do that plus the fact that there is a possibility that the inability to deal with this effectively will result in a ""taxpayer bailout,"" which will effectively scuttle the opportunity for restructuring the banking system and modernizing it All of that is creating some lack of public confidence not only in the banking system but in the deposit insurance system  Then add to that something that Governor Mullins touched on, which is that the upturn in long-term rates is more likely to be a reflection of higher inflationary expectations, and that kind of environment especially is not going to be a contributor to recovery So, I believe the downside risks remain very significant But I am also skeptical in that interest rates and interest rate adjustments may not be the effective medicine if the problems that are inherent in this economy are more psychological than financial or rational So, I'm at the point where I think it is much too early to take the punch bowl away; but at the same time I wouldn't be inclined to refill it "
1095,1991-03-26," I support the recommendation of ""B"" symmetric for all the reasons that you have so much more logically and eloquently stated than I "
1145,1991-05-14," Mr Chairman, I have been very disappointed in the fact that a rather aggressive pattern of moves toward ease over the past several months has not really resulted in much more stimulus to the economy than the refinancing of existing debt That leads me to the conclusion that perhaps we have a somewhat different kind of phenomenon here, namely that we have a real crisis of confidence that doesn't necessarily get cured by repeated signals of monetary ease I guess I'm convinced that the number of things that are acting against renewal of confidence in the economy is very significant First of all, we have genuine concerns about the health and the future of the banking system, which I think are very widespread We have corporate profits that are very disappointing We have a very heavy debt burden remaining for consumers, for businesses, and for governments--to the extent that the fiscal problems of state and municipal governments really have taken away their ability to have any stimulating effect on the economy In fact, there's an overhang of apprehension on the part of both businesses and consumers that these problems of state and local governments can only result in higher taxes or reduced services or a combination of both We have press reports of layoffs and restructurings and bankruptcies; we have lackluster performance in new orders that certainly has damped business enthusiasm for expansion And the stubborn resistance of long rates to respond to lower rates on the short end is a reflection, I think, of inflationary expectations on the part of the public I believe that, until confidence picks up in some fashion, the economy is likely to remain sluggish Therefore, that leads me to conclude that the risks in the forecast really continue to be on the down side But for the life of me I don't have a good solution as to how to stimulate that recovery in confidence "
1193,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, I had a great temptation just to associate myself completely with President Corrigan's remarks, but I can't resist the opportunity to make a few additional comments Obviously, the United States is probably less susceptible to whatever the events in the Soviet Union will bring forth than other countries At this stage it's very difficult to quantify that, but it certainly muddies the crystal ball a little regardless In spite of these glamorous mergers that were recently announced and in spite of the fact that I share Governor Angell's view that the banking system will look better in the fourth quarter and going into next year, I believe it is still fragile and still very defensive in its attitude I think there will be further large failures and that the effect of that could be to make the others, the survivors, even more defensive than they currently are Business profits remain very poor; they're disappointing And I think restructuring among business firms will continue in order to improve their ability to handle debt more comfortably And that's hardly the climate for an improved outlook for business fixed investment  I'm still convinced that the basic problem with the pace of recovery and the sustainability of recovery is one of confidence rather than the level of interest rates That is to say, I believe consumer confidence is reining in the growth in retail sales I think that business confidence is responsible for the slack demand for business credit And lender confidence is responsible for the lack of aggressive lending on the part of the banking system The credit crunch, whether it is due to a reluctance to lend or a reluctance to borrow, is a reality And it's the greatest threat to the recovery, which I believe is clearly underway at this stage of the game I think banks are enjoying their new margins and I think they intend to enjoy those new margins rather than lower rates in order to attract more business, even if policy is eased further If the banks are reluctant lenders and are well stocked with securities, they are not going to be very competitive in bidding for [retail] time deposits, and that may account for some of the recent dynamics or lack of dynamics in M2 The M2 phenomenon is not well enough understood to persuade me that it is terribly important to this whole equation and that' its current behavior would justify further policy accommodation "
1194,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, I agree with the ""B"" recommendation Like President Parry, I would prefer the symmetric language I guess I'm not persuaded that we have enough certainty about the behavior of M2 to think that we can push the button and make it happen I don't expect that the projection on the growth levels under the different scenarios is necessarily going to happen just that way So, I would prefer ""B"" symmetric   I  -41-    8/20/91 "
1245,1991-10-01," Jerry, would the removal of the primary dealer status bring the firm down?   Yes "
1246,1991-10-01," Mr Chairman, recent public attention has been focused on the banking sector being the skunk at the garden party, which is restraining more vigorous growth in the economy I have a somewhat different view I believe that the credit crunch isn't [the issue] I believe it's not so much that banks are not lending as it is that borrowers are not borrowing It is true that bankers' confidence has been badly shaken by savage examination experience, a slack economy, and stiffer capital requirements; but they can hardly abandon their basic business, which is lending money I think the anecdotal evidence favors the conclusion that it is weak demand rather than lender reluctance that accounts for the credit contraction Consumer confidence and business sector confidence are weak and are not likely to be stimulated by further interest rate changes Some solid good news about the economy is far more likely to stimulate demand than a 25 or 50 basis point cut in the fed funds rate I hope we don't lose patience with the pace of recovery if we have confidence in the staff analysis, and I do In the past, we have had a tendency to ease too much and too long; and I hope this time that we can keep our eye on the target of price stability and not over-stimulate the economy   It's half of where it was four years ago "
1247,1991-10-01," I favor ""B"" but with symmetric language, please "
1295,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, I've really been startled by the recent clouding of our otherwise perfectly clear crystal ball I also find it difficult to deal with the proposition that this is a bank- managed credit crunch that is a major factor in the continued sluggishness of the economy After all, credit extension is a two- party transaction a willing and demanding borrower and a willing and accommodating lender And lenders who have been abused for reckless lending and excessive risk-taking can hardly be criticized for a more cautious current stance As a matter of fact, I suspect that those who are complaining the most and the loudest about the unavailability of credit are the people who didn't pay back their loans last year and whose balance sheets have deteriorated substantially as a result of the economic slowdown I think businesses and consumers at this point are confused and worried by the same conflicting signals that confuse and worry us And they are not hammering on the doors of the banks demanding extensions of credit In my opinion we are in a paralysis of confidence on the part of consumers and businesses as well as banks And I am somewhat skeptical about the effectiveness of monetary policy in dealing with human psychological depression It seems to me that confidence is more likely to return under the stimulus of a clearly enunciated political leadership in dealing with domestic issues, and I question whether further ease in interest rates will do the trick "
1296,1991-11-05," Well, I must say that I feel like the person who is lost in the woods who as a boy scout was told that if you get lost in the woods find a stream and follow the stream downstream and you'll eventually come out It may be a long trek if you're somewhere near the Continental Divide! But I sense that there's a stream going along here, and I guess I'm persuaded that the downside risks are not material So, I will vote reluctantly for ""A"" symmetrical   Yes, 25 basis points down but symmetrical language "
1352,1991-12-17," I would much prefer alternative III I think it's simple and straightforward and it gives the opportunity to emphasize in the Policy Record anything that we want to call particular attention to However, I, too, can see that the train already has left the station, so I will support alternative I as a step in the right direction "
1353,1991-12-17," Well, Mr Chairman, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I will restate my conviction that what we have now is a crisis or paralysis of confidence There is clearly [underway] a deliberate restructuring of balance sheets on the part of consumers, businesses, and banks to reduce debt and increase equity and liquidity And given current attitudes, until that adjustment is much further along than it is now, I think we will not see a return to stronger [economic] growth patterns Confidence is at best an ephemeral concept and basically it is a psychological phenomenon Perhaps if we had a clinical psychologist on the Committee, it might help! In the meantime, I remain unconvinced that confidence will be shored up by a further easing in policy While I recognize that the burden of high levels of debt is somewhat alleviated by a lower structure of interest rates, at the same time I do worry about the dollar and the risks related to a steeper slide in its value due to an even more significant interest rate differential A flight to safety  -21-    12/17/91  may be the thing that is keeping the dollar as stable as it is, given chaotic conditions in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe And yet I am persuaded that we have not seen the full effect of the easing that we have already accomplished, and I would like to wait before initiating any further ease "
1354,1991-12-17," You're saying ""B"" asymmetric?   I would prefer ""B"" with symmetric language I really think that we have to send a firm sign that the [downward interest rate] drift is going to stop That could have a very stimulating effect because I think the economy and the public are being exposed to something akin to Chinese water torture We creep down 1/4 point in the funds rate and then we creep down another 1/4 point and we change the discount rate If we follow that same pattern, it seems to me that we are creating the expectation that that pattern is going to continue almost indefinitely I think there's a lot to be said for turning it off, at least for a while, and seeing what happens I'm still not convinced that all of the effects of our previous easings have come through and I don't see why we need to continue this drift So, I would be in favor of ""B"" symmetrical  -36-    12/17/91 "
1404,1992-03-31," Mr Chairman, I'm one who has felt that we were in a genuine recovery for some time, and the current forecast--if it is accurate and I think it probably is--seems to sustain that Certainly, consumer confidence has improved even though it's not exactly ebullient at the moment Corporate profits are somewhat better, but business confidence is still restrained The fragility in the financial system that we have worried over for the last two or three years seems to be mending, particularly within the banking system, although there are still a number of large troubled institutions that command a major share of media attention And media attention, I think, has a psychological effect on these confidence factors Bank earnings are certainly much better and the availability of capital has improved, and that's encouraging for further strengthening of balance sheets Banker confidence I believe is still a problem, and that may be at least partly responsible for the slow pace of growth  -27-    3/31/92  Having said all that, I think there are still some pitfalls that could abort or at least sidetrack this recovery A dollar at its current level, or perhaps even a little stronger, and weaker economies in our major trading partners could reverse our recent export performance, which has certainly helped keep this recent recession a shallow one I guess I'm politically skeptical enough to believe that there is still a possibility that irresponsible legislation to provide a quick fix could happen, and it might in fact be counterproductive Defense cutbacks, I believe, will create long and painful transitions because the laid off workers are going to be permanently displaced, and they will have difficulty relocating in any short time frame I think that effect will be more regional than general and will have important impacts in states like California As a matter of fact, the current issue of The Economist has a real scare article about the effects in California, Washington, New Mexico, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, and one or two other states A further increase in long-term interest rates could certainly smother the recovery of the housing market and discourage long-term financing for investment or refinancing of higher-cost debt I believe that, properly managed, all of those problems can be limited to a minor drag on the rate of recovery The [interest] rate issue is the most important one in my view, and it suggests a position of vigilance, although I remain skeptical about the ability of further easing of policy to stimulate the economy or bring down long rates In fact, further easing might have the perverse effect of driving up long rates I think our stance needs to be flexible at the moment And, as I said to begin with, I think the Greenbook forecast looks pretty good "
1405,1992-03-31," I came prepared to argue for symmetric language and for alternative B, and I guess the news report from Don Kohn tended to sap my courage I must say that in the first few meetings I attended here I was puzzled about the lengthy debate over precious changes in language or changes in precious language But I now know that the world watches so carefully everything we say and exactly how we say it and in what order that I guess the debate is worthwhile And I think probably staying the course and keeping the flexibility that's implied by the asymmetric language is appropriate "
1462,1992-05-19," Mike, I'm puzzled by the corporate profits projection in the Greenbook It looks like fairly steady improvement during 1992 and then it goes rather blah in 1993 with a fair amount of swing back and forth from one quarter to another What is the rationale behind that projection?   The stock market would seem to indicate that that's the view on the whole  -10-    5/19/92   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman I must say that over the last six weeks or so I have become more of a cautious optimist about what is going on in the economy It seems to me that these most recent figures on consumer attitudes forebode a much brighter outcome  -22-    5/19/92  Consumers have been gradually reducing their debt load, which I think has helped to improve their feeling of confidence as reflected in their attitudes toward housing, auto, and appliance acquisitions At the same time, long rates most recently have shown some slight improvement, and we have some reason to believe that that may now continue The banking system I believe is substantially recovering from the problems that have plagued it the last four or five years Operating margins, net interest margins have improved; earnings have improved The restructuring of many of these institutions toward greater efficiency is beginning to take hold Balance sheet values are certainly much sounder and much closer to reality today than they have been, although in some isolated instances there is still a ways to go Clearly, they have better access to the capital markets so that the capital shortages that still exist certainly can be dealt with much more easily now than they could have been up until this time I believe that these bankers are still cautious lenders I think the burns haven't completely healed and the memories about recent events will be long But I believe that they are now able, and to some extent willing, to respond to legitimate demands So, I think the banks will be able to finance whatever level of recovery is coming along  Corporate conditions, I think, have improved significantly Again, restructuring has had a very salubrious effect on corporate balance sheets Corporations have eliminated in the process not just people, but some poor businesses The divestiture or even shutting down of businesses that have been otherwise a drag bodes well for future profitability Also, the reduction in debt service has been appropriate They have done this through much more favorable debt financing and by replacing debt with equity So, I think the general tone there is better and that's why I'm a bit skeptical about the 1993 projection for corporate profits I think there may be some fundamental improvement there that can be very helpful  Having said all that, I think the progress on inflation is disappointing in view of the length of time that we have had a fairly restraining hand with regard to policy And it's particularly disappointing and puzzling that the figures are better when you leave food and energy in right now than when you take them out They've always been seen as the wild cards  It seems to me that the Greenbook forecast is a reasonable one My own would be somewhat more optimistic but only marginally But I don't think we should be discouraged by a modest growth rate in the GDP I think it is fully consistent with a continued move toward price stability, which should be our objective We must be sure to stop pouring drinks while everyone is still sober, and probably the next policy move will have to be toward restraint rather than ease "
1463,1992-05-19," Congress is working on it! [Laughter]   Well, for all the reasons cited in my earlier sermon, I support your recommendation of ""B"" symmetric although I would like to identify myself with Governor Angell's preference for asymmetric toward restraint "
1515,1992-08-18," Mr Chairman, I'm increasingly concerned about what I view as the continued deterioration of the economic psychology of the country I believe that psychology creates the conflicting signals which in turn contribute to the sluggish rate of recovery in which we find ourselves Banks continue to be chary of aggressive lending, but their role in a more dramatic growth rate is also constrained by a very slack demand for credit by both consumers and businesses Consumers, or at least a lot of them, are frightened and very cautious about taking on more debt to step up consumption Businesses are still involved in balance sheet restructuring to equitize debt or refund debt to reduce debt service [costs] That posture will not change until demand creates confidence in inventory production and capacity expansion And perhaps more fundamental than any or all of the above is the sense of the country that we are adrift That we are in an election year in the midst of domestic and international issues which differ from those of a few years ago and perhaps are more worrisome Stubborn political and humanitarian issues both at home and abroad are frustrating because the diplomatic, economic, and military tools we might have resorted to in the past no longer are particularly applicable or available, especially in the absence of fiscal ammunition And neither candidate has yet given us a clear idea of how he would approach the final solution to these problems  In these circumstances, I believe monetary policy is at a juncture similar to the doctor who has moved his patient into intensive care, shot him full of antibiotics, given him multiple transfusions of whole blood, has an intravenous going with glucose, and is assisting respiration with shots of pure oxygen The doctor can now only wait for all of that to take effect Further intervention will probably not change the outcome Patience is prudent and patience should be our watchword for now   They have pythons in Arkansas? "
1516,1992-08-18," Mr Chairman, I don't see anything about symmetric language that forbids a change, but to have asymmetric language seems to me like giving you a loaded gun that is already cocked, I would really rather have symmetric language so that you  -40-    8/18/92  would have to have a consultation with this group before you cock the weapon and certainly before you pull the trigger So, I would certainly strongly favor ""B,"" but I would favor symmetric language   But symmetric language as opposed to asymmetric language might also be interpreted as an expression of confidence The asymmetric language is saying we expect trouble   Yes   Yes   Well, I'm lonesome but I'm delighted too! [Laughter]   I have a patient; I'm waiting for him to recover "
1563,1992-10-06," Mr Chairman, I find the incoming statistics very disappointing, particularly industrial production, new orders, purchasing agents' reports, consumer attitudes, and housing starts On the other hand, the monetary aggregates look somewhat healthier, or perhaps less sick is the right way to describe it Bank credit apparently has begun to grow again, although certainly not ebulliently Attitudes are being affected by media expectations of instantaneous increases in employment and decreases in unemployment to reflect what is going on in the economy The predilection to dwell on gloom and doom is exemplified by the way they deal with headlines in any economic article A good example is recent articles predicting masses of bank failures and estimates as high as $80 billion of assets in the banks that are due to fail over the next six months They emphasize all of that instead of talking about the much stronger earnings and the much healthier capital ratios that are typical in the industry The increasing uncertainty about our political future I think is a major factor here With neither party candidate for president offering a credible program for dealing with the nation's problems, I'm more convinced than ever that the current partial paralysis of the economy will continue until after the election and that the expected clarification of what the future holds [will be delayed]  In that kind of environment, I doubt that short-term interest rates lower than those already in place will have any stimulative effect I think this is a time to say that the inventory in the candy store is sold out; we should hold steady where we are to allow the full effect of the previous easing and rationalize the attitudes on the part of consumers to stimulate more vigorous growth Furthermore, the risk of additional chaos in the foreign exchange markets and the possible rekindling of long-term inflationary expectations is real in my mind, and it can only be avoided by keeping with our present stance   Question, Mr Chairman?   As stated in the Bluebook, ""A"" requires a reduction immediately in the federal funds rate to 2-1/2 percent Was that your intent?   All right, ""B"" I thought you said ""A"" I'm sorry   Mr Chairman, for all the reasons I stated before, I would prefer ""B"" symmetric because I don't have any confidence that a further change in rates can accomplish the stimulative effects that it's supposed to have And I'm very reluctant to take the risks that are inherent in the foreign exchange markets, which I believe are there On the other hand, I think your argument that we need some emergency firepower in the event of an accident or a surprise is persuasive for asymmetric language But I would prefer to have it symmetric with the idea of reconvening the Committee if the emergency happens Maybe the emergency will happen too fast to make that practical, but until I hear the other comments around the table I'd like to be recorded as favoring ""B"" symmetric   Symmetric ""B"" "
1619,1992-11-17, I thought we were exempt 
1620,1992-11-17," Were they buying anything?   Mr Chairman, it seems to me increasingly evident that the economy continues to be moving in a positive direction, albeit at a very moderate pace, which looks to be consistent with further progress toward price stability My impression is that the election has probably had a favorable effect on consumer confidence due in part to the intense media attention to expected stimulative actions on the part of the new Administration and an almost magical disappearance of the media's former obsession with unemployment and layoff announcements Nonetheless, corporate restructuring, and particularly debt reduction and administrative staff reductions, will continue I believe that spells out the [basis for] longer-range improvement in US competitiveness Many of the indicators are on a more favorable trend line Corporate profits, while spotty, are generally better The banking system is in better shape as measured both by its balance sheet values and by banking profits, which are probably at the best levels in more than two    11/17/92  decades Having said that, we certainly have not yet seen the full impact of the slowdown in California reflected in the banks that have a heavy stake there The general tone of the financial markets I believe is resilient, and those markets have weathered a lot of the things that Mike Kelley was just talking about To be sure, higher dollar exchange rates and softer economies among our major trading partners don't indicate a major boom for the export sector It seems to me that the Greenbook forecast is on the money, if that's not an improper usage [of that expression]--   --and consistent with my own analysis and the anecdotal input that I've been hearing However, consistent with the suggestion of Don Kohn's recent memo, I will not further telegraph my [policy] views! "
1621,1992-11-17," Mr Chairman, I'd like to associate myself with all the comments of my colleague, Mr Angell, with one exception In other words, I favor ""B"" symmetric and 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent on the range for 1993, but if I were in your shoes I would feel more comfortable with the February explication of that move rather than dropping it in here in the middle of an interregnum between one Administration and another "
1678,1992-12-22," Great accounting!   Mr Chairman, I have a Christmas present for the Committee! I'm going to spare the Committee my usual comprehensive and picturesque discussion of the economy sector by sector I simply want to make the point that I remain more optimistic than the staff does about where we're going and the pace at which we're going The thing that puzzles me about the Greenbook projection is that the relatively slow rate of growth in 1993 and continuing into 1994 and the major slack reflected in the unemployment numbers would indicate a more rapid rate of progress on the inflation front than is contained in the Greenbook projection My own feeling is that the growth rate of GDP in 1993 will probably be up to 50 basis points higher [than the Greenbook forecast] and I think that rate of growth may be consistent with somewhat lower unemployment numbers and with the Greenbook projection on inflation In summary, I feel more optimistic about the rate of growth in the economy and the rate of decline in the unemployment rate than the Greenbook I think the risks in the    12/22/92  projection are about symmetric with a slightly greater tilt toward the upside risk "
1679,1992-12-22," ""B"" symmetric "
1732,1993-03-23," That's a hard act to follow!   Well, Mr Chairman, to some extent I share the concerns that Governor Mullins and Governor Angell have expressed that we run the risk of hanging in here too long with this lower rate structure On the other hand, forecasting in this environment is like trying to solve an equation with 23 unknowns It seems almost impossible to assess accurately the full impact of President Clinton's economic and health care programs But on the face of it, higher taxes and simultaneous cutting back in government spending have to be considered to be contractive And while the full effects of the  -30-    3/23/93  program won't be felt for some time and the financial markets have reacted favorably in the belief that it represents a credible attack on the deficit, we still have not seen what the full impact on employment will be of defense cutbacks and other spending cutbacks, including something that hasn't been mentioned here today and that's the armed forces personnel reductions, which are clearly going to contribute to unemployment What worries me is the potential impact of these impending developments on consumer and business confidence Now, we may be seeing a signal, a first signal of that, in the recent declines in the Michigan survey particularly as to consumers' expectations for the future If in fact consumer spending contracts sharply and business investment retreats from present announced plans and if we get a dramatic enough slowing in the economy, there is the specter of a retreat from fiscal discipline toward outright stimulus that I think is almost inherent in this government, and a probable inflationary result The realities of the situation I suppose will become clear later in the year; and certainly in my opinion a policy shift at this moment is not necessary But I think we ought to stay on red alert "
1733,1993-03-23," ""B"" symmetric, alternative sentence "
1786,1993-05-18," Mr Chairman, I find the recent indicators of a possible intensification or rekindling of inflation very disturbing in the context of our stated objective of price stability, which I believe is the proper objective for this institution The question, it seems to me, is whether this is the time to take the punch bowl away before everyone but the host gets drunk and the party gets rowdy The timing of any tightening of policy is critical It must be early enough to stop inflation before it gains momentum but it must also be    5/18/93  late enough to be based on reality and not just intuition In the current situation it is hard to make a substantive case, in my opinion, that a real inflationary trend is under way rather than the effect of simultaneous aberrant one-time influences By contrast, I believe that a case can be made that the apparent slowdown in growth is a result of collapsing confidence on the part of both consumers and businesses in the extremely uncertain environment created by record high proposed tax increases, large proposed [defense] cutbacks, and fundamental change in a health care system that was basically established in our culture more than 30 years ago Consumers and businesses continue to be more interested in debt reduction than in re-leveraging with long-term commitments It can't have escaped any reasonably intelligent observer that the economic proposals that are before the Congress right now are essentially contractive A premature move to tighten policy against that background could be disastrous to economic growth and could run the risk of reigniting enthusiasm for fiscal stimulus rather than deficit reduction and budget discipline In that scenario the inflation fat would really be in the fire again It seems to me that this is the time to hold to our present course at least long enough to have a better idea of what Congress will do with the President's proposals and what the effect will be on economic growth "
1787,1993-05-18," I'm marginally persuaded to go with asymmetric toward tightening But I must say that I'm rather astonished that Bob Forrestal is the only one around this table who has even discussed the possibility that tightening might have a very, very serious effect on economic growth That is what worries me And the political reaction to a dumped economic growth rate could have much more serious inflationary implications and also serious implications for the future of deficit reduction So, I think we ought to be very, very careful not to move until we're really persuaded that there are overwhelming reasons to do so "
1837,1993-08-17," I don't often find myself counterpoised against Governor Mullins and I run the risk, I think, of sounding like a broken record here, but I continue to hear the term fiscal drag around the table My inclination would be to change that a bit to either fiscal anchor or maybe fiscal torpedo It seems to me that tax increases of the magnitude we're talking about, which are not confined to the wealthy--and Larry has indicated here what the effects can be on, let's say, a subchapter S individual who has a healthy income--and spending cuts of the magnitude we're talking about, if realized, will displace a lot of workers for long periods of time and some perhaps permanently Corporate restructuring continues and I think it may be even at an accelerated pace now and in the near future The consumer confidence indexes, as we've all noted, continue their downward trend And logic says that that set of conditions may inhibit consumer spending, although we have not seen startling evidence of that yet But after all, the budget compromise is only a couple of weeks old And certainly there are indications that it is at least causing the postponement of some business investment; and certainly business hiring is being diverted into temporary types of help instead of permanent employment I continue to believe that those conditions will develop further as the full implications of the budget agreement are realized on a broader scale At the same time, the health care discussions thus far seem to telegraph further costs both to businesses and to employees And there seems to be a growing concern over the full implications for employment and investment inherent in the North American Free Trade Agreement  In that [environment], I still think the risks to the economy are shifting toward the down side as uncertainties [abound] We all accept, I think, that uncertainty inevitably inhibits growth In that context a more symmetrical approach to monetary policy would seem to be logical but I'm not suggesting or recommending that simply because I think a shift in our policy at this time could create a very negative signal and one that might send things going in the wrong direction But I am convinced that we are at a juncture here where the full implications of all of these major programs could be inhibiting [economic growth] to a much greater extent than is currently indicated by the data that we're looking at "
1838,1993-08-17," Well, I preferred a symmetric directive even last time As I said in my comments earlier, I think under ordinary circumstances conditions would dictate a symmetric directive at this point I still am concerned that if we give the impression that we have abandoned our determination to seek stable prices, we either signal a weakening in the economy that is more than is perceived elsewhere or we set off inflationary expectations again because they think we're backing away from our position of pursuing [price stability] On the other hand, the arguments that have been presented here for, as Bob McTeer calls it, the ""shelf life"" of the asymmetric directive I think are persuasive, so I'm prepared to back ""B"" symmetric "
1888,1993-09-21," Mr Chairman, all of the Cassandra-like insights into what is going on that I had in mind have already been stated by Presidents Melzer and McDonough and Governors Angell and Kelley So, I'll just be marked present Thank you "
1889,1993-09-21," ""B"" symmetric "
1944,1993-11-16," What authority is represented by the current request from Chairman Gonzalez? In other words, this is not a subpoena but I thought I heard you indicate that our ability to deny a request of Congress for information is limited In other words, how do we respond to the immediate situation?   Well, he didn't use that kind of language   All right If he should be dissatisfied with whatever answer we give him on the basis of the current request and he reverts to a subpoena, do we have the right to deny the confidential information and so forth in responding to that subpoena?   Third question, if I may What constraint is his Committee under in terms of subsequently releasing that confidential information--making it public or leaking it or some other publication of it?   I would judge then that the best we can do retrospectively with regard to these transcripts is to try to satisfy his request by offering something other than the raw, unedited transcripts that we have on hand in order to try to protect that confidential information Is that where we are? We're in a--   All right, it's the Committee's request but it's coming from--   Well, we haven't been subpoenaed yet   I understand   I understand, but the current request is from the Chairman   All right, thank you   But he has read top secret documents on the floor of the Congress   Into the Congressional record   It seems to me that we have two separate issues here One is how we respond to this [House Banking] Committee request through Chairman Gonzalez And then if we're going to make the material available to that Committee, do we also release that material to the public on some sort of a schedule retrospectively? Is that what is contemplated here?   That's certainly something to be considered, is it not?   Well, let me understand that Is what is being proposed that we suggest something that we're going to release to the public in the hopes that he will then change his request from unedited transcripts and tapes to accept whatever we have proposed?   Yes And if there is some prurient interest in these unedited transcripts and tapes retrospectively is that going to prompt them to ask us to share with the [House] Committee unedited tapes and transcripts prospectively as part of their oversight of monetary policy? I understand the rationale in the sometimes opaque language in these letters; it's all under that oversight umbrella So if they needed all of this to overlook the historic performance, will they not insist on having it prospectively?   So it seems to me that that's another issue we have to address Not just what we're going to release to the public, possibly in the form of a Memorandum of Discussion, but whether in fact there's going to be a demand that we continue to release tapes and transcripts as they are generated in the process of doing the Memorandum of Discussion, regardless of what the Archivist says [I say that] because, as I understand you, Congress can ask for anything it wants   Mr Chairman, I fully subscribe to the proposition of making available to the [Banking] Committee edited transcripts, eliminating the confidential information that we would find sensitive I'm less concerned about the time lag It seems to me three years on the retrospective part is adequate And though we haven't addressed this specifically, I don't think it's practical to go back and try to get every living person who ever participated to review something that they may have said 15 years ago So I would let the staff do the editing And I don't think I could possibly justify in my own mind trying to do a Memorandum of Discussion of all of those ancient meetings because the person attempting to do so simply wouldn't have the proper environment in which to interpret what was being said  On the [going forward] side I strongly favor the Memorandum of Discussion simply for accuracy You can read, as we did in the example that was circulated, the kind of gibberish that one of those transcripts contains It's almost impossible to tell what individuals were really trying to say in any given speech And that leads me not to be in favor of releasing both an edited and a raw transcript because it seems to me that then somebody can raise the question of whether we interpreted that bit of gibberish correctly So, I think the edited transcripts retrospectively are right; and prospectively in order to eliminate inaccuracies the Memorandum of Discussion should be used, which would be subject to the review of the participants And as I understand current Archival practice, we would be allowed to discard the tapes and the transcripts from which that was prepared And until that is challenged and found inoperative as far as a court was concerned, I would think we would be adequately protected in using that procedure on a prospective basis And I hope that kind of procedure would satisfy the [Banking] Committee and not encourage them to try to seek our working materials, our working papers if you will, on a prospective basis   Three   One would be satisfactory to me but I sense that I'm way out of line with everybody else on that   Yes   Are you talking retrospectively?   My first choice would be lightly edited transcripts; my second choice would be lightly edited transcripts with annotation   We have a majority for one choice though   Well, if you have a majority--   Yes, we do   It just complicates it   Three and five   MOD first; and lightly edited transcript fourth or fifth   With the momentum that he will gain by our acquiescence to [releasing the transcripts], he will then say Well, this is what I want you to decide to do   He's going to back us right into a corner  -55-    11/16/93   Mr Chairman, we've been here for 3-1/2 hours discussing this one issue and have only decided maybe a third of it I wonder if there's any merit, rather than cluttering up the next Open Market Committee meeting when we're supposed to be making monetary policy, in having a separate meeting on this subject and resolving it no matter how long it takes   I think that's the right course of action, but it seems to me that inevitably that is going to trigger a subpoena and he will [get] the unedited tapes and--   And work back "
1945,1993-11-16," Well, for the first time in a long time I don't find myself in congruence with the Greenbook in terms of all of the elements of [the growth forecast] I am much closer to the  -82-    11/16/93  Greenbook's version of inflation but for an entirely different set of reasons A growth rate in the economy overall of closer to 3 percent or slightly better for next year is more in line with what I see developing I think that housing markets are likely be a little stronger I think we've been overly pessimistic on the exports side I just can't see that dip and deterioration there in spite of the common current outlooks for some of our major trading partners The other part of the trade balance that bothers me a little is the expected and continued high growth of imports I think at least the consumer side of the import market is going to be rather weaker than we perhaps expect Now, given the fact that the unemployment figures might go down somewhat under that kind of scenario, then I think the 31 percent projection for inflation may not be an unreasonable one  Having said all that, I think there is an opportunity here for us to blow an aneurism in this economy through its most fragile part, and that's the financial markets The full impact of higher taxes at least for some major segment of the investor market, a perception of higher costs for a lot of things because of excise taxes, and the possibility of paying higher premiums for health care and so forth and so on, may in fact cause a lot of nervousness that will lead people to retreat from the more speculative parts of the market And I just believe that the values there are high enough and the market nervous enough that it looks for chances or opportunities or excuses or rationales to trade And if the trading ball gets rolling down the hill, I think we could have a serious contraction in both the equity market and the bond market, which could affect all these other differences that I have had So I really don't want to be right--I want the Greenbook to be right--because of something like that But at the same time that's a part of the economic puzzle that remains very worrisome to me   Mark your calendars! This is the first time we've been in agreement in about four years or something like that "
1946,1993-11-16, Concede the putt 
2010,1993-12-21," Along those lines If the October 15 conference call was a meeting of the Committee and if it is protectable because it was deliberative but we open it to the Oversight Committee, then by precedent do we have to open other deliberative matters on monetary policy to the Oversight Committee?   Boy, that's a delicate differentiation   Well, but are we deliberating something?   That's the part that worries me about it   I think it's a good gamble to try this ploy and hope that the presence of other witnesses who will see the whole thing more objectively and be able to defuse any attempt to take pieces out of context will be advantageous I think that's a very good strategy to pursue I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2011,1993-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman I must say that I have a tendency to agree with the concerns about the continued contraction of military spending, the full impact of higher taxes, and the persisting sense of job insecurity, which I think will continue to be driven for some time by corporate re-engineering I don't see any real end to that trend And as the financing of this health care program emerges, all of these factors are going to continue to tend to dampen but not dump economic growth In that context I see no really compelling case for policy change at this time in spite of the current spurt of economic growth On the contrary, I think a premature move could choke off a satisfactory growth rate The timing of any change in policy in the current circumstances is exquisite and we will be more comfortable when we meet next and have some indication of the first-quarter outlook at least At that point some adjustment in the directive might be appropriate--sort of a loading of the gun by perhaps tilting the directive--if it looks as though the staff projection of more modest growth in the first quarter is not going to materialize  [Secretary's note Chairman Greenspan left the room briefly to take an important call, and the Vice Chairman conducted the meeting during the Chairman's absence] "
2012,1993-12-21," I'm a little puzzled by the fact that almost everyone who has spoken so far has said that they were convinced that we were going to have to tighten sooner rather than later and yet they have been willing to buy into a stand pat symmetric language directive right now, even though everybody is expressing concern about reacting to strong numbers That seems to me to be a mixed problem I'm more of the mind that I find it hard to disagree too much with the Greenbook projection and, therefore, I'm reluctant to take any action prematurely, as I stated in my earlier comments So you and I have arrived at the same prescription for policy but from slightly different points of view And I do support the ""B"" symmetric   Not for long! [Laughter]  -37-    12/21/93   Good "
2077,1994-03-22," I guess I'm somewhat confused because the comments around the table seem to address different parts of this issue Are we discussing the merits of swaps, period? Are we discussing the merits of any swap line with Mexico? Are we discussing just a request for an increase in the swap line with Mexico? Or are we discussing the use of the swap with Mexico? Or all of the above? It sounds like all of the above to me But it seems to me that this discussion may be long overdue if we have a whole array of these arrangements in place with various countries, so perhaps we should be trying to delineate or define better what our standards are for engaging in swaps That's point number one And point number two is then insuring that any swap arrangement meets those criteria  I certainly have great trouble with the use of the swap either for pegging exchange rates or for window-dressing purposes I think that's inappropriate On the other hand, it seems to me that Mexico has, within certain limits, handled the previous drawings quite responsibly even though there may be some question about the purpose of one or two of them They handled them responsibly in terms of their meeting the conditions of the swap, if I have the right impression So, if we are going to focus on the use of the swap line, accepting that swaps are appropriate in certain cases, then maybe what we need to do is to define what we regard as an acceptable use of the swap We have heard all the things we don't think are acceptable What is an acceptable use of the swap other than to address disorderly markets? That is not a question, I guess, but rather a general statement of my confusion   I would have said substantially what Bob Forrestal said "
2078,1994-03-22," That's a nice sequence and I'd like to associate myself with a lot of what Governor Kelley just said I want to add to that my perplexity about the projected relationships between four elements of the forecast The first is the presumed direction of policy and the trajectory of interest rates associated with that policy The second element is GDP in the context of that policy and in the context of what we presume to be potential for the economy In its effort to tie all of that into the projection for the CPI, the staff has come up with a projection for the balance of 1994 and well into 1995 that has the CPI running at a higher rate than it did in 1993 and 1992 and the GDP running at a lower growth rate than in 1993 and 1992--in fact tracking very close to what we presume to be the potential for the economy Those things don't make much sense to me Either the staff has underestimated GDP and it is going to come out higher than projected and therefore the CPI numbers are more reasonable, or it has underprojected the CPI If it is the former, then the question that I would raise is whether we have the right monetary policy If in fact we are projecting a monetary policy involving rates that are rising gradually to a certain level with the result that the economy is growing at a relatively sluggish rate and there is no projected progress against inflation, then clearly, given the stated objective of stable prices, do we have the right policy? I don't have the answer to that at the moment, but in the context of some of the things that Governor Kelley was saying, I just don't feel comfortable with the conclusions that one seems to be forced to draw from those projections "
2079,1994-03-22," Mr Chairman, not to be facetious, but the 25 basis point approach sounds to me a bit like taking down that Sword of Damocles and inflicting the death of a thousand cuts on the economy It dies slowly in anticipation of the next strike Instinctively, I would prefer in the best of all worlds a 50 basis point move for the simple reason that if we are wrong and the economy is moving faster than we thought, we would be seen as having been a little ahead of the curve, and we could still move further That to me is preferable to making a move in between meetings in reaction to something that's published in the press If we are wrong on the other side and if the economy is significantly weaker, then we can stop at 50 basis points; we won't need additional moves perhaps Or we don't have to stop at the 50 points; we can add another 25 if necessary On the other hand, I have great respect for your analysis of the market risks involved in a 50 basis point move, and I will reluctantly agree to the 25 basis points with symmetric language That's all "
2133,1994-05-17," Mike, you indicated that you thought there might be some significant revision in the first-quarter GDP number when we get the revision Will that be at the end of this month?   Would you share that with us?   Thank you   I've grown considerably less comfortable since the last meeting with the consensus view that we have a solid economic expansion under way Not only was the announced GDP growth rate in the first quarter way below staff expectations, but staff now expects a further downward revision of the 26 percent number that was announced That, combined with recent statistics on auto sales and production, industrial production, retail sales, and a modest reversal of consumer expectations, has convinced me that the psychological tone of the economy is very fragile I attribute that fragility to job security anxiety, fueled by continued corporate re-engineering with the accompanying layoffs combined with worries about household cash flow, debt levels, and impending changes in the health care system and its costs Nonetheless, the reduction in slack in the economy certainly feeds my concern that there remains some prospect for growth well in excess of potential, and I expect that further absorption of slack will come from the export sector As US products become more competitive because of dollar rates, technical improvements, higher quality, and the recovery of European and Canadian economies as well as a higher level of growth in Mexico, the growth in exports will  -27-    5/17/94  exceed staff expectations and stimulate a higher growth rate than in the Greenbook forecast  All in all, I believe that events already in train will tend to heal the fragile psychology of the economy, all of which suggests that additional restraint may be in order "
2134,1994-05-17," Mr Chairman, I'm very pleased to support your recommendation, and I think the elegance of the language permits the interpretation that was intended--that we may still be probing, that we are not sure that we are at neutrality, that we have taken a significant step forward, but we're not at all committed to standing pat I just think the language is beautifully composed "
2185,1994-08-16," I'm a little puzzled by the projected levels of consumption expenditures and am trying to reconcile them with the relatively high continued levels of housing starts projected in the Greenbook as well as the further increase in light motor vehicle sales to the highest level since 1988 That just doesn't seem consistent to me   A confounded question, I guess   I'm confounded at any rate   Present company excepted please!   Mr Chairman, the learned comments of our colleagues have been so encompassing that they leave me with little additional wisdom to share with the Committee My personal view is that the economy may be more robust than the Greenbook forecast would imply I continue to believe that consumer uncertainties about job security and about what government is up to tend to be a damping influence and a counter to runaway growth However, I think the current brisk rate of growth argues for some further braking from policy "
2186,1994-08-16," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2238,1994-09-27," Mr Chairman, I suspect that the death yesterday of the Administration's health care reform scheme may well result in a reversal of some of the recent declines in consumer confidence On the other hand, the upcoming election will tend to focus attention on voter dissatisfaction with government and support continued uncertainty My own view is that the export sector may in fact do better than the Greenbook forecast, and consumers may continue recent spending patterns more strongly than the Greenbook projects The abrupt drop in GDP growth projected by the staff for 1995 seems to me to be inconsistent with the projected levels for autos and housing starts As a result, I continue to believe growth in 1995 will be somewhat stronger than the staff forecast and may indeed require further restrictive action by the Committee But I'm not convinced that we have yet seen the full impact of our previous policy moves or that the future direction of policy is clear enough at this time without more hard data I certainly admire the inflation reduction and containment achieved in some other countries, but I find the social price paid in those countries in terms of prolonged recession and very high unemployment unacceptable for the United States I would rather pursue a more moderate course designed to ratchet core inflation down over time and not be distractedly concerned by  -28-    9/27/94  occasional temporary upward blips in the CPI Consequently, I think we need more information and a very sensitive foot on the brakes "
2239,1994-09-27," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I hope that in casting my vote I will be resolving in my own mind that  -41-    9/27/94  the Committee not be inhibited in any way in the timing of a move by the proximity of the election "
2298,1994-11-15," Are we saying that dollar/yen is an interest rate phenomenon?  -48-    11/15/94   Al, I would argue that we can't withdraw from it completely because part of our statutory responsibility is the stability of the financial system I can envision a situation where the foreign currency markets were so disorderly that they were a threat to the financial stability of the country I think that to take us completely out of that would be a mistake Now, the problem is how to define a disorderly market; who makes the decision whether it is disorderly; or whether, in fact, for whatever purpose, we are trying to peg or stop a decline in a rate relationship But I don't think we can get out of it completely I would like to see us, as a matter of internal policy, limit our participation to those situations where we have a disorderly market and where we define what is a disorderly market   Yes "
2299,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, the Greenbook outlook for dramatically increased short-term rates and a marked slowing in the rate of economic growth accompanied by rising inflation and increased unemployment is not a particularly appealing one It would be much more attractive if the inflation projection was one that reflected greater progress toward stable prices An even more unpleasant vision is the one that would emerge if further significant restraint were not put in place In spite of recent declines in consumer confidence as  -26-    11/15/94  measured by the Michigan survey, consumer confidence remains at a high level and may be further enhanced by the election results I suspect that the current momentum in the economy may be significantly stronger than previously expected and may in fact produce a stronger GDP performance in 1995 than that projected in the Greenbook It is hard for me to accept the idea that we can't get an inflation rate significantly below 3 percent If the monetary policy inherent in the Greenbook forecast can't produce a better result, then perhaps we should be considering monetary policy alternatives that would make better progress toward stable prices even at the short-term cost of unemployment marginally above the NAIRU The signal effect of greater restraint may in fact wring out some of the inflation expectations in the markets, which are inherent in current bond prices "
2300,1994-11-15, I support your recommendation 
2353,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, if the staff projection for the fourth quarter is correct, we clearly have a more vibrant economy than most of us had expected and the surprise is the lack of inflation flares in the current figures I am somewhat puzzled by the Greenbook projection for the first quarter of 1995 The abrupt GDP slowdown seems to me to be counterintuitive With the very high level of capacity utilization and reduced slack in the labor markets, pressures are building for price increases and higher wage demands when contract negotiations begin next year What I find puzzling is the widespread existence of sales at significant discounts on every kind of merchandise Brooks Brothers has recently offered 40 percent off on top-of-the-line goods, and the newspapers and catalogs are bursting with ads for sales Coming during the top selling season of the year, these sales would seem to support the idea that price increases are very difficult to make stick To be sure, steel--operating at or about 95 percent of capacity--has negotiated contracts for 1995 deliveries at higher prices And that pattern will probably spread in the near future to other industries that also are operating at high levels of capacity The momentum certainly seems to be there for accelerating growth in the economy even though it is already burning along at a rate well above potential And as the night follows the day, inflation is certain to be lurking The height of the Greenspan Wall prevents me from completing my prepared remarks at this time I will wait for the gate to open [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) The flood gate was it? "
2354,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, one argument against policy moves at this time is this skittishness of the markets on the heels of the Orange County mess On the contrary, I think the markets have reacted to the ""Lemon"" County and the Bankers Trust situations with great poise and restraint In my opinion, the markets may be more dismayed by a lack of further tightening now, particularly as they sense the increased level of economic activity, the shrinking labor market slack, high levels of capacity utilization, and consumer attitudes that don't foretell much slowing of consumption In the past, there has been market speculation that we were behind the curve The November action countered that impression, and I worry that ignoring the continued strength of economic activity even temporarily may reignite concerns about our determination At the risk of dubbing the Fed as the Grinch who stole Christmas, it seems to me we need to snub  -33-    12/20/94  the brakes again without delay, and therefore I would prefer alternative C symmetric "
