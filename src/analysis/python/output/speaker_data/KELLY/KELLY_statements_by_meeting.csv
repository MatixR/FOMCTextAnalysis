1142,1991-05-14," Well, Normand, will you please make a note for the next meeting that whenever Governor Mullins signals he wants to speak, put me down immediately ahead of him!  There's isn't much left to say, Mr Chairman As I read the statistics that are available to us, and more particularly as I listen to the reports from the Districts, it may well be that the bottom and the recovery are at hand, but they sure aren't in hand I'm confident that they will be and that we are reaching the bottom I'm not that confident about the outlook thereafter I'm not sure what kind of strength we're going to get out of a recovery or how sustainable it's going to be I don't think those are sure things I continue to have considerable concern about the drag that's going to be present with us for a while from balance sheets I'm sure Jerry is correct that balance sheets are beginning to recover both at the household and the corporate level But I also wonder if that doesn't have a long way to run yet And I wonder, as that process does run its course, what the implications are more broadly I don't see where our real strength is going to arise from There are some good straws in the wind but none of them look to me as if they're of the nature that they have the strength to push or that we can be very confident as to their sustainability The exception to that is probably the inflation outlook, which I think ought to help in a lot of ways that are both visible and invisible And, of course, there is a natural buoyancy to this economy that, as Mike and others have pointed out, usually leads to better results than one can see at any given point in time But I continue to think that perhaps the risks are not yet symmetric For the short term at least, they do seem to me to continue to be on the down side Confidence is the biggest fragility I see As John LaWare said just a moment ago and as Ed Boehne said earlier If confidence doesn't continue to improve and begins to deteriorate, it could lead to some potential real problems down the road But as far as our work goes, I do think that policy has provided us with a good deal of insurance against these gloomy possibilities It seems to me from a policy standpoint that it's a time to wait and see how things develop "
