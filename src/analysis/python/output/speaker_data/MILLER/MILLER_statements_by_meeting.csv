662,1978-03-10,"  Thank you very much, Arthur  I hadn’t envisioned that this would   be the format for my becoming Chairman of the FOMC, but I am grateful to Arthur for his  thoughtfulness and courtesy in doing this  This is a subject we can discuss later since we have an  agenda we need to turn to      Arthur has indicated that we have two items to consider  The first is the consideration of the   swap line with the Bundesbank and the second is the question of the federal funds rate [given]     3/10/78              2  developments in the monetary aggregates since February 28  On the first item, I would like Henry  Wallich, if he would, to summarize the recent negotiations and discussions with the Treasury and  the Bundesbank and set the stage for our considering this item       Thank you, Henry  Let me say that what we’re going to be asking   for today, once we’ve had our discussion on this subject, is for the FOMC members to give an  informal indication of approval or disapproval, hopefully approval, so that we will have time for  the staff to give you the details of this matter by wire and ask for your vote back, which will be  expected promptly  That will allow us to proceed in coordination with the Treasury on whatever  may need to be worked out in this total package  The counsel at the Bundesbank is being consulted  now to get their official approval  We have from Mr Emminger his indication of concurrence and  we are in the process now of getting FOMC concurrence so that we can see if this can be  confirmed      At this time, I would suggest that I call on those who are familiar with this to add any   comments they wish, and then I will ask for comments from everyone  I think, Arthur, you may  have a view on this that you would like to express to the Committee       Thank you, Arthur  Paul, I would appreciate your comments  Paul   is Vice Chairman of the Committee and is a member of the subcommittee on this issue and I think  perhaps he should next express his views       Paul, there was a disconnect on the line      Thank you, Paul  Phil Coldwell is also a member of the   [sub]committee  Phil, any comments?      Thank you, Phil  I might add my own comments  I could, if   anyone were interested, go into some of the reasons why we should be concerned about the value  of the dollar  I won’t do so because I think that perhaps everyone has the same view  There are  many reasons and I won’t recite them all  I would say that in particular the timing of this, in order  to strengthen a next step of a more comprehensive look at both the short-term and longer-term  aspects of the problem, could be constructive  We see in this an indication by the Administration  of a willingness to take some further steps in the energy area which, of course, is fundamental in  correcting the large demand for petroleum that we need to address  The other [issue], of course, is  the relative growth rates of the US and European economies, which do go to some fundamentals  in our balance of payments and balance of trade  If we can add to that some of these bridging  activities and SDRs and the swap lines that will help us get along the course, I think that is a  worthwhile thing to do      I concur with the observation that this should be looked upon as evolutionary; it should not   be looked upon as a final conclusion of the scenario [involving] these events  I also concur with  Phil Coldwell’s caveats, but I should point out that I don’t think we can guarantee that we will be     3/10/78              6  able to negotiate all of those things before this has to be decided  I think we have to have a little  faith that we’ll keep negotiating and have some practical reasons to get toward that result in due  course       We’ll try, and we have so guided Alan in his discussions  But   we’ll have to see whether that comes out immediately or comes out in due course  I think the  results will be that way  Those are my observations; I can elaborate on them      Before I ask for other comments, I’d like to make a couple of points  I’d remind everyone   that it is not intended that this swap line be initiated or confirmed unless the whole package is put  together  So this has to be treated [as part of a package]  In my view we should not do this at all  unless the package is completed  I think everyone should understand that  Therefore, it may come  to naught or it may come to a quick decision  We should be prepared to do our part if we agree we  want to do our part  It is therefore very important also that we not have any discussion or  interpretation of this particular action until it is official  When it is official, if at all, I think the  interpretation of it should be from this office so that we don’t create confusion about what this  means and what the implications are  With those observations, I would propose an alphabetical  rundown through the Committee  Dave Eastburn, I would appreciate your comments       Henry      So they have about a billion      Do you have a further question, Dave, or comments?     3/10/78              7      Thank you  Phil Jackson      This is Bill Miller speaking  Let me just add one thought to Phil’s   question  I think, Phil, there’s another side of this  Changing the proportion of participation with  Treasury with the resources we’re contemplating may be desirable; it seems to me desirable to keep  them in the activity rather than have them run out of capacity early  If they stay in with us, it seems  to me they have more incentive and more involvement, and I would hate for us to be locked into  too strict a--       Now, I have to go back to some parliamentary procedure  Phil   Jackson had the floor; have you yielded it to all these people, Phil?      Phil Coldwell      We need some flexibility  We agree with--      Monroe Kimbrel      May I repeat it?  What we have now is a current exposure of $16   billion  We will add to that exposure whatever we use under a facility which could aggregate to as  much as $4 billion  But the settlement [of drawings] under the first $2 billion line you previously  approved would not reinstate those drawing rights  Therefore, once we settle on anything under the  present [line], we would end the risk and we would only continue risk on new draws       And there is 50-50 loss sharing      Thank you, Monroe  Mark Willes      Mark, may I just make a comment?  As I said, I could have   discussed the fundamentals  Perhaps I should have  One of the things that worries me about what  has happened to the dollar is that it has an inflationary impact on our economy  It appears that the  decline in the dollar in the last few months alone--it’s hard, of course, to be precise--could add as  much as 07 of a percent to the inflation in the United States this year  So, to my mind, our concern  about the dollar is a concern about inflation  Am I correct on my statement of 07, Steve?  Yes, I’m  getting confirmations that that’s about what our studies would indicate  I also am concerned about  the energy [issue]  It’s a very delicate [matter]; even the Treasury can’t make this decision  The  President will make the decision as to [when] he will take alternative action about energy if he  can’t get an energy package put together in Congress  That’s behind this, too  We don’t want to  pre-guess what the President will do, but he’s leaning toward some specific actions and this will  help us get a moral commitment along those lines  So that could be helpful  Willis Winn       Henry, would you like to answer?      Willis, any further comment or question?       3/10/78              11    Thank you, Willis  I think I’ve been through all the members of   the Committee now  Does anyone have any further comment?      But I would expect that those technical details would be worked   out by the April 5th maturity date that’s coming up  At least that would be the target date  So  probably at the next FOMC meeting we will deal with some of the technical aspects       Thank you      I think the contemplation on our side is that the terms will be the   same      And I think those are contemplated      And the final settlement with the Bundesbank has to be resolved  I   might ask at this point if Art [Broida] would give us his view of what technically we’re asking to be  accomplished right now and how we should proceed       We’ve gone around the circle and I gather I’ve heard from   everyone  There are cautions and reservations, but I’ve heard no dissent  Unless someone wants to  express a dissent from the general package, we will proceed to try to get the detailed language to  everyone today and hopefully get the votes back so that we’ll at least be in a position to proceed  over the weekend if it is necessary  Is there any further comment on this subject?       Then I suggest we move to the next item on the agenda, which is a discussion of the federal   funds rate target  Steve Axilrod will fill us in on this subject based on the M1 and M2 figures that  he’s been working with       Well, gentlemen, based on my understanding of the February   directive, it would seem--given the way the aggregates are coming out--that the Manager should be  reducing the federal funds rate  Peter Sternlight, is that your interpretation?       Because that could be true, it seems wise on this phone   conversation to consider an instruction to the Manager to continue aiming at a 6-3/4 percent rate  The basis for doing that is (1) that these factors may be temporary and (2) that there is a  relationship here to our objectives in the foreign exchange [area] and we would be working against  ourselves by having lower rates right now  So for those two reasons, I would recommend for your  approval that we ask the Manager to maintain his target at 6-3/4 percent       For the time being      We won’t change the directive  It will say that, based on these  conditions, we’ll continue the target at 6-3/4 percent  If those conditions change, we will have to  re-examine [the situation]       Would you repeat that, Phil?  I’m not sure everyone heard      As you know, Phil, the present directive does say that in the   conduct of day-to-day operations account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions,  including the conditions in foreign exchange markets       Art has a comment on this      Are there further comments?  If there are none, I would ask Art to   call the roll and vote on this matter      Yes, the ranges are maintained  This is a supplemental instruction   to the Manager to aid in these unusual conditions      So voted  Gentlemen, we thank you for your attention on  a Friday afternoon, and we’ll look forward to seeing you at the next meeting  This meeting is  adjourned       END OF MEETING    "
682,1978-03-21,"  Well, he can join us when he arrives  First, we can start on some   of the procedural matters, if I can find my agenda  This is the [annual] organizational meeting, as I  understand it  The first order of business, therefore, is the election of officers to serve until the  election of our successors at the first meeting after February 28, 1979  Governor Wallich, you  seem like the likely one [to start us off]       There’s a motion and a second  Is there any dissent?  That is   approved  For the other officers, I would like to nominate Arthur L Broida as Secretary and call  upon Mr Broida as Secretary to put before you the additional slate of officers       If any name has been omitted, it would be an embarrassment later  Are there any additions or corrections?  May we consider this slate approved?  Hearing no  objection, it is approved      The next item of business is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions   for the System Open Market Account, and the New York Bank has volunteered  Are there any  contenders for the assignment?       Well, hearing no dissent we will approve that  The third item is   the selection of the Manager of the System Open Market Account, the Deputy Manager for  Domestic Operations and the Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations  The incumbents in the  respective positions, as you know, are Alan Holmes, Peter Sternlight, and Scott Pardee  We would  propose to redesignate them if that meets with the approval of the Committee  Hearing no dissent,  we will consider that approved      Next is the approval of the minutes of actions taken at the FOMC meetings of February 28   and March 10, 1978  I believe these minutes have been circulated  Are there any comments,  corrections, or additions?  Then, Mr Secretary, those would stand approved     The fifth item of business relates to foreign currency operations, which have been of more   interest recently than in prior years  And we have Scott Pardee here to give us the report on the  operations since the last Committee meeting       Thank you very much, Scott  Are there any questions or   comments?  Henry      Chuck      Paul, you had strategically placed yourself in Basle for this   announcement  Would you like to make any comment?      It has been less in a period of time      More by us--double by the United States      I might make a few comments   I would just observe that from   my point of view, or from the Federal Reserve’s point of view, the handling of this particular  package was not ideal, and that teaches us a lesson  Premature disclosure of discussions did take  the edge off the ability to present a package that could have been analyzed a little differently  The  terms or the contents of the package became fairly well known before the official announcement   We anticipated in any case that the package had certain limitations--that it was not powerful  And  we took a view that the Federal Reserve should have a very low profile about this package on the  proposition that if you come out with a step that is not a  powerful one then you certainly shouldn’t  look to give it a great deal of emphasis in the media  So, we were not surprised at the market  reaction  I think it’s a fair statement to say that we felt that we might have to marshal resources to  deal with the disappointing reaction  And we might have been more fortunate [in that regard] had  the announcement come as an announcement without [prior] disclosure     There were some conditions [proposed] by the FOMC at its meeting of March 10 that I’d   like to mention  One was that we continue the same terms on the new $2 billion addition to our  swap line with the Bundesbank with regard to rates and risk sharing and those were worked out  Alan, you worked those out very nicely  There was also a desire to maintain the participation of     3/21/78              5  the Treasury, and with some backing and filling we have received the commitment of the Treasury  to stay on a 50-50 basis until they exhaust their original resources from the January program and  then to shift to a 60-40 ratio  We would do 60 percent and they would do 40 percent, which is what  we discussed in the FOMC telephonic conversation They have agreed to that, which means that if  we continue to intervene, at some point they will run out of resources before we do  It is our view  that it would be better to keep them in this in a fairly substantial way rather than trying to scale  back further  After all, there are additional resources that the Treasury could call upon  One item  that we were to endeavor to pursue was the repayment matter--whether we can pay the Bundesbank  directly and on what terms--and that will take some time with the Germans  We have had guidance  that any repayment program would certainly not be stretched beyond the year; at least that’s the  [indication] at the moment      Another part of [the Committee’s guidance on the negotiations] was to seek a takeout from   the Treasury and that is under discussion  But the Treasury has so far indicated they have, in their  view, both legal problems and policy problems in responding to that in the short term  Their legal  problems I cannot assure you that I understand, but they are related to whether or not they have the  authority to take on new risk at this point without Congressional action or without some cleaning  up of their [Exchange] Stabilization Fund position We are going to try to find out more about that   The policy issue is their fear that assuming more currency exchange losses in the near term will  bring on Congressional limitations because there are some political problems  So, we are pursuing  that but we have not resolved it yet  I believe those are my comments  Henry, would you like to  add anything?        We have viewed all these things as temporary or bridging actions   and fundamental issues need to be addressed  That’s why you probably read in the press some of  our comments about inflation and the necessity to do something that would show more  decisiveness in that area and to do something about energy  The problem with energy is something  beyond our purview, but it’s one that is being looked at  I don’t know what the outcome will be in  terms of alternative action by the President in case an energy bill acceptable to him is not passed      3/21/78              6  As you know, the statement with the Germans did reflect the willingness to take action along these  lines, but that still has to be determined       On the relative rates of growth, the communiqué indicated that the Germans would look   one quarter earlier at their rates of growth  But again, a realist will recognize that looking doesn’t  mean action and that they have their own internal problems about the speed of recovery of their  economy in terms of their inflation and budgetary deficits and so forth  This is by no means--and it  should not be viewed as such--anything that constitutes coming to grips with significant action on  the substantive fundamental issues  They still remain to be resolved       Gee, if they could just export some of their deflation!      Yes, Ernie      Yes, from other countries  Paul can speak to that       3/21/78              7    John       The Treasury has severe reservations about it  Originally, two   weeks ago, they were taking the position that they would not be in favor of it--that it raised too  many problems for them  Since then I think they have become a little more open minded about it  However, I think the first avenue is apt to be the sale of gold  Sales of gold were under  consideration and were deferred partly because of the French elections, which are now over  So I  think it’s likely that the Treasury will start a program of selling gold, which I personally would  favor  There are a lot of advantages in using gold because at least then we don’t end up with debt  and the currency risks that go with it  So I think that’s an avenue that should be pursued  There  has been a discussion about the level of gold sales that are possible--what the market can absorb  and that sort of thing  Henry can correct me, but I believe the Treasury feels that they could sell  about 300,000 ounces a month       The nice thing about this problem is that it’s surrounded by  dilemmas!  Everything you do has an adverse effect on something else  Nothing is ideal  I might  add that we live in a situation where the market is very realistic, very factual  That’s why the  possibility that gold would be sold caused the gold price to drop by $5  You don’t have to sell  gold, you just have to breathe [that you may] one day  Dave       Henry      Phil      Phil, do you have a question?      Yes  We have all these policy dilemmas we are speaking about    Relative growth rates are such that we are going to continue to have these large current account  deficits  Then our choices are going to narrow down to whether we’ll take a lower growth rate in  our economy, because it doesn’t look like we are getting the relative speedup in other economies   [A lower growth rate] is something that I think many of the economic advisers in the  Administration are now willing to accept because the alternative is to continue to see the dollar  under pressure, and our resources to change it are not great  And that in itself feeds inflation into  our economy and creates a whole series of other [developments] that lead us down an unhappy  trail So there is at least some thinking about whether we have to have a willingness here to shade  our growth rate somewhat       No, in order to hold down imports and to improve the--      It is      This is the current situation  Now, unless there are more   questions on that, we have to ratify the transactions of the Desk since the previous meeting  I  assume this [report] has been circulated  Is that correct?  Any comments or questions?  [I take it]  then that we approve and ratify the transactions of the Desk      The next item is the report of the ad hoc subcommittee on the subject of currency matters    Henry, I believe you are reporting on this today       Perhaps there will be questions or discussion  Frank      Chuck      Bob, you had a question      May I make a suggestion?  I think we are in an area we could   probably discuss all day and have different opinions  If we can live with this for a month, can we  come back with another suggestion?  Would that be all right with the Desk?  If we can find a better  way to express this in net terms and so forth, let’s do it         My experience the last few times would verify that  I think the   Desk has acted responsibly and I think the more time spent on substantive issues and the less on  mechanics helps make the Desk work better  So I would certainly support the idea of giving them  a little running room and then looking at the situation       I think that message has been [given]      That’s correct  That’s why it turned out just to be practical  Well,  if we’re going to re-examine this, should the ad hoc committee stay in being until next meeting just  for this purpose?       Why don’t we do that then?  Let’s continue it for a month  Now,   what is the pleasure of the Committee as to the proposed changes in the gross transactions in the  daily limit and the limit between meetings?  The proposal is to change them from $100 to $200  million and from $300 to 500 million  Is that correct?       Is that a motion?      Would that include the reaffirmation of the other instructions that   we’ve had?  We’re just changing those [limits]      Is everybody clear on what you’re proposing?  Is there a second?    SPEAKER(?)  Seconded      The motion has been seconded  If everyone is clear on what the   motion is--I have it before me and I assume everyone else does, too--is there any further  discussion? All of those in favor, say “aye”     ALL  Aye      Opposed?  So voted  Henry, you have other items to discuss      Any discussion, questions?  Yes, Phil      Any other comments or questions?  You’ve  heard the motion, the   second  All those in favor say “aye”       3/21/78              17  ALL  Aye       Opposed?  So voted  Alan, I think you have other [comments to   make]      Gentlemen, you’ve heard the invitation  Any guidance?  Paul       Yes, [Henry]      Phil      Phil      Dave      I agree that the 50-50 sharing [of losses] is quite important,   because you can’t tell which way it’s going to go  They’ve been with us all the way to this point;  they ought to continue with us as this is liquidated  They may well gain, as you say, as a result of  it, rather than lose  I also agree with Phil Coldwell   I have the impression that that Swiss debt is  being paid off in a very leisurely way  I don’t really recall what the terms are  I know we pay off a  little bit every week, but it seems to be with us forever  So it would be nice to be able to negotiate  a shorter period of amortization than we have on the Swiss debt case     Any other comments?  Alan, do you have any other technical matters you need action on?       3/21/78              20    Any discussion?  Phil      There are several things you should know  The Treasury   proposed originally that we intervene for a period, [doing] 100 percent and then they would  intervene for a period using the 60-40 [ratio]  And when they had used up 80 percent of the  amount we’d done, we would come back in again  I think that’s a very poor procedure  I think it is  much better if we go 60-40 all along and I think the technique of having them reimburse us is much  more preferable and the only one that makes sense here  I really think we shouldn’t be in there  alone and then leave it to the Treasury to come in later       Governor Coldwell, you’ve been in Washington too long; you’re   becoming cynical  You need some R&R  Obviously, we can count on the Secretary of the  Treasury when he tells us he’s going to do this  Can’t we?        We can certainly confirm by letter what we’ve already agreed to   verbally      Yes      Oh yes, that should be for their account, really  We shouldn’t be   taking the risk even for three days  They should just bear it with us all along      Henry, would you just confirm it?  Tony has understood this   clearly and I think we just want to make sure there’s no lapse here      Well, just send them a letter confirming it and [add] a place for   them to [sign it and ask them to] send back a copy  Ernie      Their resources are shrinking in relation to ours  Therefore, when   the original billion dollars runs out, [and they have] $50 million more--is that right, Alan?      At that point we would shift to 60 percent for the Federal Reserve   and 40 percent for the Treasury because we have larger resources      Sharing  Remember, our swap line is 50-50 risk-sharing with the   Bundesbank so all the intervention has been under an arrangement where we take 50 percent and  the Treasury takes 50 percent  So we’ve had 25 percent of the risk  Now that will shift to where  we will have 30 percent of the risk       To the IMF      I certainly agree     3/21/78              23      I think we all agree on that and if we come to the point where they   have no resources, I guess we’ll have to face the issue of whether we end the intervention      They made a point in the communiqué that they have the   resources of the IMF, and I think that means they should have a commitment to use them  Any  further discussion?  Yes, Bob       That’s why we want to continue to pursue some take-out from the   Treasury       The question before the house is Alan’s suggestion--I don’t   believe we acted on it--on the $2-1/4 billion  Is that correct?      Is there any dissent from that change?   Hearing none, we will   approve that  Henry, I think you have one final item?       3/21/78              24    Bones      Paul      John      So far  Phil     3/21/78              26      Well, thank you  These comments are very helpful  We’ve spent   one hour and twenty-five minutes of our valuable meeting on a subject that I hope will wither  away But I’m not very hopeful  We’ll be discussing it at the next meeting and I hope to be of  some [unintelligible]       The main one, of course, is the yen  And I personally am not   prepared to suggest that we get involved  The Japanese are extremely upset  It’s a very serious  political problem with the Japanese  I’d want to send high level people [there] to try to get some  similar arrangements  I don’t think that we really have the resources to deal with it  And I don’t  think the yen in international money markets represents the same kind of problem  I think the  Administration is going to have to deal with the Japanese from a foreign policy point of view; I  don’t think we can really deal with it  As you know, their interventions are massive and even if  there were some psychological basis for us having a $2 billion swap line with them, it could be  used up so quickly  It wouldn’t really make good sense; it doesn’t seem so to me  But it’s a very  serious problem in terms of international relations; in terms of realities it’s something else       Phil      They’re taking $750 million against--        Gentlemen, I think we better move along  Now this subject has   taken an hour and a half of our time  The next subject returns us to the world that will be more  familiar to some of us, and that’s the economic and financial situation here at home  Jim, I think  you’re going to lead off our discussion of this subject       Thank you, Jim  Discussion?  Larry      Frank      Dave      I’m not sure I said that  I said there was some sentiment that that   may be the choice      Is this a local comment, Dave?      Thank you  Henry      Have a speedy soft landing?      Chuck      Bones      Mark      Well, confidentially, the Administration is examining what more   aggressive anti-inflation program could be undertaken within the policy of moderation that has  been indicated in the economic package  That action, if taken, would be both direct governmental  action and would be inclined to marshal similar support in the private sector for holding down  wages and prices  Whether it would be effective would depend on how much visibility is put onto  it and how much real attention leadership would place upon it  In addition to that, the possibility of  a very strong statement on holding [down] the budget deficit and the possibility of some action on  the supply side in releasing things like timber for harvesting are being looked at  I cannot tell you  whether any of this will lead to anything or whether action will be taken     On the energy side you can go around this town and find anything you want but there’s   very little sentiment that an energy bill will be passed soon  So that leaves the President with a  choice of whether any alternate action should be taken in the way of quotas or import fees, and if it  is, when and how and so forth  I can’t give you the answer whether that will be done either   There’s a good deal of feeling that time is short and these things need to be done--that they need to  be done as a step and if they don’t work then something else should be done to keep an active  program going  It seems to be a rather universal feeling that inflation is the number one problem  The employment situation has behaved better than the Administration planned, and better than our  expectations, which means that the time is there to pay attention to this inflation [problem]  If we  don’t pay attention to it soon, inevitably we’re going to bring about conditions in money markets,  prices, and investment that will lead to a recession  And the larger the inflation bulge, the more  difficult the recession will be, so it’s looked upon with some seriousness  But that doesn’t mean  that there [will] be action        I think they base their skepticism on experience because there   have been a lot of toothless programs  I think the question is  Will people get serious enough and  take real action?   Is the President willing to veto legislation that breaks the budget?  Is he willing  to go into aggressive control of expenditures beyond the budget--asking all departments to scale  down spending even below amounts that perhaps should be appropriated?  Will the federal  government in the face of the labor situation be willing to cut back the increase in Federal pay  raises?  I can’t answer those questions  But if those things are done, I would be more optimistic  that we could then have a case to expect the private sector to do its part  Without the government     3/21/78              33  sector leading the way with real [actions] and not just rhetoric, I think we’re going to get no place   But if concrete things are done then I think that, at least in the next phase, we ought to try to sell the  private sector on doing their share What is the next level of action?  It’s even more difficult and a  little more disruptive, so I think we have to proceed as best we can       I would quote the father of the idea  He said of his child that it’s a   great idea but he wouldn’t enact it into law today because it’s premature  I don’t think it can be a  part of the action in the next few weeks  I think it can be looked at in terms of a more structural  change over time, Frank  It needs to be studied  Is that a fair statement of the father?       [Given] my knowledge of Congress, I’d say that 150 pages of   technical details [translates into] about 10 years in Congress  So, I think it’s going to be slow to  come to that  And I think there are some reasons why we have to be cautious because there could  be some effects in capital intensive industries that would have to be looked at very hard  The  industries that are most in need of capital flows might be the hardest to [deal with] because they’re  also the ones that have the strongest unions and may not be able to resist the pressures  They might  have higher wage rates plus higher taxes at the very time when we need capital formation for  investments  So it is a tricky proposition and I don’t think it can be implemented in the short term     As an aftermath of a series of events over ten years, it’s hard to coalesce leadership in the   government  It’s nobody’s fault, but there has been a fractionalization of leadership after all these  events  Therefore, Congress doesn’t stick too much to anybody’s program  They all have pet  ideas, which is still good in many ways but bad in terms of getting action  And the Administration  has many factions pushing it in this direction and that direction  I personally think time is very  short for them to take some more believable steps in fighting inflation and if it’s not done, inflation  is going to be left to the Federal Reserve and that’s going to be bad news  I don’t think we really  have the capacity to avoid the consequences of the inflation  We can do some things but they  inevitably are not going to work out with a scenario that any of us will like       Well, I think an anti-inflation program will [require] Presidential   leadership and action  If you consult with Congress about it, you will still be consulting next  October!  One of the problems with taking [action] is that everybody has his parochial view   Everybody wants to say well, in my parochial view I’ve got to consult this, and this, and this   Well, then you never get anyplace  So somewhere along the way, if [inflation] is perceived to be  serious enough, I think it’s an executive action that has to be taken  My guess is that such an  action--a forceful and believable action--would be not unpopular, but would be popular       If other actions aren’t taken, we would have to continue the   process, which we will no doubt do  And if we do, inevitably that will lead to a slowing down in  capital investment and in homebuilding and it will lead to a recession  That’s why I hope that other  actions can be taken, not just ours     Let me ask you again please to treat these discussions very [confidentially] because if the   Administration wants to do something, I think they should be left plenty of room to do it in their  own way and their own time  We shouldn’t start rumors of discussions that would impede their  [success]  Like the arrangements with the Germans, too much discussion in advance I think did  hurt the process      Now, I have a couple of choices for you  We have a number of people who would like to   speak; there are four more who have so indicated  Would you like to take a few more minutes to  hear their comments and then have a break or would you like to break now and come back to their  comments?       All right, let’s take the four who are listed so far  Bob Mayo      Thank you, Bob  Phil      I don’t say thank you to that  Willis      Thank you  Paul     3/21/78              37      We’ll have to find an ingenious way to [indicate] that our policies  are taking account of the other parts [of the legislation]  We also have to work toward price  stability and fight inflation       On those occasions, I will invite one of the other members to   testify!  John, I think we’ll ask you to comment as the last speaker  Then I have an experiment I’d  like to try       Thank you  I’d like to try an experiment  Jim, would you give   me three numbers--and I want everyone to write them down  First, what is your objective or what  does the staff have in mind for the real growth in GNP ’78 calendar year over ’77     SPEAKER(?)  Year over year?    SPEAKER(?)  Or fourth quarter to fourth quarter?      Okay, give me fourth quarter over fourth quarter      Okay, write that down  Now give me your year-end  unemployment rate        That’s the average for the fourth quarter, not year-end?      Then write down your deflator      Now the experiment I would like to try  I will not use the data   except to experiment, but during the coffee break or sometime today, would you write down  individually what you think those figures would be within a range  Use a range  Do you expect  GNP is going to be, you know, 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent or do you expect it to be 3-1/2 to 4 percent or  what?  On unemployment, give me exact figures or ranges  This is just for an experiment to see  what this group would come up with if they had to make those personal judgments on top of the  staff  I’ll tell you later why  They’re not to be used; this is private  Let’s have a coffee break                                                         [Coffee break]      Thank you, Peter  Questions?  Comments?   Yes, Henry      Yes, Phil      Gentlemen, we have the question of action to ratify the   transactions since the previous meeting  I believe [the Desk’s reports] have been distributed  Is  there a question?  May I, in the absence of a dissent, record those as approved?  At this point I call  on Steve Axilrod for his comments       Comments or questions?  Yes, Frank      Roger had his hand up     3/21/78              42      That’s a pretty good answer  Chuck and I like the length of it!      Mark, you had a question      Okay      Paul      It’s inevitable that we will have to make changes before we   proceed with the policy directive  Let me mention a couple of points  First, I’ll report on your own  projections for the economy  Taking the members of the FOMC--ten are present--for the ranges of  growth in GNP, five would fall in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent bracket, against the 44 percent that was  indicated by the staff, which would suggest a belief by the FOMC [as a whole] of a little lower  growth rate than the staff expects  Three of the projections would fall moderately below the 4     3/21/78              45  percent; and two would be over 4-1/2 percent  So it looks like that bracket is more or less 4 to  4-1/2 percent  If we picked up the views of the seven additional Presidents who are here, three  would fall below 4 percent and [the others] would go to 4-1/2, or within [the 4 to 4-1/2 percent]  bracket [unintelligible], which again would indicate that the consensus is for slightly slower growth  than the staff projection       On the unemployment rate, the FOMC members fall in at a 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 percent range   against the 59 percent projection  Two would be below the 5-3/4 percent on one of their figures  and two would be over, so that [six] would fall completely within the brackets  If you add the other  Presidents, you pick up five on the low side and three on the high side, which would indicate that  the consensus is, if anything, that the unemployment rate will perform pretty well  It leans a little  even below the staff projection       On prices, the staff projects a 66 percent [deflator]; the FOMC [members] would be 66 to   7 percent, which would indicate that everyone expects inflation to be worse than in the forecast   Three would fall below the 66 in one of their figures, two would go over 7  If you add the other  Presidents, you pick up two below and three over; again it looks like the leaning is to higher  inflation than in the forecast  That is very helpful information     I would say to you that one of the reasons I wanted to experiment--we will just use this here   today--is that the issue I’m facing is as follows  For some time the Congressional Committees who  have oversight and who invite us and by law now require us to testify quarterly on the monetary  aggregates have also been pushing for more quantitative figures on prices, on unemployment, and  on GNP  Those in the System have felt, and I certainly concur, that it would be an enormous  mistake to begin to provide the Congress with staff projections because that would destroy the  ability of the staff to be completely independent in their views and recommendations or projections  to us  They would tend to be influenced by the fact that those views would become public  The  law does not require quantitative numbers; the law now requires that there be a discussion on  projected or prospective production, prices, and employment, but not [quantified]  The solution  that has been used is that the Chairman has been giving personal views of the quantitative figures   I feel a little uncomfortable [with that] and I’d like to have help from the Committee  If I’m going  to give personal views, I would prefer to have this sort of backup or something like it--or even see  if the Committee might want to develop a consensus and authorize me to use this consensus figure  so that we use something that the Committee has developed, not the staff      I think to resist any kind of quantitative figures is going to be very difficult  I’m not too   happy with using just the Chairman’s personal estimates  Maybe that’s because I’m not so well  qualified to make them or maybe it’s because I feel that more input would be a healthier situation  With ranges like this, I don’t think it would be very bad if they were used in testimony  We don’t  have to face it now but at the next meeting I’ll be preparing for [testimony in] April, so you all  might think about this and whether you want an input into those figures or whether you want to  leave it to me  Unfortunately, if it’s left to the Chairman, the Senators and Congressmen and the     3/21/78              46  newspapers assume it is the Federal Reserve position  That’s the problem  So, I don’t like the  Chairman giving his personal views, which really get [incorrectly] interpreted in the press  I was  speaking to a Senator last evening and his comment was, “I didn’t know those weren’t the Federal  Reserve’s figures; I thought they were”  Of course, it has been very carefully said that they were  the Chairman’s figures  So, just bear that in mind because next meeting we might deal with it  If  you would like to comment on it now, I would welcome it, but there’s no urgency to comment at  this point  Ernie       It could be that that’s the solution  It could be that we’d do this   without names and, therefore, have a blind view  Or it could be that this would merely be guidance  to me to make my personal decision   It could be any combination of those  Yes, Mark       I would feel more comfortable if I at least had some input from   the Committee, and I am willing to go as far as you all would like  I’m willing to play it any way I  don’t like to be trying to represent the Federal Reserve with a very crystallized view that makes me  feel that I’m overstepping a little  I don’t personally feel any concern about good times and bad  times  I think the world has come to the point where if we are going to be responsible and  responsive, we’re going to have to be giving some indication of what we see ahead, whether they  are personal views or whether they are consensus views  And some day we are going to have to be  looking at bad times ahead and we are going to have to say so       You see, if I’m asked before the [Congressional] Committee on   April 25 what my personal views on inflation are, they are going to be higher than the  Administration’s and that’s going to be in the newspaper  Now whether we want to say we all have  a view that’s leaning a bit that way--is that better?  Or should it be me?  I can play it either way   But I don’t think we can avoid answering the question; I don’t think we should  I don’t think I     3/21/78              47  should avoid answering the question because the message that inflation is getting worse is a  message to action and if we don’t say it, I think we are not measuring up  I think there has been a  tremendously favorable reaction to my strong statement on inflation already  It hasn’t been  negative  [The reaction] has been, “My God, if that’s true, let us do something”       Mark had his hand up first and then I think--      Bob      That’s correct  If we ever move beyond [my] personal views, it   should be unidentified--[and stated in terms of] consensus and ranges      Henry      That’s what the Congress wants--clarity       3/21/78              48    Yes, it could be widened      I took off the ends of it; it could be widened easily  Let’s see    Bob Mayo wanted to speak      What you’re saying is that you’d like the Chairman to be on the   spot      I think perhaps we’ve spent enough time with this today  I would   appreciate your thinking about it and perhaps coming in with some suggestions at the next meeting  Ernie Baughman has written a letter, which you’ve all received, suggesting that we also take a look  at a longer-range view of monetary policy and the aggregates  My suggestion would be that this  matter be taken up by the Subcommittee on the Directive  Chuck, that’s your committee, I think   Perhaps at the next meeting you could give us some views on this  I think it’s well worth  examining       Is that satisfactory?       3/21/78              49    Now, I think we turn to the directive itself, unless there is some   order of business I’m not familiar with  You have a draft before you, which has general  paragraphs I might ask if there are any comments on the general paragraphs before we come to the  operational paragraph  I have one on line 8, page 1  I think when unemployment went last time  from 64 to 63 percent it edged down; but when it goes from 63 to 61 percent it might just  decline  I think when it falls 02 of a percentage point it is doing more than edging        Yes, a precipitous drop in unemployment  I just think “decline”   might be a better word  Are there any other comments on the general paragraphs?  Then what is  your pleasure on the operational paragraph?  We have two choices, the formulation that is  described as “monetary aggregates” and the one that is “money market”  Anyone?  Paul       Fine, address yourself to a broader view      Gentlemen, I don’t know what your procedures are but maybe I   can make a couple comments on how I see the situation and maybe I can be helpful  It seems to me  that any lowering of the funds rate bracket would be inconsistent with the views that I’ve been  expressing and would, therefore, not be in the direction I would want to go  It also seems to me  that going to higher targets for the federal funds rate right now might be premature in view of all  the other considerations around  I am sympathetic to the idea of a steady course at 6-3/4 percent,  but I think a range of 6-3/4 to 7 is a little unworkable  I would prefer to use 6-1/2 to 7 percent and  administer it at 6-3/4 percent, with consultation before allowing it to go below that as we did  recently when we maintained [the 6-3/4 percent rate] even though the aggregates were below the  range  A second point of view is probably quite consistent with your last point, Paul  I do think  that it would be healthy to have M1 at least, and maybe M2, more toward the alternative C ranges  than the B ranges  So I tend to have, as I expressed it at a recent Board meeting, a B+ attitude  I  would be a little more comfortable with [the ranges for the aggregates] if they were reduced some; I  don’t know how far  But I do like the idea of keeping the federal funds range at this point at 6-1/2  to 7 percent, but targeting the [rate at] 6-3/4 percent without some additional consultation  I don’t  know if that’s helpful to you        3/21/78              51    Oh, no  I think I would allow it to go above  I just wouldn’t   allow it to go below because of the worry that I feel about the inflation situation      That’s what I think  I think that if we could administer it that   [way] we would have a better program      Well, I’d like to hear a little discussion  I think the M1 in   alternative C would be better  Whether it makes any difference in M2, I don’t know  I probably  would take alternative C on both M1 and M2 and alternative B on the federal funds rate  That’s my  viewpoint  Now, in the order people have indicated [a desire to comment], I call on Phil Coldwell       Phil Jackson      Henry Wallich      Dave      4-1/2 to 8?     3/21/78              53      Thank you  Willis      Bones      Larry      Thank you  Ernie       3/21/78              54    Frank      Bob Black      That’s the purpose of having big spread sheets      John      Chuck        3/21/78              55    Thank you, Chuck  Mark      Oh, this is a good group      We have a lot of discipline around here      We haven’t heard from Bob Mayo Would you like to comment?      Thank you  Roger, would you like to add any comments?      Thank you  Alan would you like to make any comments?      Steve?     3/21/78              58      Do you have something else?      I’ll take an opinion      May I just [review] the bidding?  Did I hear any FOMC voting   member ask for a money market directive?  There were several who didn’t speak [to that]  Phil,  did you have any preference?       Dave could you--      Mark?      Willis?      That looks like one thing we’ve decided; there’s a very large   groundswell for the aggregates language  The next thing one might observe, looking this over, is  that everybody uses [different] numbers and words and they all seem to come out to 6-3/4 percent  on the federal funds rate  On the other hand, there seems to be pretty good sentiment that we  should clip down some of the range on M1 and I gather on M2  Steve, I didn’t quite understand  your point You said you wouldn’t like to see the lower end reduced  Are you talking 4-1/2 or 4?       All right, let me see  On M1, it seems to me that if one were   talking 4 to 8, one would catch almost everybody’s view on this  It almost looks like the 5-1/2 to  9-1/2 or 5-1/2 to 9 would catch most people on M2   But some would like to start it at 6 and there  was only one person who would go up to 10  Almost everybody had 9 or 9-1/2 on the upside and  5-1/2 or 6 on the bottom side  There was one 5  Would it be appropriate to consider 4 to 8 on M1  and 5-1/2 to 9 on M2?  And I really think we could live with the 6-1/2 to 7 percent [on the funds  rate] with the consultation below the 6-3/4 better than we could the other [proposed ranges]  So it  would be 6-3/4 and consult before taking it below that and have complete discretion to go to 7   Now, could we get a consensus on that kind of resolution?  I gather that it’s unanimous almost   You’ve got my vote [too] that we should go to the monetary aggregates, so I won’t say anything  [on that]  I always like to be on the winning side!       We would not go below the midpoint unless there was prior   consultation because of conditions      No       3/21/78              60    The 7 the Desk would have [available] at its discretion      Sure, and with the regular directive      So we put in 4 to 8 for M1 and 5-1/2 to 9 for M2      You mean 6-1/2 to 7-1/4?      I think there was a preponderance of members who wanted to   keep a 7 percent lid on the funds rate  We still have the range; it only takes a phone call to decide  that we’ve got to have the rates higher  I hope we could agree to do that  May we vote on that  basis?   Mr Secretary       There are a few other items of business in this meeting and we   may even soon [get] to lunch  I hope you all will join us  Item 9 is the review of the authority for  lending securities and there has been a memorandum on the subject both from the System Account  Manager and from the General Counsel  Peter is prepared to comment, but I rather think that  unless there are particular questions we could get your views by voting  [Someone] moved  approval  Is there a second?       [Hearing no objection,] we will record that as approved  [Next is   a] review of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations  There is a copy [in the  memo you received and] no changes have been proposed  However, I think Steve had a comment  he wanted to call to our attention       Is a vote required on this subject?    SPEAKER(?)  No      It is required  There is a motion, second   Is there any   discussion? Any dissents?  We will approve that  Next is the review of the agreement to  warehouse currencies for the Exchange Stabilization Fund  We have a memo and Ted Truman is  prepared to comment  I’m please to say that after consultation, I find that we do not take any     3/21/78              62  exchange risk on this warehousing  Therefore, I feel comfortable about doing it to accommodate  the Treasury       Even if you have a legal opinion that they’re liable for the risk?      Not under risk, no      Is there a motion to approve?  Is there a second?  Would all those   in favor raise their hands please?  Opposed?   One vote opposed?      Item 12 is the review of the Authorization for Foreign Currency   Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the [Procedural Instructions]  No changes are  proposed  Is this a required vote?  This is moved  Is there a second?  Any discussion?       So, is there any dissent from approval?  Then we’ll record it as   approved  Next is confirmation of [the date of] the next meeting, which is April 18  Unless there is  other business, I would suggest that we adjourn for lunch  Thank you for your patience        END OF MEETING      "
706,1978-04-18,"   I do welcome all of our visitors again and we have a busy agenda  If we move along diligently, I think we can get through it in an appropriate time  I hope that the  word has been passed that I would like, if it is convenient for each of you, to have the Presidents  and the Governors and a few of the staff joining in for lunch upstairs as we did last time  That will  be an occasion where we have a few things we just might informally bring to your attention  And  if there is anything that any of you would like to bring up at that time, we would welcome that     In preparing for the meeting today, there were some items that were pending that I just want  to mention  One was the report on revisions to the procedural instructions for foreign currency  operations, which Governor Wallich and the ad hoc committee have been considering  I  understand that that is not ready for this meeting; it might be ready for June  I just wanted  everybody to know [that work] is still under way and I don’t think there is any pressure to get it  done today  The second matter was a possible change in policy with respect to operations in  Federal agency issues  Steve Axilrod and Peter Sternlight will have something on that for us, I  believe, in May  Is that right, Steve?       So that was a pending item  Another item that was pending was to  report to you on possible methods of settling our swap arrangement with the Bundesbank  Again, I  don’t think that we have made adequate progress from the recent visits of Alan Holmes and Henry  Wallich, too  We may comment on this a little but I don’t think we are ready to move ahead at this  meeting  The meeting [agenda], as I say, is long but I will try to keep it going      One thing I do have an obligation to tell you is that when I first took office and appeared on  March 9 before the House Banking Committee, Chairman Reuss gave me a little static about the  ranges on M3  He thought the dropping of the M3 ranges indicated a decision by the Federal  Reserve to curtail the flow of funds into the housing market; he was concerned about that  Last  Monday, a week ago, I had the second half of my appearance before that Committee They didn’t  finish the first day so [Mr Reuss] brought me back for a second day  On that occasion he again  reminded me that I had an obligation to inform the FOMC of his concern about this  I am now so  informing you so that you will all know he is concerned about why we want to handle M3 in that  way and he wanted me to bring this to your attention with redoubled urgency  I have now done so     Now we can proceed with the agenda  The first item is approval of the minutes of actions  taken at the meeting of March 21  Are there any comments or questions or changes?  Hearing no  dissent, we will record those as approved  On foreign currency operations, Scott Pardee will report  to us on operations since the last meeting       Any questions or comments?  Phil       Well, I think we want to reverse these transactions when the  opportunity presents itself  We have thin markets and we have to be careful and not get a little  ahead of ourselves       I think Henry had something to say       Bones, I think you had a--       Our aggregate paper losses now amount to how much, Ted?       About $90 million of which half is ours, right?  So you have  potential losses now, Bones, of around $50 million for the Fed  Bob Mayo, you had a--       We have a situation where I think you are saying, Scott, that the  dollar has behaved better because of perception rather than reality  And I think that is a very  tenuous market in which to expect you to do major reversals  We hope that that perception will be  clarified by performance and if so, we will be able to reverse the entire amount  That would be  ideal  And we wouldn’t have to have Henry negotiate how we pay [the swap debt] off       Phil       And judicially and prudently  We all agree with that  We might  move on now and ask Henry Wallich if he would give us some comments  It says on my agenda  “brief comments”       How much comes due in May?       That’s right       Phil       Any other comments or questions of Henry?  If not, the next order  of business is an action to ratify the transactions since the previous meeting  I think we have had a  report of those circulated  Is there any further question or is there any dissent from ratifying the  transactions?  Hearing [none], that is approved  The next item is consideration of the Manager’s  recommendations with respect to foreign currency operations  Scott       Any discussion, questions?  Is there any dissent?  Then we will  authorize the rollover  The next item is the proposal for 3-year target ranges for the monetary  aggregates  We have had Ernie Baughman’s letter in the past and we mentioned it at the last  meeting  Since that time this has been considered by our [Subcommittee on the Directive]  Chuck,  you are Chairman of that subcommittee, I understand, and I suggest perhaps that you lead off the  discussion of this item, based on the report that has been circulated       Members of that subcommittee are you, Dave, and Paul       Dave       Ernie, would you like to comment on this?       I think you ought to have a chance to defend your proposal       Ernie, if this kind of approach were taken, it seems inevitable that it  would become repetitive  I don’t think one can do it one time with the expectation that it would  [not] be repeated; that would be my guess  How often would you see the revision?  Would this be  revised once a year?       So, it would be on an irregular basis?       But one of the elements of long-range planning of most kinds is the  ability to revise, based upon circumstances  So one of the problems in terms of credibility is that if  you put something out for three years, the probability of being at the right place three years from  now is very low  That’s unlikely for most long-range planning of any kind  But if you revise often  enough to take account of changes and keep shifting your horizon and you do at least have a  direction in which you are heading and you create a direction more consistent with your view point,  you may have a different consequence than if it is frozen for three years  Very few of us can have a  crystal ball shine enough to tell us what is going to happen in a little over three years       Larry had his hand up first; then we will move to Henry Wallich,  Phil Jackson, Phil Coldwell, and Frank Morris       4/18/78             10     Henry       Phil Jackson       Phil Coldwell       On a one-year basis that is tough       Frank Morris       Bob Black has asked to be heard and Bob Mayo is next       Bob       Well, Ernie, it sounds like there is a consensus in favor of not  moving along these lines at this time  So, since this is a democratic process, your job is to continue  to revive it when you think you have more sales points to make  At this point I would suggest that- -       I think at this point we can accept the subcommittee report and  thank them and thank everyone for the discussion   No doubt we will hear again on the subject at  least of establishing a philosophical base on where we all think we are going--whether it is  quantitative or qualitative       Well, I think that we are planning to have the staff do more or less  what has been done at this meeting--to continue to give us a longer horizon for us to look at       Certainly       It seems to me that we have an overwhelming view that we are not  [going to] take the proposal to indicate mechanical devices  I think there could be qualitative as  well as quantitative looks  But I think the whole process of this Committee should be a living one   It seems to me that we should be open-minded and there should be different viewpoints we should  listen to  We’ll move on to the economic and financial situation and outlook--what we call the  crystal ball report  Jim Kichline     MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN  [Statements--see Appendix]  Mr Zeisel  will continue the presentation with a discussion of domestic economic prospects and likely price  developments       Thank you very much Jim, Jerry, and Ted  At this time I would  suggest a general discussion  And in case any of you are concerned as to whether we are going to  repeat the exercise of your own projections for GNP, prices, and unemployment, I would suggest     4/18/78             14  that our discussion now assume there is no change in them and we will discuss that matter later in  connection with a presentation of the quantitative projections to the Congressional Committee  But  I think now should be just a general discussion and question period  [Willis]       In the housing area, Jim, you might mention--in case anyone missed  it--that you have assumed an increase in the ceiling rates at what, midyear?       So that has been assumed in terms of the funds availability for  housing  Bob Mayo       I might mention, in case you missed it, that the Federal Home Loan  Bank has just reduced by 1/2 percent its liquidity requirements--I expect you all saw that--which  releases about $17 or $18 billion in potential resources for housing       If any of you want 400 letters, testify before Congress that we might  be raising the rate and you will get 400 letters!       Yes, Bob       I wish you would  That’s an area of [unintelligible]       Hope you are right  We have listed for comments Phil Coldwell,  Henry Wallich, Ernie Baughman, and David Eastburn  So we will start with Phil       A mini growth recession?       [Henry]       That is just the market--the supply and demand       Dave       Mark       Thank you, Mark  Frank       Thank you, Frank  Chuck       I am a little disappointed  We know the problem, Chuck       Philip Jackson       4/18/78             22     I can’t say thank you to that one; I appreciate it  Bones       Thank you, Bones  Tom Williams, it’s nice to have you with us       Paul, you have been very quiet       Don’t be too defensive       Thank you  Let’s see  We haven’t heard Roger  Is there anything  you would like to comment on?       Bob Black, do you have anything to say?       Well, tomorrow I complete six weeks in my new assignment and in  that period of time it seems to me that inflation has risen in the visibility of people as an issue  It  seems that underlying everything we are saying today [inflation] is what is behind the changes in  projections and a lot of the comments here  There are factors that would indicate the possibility of  sustained moderate growth in the economy  The inventory situation is in good shape  The ratios  are good  Depending on how you look at it and where you go in the country, the capacity  utilization does have some slack  Employment we can debate about but we shouldn’t forget that  we have a large number of people--almost a million--parked in public service jobs that might be  flushed out into the other labor force if the economy needed them and there was a demand for  them  And capital spending hasn’t yet recovered in real terms to where it was before  So those are  all factors that would allow for continued moderate growth without unusual pressure     But contrary to that are the effects of inflation that would show up in interest rates and in  housing--and therefore possibly a decline in housing  Capital spending may not ever get to be as     4/18/78             26  well as we project if interest rates move ahead because businesses do act a little on their  expectations of costs and prices; when they are uncertain, they hold back  And the international  situation could be a destabilizing force for growth  So I think we have a mixed situation, with a  possibility of continuing at moderate growth rates through the forecast period  And I would concur  that those growth rates, short term, are going to be rather vigorous and may tempt us to believe that  we have a very strong economy when I would see other factors moderating growth  I look at the  slower growth rate absent the peculiar bulge of the second quarter, which [reflects] some activity  shoved forward from the first quarter  I take that back out  As you know, last meeting and this  meeting I have been looking myself at more moderate growth  I was under the projections of the  staff last time in my own views and would still believe that we are looking, except for the second  quarter situation, at a moderate outlook     I would suggest that we take a coffee break and when we return we will turn to the question  of do we believe in monetary policy            [Coffee break]       I would like to compliment the staff for the presentation this  morning  I thought it was excellent; I could understand it, so obviously it was excellent!  I usually  come to these briefings and I don’t understand them  It is nice to have it put in simple economics  that I can understand  Thank you     Now, as a prelude to considering the long-run ranges, I’ve asked Steve if he would give just a  few of the pros and cons on some possibilities  As you know, in the Bluebook on page 5 some  alternatives are presented       Well, gentlemen, normally I would like to add my analysis but  Steve has said it well  My personal reaction is that, considering all the pluses and minuses, I     4/18/78             28  believe it would be prudent to maintain the current ranges at the present time  That is my own  reaction to the situation  There is one aspect I would call to your attention and that is that in the  past we have been reporting these ranges to the Congress on M1, M2, and M3  In the Federal  Reserve Reform Act there is reference to reporting on monetary and credit aggregates, so I think  we would be wise to look at bank credit and make that a formal part of our proceedings  We could  include that also and be more consistent with the language of the Act  Before the Federal Reserve  Reform Act we were dealing with a resolution that did not have the effect of law  Now we are  talking about the law and I think we ought to be more in compliance with it   As you know from  the materials that were circulated, Senator Proxmire also wants us to deal with this debt proxy  situation, which I am not all that excited about  But we are going to study it and at least get the  analysis done  But I would feel that we should have four items for which to establish ranges M1,  M2, M3, and bank credit  Again, my suggestion would be that we live within the current ranges  until the next quarterly meeting  Dave       Yes       Paul       I think intellectually one would want to see it lower but my feeling  is that it is not worth the effort in terms of what we are trying to accomplish  Phil Coldwell       Okay  Henry       Thank you  Bones       Chuck       Phil Jackson       Yes, 7 to 10 is what is being proposed       Steve, how would that strike you?       We didn’t report that last time around       So we don’t have the same problem of change  I wouldn’t object to  that if--       It is in the policy record so the question is  Do we want to show an  increase at this point?  I don’t feel strongly about it because I don’t think it is one that is focused  on And I could certainly live with making that 7-1/2 to 10-1/2       Well, let’s come back to that in a moment  Roger       Bob Black       Mark       I have already made that statement; I made it to the House  Committee when they asked me  It seems to me that our policy should be to set ranges and to be  within them  That is our purpose and I realize that if we stick with our current one that we do have  to take some restraining measures to live within the M1 range  I realize that       Mark, if we want to be safe, to live within them I think Steve is  right that we should raise the upper limit of M1  But the trouble with that is that it works against  our purpose--to fight inflation       Mark, anything else?  Thank you  Larry       Bob Mayo       Thank you, Bob  Ernie  Before you speak, I want to welcome  Steve Gardner, who has come in  I will tell you, Steve, that we are right in the midst of setting the  long-term ranges and we were being very imaginative by trying to keep them where they are-- which I might add will be very tough in terms of the current outlook for inflation       Thank you  Willis       We have not discussed the short-range targets and we do not plan to  do so because they are not released until three days after the next meeting  So the only thing they  might discuss is why we had the short-term ranges from the March meeting  I might get questions  but we would not normally be volunteering in our testimony any comments on the short-run  ranges And we will not discuss the ranges set today       We have the Merrill case we have to worry about the same day; we  may face it  In this go-around of testimony, we will not be addressing short-term ranges other than  questions they might ask about the past       All right  Frank, did you have anything to add?       Steve, did you have any suggestions?  We’re talking about staying  with the current ranges  I’ll make a comment in just a moment about the bank credit part of it       I think every member has been consistent with this except perhaps  Henry  I am not sure how strongly you felt about reducing M2 and M3  My suggestion, to recap,  would be to stay with the current ranges for M1, M2, and M3  And from Phil’s comment, which I  think is a good one, we’d set the bank credit at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2  Now, Henry, would you be able to  vote for that?       Is there anyone who can’t vote for that?  Then we have a  [unanimous] vote  Thank you very much  The next item of business is the continuing discussion  of how we handle these quantitative expectations for real GNP, prices, and the unemployment rate,  consistent with the long-run ranges for the monetary aggregates  We know we have some  problems  If I were giving my personal view today, I think you all know the issue so I won’t repeat  it  We have had a couple of excellent letters which have been circulated  I appreciated those  letters; they were helpful  If I were giving my own estimates for the second quarter of l978 to the  second quarter of l979--that would be our first-quarter-to-first-quarter [figures], I would be looking  at real GNP in the 4 to 4-3/4 percent range  That means fairly slow growth after the second quarter  I would look at unemployment as 5-3/4 to 6 and I would look at inflation as 6-3/4 to 7-1/4     The question before the house is  Would it be your desire for us to seek a consensus of the  FOMC and for me to report to the Congress on the consensus?  That consensus might say that all or  most of the members fell within these ranges, two members thought it should be higher, and one  thought it should be lower  It would be that kind of comment, which opens up the possibility,  particularly for Henry Reuss, [to say] “Send me the names of the people who felt that way”  That  may be a good idea or a bad idea  He backed off that, however, in my recent testimony when I said  that I thought that would be inappropriate because it would be impossible to get an open discussion  if people thought they were going to be called before Congress to explain every little quiver and  quake  The other alternative is for me to make these my own personal observations and report  them accordingly  The other alternative, of course, is to consider this an official action--that is, as  ranges of the Committee  What is your pleasure?   I am looking for guidance       I understand  Philip Jackson       You’d rather me have that burden!       John       Of course, we do on the monetary side have the vote of the  Committee; and it is only on GNP and inflation numbers [that we do not]   Mark       I appreciated the letter; it was very helpful       Bob Mayo       You all saw my last letter, I take it       Somebody has to be available to go to jail!       Thank you, Bob  Philip Coldwell       Henry       They were consistent with this except on inflation, which was 6-1/2  percent       I feel comfortable in saying that I think inflation is worse now than  it was three months ago and worse three months [ago] than it was before that Your point is well  taken  Paul       We have twelve [differing views] on the outlook for the economy  and a unanimous vote for monetary policy       Dave       4/18/78             39     I will say that I will let you know each time what I am thinking  If  you think it is way out of line, whistle  I don’t think a quarter of a point is a big deal but if you  really thought we [had big] differences I would like to debate it because I don’t want to get at  variance with a middle range       I think I will bring you in on what I am thinking each time  That  way you won’t be surprised and you will have a chance to suggest, as Phil did, that maybe I ought  to widen a range  It won’t be locked up until we prepare the testimony, so I am open to arguments  or even persuasion  Chuck       Willis       Steve       And having listened, I’ve come to this personal judgment       Thank you, Steve  Roger       Bones       Frank       Really?   I’ll come back [to that]       And he will be asleep!       With all the times we are invited to testify, maybe we better get the  Presidents testifying more often so we can spend more time working at the Board  Well, Larry,  you are entitled to a rebuttal if it is short  We are running out of time       Ernie, you are the last I believe  We have heard from everyone  [else]       I wanted a procedure with your permission  I don’t hear anyone  who is objecting to my making personal projections for the time being  I hear people who say they  would be comfortable if [Congress] moves us more into [providing a consensus of] the Committee,  but I see no pressure to do that  So with your permission, I’ll proceed accordingly  You will get  the testimony; you will see it, and we will discuss it from time to time  And we will see what  happens Is that agreeable?  So we will proceed accordingly       4/18/78             42     Well, our records show moderate growth [in] all those things, but it  is a question of when you get the numbers  Now we come to what we have all morning been  waiting for--what we do about all of this       Yes       Yes, to the Subcommittee [on the Directive]       So that will come forth and we will discuss it at some point       On the domestic open market operations, Peter Sternlight has been  waiting patiently and is now going to tell us about the operations since the last meeting       Thank you, Peter  We need an action to ratify the transactions since  the previous meeting  May I consider that a vote?  Any objection?  Hearing none, that is approved  Any questions or comments on Peter’s report?  Frank       It is more comforting to have it that way       It is a conscious effort on our part that collateral [unintelligible]   Any other comments or questions?  Steve, if you will report to us now       Does that mean you are hungry and you are ready to go or  something like that?       Thank you, Steve  I’d like to give you a personal proposition, not  intending to constrict your views but just to give you something to shoot at as a possible idea  If  we are going to have any chance of living within our long-run range, we are going to have to  tighten up here a little bit  I would suggest, therefore, the following possibility that we accept for  the April-May period the ranges shown on page 8 in alternative C, which for M1 is 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  percent and for M2 6 to 10 percent, and that we set the federal funds range at 6-1/2 to 7-1/4  percent And [I’d take the wording] on page 3 for the directive, lines 43 and 44, which states that in  the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average  federal funds rate close to or slightly above the current level  That would, of course, give the Desk  some possibility for a move in the direction that I think we need to move in--to begin to accomplish  that  That is a suggestion  I am open to your thoughts       Oh, I’m sorry  By saying on page 3, I meant to suggest using the  monetary aggregates  I meant to say 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, 6 to 10, 6-1/2 to 7-1/4, and use “close to or  slightly above” the current level  Paul, you have a comment?       Even further?  Well,--       Okay  Phil Coldwell       Where would you put the lower limit?       John Williams       Steve       It is [something] like 10 percent for the month of April, you see   Unless we do something, we are going to get outside of our ranges       Bob Black        Phil Jackson       The 26th is the Treasury [announcement]       With an aggregates directive       Bones       Ernie       4/18/78             47     Would you say that again, Ernie?       Yes, that’s 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 and 6 to 10  Dave       Old habits       I’d put my midpoint at 7 in my 6-1/2 to 7-1/4  It is a very good  midpoint  Chuck       Mathematically I think it just works out that way       It is good       Larry       Frank Morris       Frank, anything else?       Steve, would you have any comments?       4/18/78             49     Henry       Thank you  Mark       There has been a lot of that going around       Okay  Willis, you haven’t given us your views yet       John, did you have any specifics you would like to mention?       Roger       Well, Bob Mayo, you are the last one and you can, therefore, sum it  up and tell us what we are really going to adopt       Well, thank you all very much  Let me see if I can synthesize this  quickly  I don’t think we have that much disagreement  On M1, we have 6-1/2 votes for  something below 5, one of which is 2, and the rest of which are 4  Therefore, it would look pretty  consistent to put the bottom at 4  On the upside we are kind of split between the 8 and 9  If 4 is on  the bottom, I suspect that 8 or 8-1/2 on the top makes sense--4 to 8 maybe?       Well, I think that it is split pretty evenly  I would see nothing  wrong with putting 4 to 9  Excuse me, go ahead       4/18/78             51     Let’s put down 4 to 8 for the moment  It is just for seeing where we  come out here  We have Partee with 4 to 9 and a couple of others on the Committee agreeing with  that and quite a few agreeing with it among the Presidents  On M2 it looks like the 5-1/2s have it   In other words, 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 appears to be the range that mostly shows up here  It almost looks as  if there is a fairly strong consensus on a federal funds range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/4         Well, there is 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 and 6-3/4 to 7-1/2  There are more that  would be 6-3/4 to 7-1/2  I think everyone was for an aggregates directive, as I read it  If that is  right, the biggest debate is whether we should have a wider range on M1  Chuck       Of the members of the Committee, how many would prefer an 8 top  on M1 with a 4 bottom, considering all this discussion?     SPEAKER(?)  Just members, Mr Chairman, or everybody?       This is just an indication  Assuming a 4 bottom, how many of you  prefer 8 on the top side?  Members only       All right  Let’s go backwards then  Let’s settle the funds rate first   There seems to be more sympathy for a 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 percent funds range  Would any voting  member of the Committee find himself unable to vote for that?       Well, if it were stated that way--6-3/4 to 7-1/2, with no movement  above 7-1/4 without consultation--how would that sit with the voting members?  Okay, that is what  it would be there  Now we can move to M2  There seems to be a kind of consensus around 5-1/2  to 9-1/2  There are some 6 to 10s and some 4-1/2 to 8s, but most are around there  What is the  reaction of the voting members on that?     SEVERAL  5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent?       All right, that’s 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  Then we have the M1 question left    Let us put it in terms of having that range as our objective on federal funds, what do we think of a  4 to 9 percent M1 range?  Would that be satisfactory to everyone?  Mark       Yes, we could split it  I am afraid of getting caught [in terms of]  what really happens in aggregates  I don’t know  I am a little nervous that if we get it down to 4  and find ourselves--     4/18/78             53       Yes  Well, how about 4 to 8-1/2?  Is that all right?     SEVERAL  Sure       All right  We have, therefore, 7 as the midpoint and consultation  above 7-1/4  On the directive itself we have a few suggestions  I would like to review them and  see if we are all in agreement  One suggestion is that we actually cut out lines 20-24  I did not  read them carefully  Does that do anything of detriment to the directive?       Yes, M2 is the second sentence, isn’t it?  What is the sentiment?       Does anybody else want to take it out besides Phil?  Then we will  leave it in  Then on the lines beginning at 20--the footnote--we will do the switching around of the  language that I think Chuck Partee [suggested]  Did everyone note that?       Why don’t we just strike the word “gradual” and say “while  encouraging continued economic expansion”?       Is “moderate” acceptable?  Then the figures we all discussed, and  the other thing is to take the footnote on page 3  That one line, “the associated range for bank  credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent” we put up in the text  And we have line 43 saying “a federal  funds rate close to or slightly above the current level”  Do we have a directive?     4/18/78             54       Well, all right  On the federal funds rate sentence strike out “close  to or”   So it says “with the federal funds rate slightly above the current level”  How is that?  And  on page 2 somebody wanted one word in  What was it?       Nobody minds one word  Well, you were marvelous today  You  got through on time and everything  You are all invited to lunch and the next meeting is [May 16]  We had a vote, didn’t we?  Is there any dissent?  Hearing no dissent, we have voted on all those  wonderful things unanimously  So that is confirmed  Thank you all  We will see you in the dining  room        END OF MEETING      "
726,1978-05-05," Gentlemen, the reason we have decided to have a conference  meeting of the FOMC this morning is because of the aggregates that have been reported  As you  know, at the last meeting we specified that we would operate with a federal funds range of [6-3/4]  to 7-1/2 percent but that we would not go above 7-1/4 percent without consultation  Conditions are  now such that we felt it would be well to have this discussion  Rather than use the procedure of  sending everyone telegrams and just have you react to a message, it seemed better to me to have an  opportunity for us to exchange views  That’s why I thought it best to get us on the phone  I hope it  isn’t inconvenient to anyone  What I propose to do is to have some brief reports from the staff and  then make a specific recommendation for your consideration and discussion  To start off, I would  like to ask Steve Axilrod to report on the latest projections on the money aggregates and on what he  sees [in the offing] for the April-May period       Thank you, Steve  I would ask Alan Holmes, [who is] on the line at  New York, if he would like to add anything at this point from his view or vantage point       Alan, I think some are having difficulty hearing you  You might  just get closer to your transmitter       Thank you, Alan  I’m going to ask Jim Kichline, who’s with us  here, to comment briefly on economic developments since our last meeting       Thank you, Jim  I’d like now just to give you my viewpoint on the  situation and what I think we might consider doing       5/5/78              4     Well, to go to my own observations, one is that I think what we  have been doing recently in terms of monetary policy has been prudent and has been perceived to  be rather decisive  The move up 1/2 percent in short order on the federal funds rate, as you know,  has been interpreted as aggressive action but very much called for in the circumstances  It actually  has been well received in the marketplace as positive evidence of our determination to take action  to curb inflation and to be [responsive] to current conditions  So I think what we have done so far  has gone down extremely well and has been effective  It has generated a good deal of credibility  and a good deal of support for what we’re trying to accomplish     Now we come to these numbers  On a raw basis alone they would indicate the possibility of  a further tightening, using our additional 1/4 point  The reason I think we might not want to do that  is because, looking at the real economy and listening to what Jim has just said--that it appears we  have a very high level of nominal activity in the second quarter, which is consistent with a push  forward from the low activity in the first quarter--this [situation] may indeed be transitory  My first  concern is that we [shouldn’t] begin to take further action before we hardly let the other moves  work their way through; that could be an over-stepping that we would regret later if in fact this is a  transitory situation  Add to it the fact that we are not yet sure enough about whether there are or  are not other extraneous factors, which Steve outlined  That makes me concerned that we don’t  become a little [impetuous]--moving in a knee jerk way instead of having a more steady hand and  looking at a steady course      I look at the other factors in the economy and I do not see evidence that at this point begins to  concern me in terms of the relationship of money and the probabilities for real activity  I don’t see  inventories accumulating out of line  I don’t see a rush of orders  I really see the first and second  quarters as being averaged together and I begin to look at the money averages together  And then I  consider some of these other factors and I feel we’re far more on the track that we’re seeking than it  would appear from the raw data  Then I look at the other things we’re trying to accomplish at the  Federal Reserve, in terms of building a sense of steady, prudent, determined action, and I see that  we might find ourselves less effective on some of our other objectives if we seem to be rather too  quick on the trigger  I wish we could, therefore, look at a program where we would continue the  federal funds rate in the neighborhood of 7-1/4 percent and where the Board might consider next     5/5/78              5  Thursday, when we would be free of the effects of the Treasury financing, an increase in the  discount rate of 1/2 percentage point, and let that be our next statement of our determination  Then  we’d get some more data on these [money] numbers before we begin to move too rapidly on a  tightening  This is overly brief and I could elaborate and embellish, but that’s the bottom [line] of  how I see it  I might at this point run down the list and get the reaction of the members of the  Committee  Paul, perhaps you would lead off and give us your reaction       Well, that’s a good point, let’s come back to that later  I think it’s  something we’ll want to discuss  Steve Gardner       Thank you, Steve  Willis Winn       Thank you very much, Willis  Mark Willes       Mark, thank you  Reminds me why I used to call it the annual  non-recurring change  Last year it seemed that you had extraneous factors every month  Let’s  hope that that’s not the experience this year  I might point out that one reason we have had good  market reception to our [action] is that I think we stated our policy well and prepared the world to  know what we were going to do  We may need a little more prep time for people to be convinced  that some numbers have [come in] here that require the next step  I don’t know but my [sense] is  that we need just a little more prep time  Henry Wallich       Thank you, Henry  Chuck Partee       5/5/78              7     Chuck, there was a disconnect  Nobody has heard anything you’ve  said  Are we all back on the line?       I suppose no one heard what Chuck was saying     SPEAKER(?)  That is correct       Well, Chuck, that was a brilliant speech  Can you shorten it?       Thank you, Chuck  Phil Jackson       Thank you, Phil  Bob Black       Thank you, Bob  Ernie Baughman       When is that meeting, Ernie?       Thursday  Thank you  I think that [covers] the comments of all the  members  I’d like to ask Chuck if he would speak to the question of timing on the discount rate  increase  Would it be all right if we kicked that around here and tried to look at the timing based  upon moving the rate up to 7-1/4 and then holding it steady for the week during the financing and  say we are prepared to move on it as soon thereafter as we felt it appropriate?  I might add that we  have one other piece of strategy in our thinking, which is that our [interagency] coordinating  committee has been working on the problem of disintermediation and has some thoughts of what  we might do there  It is unlikely that we can get that in place until next week  Wednesday or  Thursday would be the most optimistic [estimate of when] we could accomplish that  Thursday  would be optimistic even  That’s another step that we might well want to be taking to provide for a  continuing flow of funds to thrifts at a time when rates are getting to a point where we may have  some disintermediation  That has been a [factor in] my thinking about moving the funds rate  I’d  like to get in place a way to avoid disintermediation before we get these rates moving too rapidly   Chuck, on the question of timing, how do you see that?       Again, this is one of those questions where logic might say the  sooner the better, but there may be something to be gained by [waiting] a couple of days to put in  place some of the other actions we could take that I think will demonstrate a more concerted,  positive, and coordinated effort  Alan, how do you see it?       So as far as you’re concerned, there is no reason to delay unless  getting the coordinating committee [action] in place would be helpful?     5/5/78              10       Well, just to focus on this action, by my count there are ten of us  present  I believe we have one Governor who is not here and there is one vacancy on the Board   So we have eleven members and one is absent, which makes ten  I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 who have  indicated a concurrence with my recommendation  And I would say my recommendation should  be interpreted as following the Volcker technique of handling the 7-1/4  I think Paul’s statement of  that was extremely wise under the circumstances and it would be consistent with my thinking  I  count four voters who would prefer to move more rapidly  I catch a sentiment that the Governors  should move as quickly as they can on the discount rate  I think the Governors will take that under  advisement  Is there more to be said, or shall we consider this [completed]?  Is this something that  requires a vote?       Paul, it well could  I think that’s something we’d better sit down  and think about  Actually Alan is in a sense right  We have created an atmosphere now where the  market anticipates everything  And the Wall Street Journal reported that we’re obviously going up  on the discount rate, so everything is now anticlimactic, I guess       Yes, it could well be  I think the point is well taken, and the  Governors can certainly take that into consideration       Paul, we don’t want [them] to get too far ahead of themselves   Well, our Secretary tells us that because of the instruction we may need a vote  Should we have a  vote, Mr Secretary?       Well, when in doubt, vote  I would put before the Committee a  proposition that we operate on the 7-1/4 between now and such other time as events cause us to  consult again or until the next meeting, erring on the side of 7-1/4 being the bottom  And that I  think is the only action of this Committee  The discount rate matter is one the Governors will take  up separately and we appreciate your advice and counsel  Would you call the roll?       Gentlemen, thank you very much  We’ll be in touch if anything  else is needed  Otherwise we will see you at the next meeting, about 10 days hence  Thank you   Bye       END OF SESSION    "
746,1978-05-16,"  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the time has arrived for our May  meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee  I’d like to welcome all of our travelers from far  away and thank the Governors for coming out of their offices so early to be with us  It’s getting to  be a habit to be on time!  I read in the newspapers that you usually start these [meetings] 15  minutes late You can’t really believe what you read in the paper  I read yesterday that I’m part  Indian, which was news to me     SPEAKER(?)  Because you’re from Oklahoma?        The Federal Reserve will do anything to get its EEO [objectives]   The first order of business is to approve the minutes of the Committee meeting on April 18 and the  phone meeting on May 5  Are there any corrections or comments on the minutes?  I hear no  objections, so we shall consider those approved and move to item 2, the report on foreign currency  operations since the last meeting  Scott Pardee       How much of that, Scott, is for the System?  Just to remind  everyone, that’s for the Treasury and the System I think  Is it 60 percent?       Thank you, Scott  Any questions?  Frank       Henry       Dave       5/16/78              3     I don’t know whether we intended to wait for our normal reports to  disclose that we had repaid  But whether we did or not, Dr Emminger has made a public statement  that we have repaid, so that’s now in the marketplace  And there was no particular reaction to it, as  I gather, Scott       I think that a certain amount of confusion in the marketplace is  healthy sometimes  Now we must act to ratify the transactions since the previous meeting  Are  there any questions or comments?  May we have your approval of such ratification?  Hearing no  dissent, we shall so approve  I regret to say that Alan Holmes is not able to be with us  He is ill  today  We do have his report on the question of the status of negotiations for repayment  Scott,  were you planning to comment on this in Alan’s absence?       Henry, you might just comment a moment on one source of  D-marks that has been worked out, and that’s the Canadian borrowing in D-marks  When they  convert that, it allows us to have a source of D-marks, which is very helpful to us       But you’re right, the market for D-marks would drive them up so  it’s a--       Scott, you have a recommendation on the open position between  meetings, is that correct?       This is a change down instead of up, which wasn’t contemplated  when people set these rules       You’ve heard the recommendation  Is there any discussion or  dissent?  Hearing none, we will consider that recommendation approved  There were those here  who were skeptical that we would be at that point at this time, but it’s working fairly well       We have problems ahead no doubt     5/16/78              6       Prudently       Well, it will be done well  Don’t worry       Unless there are further questions, I would propose that we go  ahead with the economic and financial situation and I call on Jim to give us his staff’s comments       I welcome any comments and discussion  Frank do you want to--       I would like to suggest that we get your specific questions and then  do a round robin and see how everyone feels about real GNP, prices, and unemployment either in  relation to the staff or in relation to their own work or experiences  Ernie, do you have a question?   I think [you’re] next  Oh, Frank, I’m sorry, did we cover yours?       Jim, wouldn’t you say, though, that if they would scale up their  plans, we’d still have a lag time because of [unintelligible] problems?  These kinds of problems are  worse today than they were five years ago         So even if plans get built up, it’s hard to get the spending in very  quickly  Bob Black       Chuck, you had a question       Dave  No rebuttals  You can discuss it at lunch     5/16/78              9       Phil Coldwell       Willis, you had a question       5/16/78              10     Because of what?       And there’s the Mexican box car situation  They were buying from  Mexico and had trouble with customers, and that has created a real shortage       [Unintelligible] you go down that rail and you’ll go into the ocean;  you can’t expect to come back       John Balles, you had a question       I was just interviewed yesterday  I hope we get the right answer  here that’s consistent with what I said  I always try to answer and get the facts later!       I think there is no question that we’re going to hit the pressure  sooner  We have some high cost capacity that’s counted in capacity  It’s obsolete, [given] high  energy costs       Well, why don’t we do a round robin on how you all see the  economy?  Do we want to start with volunteers or should I just start here with Steve and go  around? Why don’t we ask you, Steve, to give us your views?  Do you agree with the staff or do  you have--       5/16/78              13     Henry       But you want that to be a soft landing       Phil       Frank       Frank, would you think the second quarter is along the lines that  Phil talked about?       Would you go up to 10 percent?       The block buying is going to pick up       Ernie       John       Thanks, John  Mark       Bob       We will skip across and pick up Larry       Thank you  Bones     5/16/78              18       Not to mention the control boats for oil people too--right, Ernie?         Dave       Willis     5/16/78              19       Are they still your friends?       Bob       Chuck     5/16/78              20       Phil       Paul       Well, thank you all  May I just say that what I hear is a universal  opinion of a strong second quarter, not terribly different from the real growth that the staff has  [forecast]   I hear differences of opinion as to the outlook for growth in the second half of the year  and almost a universal feeling that the risk is for higher inflation  That’s what I hear     Jim, before we leave the subject, I think several of the staff, when asked yesterday by the  Governors in our briefing, indicated their feeling that if there was any risk in the last half of the     5/16/78              23  year it might be that the performance would be weaker than the [forecast]  Is that still the staff  opinion? Or did I reflect it correctly?       I thought that the Committee might [want to] know that  You all  see some things, but the staff was questioned on this yesterday and I think they would probably feel  that prices are the most vulnerable part of their forecast--that they see pressures--but for the  discussion on actual real activity, [they thought] it might be lower  Let me ask I’m told coffee is  ready, but is [a coffee break] desirable or can we get out some reports before?  What would be your  pleasure--break and come back?  All right, why don’t we do that and we’ll pick up on the next and  most exciting part, I thought, of an FOMC meeting     [Coffee break]       Ladies and gentlemen, may we reconvene to come to the part we are  paid for?  For now it’s going to [unintelligible]   Opinions are very valuable, but votes separating  the folks [unintelligible]   Let’s see now; [the next agenda item is] domestic open market  operations  Peter Sternlight will give us a report on operations since our last meeting       Thank you, Peter  Any questions?  Phil       You all have received a report on the transactions of the Desk and  we need action to ratify those  Are there any questions or comments?  Are there any dissents from  approval?  Then we will consider those approved and turn to Steve Axilrod for his comments       5/16/78              24     We have a question from Frank Morris       I think we have a couple ahead [of you]  We’ll put your name on  the list  Paul you had [a question]       Henry, you had a question, I think       Chuck       Ernie       I would like to suggest a procedure now that you’ve asked your  questions of Steve  I would like to give you some personal comments about the question of the  directive and then perhaps call on the voting members of the FOMC in order to get your personal  viewpoints and then call on the other Presidents to give us their inputs  I think that might speed up  the process in getting to a decision      I think this is the most difficult of the few meetings I’ve been to in terms of making the right  judgment and I’ll tell you a few reasons why  I won’t try to give you the full scope of my interests  and concerns because I don’t want to take that much of your time  But first let me just give you a  few slants on the money situation  If you look at the [figures on the] money aggregates on page 4,  change the second M3 to M4; we don’t have two M3s  The first thing that has concerned me about  the decision this month is to what degree [M1 growth in] April is an aberration and to what degree  [it is due] to the tax deposits--the nonwithheld payments--which were higher than usual  And to  what extent has the high level of stock market activity created aberrations that we can’t yet measure  or understand?  I’m beginning to assume that it is an aberration  I look back and I see--not on this  table--78 percent growth in M1 in calendar year ’77 and for the last twelve months 73; it’s coming  down  In the last six months, including this April, it’s 65  And in the last three months, including  this April, it’s 72  My first observation is that if there is something strange about April, then  averaging over time, the figures aren’t nearly as bad as we might be thinking [when] looking too  closely at one month  You see the same thing in M2  Steve, refresh my memory  What was the  rate of growth in calendar ’77?       It was 98  But in the last twelve months it’s down to 82 and in the  last six months it’s down to 69  And even with 3 months and April the way it is, it’s 70  So my  first conclusion is that perhaps we should not begin to exercise policy too quickly over a month that  may have strange features about it      My second concern goes to the general judgment about the economy and the risk of being  right or wrong on that judgment  It’s interesting that when we look out at the [unintelligible] as it  is  What we’ve got to do in judging the economy in the next twelve months is to judge how it’s  going to behave, and it never behaves like we feel today  It always behaves in some other pattern  When we look at the first half of the year, we have an average real growth of 4-1/4, or maybe 4-1/2,  and we put that against the context of the early projections of the staff for growth for the full year  of 46 percent  And the first half, with a strong quarter, is less than that  I don’t see the  characteristics of an overheated economy if you assume that the two quarters do have to be     5/16/78              30  averaged because of the characteristics of the first quarter and the catch-up significance of the  second quarter--the second-quarter bounceback  When we were here talking earlier in the year and  looking at first-quarter figures, everybody assumed a much softer bounceback, you see  Now that  it has happened and it averages out everybody assumes that it’s going to continue forever  I think  we tend to do this psychologically  I worry about that because it might make us make poor  judgments      The inevitability of the circumstances, if I’m correct, would indicate that we shouldn’t yet  judge that there is a built-in strong economic uptrend  One would expect that we’d be running out  of characteristics of catch-up buying, running out of characteristics that may be influencing  consumers [to spend], recognizing that we have already put some restraint into the system and  recognizing that the change in the tax proposals mean the fourth quarter is going to have a  reduction of stimulus of about $35 billion, annual rate  I think the more likely scenario is for a  slowdown in the economy along the lines of the staff projection--perhaps even weaker by the  fourth quarter  I personally think this is good  I assume our policy direction for the last few  months has been directed toward slowing the economy as a means of slowing inflation and as a  means of bringing some equilibrium in world economic conditions because our fast growth rate  against slow rates have created certain problems for us      Now, if in fact that judgment is true, I hope we’d be cautious in further monetary action that  might precipitate or trigger some dislocations that we don’t intend  I also would think that we want  to achieve that lower growth rate with that soft landing that Henry Wallich speaks of, which means  we ought to be a little cautious in how we move to reinforce that slowdown for fear that we’d  overshoot and we don’t land very softly--we go right on through the line and end up in a recession   I guess my fear is that we’re at the point of time at the Federal Reserve where if we don’t make a  very judicious judgment here, we could well find ourselves being the cause of recessionary  pressures     On the other side, I view the risk as being low if we go slowly, because I don’t see further  significant tightening here as doing much for inflation or doing much for preventing a cycle if it’s  already under way from some of the forces you all mentioned  I mean it’s going to happen then, so  why do we need to accelerate it?  Therefore, I don’t see a high risk in going slowly  I see a high  risk in going too fast because if the scenario [I’ve outlined] is right, surely that will bring about a  recession, which I think would be unwise  So [that’s how] I look at the balance of risks--and again  I’m shortening this without telling you about my recent conversation with the housing industry  yesterday  They came out with a very strong anti-inflation resolution and they’re home saying  they’re going to cut down their activities because this is what the group meeting in Washington  yesterday was saying  They were calling on the federal government to balance the budget this year  [and] in ’79; they were calling on the federal government to take action to balance the budget even  if it meant withdrawing money from housing  So there is a psychology a little different from what I  heard [previously]; they’re going home with the idea of dampening their activities and being  willing to forgo building in order to hold down inflation  That was the story when they had a  written resolution they had just adopted 90-10--90 percent voting for it after a very intense debate     5/16/78              31     So there are, it seems to me, more probabilities that we could create problems by going too  far this time than we’d create by being a little more cautious  Therefore, my tendency is to hope in  our discussion that we might find some concurrence in that viewpoint and some consensus that we  [should] learn more before we begin to take too significant an action in either direction  There are  no conditions here for easing money, at all, that I can see  But what I worry about is that we might  begin to tighten too much too soon without knowing enough and regret it later       Now, I would hope that we might run down the list, as I say, and ask for your viewpoints,  specifically on what [alternative] you’d like to see us adopt--A, B, or others  And then if you were  willing, I’d like to suggest that you might last turn your attention to some of the revised wording in  the memo that I sent to you  It’s not a big issue, but if we have time, we might at least look at that  question as to the wording of the directive  So Ernie, your name [begins with a] B, so I guess you  start       Thank you, Ernie  Phil Coldwell       Dave       What would you do?       Thank you  Steve       Thank you, Steve  Philip Jackson       Is that right?       For May and June, what are your growth figures?       For May and June  What would it average for the quarter then?       Thank you  Chuck       Surprise, surprise!       Thank you  Henry       Thank you, Henry  Mark, I think is our next member  Is that right?       Thank you, Mark  Willis       V?     5/16/78              37       Oh, the Chairman and the Vice Chairman will speak last  We want  all your wisdom--all that we can get--first       Be wrong?       Why don’t I quickly get the views of the other Presidents and I’ll  come back to you, Paul  John       Thank you, John  Bob Black       Thank you very much, Bob  Roger       Thank you very much  Bones       Thank you  Bob Mayo       Thank you, Bob  Frank Morris     5/16/78              40       Give some reasons out       Citibank just announced its offering of it already       Yes, but it’s in the M2       Larry       Thank you  Paul       The figures are closer than I would have thought       Well, hearing all that, let me see if I can come up with a proposal to  be voted on  Let me start off with what I think is an easy one looking down the list  Six people--a  majority of 7, if I include myself--say 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 for the range of the fed funds rate  My own  preference would be to operate in a mode from where we are now and seek in due course a 7-1/2  percent rate, with an understanding not to go above that without some consultation  That’s the  trigger point at which the market in my mind would be wondering if we weren’t in a new phase   On the ranges I would think that 3 to 8 and 4 to 9 would suit most everybody, as I look down the  list  There are some who went a little lower, but most seem to prefer 3 or 4 as a starting base and 8  seems to be the majority on the upside  So if I have expressed myself well, it would be 7-1/4 to  7-3/4--moving toward 7-1/2 percent as the objective, but cautiously and not going above it without  some discussion--and 3 to 8 and 4 to 9  Is there--       Well, I would make the midpoint 7-3/8 but expect the Desk to be  moving to 7-1/2       Well, I think I would like to consult with people just to see where  we stand  Maybe we have to go further than that       That has been the procedure for the last few meetings  I’ve been  there  The first meeting was we don’t go above a certain level until we consult and the second  meeting was the same thing  So if I am setting a new procedure, it’s news to me       Well, I would not feel comfortable myself with just turning it loose  to 7-3/4  I just have to be frank; I would be uncomfortable with that         I would have to say that’s my judgment  Let’s take a vote on the  proposal I’ve made  If we don’t have a majority, then we’ll take a vote on another proposal       Yes, that’s right       That’s absolutely right  But I didn’t want it to go above 7-1/2  without some consultation with the group because I think it may have some broader implications-- that’s all  So where are we, Mr Secretary?       Well, whichever you like       All right  How many of the voting members would be willing to  accede to that proposal?       Okay  And how many would not?       Okay  And what differences do you want?       I’m sorry, I don’t understand  What’s different from what I said  then--just the 7-1/2?       How many of you would prefer that?       Well, I think we were voting on the whole package with that  change       Peter       That was my proposal originally--that we edge up to 7-1/2  The  only difference I see is whether or not there’s consultation [before we go] above 7-1/2       5/16/78              46     So where are we split on the votes then?   I’m not sure I understand  Is it on the ranges for M1 and M2?  As I look down the list here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 people suggested--7  actually--no higher than a 7-1/2 for the midpoint  So is that what--       Okay, let’s try it again  Let’s be sure what we are talking about,  though  Do you have any problem with the M1 and M2 ranges?  To repeat, they are 3 to 8 and 4 to  9  The range on fed funds is 7-1/4 to 7-3/4, moving to 7-1/2 in a week to 10 days after looking at  the Thursday numbers  And I must say that I intend to get back to the FOMC, whether we have it  in the understanding or not, if [the situation] requires going over 7-1/2  I just feel that has to  require some discussion       The statistics that would mean that we can’t live within these ranges  without going higher [on the funds rate]  And I want everybody to look at what is happening in the  economy, the revision of the first quarter, and--       Yes       All right, how about that one?  Therein is a question  Suppose we  end up and have a surprise--we have a negative  Suppose money behaves differently [than we  expect] in the next week  What we would do then?  Go to the 7-1/2 regardless?       I don’t think that’s a problem  Why don’t we just [vote]  We’ll  take care of that if necessary  So, is there a vote on this one?  How many would favor what you  think the proposal is?       The funds rate range will be 7-1/4 to 7-3/4, with the plan to move it  up to 7-1/2 in the next week to 10 days after looking at [developments]       Yes, I’m going to do that       That’s what I’m going to do       Okay, how many of the voting members are for this particular one?         Let’s call the roll       Let’s see who’s for this, and nobody will be locked in until we clear  the language       Now may I turn to the language?  If it’s inappropriate to consider  the changes in the directive language at this meeting because of the lateness or anything, we can  defer it  My point in suggesting it is because I find around Washington that people think we are  doing something different than I think we are--in fact the language reads as if we are  I have  something to read--       Let me read you some language  Let me read first the language of  your present directive, which says what you have been saying, “Specifically, at present, it expects  the annual growth rates over the May-June period to be within ranges of” so-and-so to so-and-so  That’s read in the world as meaning that we are forecasting [those rates of growth] and that is  where we intend to be  The actual operation has been that if [the aggregates] move beyond the  midpoints or beyond those ranges, that triggers further action on the funds rate  It is not a  prediction that they will necessarily be within those ranges  And that difference of perception is  causing the Federal Reserve to be read as not knowing what it’s doing  That’s how those on  Capitol Hill read these directives  [They say,] “You guys say you are going to do so-and-so and  you never do it, so obviously you don’t know what you are doing”      Now, regardless of whether it’s a money market or aggregates [directive]--I’m not worried  about the technical part--I only am concerned for the welfare of the Federal Reserve as to whether  it says what it’s going to do and does what it says it’s going to do  So I have some language here,  which Chuck Partee has suggested, which I will throw out to you  I think it is an improvement  It  says, “In the short run, the Committee seeks to foster money market conditions that are consistent  with the longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates cited above, while taking account of more  general financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange markets  During  the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed initially  at keeping the weekly federal funds rate at about the current level”--or in this case I should say  “slightly above the current level”  [The wording continues,] “Subsequently, operations shall be  directed at maintaining the weekly federal funds rate in a range of 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 percent”  Now  here is the new language  “In deciding on his specific objective for the federal funds rate, the     5/16/78              49  Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of  growth in the May-June period of M1 and M2 within the following ranges of tolerance 3 to 8  percent for M1 and 4 to 9 percent for M2”  Personally I would add--because I think Governor  Coldwell has a point--“For this purpose M2 shall be given somewhat greater weight than M1”        The changed language?  You probably all have this before you  If  you don’t, it suggests changing the sentence that [talks about] the specific level [of the funds rate]   It would read In deciding on his specific objective for the federal funds rate, the Manager shall be  guided mainly--this “influenced” is a bad word--by the relationship between the latest estimates of  annual rates of growth in the May-June period of M1 and M2 and the following ranges of  tolerance This [latter part] is a very big improvement in my mind because these have been  perceived by me to be tolerance ranges       That’s what we are really doing, and that’s why I was trying to--       But since you are the author--       Yes, I think you’re right, Frank  I think there has to be another  session to address this issue in depth  We may or may not solve it  But I think an interim step to  play it in a different way can be constructive       Yes       5/16/78              50     Surely, all kinds of [suggestions are welcome] or we can even drop  the whole idea       Let me read that  In view of the recent growth of monetary  aggregates in relation to--       Well, let’s say “in relation to” the longer-run ranges  See, then you  tie in the prior [sentence]  That’s our objective  Then we say in view of the growth in relation to  such longer-run       Yes, Bob       My original proposal was merely to shift wording to explain what  we are doing, rather than change policy  While I tend to like Phil Coldwell’s suggestion, I think I  agree with you that we are getting into substance and it probably shouldn’t be done  But I’m also  willing to leave everything the way it is and let you consider it at the next meeting       Why don’t we take it out?       I hope not  Bob       Roger     5/16/78              53       Mark       Is there a general consensus on that viewpoint?  We have no reason  to rush this  The issue is still with us       No  There’s no reason [to rush]  I think we need to address the  point that we continue to use the word “expects”  I even think we ought to consider taking that out  of the directive if we do nothing else       Let’s look then at [that language]  I gathered from the conversation  that everyone would like a monetary aggregates formulation  Let’s look on page 3, which has the  operating paragraph, which is what we are talking about  “The Committee seeks to encourage  near-term rates of growth in M1 and M2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the  longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph  Specifically, at  present,” it intends to be guided, or what?  “Expects” is really wrong to my mind       The ranges of tolerance, okay  And then “In the judgment of the  Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average federal funds rate     5/16/78              54  slightly above the current level  If, giving approximately equal weight to M1 and M2, it appears  that the growth rates will deviate significantly from the midpoints [of the indicated ranges,]…”    And the word “midpoints” is your problem, [Steve]?       Significantly       All right  [The rest of that sentence reads “…the operational]  objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 7-1/4  to 7-3/4 percent”  Any other changes?       So I think so we can live with this  Any other changes?       Yes  All right, I suspect at this point that we should ask your  blessing on the directive  Is there any dissent from it as we have outlined it?  Oh, Mark  All right     [Next on the agenda is] the Federal agency issues, which I think can be deferred  Our next  meeting is Tuesday, June 20  And we can now adjourn  I thank you for your patience  Your  tolerance, within ranges, has been very good     5/16/78              55       Yes       END OF MEETING      "
772,1978-06-20,"  We do have a busy day and I am going to once again ask your  cooperation in trying to stick to the subject matter and I=ll try to do the same  Before we begin, I  want to call to your attention a letter I received from Chairman Henry Reuss about the possibility  of raising the long-run ranges for the monetary aggregates  I call it to your attention because I=m  sure that when I testify in July he will be anxious to know that you have received this and  considered it  And, of course, our ranges will come up for consideration in July     I would also mention that I have some concern about how we establish the ranges for M1  in July as we look ahead twelve months, realizing that on November 1 the automatic transfer  regulations go into effect and M1 is going to change in some unspecified way  It=s going to be  very difficult to guess how to establish ranges for a measure that=s going to be drifting on a string  in the period  Whether or not it would be wise, possible, desirable, or agreeable to temporarily  suspend the ranges for M1 until we can find out what=s happening, I don=t know  But it=s  something you might think about because otherwise we=re just guessing  We don=t know  whether the change is going to be x or y       Yes  Any thoughts along these lines, if you=d like to share them  with us before the next meeting, would be appreciated because I think it is going to be a tricky  time for the establishment of these ranges      The first order of official business is to approve the minutes of the actions taken at our  FOMC meeting on May 16  I think you=ve had the minutes and, unless there are any corrections  or additions, I will record them as approved  Hearing none, we will assume you=ve done your  usual good job, Mr Secretary, and gotten concurrence  [We move on to] foreign currency  operations and a report on the activities since the last Committee meeting  Scott Pardee       And the attitude is different [depending on] which way you are  going  Would you repeat [the figure] so that we all have it for the total amount of purchases of  marks--Treasury and Federal Reserve--for the period?        Dollars?       Thank you  Any questions, comments?       Well, we don=t know  Compared with what?  You=re just  impressed with the numbers; you=re not impressed with [unintelligible] they=ve done a good job   Henry       Our next action is to ratify the transactions in foreign currency  operations since the previous meeting  Is there any dissent from that action?  Then we will  consider that action approved  [Next is] consideration of the Manager=s recommendations with  respect to foreign currency operations  Alan       Thank you, Alan  You have recommended two actions  One is to  approve the renewals of drawings with July maturities and the second is to reduce the [limit on  the] open position [in paragraph 1D] of the authorization to $15 million  Any questions or  comments?  Any dissent from those actions?  Hearing none, we will approve those two items   Thank you very much, Alan  I do concur that the Desk has been operating quite successfully  during this period      The next item is the matter of revisions to the procedural instructions for foreign currency  operations and this involves a report of our ad hoc subcommittee  Henry, I believe you are the  Chairman of that subcommittee and you circulated a paper  [Do you have] any particular  comments or should we go directly to the revisions that are recommended?       I think you all have Attachment A, a strike-through [version that  shows the] changes that are recommended       Would you please?       Thank you  The action that is being requested is the approval of  the amended procedural instructions, [shown in] Attachment A, and the amended paragraph 1D  of the Foreign Currency Authorization in Attachment B  Are there any questions?  Comments?       Alan, do you have any comments on these proposals for change?       6/20/78                5     Scott, did you have any comment?       You have the other limits so you do know almost where you are   Any other comments?  Is there any dissent from approving these recommendations?  Hearing  none, they are approved  We move from foreign currency to the economic and financial  situation and outlook, and Jim Kichline has a report       How do you handle housing on that?       May I suggest a procedure?  I=d like to have this continue for a  while but I=d like to cut it off at some point and do a round robin, as we did the last time, and get  the comments from everybody, if you don=t mind  So I=ll run through a few more comments here  and then I=d like to [move on]  Last time we went clockwise; this time we=ll go counter-  clockwise  Steve, do you want to make a comment?       Do you need any more answer to that, Bob?       Three more comments; then we=ll do a go-around  Henry  Wallich       Any reaction?       Yes, rather than do the whole thing  I think that=s right       No, you=re the last commenter before the go-around       Thank you all very much  Now we=ll have a go-around and I  hope that each of you will comment on your own views and the views of your staff organization  on the outlook for real GNP, prices, and unemployment  And note any other factors that you  want to mention regarding the 1978 Q2 through 1979 Q2 period  Paul, we=ll start [with you]       6/20/78                13     Any specific numbers, Paul?       Thank you  Phil       That=s the first time I=ve heard “only” $100 billion!       Unlike the Federal Reserve family       Phil, do you have a number on prices?       Over 6 percent?       Thank you  Chuck       A standard 7-1/2?       Chuck, do you have specific numbers for us on our three  [measures]?       Okay  Bob       Thank you, Bob  Willis       Unemployment [unintelligible]?       Thank you very much, Willis  Dave, we haven=t heard from you  yet       Thank you, David  Bones, we haven=t heard from you either   You are quiet down in that corner!       And GNP?       Thank you  Larry       Thank you, Larry  Roger       Thank you, Roger  Bob Mayo       Thank you, Bob  Mark       Now, that is no excuse, Mark  None of the rest of us does either       I thought that was a Federal Reserve action       Thank you, Mark  John       6/20/78                21     Thank you, John  Ernie       On a daily basis       Thank you  Frank       You don=t mean 6 percent  Do you mean 6 percent over the four  quarters?       Okay  I was only making sure we got it right       Yes, I understood that       What would be your unemployment figure?       6/20/78                24     That would be ideal       I=ve always liked a more stable woman myself       Thank you very much  Phil        Did we get your GNP number?       Thank you  Henry       Thank you, Henry  Steve       We=ve heard sixteen!  Fifteen--you and I are left  We=re in trouble       Steve, you put your GNP at what?       Thank you very much  Let me make a couple of observations  One  is that I would think this exercise this morning has proved conclusively that economics is a science  Second, I would ask the Secretary to retain all of these estimates that we=ve been getting since  March And when we come around to next March, we=ll be able to start putting your score cards  together on how well you=ve done on what you have estimated each time  So please sharpen your  estimates for next month and remember you=ll be measured over time--that is if you=re planning to  stay with the Federal Reserve       I=ll tell you  The deal is you get to keep your job if you=re right   Okay?     Let me make a few quick observations  One [relates to] the Redbook  My experience with  business people is that they=re always looking at last month=s performance and they look at it the end  of the following month  They=re always, therefore, slightly out of touch [if they are large]  corporations  Small corporations are in very close touch, but large companies are extremely out of  touch with reality and with day-to-day reality  So I think there=s always the lag effect      6/20/78                28     In terms of where we are and where we can go, it seems to me that we’re at a high level of  activity that will carry us forward at substantial growth rates  I don=t see it [continuing] in the  automotive or durables [sectors] because certainly there=s probably been anticipatory buying  But  like everything else, that will run its course; the credit involvement and the cash flows will begin to  restrain that  So I don=t see a great deal of buoyancy in that area  Housing certainly isn=t the area for  buoyancy because it=s going to be headed down  As far as business fixed investment is concerned,  that doesn=t have time to crank up in this period of time to create a substantial increase in our outlook  for [activity]  When it comes to government spending, I think we see it going somewhat toward less  stimulation  When it comes to other consumer spending, the consumer has spent so much money on  durables and I doubt that the consumer will want to shift quickly into nondurables  We=re looking  for a period of consolidation plus there will be credit restraints  Inventories and business I should  have mentioned in passing  I think we=re going to see businesses very concerned, as they now are  getting their financing from banks, because they=re unwilling to take down long-term money and  they=re going to be cautious about building up more short-term debt to carry inventories at high  levels in the face of their expectations      So I don=t see the conditions for a great deal of ebullience in the period ahead  I do think that  what we do on monetary policy is critical  If we should crunch the economy, we can bring on a  recession  If we use a steady and sure hand to restrain the growth of the aggregates and bring it  down at a more measured pace, then I think we see conditions for bringing the rate of growth down  to a more sustainable level that will counter inflation but avoid the overshoot that would carry us  into a recession  We particularly have to be conscious of that overshoot if the amount of fiscal  restraint is going to be removed toward the end part of this year at the same time some of the impact  of our restraint will be taking hold  My numbers would indicate, therefore, real GNP growth over  this period in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent area--probably nearer the 3-1/2 but in that area  I would think  that inflation is going to take time to abate and that we=ll see 7 to 7-1/2 percent on prices in this  period  If we get the kind of growth rate that I=ve indicated, I think employment is not going to be a  major additional problem and I would see it in the 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 range as a prospect  And with  those comments, I think we should take a 10-minute break     [Coffee break]        Well, ladies and gentlemen, let me call the meeting back [to order]  and remind you that we have a luncheon at one o’clock and a meeting on membership at 215 pm   And I’d remind some of you that we=re meeting tomorrow on delegation  While this morning=s  session has so far been outstanding, particularly in the degree of eloquence with which each of you  has spoken, it has not been outstanding with respect to the degree of time you took to be eloquent   So I would like you now to be both eloquent and brief  The results will be the same, and you=ll be  able to have lunch and have your meeting on important membership issues  The first order of  business, however, is to hear the report on open market operations since the last Committee meeting   Peter Sternlight       Thank you very much, Peter  Any questions?   Bones     6/20/78                29       Any other questions?  We need the approval of the Committee to  ratify transactions since the previous meeting  Hearing no dissent, we will record that as approved  Let’s turn to the comments of our chief economist, Steve Axilrod       Thank you very much, Steve  Are there any questions to Steve?   Yes, Dave       Well, gentlemen we have two major matters of business (1) the  directive and (2) the language  I would suggest that we run through the Committee to get your  suggestions for the directive first and look at the language second  Since I cut our Vice Chairman  short the last time and left him to the end, the least I can do is to put him up front today  Paul, would  you like to lead off?       Thank you, Paul  Why don=t we run down the Committee  alphabetically  Ernie       Phil Coldwell       Thank you  Dave Eastburn       Thank you, Dave  Steve Gardner       6/20/78                31     They=ve got to be right once in a while  Would you prefer the 5 to 10  or the 5 to 9 range, Steve?       Thank you  Phil Jackson       Phil, you could use the money market directive          Either way  Well, we always like flexibility!  Chuck       Thank you, Chuck  Henry       Thank you, Henry  Mark       Thank you very much  Willis       6/20/78                33     Some of us may have stopped earlier than that!       Thank you very much  John Balles       Thank you  Bob Black       Thank you, Bob  Roger       Thank you  Bones       Thank you  Bob Mayo       Thank you, Bob  Frank Morris       Thank you, Frank  Larry       Well, we=ve had a complete rundown except for my comments  Let  me just take these in order  For the range on the fed funds rate, we have one, two, three, four, five,  six, seven of the voting members, not counting myself, who prefer 7-1/2 to 8, which would indicate  the majority  I don=t know whether those who preferred an 8-1/4 [upper limit] would be willing to  accept the 7-1/2 to 8  It appears that the members also have a wide majority in favor of moving to  7-3/4 any time between tomorrow and two weeks, which would indicate Friday or Monday  Now,  we have more trouble with the M1 and M2 ranges  We=ll probably have even more trouble in trying  to decide on the language  But let=s see  Seven of them would be 9 to 11 on the upper side and 4-1/2  to 6-1/2 on the bottom side on M1  I don=t know quite where we come out on this       Yes, I think that looks about right, Phil  Let me, therefore, formulate  [a proposal]  If 5 to 10 is about right [for M1], it looks like it=s almost the same thing for M2; I don=t  really see that much variation  Let me suggest for the ranges, just for a straw poll, 5 to 10, 5 to10,  and 7-1/2 to 8 [on the funds range], moving to 7-3/4 probably by the end of the week       End of this week or early next week  Chuck, what was your view?       I think the market is expecting it, so I don=t think it=s a big problem if  we do it now or early next week       Well, let=s come to the language before we--       Yes, I can understand that       One, two, three, four had a 6 or 6-1/2; I think your point is well  taken  Let me come to the language for a moment and then I=ll come back to those numbers  I  would first like to find if there=s a sentiment--we=ve all had now a month to look at this proposed  language--in favor of this language  My own sentiment obviously is, though I don=t take any pride  of authorship in it because I didn=t write it  It was written by some brilliant leaders at the Federal  Reserve; it=s associated with my interest in trying to accomplish some things with the language  I do  think it is helpful  Also, in the context that we are now operating, on page 2 of the language--if we  use it--my preference would be to let the Desk operate on the language in line 28  I just feel that  under present conditions to let the Desk operate in connection with the ranges would be better than  picking the midpoint  But that=s just a personal preference  Now, is there sentiment to go to this  kind of language?  I heard only one negative comment       Okay, Phil, what would you like?       You want to take out “in the short run”?       To achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are  consistent with the expected growth rate of the aggregates?       I would expect it would be troublesome now       That=s for sure       Suppose we said “reasonably” consistent with the long term or used  some qualifying word  Is that what you=re worried about?       “Expected” gets us into a bit of a problem, I think       That=s right!  We are just not doing it       You want to say “hopes to achieve”?       “Consistent with moving toward”?       I think the only instruction to the Desk starts in line 15  The other is  an expression of what the Committee thinks it=s trying to do and [then it] instructs the Desk  The  Desk can operate [unintelligible] telling them about the ranges       I agree with that, but I haven=t been able to do that yet       I think you complicate it, Larry, because your instruction goes on to  say that you look at these in deciding whether to move [the funds rate] within [its range]  You can=t  go back and look at both  Let me do this with those who are voting members  Just by a show of  hands temporarily indicate--I=m not freezing this language and I=m not skipping Phil=s point--who is  willing to see if we can make this language of the current proposal, Attachment A, acceptable?  I  gathered there was [favorable] sentiment; I=d like to see it  Okay, I think we=re all in agreement  So  now, is this such a serious [problem]?  We=ve been doing it so long       Forever  Is this the time to [change it]?       This is the same kind of language we=ve been using all along, isn=t it?   I agree with you that we haven=t been meeting it  I=ve always read into it that longer run means  beyond a year even       Well, we ought to raise the range of M1--that=s the truth--or get rid of  it  We have given our staff an impossible task to fit economic reality in ranges that are inconsistent  with it  That=s what we have been doing       We ought to change them to be realistic, but we can’t even do that  right now  We don=t even consider it until next month unless--       All right  Does that offend anybody?       We bought broadly  Anybody else?       What would you like?       Do you want to take the word “weekly” out and leave “average” in?       Steve?       When you say “initially” keeping the average funds rate you can=t  mean [the average over] three months  What do you want to do?  Leave “weekly” in or take it out?  How many want to leave it in?   [Pause]  How many want to take it out?   The “ins” have it      On page 2 we have to jot in some figures later  And if we decide on lines 27 and 28, we=ll  know how you all feel  My preference is line 28  How many prefer line 28?   One, two, three, four,  five  How many prefer 27?  One, two, three, four   There are some non-voters         This says “giving approximately equal weight to M1 and M2 if their  rates of growth appear to be”--and you have a choice--“significantly above” or “significantly below”  their midpoints  That=s one choice  The second choice is “close to or beyond” the upper or lower  limits  Normally, I would prefer 27 but in the touchy situation we=re in at this time--with July being  such a seasonally unpredictable month--I thought the Desk would be better served to give them the  right to operate within our chosen range if they were allowed to go close to the upper or lower limits   If we get to the lower limits, we certainly don=t want to cut the rate; if we get to the upper limits we  certainly are all going to be able to express our views but we wouldn=t be compelled to make a  [move]       Sure  Last month I would have preferred line 27; this month I prefer  line 28 because I think we are going to have a very tough time operating--       No, that=s the point  That=s why I wanted to get this settled first and  then you=ll decide on--     6/20/78                42       I will still put the question to you  Line 27 now is operating off the  midpoint  How many prefer that?  One, two--no, we have to have voting members only  One, two,  three, four, five  How many prefer line 28?  One, two, three, four, five  Who=s missing?      SPEAKER(?)  One of the Board members     SPEAKER(?)  That only makes 11       I=ll call the roll  That=s easier  Just say 27 or 28    Ernie Baughman   27     Phil Coldwell     27     Dave Eastburn    27     Steve Gardner    28     Phil Jackson     28     Bill Miller      28     Chuck Partee     28     Paul Volcker     28     Henry Wallich     27     Mark Willes     27     Willis Winn    27     All right, 27 won, so 27 we=re going to use  That=s simple  It=s a very democratic process   Now, we can, therefore, go back--it makes the ranges a little more difficult  The ranges we had  talked about a moment ago were 5 to 10 and I think it might--pardon me?   Does that mean more  leeway would be desired by anyone who has expressed ranges before?   Is it 5 to 10?       All right  How many would prefer 5 to 11?  Let=s just take a straw  vote on that  Four of us  How many would prefer 5 to 10?  One, two, three, four  And how many  would prefer something else?     6/20/78                43       We=ll go back and ask  How many now want 5 to 10?  That takes  care of that  All right we=ve got 5 to 10        Now on M2, what is your pleasure?  How about 6 to 11?  All right,  let=s say 6 to 10  How many will accept that?  It looks like a clear majority  We, therefore, need a  final vote, Mr Secretary       As I read the consensus, it was the 7-1/2 to 8 percent range, moving  to 7-3/4 by the end of the week and thereafter operating on the directive  If we have strong  aggregates, we go to 8  We=re going to put [that] in the language  The language would read “During  the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed initially at  attaining a weekly-average federal funds rate slightly above the current level  Subsequently,  operations shall be directed at maintaining…within a range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent”  On page 2, we  use 5 to 10 and 6 to 10 and we use line 27  That’s the sum of what we got individual votes on   Now, may we call the roll for a final vote on that version?       It would read 2 percent instead of 1-1/2  Now call the roll on the  directive as outlined       We have a vote  Thank you all very much  Now we need to  consider in the next seven minutes the memorandum that Steve Axilrod and Peter Sternlight have  been putting together as their great debate  It may go on forever since we never seem to get to it  I  don=t think we=re going to sell any agencies if we never get to this subject       Is it so urgent that we can=t put it over [to the next meeting]?       Well, you all have had this before you for a couple of meetings   What is your pleasure?       Gentlemen?       Phil is saying that on rollovers don=t roll them over, thereby reducing  the portfolio       Reduce your buying and therefore cut back some     6/20/78                45       You didn=t ask us if you could do all that       Why don=t you fellows work it out?     SPEAKER(?)  Yes       Gentlemen, would there be a show of hands of those who would like  to see us affirmatively selling out issues of agencies at this point?       We=re talking now; if we instruct the Desk to do this, it will be  [effective] now  How many would prefer to not have that happen?       No, we would authorize the Desk to carry out the objective you had  in mind in your recommendation, giving due consideration to the market conditions, and to  demonstrate that there is another side of agency holdings  The timing is to be selected with great  care and judgment and prudently       Apparently there was a majority of the Committee unless I misread  it Who=d be willing to give Steve and Peter that [authority] now?       Well, they are able to do that now             Would you like to vote again?  I got a pretty strong sentiment that we  would authorize you to go ahead, recognizing the cautions and constraints       Exactly  The next item of business is to confirm the [date of the]  next meeting, which is Tuesday, July 18  And the next item of business is an executive session for  five minutes                                [Executive Session]       Gentlemen, we are going to have John Denkler here in a moment, but  you have seen the memo and we have a serious problem  Microwave communications can be  intercepted  There is a general feeling that they are being intercepted and on a number of our actions  where there are market consequences, [the information obtained] could be or might be used for gain  either for international reasons or for reasons of organized crime and that sort of  thing [Secretary’s  note  Messrs Denkler and Wallace came in to the meeting at this point]  You all know John  Denkler, I think, and Bill Wallace I think you also know  I=ve just begun to state the problem, John   Why don=t you pick right up?       Gentlemen, this presents a couple of problems for us  We were very  reluctant to spend approximately $500,000 for an inter-connect, which is the cost of equipment that  would allow us to link up the twelve Reserve Banks and Washington, in an area where probably  technology in a few years will make it more likely to be accomplished in some less expensive way  and where the benefit of it is in connection with FOMC telephonic conferences  On our daily calls,  we greatly value the monitoring of the [Reserve Bank] President [on the call] and yet that is the  vulnerable link because the calls are made on a daily basis at a given time, which makes an intercept  [more likely] and use of the information particularly vulnerable      An alternative to following John=s recommendation would be for the call to be made with  perhaps a Governor rotating on the call rather than a President just to have another member of the  FOMC on a secure line  And the information passed to the President could be on market conditions  without stating any of the dealer positions or program for the day  Of course, as you know, they  would then get that within an hour or two of the program and the monitoring could be a little more  after the fact, which I don=t think would be a great impairment to the [process]  You’d have a chance  then to still exercise surveillance in terms of the general trend of the Desk’s operations and to raise a  problem, if one exists, the next day  Certainly we’d get the input  It seems to me that that=s a more  reasonable course at this stage than to spend $1 million and a more reasonable course also in [terms  of] time because to get the whole System network together will take 18 months or so, I gather  I  think it will take a very much shorter time to do just the Washington-New York link      The FOMC, I think, is going to be a very serious problem if we have to have a [telephonic]  session  We are going to have to be extremely cautious in having voice conference calls in the  future  It may mean that we will use other lines of communication that are more secure  We would  include, however, a land line system in your proposal, John, as I understand it  And because the  FOMC conference calls would be irregular, it probably would not be worthwhile to tap the land  lines, so we probably could risk taking those calls on the land lines  But because the daily call is at a  particular time, there I think tapping would be too much of a risk       Rome Air Force Base developed this for the military and it=s only in  prototype  One of the risks here is that we’d be one of the first buyers, although the test that John  has conducted--     6/20/78                49       What will happen in the next few years is that micro processors will  develop and digital techniques will develop and you will be able to get very high quality signals at  much lower cost, I think       Alan       That is in New York and Washington--at each terminal       Now, we need to discipline ourselves on all of our telephone calls  I  am guilty of talking about sensitive matters on the phone with any of you or anybody else just  because this has never been brought to my attention as a serious risk  But apparently, without saying  more, we feel that it is a current risk and may be being used against us in ways that would be to our  disadvantage  So I think that we should move rather promptly       Well, once you use the scrambler--       The wire?  The current state of the market is known  If we don’t give  out dealer positions, which are not known, and the program to be executed and inform you of that  after its execution has started--  When do you send out the wire?  You do that within a couple of  hours, don=t you?       Are you asking if that information is secure?     6/20/78                50       What is the answer to that?       That it=s after the fact is the main security  In fact, we may have to  make sure we hold those wires until an hour after the fact or something so that we don=t get  [unintelligible]  Now, the problem is a very clear-cut one  Would the Presidents be willing to do  their surveillance on the basis of [knowing the program] a few hours after the fact and reining in the  Desk prospectively, rather than on each day?  There’d be a 1-day lag in your ability to respond  I  don=t think that=s a big risk; the way the Desk operates, it’s a very responsible operation as far as I  am concerned         Without myself participating, I would recommend that one of the  Governors here rotate [as a participant on the call] to keep a second monitor under those conditions  so that there is somebody from the Committee who is alerted at all times  Yes?       We need to upgrade our security all around and I think we need some  instruction  As I say, I have been guilty of picking up the phone to someone in Washington and they  ask me a question and I give them the answer  It will be terribly inconvenient, but in many cases I  think we are going to have to wait [to discuss some issues] until we get together face to face And, of  course, you have to be careful  I don=t think that Washington=s a big risk, but in foreign countries the  ability to pick up your conversation at a distance is tremendous  So any of you traveling abroad if  you are walking in a park talking secretly and think you’re secure, you=re not       No, I asked that question  Would this be a problem?       [The President on the call] raises questions and usually it is after the  fact  That=s why I didn=t think a shift of procedure would be that objectionable  But I didn=t want to  [do] it without a full Committee discussion to get your sense of what you would like to see us do     6/20/78                51       Does anybody disagree with that?  Are you agreeable for us to  proceed with this program and let John implement it as soon as we can?  We=ll post you on  procedures as soon as we can get organized       Yes       Yes, that=s what we want to do  When we get the land lines, we want  to use them for the facsimile       Faster, cheaper, and more secure--and that would help       Yes, I think the leased lines would allow us to organize a conference  call much more quickly; we can patch it up on our own board       We can use it on off time, too  We will use it for our own calls       We will lease it and we will have it just for ourselves       And if Bill=s plan works out, we will end up paying for that [to a  large extent] with the reduced cost in the transmission of documents  So with your blessing, we will  proceed accordingly  Now we will all have lunch  We=ll see you upstairs as soon as we can     6/20/78                52                                                           END OF MEETING      "
798,1978-07-18,"  Realized [or] unrealized?       Thank you, Scott  I heard a report this morning--maybe I  misunderstood it--that there was a sudden drop in the dollar in the Far East  Is that [true]?       Thank you very much  Any questions?   Henry       We need an action to ratify the transactions since the previous  meeting  Is there any dissent from that action?  Then we will consider that approved  [Next we  have] a recommendation of the Manager with respect to foreign currency operations, Scott?       Any questions?  May I consider that recommendation approved?  Hearing no dissent, it is so approved  Now, while Henry was in Basle, I understand that the  Japanese asked the question about activating our swap line  You might mention that to the  Committee, Henry        Unless there’s a groundswell of desire to [acquire] yen and  intervene, I think we’ll respond saying that we do not believe conditions are appropriate for this  If there’s a groundswell, those of you who want to [do this can] testify before Congress and explain  why we did it           Well, you either should do it enough to be effective [or not do it]  If  you do it in a small amount, the static we’ll get from it will be more abuse than we--       Well, Paul’s point, I think, is that time may [bring a] change  On  the point Henry and I made  In formulating a response, we don’t want to make this a “forever close  the door” response; it’s just in today’s conditions  Who knows what will happen in the future?       All right, let’s move along then to the economic and financial outlook  We are going to have  a staff presentation led off by Jim Kichline     MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN  [Statements--see Appendix]       I would suggest as a procedure that we take a few minutes for any  questions of Jim, Jerry, Ted, or others  Then after that I’d like to do once again a go-around and  get the inputs from each of you on your [estimates] for GNP  Chuck       John Balles       You’re not too convinced but you hear it  Ernie       Thank you  Larry        Is that a recommendation, Jim, that we cut those things out?       Frank Morris had a question  Did he leave?  Well then, we’ll go to  Bob Mayo       Yours has been answered  All right then, we’ll go to Philip  Jackson       Frank, we missed you for a moment, and we’re going to pick you up  now       Gentlemen, I have four names left on the list  I suggest I run  through them and then perhaps we will do a go-around, in which case any other comments or  questions will be brought up  Bones, do you have a question?       Roger         There is a change in the withholding immediately, isn’t there?       Henry       Phil Coldwell       Gentlemen, we have quite an interesting process  We have the  Redbook  We have the Greenbook and the Bluebook and we have the presentations and your  questions  Then we finally come around to the recent procedure of asking you for your individual  judgments of what you see in terms of three critical elements in the next four quarters  Why don’t  you pick up your pencils for a moment and let me remind you to jot down the figures that would be  the staff figures  We will be asking you to give your own reactions  So, first is the real growth of  GNP from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979; the staff projection is 37  percent  The next is the gross business product fixed-weighted price index over the same period of  time--our measure of inflation, if you will  And there we have a staff figure of 73 percent  The  third figure is the rate of unemployment in the second quarter of 1979--that is, at the end of the  four-quarter period  There the staff is looking at 57 percent, which happens to be the same figure  as in June  So, those are the figures  Last time I went around [the table] counterclockwise, so what  about going clockwise this time and starting with Henry       Thank you, Henry  Phil       7/18/78              11     Any particular comments?       Thank you  Frank       Thank you, Frank  Ernie       Thank you very much  John       You’ve been being proved right from meeting to meeting       John, perhaps at the break you can get how it works out on these  quarter-to-quarter figures consistent with the others, because I think you have to do a little  calculating there       Well, if it is possible       Thank you very much  Mark       Thank you very much  Bob       Thank you, Bob  Roger       You’ve got one more quarter on it now, though       Thank you very much  Larry       Thank you very much  Bones       Thank you  Dave       Thank you  Willis       Thank you, Willis  Bob       We will give you the range  Chuck       It is 3 to 3-1/2, which now includes 37?       Thank you, Chuck  Philip       Thank you  Paul       Thank you, Paul  I am just looking quickly at the means [of these  figures] for members only  Art has given me some figures showing that [compared to] the staff’s  real GNP growth of 37 percent, for members the consensus comes out at 37  Is that what you’re  saying?       There are two above and three below       And five below  Now I’m getting it  Why don’t you tell us what it  is?  Turn your microphone around and give us the straight dope       Sure  We are averaging all kinds of things       Can you count this one up?  There is an interesting thing because  the range on the real GNP from the lowest figure cited to the highest is 1-1/2 to 4 and prices go  from 6 to 8-1/2 and for unemployment it’s 5-3/4 to 6-1/2 percent  There is not much I can add  I  think the conversation has been very helpful  We have seen a lot of common viewpoints and some  variations of the theme  I would say that the most discouraging thing about inflation is the number  of things that are going to be happening over which we have no control but they feed inflation  The  staff did some studies for my testimony last week at the House Budget Committee and the  calculation Jim came up with is that the minimum wage increase on January l will add almost 1/2  percentage point to inflation next year  And the increase in the social security tax on January l will  add 04 percentage point  So you’re talking about almost a percentage point  In fact, some other  extraneous factors there added it up to about 1 percentage point on inflation just from those factors   Naturally, I have proposed--       The 03 [from] oil, I am more sympathetic  We are going to have to  do something to constrain that; we may have to absorb that  The others we have within our power   As I said, I recommended in my testimony that we defer the minimum wage for two years and  nobody screamed, but nobody rushed in with a bill   So, if any of you would like to introduce the  bill I am sure it would be welcome  Reserving the right to change my mind, in preparing my  testimony for next week, Steve, I would think that we are talking in this period about 3-1/2 percent  growth  We are going to have to average the four quarters  On prices, I’d say 7-1/2 probably and  on unemployment 5-3/4 to 6  That would be my guess, and I am not far off from what everybody  else had  That is how I see the situation     The most important announcement that I have is that coffee is ready and I suggest we take a  break for a few minutes and come back and see if we can struggle with setting some long-term  ranges          [Coffee break]     SPEAKER(?)  Inflation has taken over the food industry, Mr Chairman  It is obvious that  the donuts are smaller!       We now face the task of our quarterly fixing of long-run ranges  At  the last meeting I suggested a couple of things for you to be thinking about and I called your  attention to a letter I received from Chairman Reuss asking us to give consideration to raising the  upper limit of the M1 growth ranges  I also called your attention to the probability that over the  next twelve months, the next four quarters, M1 would get a little murky with the automatic transfer  going into effect for M1 on November l  I asked you to think about whether anything should be  [done] there  We have had some comments, but let us start off first by having some introductory  observations by Steve and then we will open it up for your views on that       Steve, I think you have talked yourself into something  Now let us  see if you have talked the Committee into something  Phil you had a question       All right then, a comment       Thank you  We have quite a few hands up, so let’s go on and get  other reactions  Frank       I assume everyone got a copy of your memo       Frank, on your proposal, what would your proposed ranges be?       6-1/2 to 9   You would announce that as a primary range  And  what would you have in the memo items as the ranges for the other aggregates?       Which one?       So are you going with the 4 to 7-1/2 that Phil mentioned or the 4 to  7 or what?       You might leave it as a memo item at 4 to 6-1/2       How about M3--the same?       Okay  Very interesting proposal  Henry       7/18/78              25     Gentlemen, I am pleased to say that three speakers have consumed  25 minutes, so I would like to set lunch for 300 pm  Or can we get away from the speechmaking  and get down to the nitty-gritty?  I appreciate the comments; they are very good  But we will be  here all day if we do that, so you have your choice  I think you’ve got to tell us what you think and  leave out all the rest of it if you don’t mind  Dave Eastburn       Thank you, Dave  Chuck       Mark Willes       John Balles       Thank you, John  Bob Mayo       Thank you, Bob  Paul Volcker       I think so  I think it’s one thing we must discuss at the end of this       I think that’s the point that Steve made--that if you don’t do enough  and then you fail to meet it, you have a double loss       7/18/78              29     Many rationales will lead to the same [conclusion]  Bob Black       Thank you, Bob  Ernie       Thank you very much  Roger       Now we need to hear from Philip Jackson       Phil, excuse me  Roger, I assume the others are the same then?       Larry       Bones       Thank you very much  Willis, you have been very unusually quiet   Wouldn’t you like to be heard from?       Not that quiet  We want to hear from you       Well, thank you  I think we have heard from everyone on this  subject  You will be impressed to know that of the voting members, not counting myself who has  not yet indicated [any view on this], only three would change M1 by raising the upper limit  And  there is one non-voting member who would do the same  So, unless there are changes of opinion,  it looks as if there is a fairly overwhelming majority to maintain the present ranges for M1  regardless of what I would say  I don’t know whether you would like to stop there and give a  reaction; M2 is a little more complicated  I think there was only one suggestion of a change on M2  and only one suggestion of a change on M3  I will come back to bank credit  What is your  pleasure?  It seems to me that the--       May I just make one comment?  I think what we have seen happen  is that we have gone from something like 4-1/2 to 5 percent real growth with 6 to 6-1/2 percent  inflation to something like a 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate of [GNP] increase with 7-1/2 to 8 percent  inflation, coming out with the same nominal activity  That has put us in a very strong dilemma  because the only area we can really operate on is to squeeze down that real growth because the  inflation lags and we have built in with the legislation [a substantial amount of inflation]  We’ve  got that very serious problem       Yes, Phil       I don’t know, because actually the threat that we would squeeze  more is more of a threat than what we would give up  I [think] Congress has reacted more from a  fear that we would tighten       I am saying that while I am concerned about all of this, I think we’d  be more likely to persuade them to do something legislative if they felt the other choice was tight  monetary policy  I don’t know       Yes, Lawrence       You all have heard the discussion  It has been very thorough and  interesting  Are there any candidates to switch votes?  If not, there is a majority, I am afraid  We  just have to vote; that is all       I can live with anything  I have to learn to do that because, when  you vote, there is not much else I could do  What are my other choices?  It is a very sneaky way to  ask for my resignation!       I think my preference would have been to make some upward  adjustment in the top of the M1 range--how far I had not decided--because I think we have a better     7/18/78              35  chance of restoring credibility  Even if we went to 7, we would have a chance at least to come  nearer to our goal  With 7-1/2, I admit that you begin to raise serious problems with the  international area and, in fact, you raise [problems] with other forces  But I have a hard time seeing  us getting into the 4 to 6-1/2 percent range  No matter what we do with interest rates, I think we  probably are going to live with overshooting, but we have been doing that for quite a while  The  Committee may later decide to bring about a control of M1 to get it in the range  If so, I think we  will trigger a recession, and that would concern me too       I think that would be perceived [in a way] that might [work] against  us  Look, we can live with whatever you vote because we are going to be back [reviewing these  long-run ranges again] in three months  We also are going to have a lot of other hot issues around  town  To a degree, there will be a divergent interest in this while we do membership and a few  other things       Will you call the roll, Mr Broida?   Look, I think we need to do  this We need to focus on M1 because it does not look like there is any sentiment that would get a  consensus for changing [to] M2 or M3  Let me call your attention to the recommendation in  alternative B that the bank credit range be increased by l percentage point on each end  Only a  couple of you mentioned that specifically  Are all of you accepting of that associated bank credit  range?  Are there any implications of that higher range that disturb you?       Let’s vote on that separately  Let us first take M1       Doing it without operating through a branch?  I don’t think it would  be picked up, would it Ed?  If it is a direct loan from a British bank to a US company, it will not  be picked up      For M1, let us just say maintain or revise upward  We know what we mean       I will switch my vote and go along with the majority  Does  anybody else want to be associated with this?       You are going to maintain your negative       Okay, we have two dissents  All right, thank you very much  Now,  on bank credit, do we take the current range or the alternative B range?  I am willing to go with the  range in alternative B       To be consistent with the other vote, you have to go for “B”       All right, go ahead       Anybody else?  All right no dissents on that  Thank you very much,  I think      One word  We do need to do some work  We have Larry’s suggestion and we have Frank’s  suggestion and we did not have time, obviously, to [give them much] attention  We know we need  to redefine the aggregates  I think the staff had a proposal on that when I first arrived here, which I  thought was a very excellent proposal, but the Governors were not interested at the time  Now I  find they are       I’m kidding you  I am just teasing  There were other pressures at  the time  I think what we need to do, Steve, is to see how we should organize a method to come  back to this Committee with a series of options or possibilities, perhaps through a discussion phase  and then a perfecting phase  With all these choices--pluses and minuses or pros and cons for this  way or that way--let’s get some direction before we do too much detailed work       Why don’t we get Steve to round up the right kinds of specialists to  help us look at the pros and cons of various options?       7/18/78              38     No, we don’t need that  I think it is more [unintelligible] to go  through the exercise  All right now, I think we still have a question from our Secretary       That is right  All right, let’s see if we can catch up  We are now at  the point where Steve, the Committee’s economist, is supposed to have some comments on  prospective financial relationships  He did not have any, did he?       Have we heard from Peter Sternlight yet?       Now we will have the report of open market operations since the  [previous] meeting from Peter       Thank you very much, Peter  We need a vote to ratify the  transactions since the previous meeting  Hearing no dissent, we can consider that approved  Steve,  do you have any further comments?       Considering the thorough discussion we have had on the economy  and on the monetary situation, I suggest that I call the names alphabetically, first of the voting  member and then of the nonvoting members  I would suggest, if you wouldn’t mind, that you first  give us a quick rundown--you can refer to page l2 of the Bluebook--on your suggested short-term  ranges for M1, M2, the federal funds range, and what you consider [appropriate to do] quickly   Let’s see whether we have any wide variances of opinion  If everybody seems to be coming out  together, I think we can shorten the discussion  If we have wide variance of opinion, let’s come  back and air [our differences]  Ernie Baughman       Phil Coldwell       I thought it was deliberately       Thank you  Dave       Thank you, Dave  Phil Jackson       Chuck       Thank you, Chuck  Paul       7/18/78              40     An 8 percent midpoint?       Henry       Thank you, Henry  Willis?  No, I’m sorry, Mark is next  I am not  very alphabetical today  I didn’t mean to leave you out, Mark       Thank you  We will now come to Willis       Thank you  John Balles       Thank you very much, John  Bob Black       Thank you  Roger Guffey       Thank you, Roger  Bones       Bob Mayo       Thank you  Frank Morris       I will now say last but I will not say least, that’s for sure  Larry       I thought so  I’m beginning to learn  Well, let me take a quick look  at this  Let me suggest to you a couple of thoughts that I have  One is that I believe--and I have  said this publicly--that we are in a period of difficult decisionmaking  It has been easy over the last  year to raise the federal funds rate 300 basis points or whatever has been done from the low point  of last year  Is that right?       It has been easy to see all of that in a period when the economy was  growing rapidly in real terms and there was considerable slack  Now we have had restraint on for  some time  I guess my concern here is that continued restraint, while logical in economic terms, is  likely to trigger a recession at this time  And if [we have a recession], I think the stimulating  effects of fiscal policy that will [occur as a result] will take away our restraint and we will have  accomplished nothing except to leave the Federal Reserve probably in a less effective position to  deal [with the situation]  That is why I think this is a very difficult period  If we do what the  textbook would tell us to do, we may start a chain of events that will work against us  If we fail to  do it, we may regret it, so it is a [difficult decision]  We get paid here for making tough judgments  On balance, I would prefer alternative A or B except that I believe I would narrow the federal funds  range to 7-3/4 to 8 percent      And I liked a suggestion that was given to me for the wording of the directive  The directive  would say that if the M1 and M2 rates of growth appeared to be significantly above their     7/18/78              43  midpoints, we would go up [on the funds rate] but we couldn’t go down without a meeting, in  effect  So we’d keep it at 7-3/4 and there’s no likelihood of it moving lower but we have prospects,  as we see the aggregates, of it moving on up to 8 percent  I think that would be my preference  I  don’t like the situation that has been developing where each day after an FOMC meeting the  market takes over and decides that we have raised the rate 1/4 and puts it into effect and then tells  us  I think we need a little more chance to regain some flexibility; so that would be my preference   I don’t know what the census comes out to  In terms of the midpoint, among the voting members  we have four at 7-3/4, two at 7-7/8, and with a couple of questions, four at 8  Is that right?     SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]       Well, let’s ask the question  Mark, did you want to go to 8 percent  immediately?       And Willis, did you want to go to 8 immediately?       So then it really is more like three 8s and the others around 7-3/4  and 7-7/8  I don’t know whether or not we have the makings of something where we are all  agreeable or not  I don’t know if you like my suggestion of a very tight range and we don’t go  down in that range but could, and probably will, go up to 8 before the next meeting       I have no objection, personally       I will tell you what Peter will tell you  He will have a hard time  maintaining 7-7/8 because this is a very, very fine line, isn’t it, Peter?       Henry Wallich has a novel idea  He said “tell them,” just like we  have said we’ve always wanted to do  If Congress would let us, we’d issue the directive this  afternoon!     SPEAKER(?)  Who’s on first?       Well, let’s listen to Peter for a moment  You are going to have a  hard time maintaining [an increase of] 1/8       I think we all ought to be aware of that       Can you operate between 7-3/4 and 8?       Steve, do you have any thoughts?  You usually have some good  thoughts       What is the Treasury situation this week?       What is the proper thing to do if we expect to get to 8 percent?       Could that be bought by a majority of the Committee?       I don’t think there is anything wrong with that  One, two, three,  Paul?       Does 4 to 8 work on that instruction, Steve?       That is all you do       That’s why I’m not sure if we shouldn’t go ahead and have the  ranges a little wider, because--       Yes, 5 to 9 and 7 to 11 because you’re just making a decision to  operate at 7-3/4 to 8 and you’re really going to be operating at 8 percent at the next meeting       [If growth is] more than that, we certainly ought to [bring] the  Committee back in consultation       What was that, please?       Yes       Let’s see if we can make this wording [acceptable to] get a majority  vote here  Let’s look on page 3 at the operating paragraph  The first problem is line 57, [or] page  2, line 43  Steve, on the formulation we are talking about, what does that line read?       All right, it’s “initially at…about the current level”  Then  “Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining…7-3/4 to 8 percent…In deciding on the  specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship  between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the July-August period of M1 and M2 and  the following ranges of tolerance…”  Now, 4 to 8 and 6 to l0 have been suggested and I want to  ask again, does that create a problem?     7/18/78              48       All right then as we go on we will say “If, giving approximately  equal weight to M1 and M2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or  lower limits…”  We will use the money market emphasis  That is a suggestion and proposal  Are  we all clear on that?  Use 7-3/4 to 8 on line 45, 4 to 8 on line 50, and 6 to l0 on line 54       Yes, the understanding is that the current level is above 7-3/4 but  not yet at 8       I like that a little bit       I think that would be perfectly acceptable  Are you with us on that?   [Instead of] directed “initially at maintaining” just say “at maintaining” the weekly average within  the range, right?  Gentlemen, can I have a show of hands of those on the Committee who are voting  if that would be acceptable?   Yes, a straw vote       Now it says “During the period until the next regular meeting,  System open market operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds  rate within the range of 7-3/4 to 8 percent  In deciding on the specific objective for the federal  funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of  annual rates of growth in the July-August period of M1 and M2 and the following ranges of  tolerance 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 10 percent for M2  If, giving approximately equal weight  to M1 and M2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the  indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate should be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion  within its range” And then we have the regular paragraph about consultations if we are getting out  of whack  It doesn’t give the Desk much leeway     7/18/78              49     SPEAKER(?)  It sure doesn’t       Peter can set the dial and go on vacation       Do you have any final comment before we nail you up on this one?       Yes, I want it to be workable because we really shouldn’t push  something on you that is foolish       [The market will] probably take it away from us  That is probably  what will happen  There’s nothing wrong with that  Now may we have a show of hands--a straw  poll--of those who are voting members?  We should be able to count ten, I think       Those who don’t like it?       Now shall we do an official vote?  I’ll vote for it       Gentlemen, we have a vote of 7 to 3  Thank you all very much for  your patience  Now we have the matter of item 7; [you received] a memorandum  Tom O’Connell  is here to explain it but I think it is self explanatory  And I think we would be wise to leave our     7/18/78              50  language in force on the assumption that the Congress will act promptly  If it doesn’t, we will have  to [act]  In the meantime, we can’t implement it and we know that  Is that all right with everyone?   Then I would like to confirm the date of the next meeting as Tuesday, August 15      Now I would like to do something that I rarely do at these meetings  I would like to stand up  and I would like to say before we have our Executive Session that this is the last meeting at which  Art will be present as Secretary  He has been with the government for 37 years and decided he  doesn’t like it, so he is getting out!  He has been with the Board for over 30 years  I have known  him only for the short time that I’ve been here and I have found him to be what you have known  him to be--extremely able and a great colleague  He has made my life so pleasant by keeping me in  bounds here--running this meeting through me and telling me when to tell you off for speaking too  long and that sort of thing, which has made it all workable  It has been a great experience  I am  really going to miss you, Art      If you all don’t know this, he has decided to finally take a permanent job  So he will be going  to work for the American Enterprise Institute with a fellow you may know, Arthur Burns  They are  going to be looking over our shoulder and telling us what we are doing that is wrong  When they  look at the last eight years, they will have to explain that to themselves  Art, I just want to wish  you all the best on behalf of the Committee and everyone here as well as all the associates from the  System  We do wish you well and I will miss you  We hope to see you around now and then     And now I think we need a short Executive Session before we adjourn for a 130 lunch     SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, may I have just two minutes?  I would like to bring to the  attention of this group the fact that the financial problems of our city are not all the theatrical  exhibitions of our current mayor  We do have a very critical problem in the area, unlike New York  City, which managed to get rid of most of the short-term debts and got them over into long-term  [borrowings]  We had about $41 million in short-term debts at the moment the market foreclosed   They have been dipping into the funds and there is a deficit in the various [sinking] fund accounts  for the cemetery and the waterworks, and all of the other sorts of setups  There is a current deficit  of around $2 to $22 million a month in terms of the general funds account and the city has  outstanding debts against the electric illuminating company [unintelligible] and total about $3  million  [There are] debts against the gas company, [which] has not collected, and the telephone  company; all of their accounts have continued to run  The banks are not heavily exposed in terms  of any single one in this area but I think it’s really going to call public attention to the fact that in  the first place most of the government accounts are not audited and second that there has been a  great deal of transfer from one fund to another--the [unintelligible] concept in terms of the  management of city financing departments  I think this is going to come to a head with some very  hard choices for communities  We have in addition a school system that is also bankrupt or  virtually close to it because under the integration order they can’t get any tax increases passed   They have already tried two or three times now  Both of these factors are going to come to [a head]  this fall irrespective of what happens in terms of--       It is a tragedy isn’t it, to see that happen?  Thank you for your  report  We will now go into Executive Session       7/18/78              51   Is John here now?  Gentlemen, last meeting we had a discussion, as you know, of the security  situation  I know that it was a new subject and that not everyone felt there was adequate time to  deal with the issue  We are back here today, by popular request, to allow for further thoughts and  expressions  Those who have access to information about security feel there is a real danger  I  think we have pretty good information that there has been an interception and a pretty good sense  that there may be abusive use of that information for financial advantage  We can’t prove that,  probably, and we all want to work toward a secure voice communication system, which will allow  us to maintain the present [practices], but we have cost and time inhibitions   The question was  whether we could have an interim procedure for a period of time  We are looking first toward  immediately getting a completely secure line between the Board and the New York Federal  Reserve Bank  And ultimately we’re looking toward technological development that would allow  a completely secure line to all the Reserve Banks or if not, whether we couldn’t have an interim  procedure at some point with the leased lines and a certain reduction of risk     John would you just add anything you want to add?  Let’s see how people feel about it  The  procedure had been suggested that certain sensitive information--the [Desk’s] program, for  example--be omitted from the morning calls or that the President be omitted from the calls and that  a Governor here on a secure line might monitor the situation during the interim until we get a  secure system for the entire network  We weren’t authorizing spending $850 million at the  moment; we were authorizing the first step to get a secure line from Washington to New York       The unsecured line can’t hear the secure lines, so you have to go to  an unsecured line to deal with the whole thing  That is the problem  You would have to go  unsecured from New York to Washington, which is very vulnerable to being tapped, because it is  well known [that communications between the two occur]  And the cable can be tapped at so many  points that it is extremely vulnerable       7/18/78              52     A land line is vulnerable to being tapped       Well, I am from Missouri on spending $800,000 because the only  things you’d use the line for are unsecured other uses  You wouldn’t use it for other secure uses   So you can get the leased lines and [save] money on it       Well, that is so rare       Sure       Extremely  The thing is that now foreign agencies are undoubtedly  monitoring by microwave  Those same foreign agencies would have to employ another technique   They can’t do it from their physical facilities  They would have to have somebody go out and do  it They can hire those people, to be perfectly blunt, for a fee  Then you also open it up to  non-foreign interveners who think there is a lot of money to be made through organized crime by  tapping into financial information  We don’t know whether they have been active or not, but  foreign [entities] have been active and could very easily just say fine, if we can’t get it by  microwave, we can get it by tap  I don’t say that their risk is less because they have to go through  the trouble and they could always possibly be detected in some sort of maintenance program  But  those wires are just in so many places, and they are so relatively easy to identify  The taps  nowadays, I believe, actually can be done without a physical connection, too, which makes that  even more vulnerable  That is a fairly new technique  All you need is, in effect, an induced sensor     7/18/78              53  that will pick up and translate this into voice  So it is not that hard, and it’s mobile  It can be done  anytime and over and over again  Bob       No, no, not at all  We must explore this  On the first point--John,  you will have to clarify this--I understood the information to be just a report on what microwave  intercepts are being used for  It had nothing to do with the Federal Reserve, but was generally on  how they are being used  And I think there is pretty strong evidence that in wheat transactions or  whatnot they have been used to substantial advantage and may even have caused some of the  inflationary problems we are dealing with around this table in terms of what happened in 1973  I  don’t know, but that is the evidence  In terms of other market transactions, I don’t know  There is  a pretty good indication that we are a target to being intercepted now  Then you begin to break  down  No, I don’t know of any linkage that can tell us of a transaction that took place by using this  intercept to go short or to buy securities in knowledge of a market movement by the Federal  Reserve  But the problem is that we don’t know how they use it or where, or even in what  secondary markets it could be used  It is certainly true in our experience that the foreign powers  involved have no qualms about making money if it gives them off balance sheet funds       No, I think we should do this together  If the value of the morning  market call monitored by a President rather than a Governor has enough benefit--public benefit and  benefit to the System--to outweigh that potential risk which is undefined, then we should go ahead  with the calls  If the benefit of that call outweighs the risks, we should continue for a period of     7/18/78              54  time--for two or three or however many years we need to get to where we have new technology  that will make this [secure communication] more realistically available         Well, Bob, I think we all ought to decide  The point, I guess, was to  leave it unchanged--not that a Governor would be monitoring but we’d make that assignment if we  went this way  We haven’t implemented this yet, as I understand it  We are still doing it the way it  was  Is that correct?     SPEAKER(?)  Yes       Well, would you please write a letter to the Senate and House  Banking Committees to explain that to them?       Yes, no doubt about that       That is by chance       If you were in New York or if you were here, you could do it  But  you could not if you were in neither of those places       7/18/78              55     It won’t do us any good       Well, we can use them for other things       But not with the cost of the secure--       The reason for the monitoring by the substitute Governor was to  have that discipline  But there was another suggestion I had made and that is that there is no reason  not to give the President a rundown on the market situation, all of which is publicly known, and  inform him later in the day of the action  And the President can critique it and say, “That was a  mistake; learn from that and don’t do it again”  It is not correcting in advance but correcting after  the fact--that kind of approach       After [the program] has been implemented, of course, [someone  from the Desk] can call you and explain it to you in complete detail  He can say this is why we did  this and we want you to know why and please if you have any thoughts in thinking about tomorrow  and so forth, is this the kind of approach that makes sense?       Yes  Well, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?   This is a case where  there is certainly no built-in fixed position on our part       I think in several years, with the growth in the market for this sort of  thing--it is going to be needed more and more just for commercial reasons because the intercepts  are very damaging to all kinds of communications  You are going to find more and more  equipment and costs coming down and more and more techniques  Look what happened if you  bought the first mini-computer  Five years later you could buy six times the power for one [half]  the cost of the original  And that is what is going to happen here  That’s why I’m not worried  about our solving it long term  I’m just a little bit stingy about spending $850,000 when I think  probably for a quarter million dollars in three or four years you will get a better deal       You can have two phones  A guy can be talking with two phones      SPEAKER(?)  Maybe I didn’t understand the question       Are you talking about extensions?       That could be secure  And you can’t be on the same line and  understand that elsewhere, but you could be on a separate line       It would be far too expensive to connect it electronically  It would  be a whole research department project       Dave, do you have a comment?       Well, certainly, before implementing anything we should work out a  procedure  We should have an assigned President to continue to be in the loop in some way  That  is certainly true  How do others feel?       The thing with that is that you pay for it, though, [in] a lease  Also,  I think that--       We hope this competition is going to develop       This particular system has been being developed for several years at  Rome airbase through an Air Force contract, and is reported to us to be one of the most--       Yes, we are going to do that  We need [to assess the] fallout of this  whole discussion  I think we are undoubtedly going to lease lines where we would have control of  our network and could use them 24 hours a day to transmit facsimile on a high speed basis  We are  testing now and the pay-out for that will make this all very economical  You don’t get a pay-out  for the other  You make one call a day for an enormous investment and maybe one call every  quarter for the FOMC       Oh yes       If we get that done, you are going to get a much better copy, a much  more readable copy  Some of this other stuff is very hard to decipher       Why don’t we also, Phil, draw up a procedure that takes account of  a system that would keep a monitoring President in the loop to the maximum degree we can and  puts a Governor specifically in the loop?  And let’s work toward the proposition that we want to  return to the present system whenever we can get a feeling of security--when the equipment is  available and the costs are right  [We’ll move] promptly to improve our facsimile transmission       What is the security on that line?       Yes, the reason that is not considered secure is that everybody in the  market knows by then       Yes, all of these things need to be better secured, there is no  question  And that can be done  I think if you can get a lease line with the facsimile you’re going  to get much better security  As I said, we are going to have a 300 lunch  Nothing will happen in  thirty days; we are going to keep exploring it  Gentlemen, the Presidents will meet in this room  after lunch  We have just one brief item                                                                                                      END OF MEETING      "
822,1978-08-15,"  First, I want to apologize for a little delay this morning  It was  because the Treasury [breakfast] had more eggs than usual and I didn't want to pass up the last  opportunity to be fed before this ordeal  Before FOMC meetings I get a very big appetite!  Second,  I have to apologize for Steve Axilrod, but he's going on vacation this afternoon and he doesn't  normally dress this way  Actually, when people saw him yesterday in this outfit, the exchange  markets, as you know, went wild  Let's see what happens      The first order of business is for me to recommend to you the election of Murray Altmann  as Secretary  I think you all know Murray  He's a New Yorker and has been with the Federal  Reserve System since 1949--going on 30 years almost--and most recently, of course, has been  working with the FOMC as Deputy Secretary  And I take great pleasure in recommending him to  you as the Secretary  Is there such a motion?     SPEAKER(?)  So moved      SPEAKER(?)  Second       Any discussion?  All those in favor?     SEVERAL  Aye       All opposed?  Now, the reason Murray has been selected is  because he has a mean streak  Art Broida was so kind that when I asked him to get a timer with a  bell on it to keep us under control, he just couldn't get up the courage to do it himself  But as he  left, he presented me with these timers, which [are hourglasses with sand and] don't have any bells  So I'm going to try to set them up when each of you starts to talk and Murray is going to show a  mean streak--since I'm a gentleman--[and tell you when your time is up]       Yes  And when your three minutes is up, he's going to say “next  speaker”  Three minutes for each one of us is an hour, so if we each speak three times for three  minutes, it’s three hours       Less  So those are your time limits  You didn't know this was  your duty, did you?       We are having a lot of fun but we are serious     My second serious duty is to note that Bob Black, Roger Guffey, and Larry Roos will not  be at this meeting and they are being represented by their First Vice Presidents  George Rankin is  here from Richmond, Henry Czerwinski is here from Kansas City, and Don Moriarty is here from  St Louis, so we are all represented, and we welcome you  I think at least for Henry and perhaps  Don this is your first time attending [as a participant] at this table, though you've been [at FOMC  meetings seated in] other places  We are delighted to have you and we hope you will speak up      The next thing I would like to mention is a concern that has come to my mind about  possible inadvertent, but nonetheless potentially damaging, leakage from the FOMC meetings  We  have seen a recent article by Ben Weberman that comes very close to indicating that he has inside  information about what goes on in these meetings  And that could only come from someone here   It is not coming from anyone because of a leak  It's occurring because of the general capacity of  the journalist to put 2 and 2 together--by calling you and chatting and by innocent questions and  silences during these calls around the country--to make up a story  I think this is very damaging   There have been memos circulated in the past about how we take special care for security and there  is, I believe, a procedure where each March the Committee is reminded of this problem      But I would like to suggest to you that all of us are subject to our egos being massaged by  the press calling us and saying how important it is to get our views on the economy  And a few  questions put here and there [can give them a story]  Frankly, I think it would be well just to  decline to take calls from the press for a respectable period after an FOMC meeting and not get  trapped in this procedure  Have your public information people take the calls and ask what the  subject is  I think we should be--and I hope we will be--more sophisticated than to let ourselves be  trapped because I do think it does damage for stories to get out about what goes on inside these  meetings        If you’d like, we can circulate some of the memos on this subject going back to 1972 and  1975, but I think you all probably appreciate what I am talking about and I hope we can watch it  Unless I have omitted something, Mr Secretary, I think we can now proceed with the regular  agenda and ask for approval of the minutes of the actions taken at the FOMC of July 18  Are there  any questions or changes that have not already been [submitted] to the Secretary?  Hearing none,  and in the absence of any dissent, we will assume the minutes are approved  Next is a report on  foreign currency operations since the last meeting  Scott Pardee       Any questions or comments?       Yes, the Treasury’s Tony Solomon made an announcement some  weeks ago  I think it’s the first time the public had been informed of substantial repayments   Ernie, I think you had a question       This is not your own characterization       With your permission, at the end of this meeting I'd like to bring  up the subject of countermeasures to this sort of situation  I’d prefer not to do it now but at the end  of the meeting, if you all don't mind, because we had not prepared to do so  I'd better bring it up  because there is something to [discuss]  I'm not trying to cut into the questioning to Scott       I think we should discuss that with the Committee, yes       Chuck Partee       I don't think we could characterize it as final       You have a massive amount of dollar holdings that could be  moved if there were a real panic       Oh yes, because you have, of course, substantial holdings of  foreigners, of OPEC countries--       You have a bottomless pit--in some sense--of panic  In the  international field, I don't think we have mechanisms to avoid a panic       By all the standards we developed before, Bob, it was disorderly       So we need your action to ratify the transactions since the  previous meeting  I believe they have been reported to you  Is there such a motion?       And seconded  Any discussion?  All those in favor, say “aye”     SEVERAL  Aye       It is so voted  Scott, I think you also have some recommendations  with respect to renewals of swap drawings, and perhaps you can go on to report on the  Bundesbank’s proposals       Any discussion?  Then we may have a motion for a renewal     SPEAKER(?)  So moved       [ None] opposed, so voted       8/15/78             6     Well, that's internal accounting       This would change the relationship for repayment purposes  Any  questions?  I think we will have much to consider in that field as this develops further  You'll be  coming back to us with something further?       I believe that completes the [subject of] foreign currency  operations unless there are still questions  We will go on to the economic and financial situation  and outlook  This month Jerry Zeisel will report  Jim Kichline is on vacation despite the terrible  international outlook     8/15/78             7       Thank you, Jerry  I would suggest that we now take a period of  time first for questions of the staff and then, as we’ve been doing recently, that we do the  go-around and get your own views on the outlook for the next four quarters on real GNP, inflation,  and unemployment  Are there any questions now of the staff before we begin?       Other questions?       Bob       Henry Wallich, you have a question, do you?       This is a leading question, so be careful how you answer it       The answer is what you assume to be full employment       Well, gentlemen, I would suggest that since we went around this  way last time, as I recall, we'll go around the other way this time  Let me start off, as usually I end  up  I would call your attention to Part 1 of the Greenbook, page 6  Under changes, it shows the     8/15/78             9  projected changes; it says '78 II to '79 II, and that's the line we're talking about in a way  If you  look there, you'll see that on a four-quarter basis the staff is projecting real GNP to grow 36  percent, they're looking at a deflator of 74 percent, and they're looking at an average  unemployment rate in the second quarter of 1979 of 58 percent  Those figures are the ones we're  going to try to get your feeling on  Now we know what the staff thinks and we're going to see what  we're all thinking around the country about the orders of magnitude [for those variables]      In my own case, I don't believe I've really changed my feeling from the last meeting  I  think that real GNP is apt to grow at 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent in this period, that the deflator is apt to  be between 7 and 7-3/4, and that the unemployment rate will be 5-3/4 to 6  I believe those are the  figures I had last time  I'm not going to fill in any comments because I know what we've seen in  the Redbook and what we've seen in the Greenbook  [I wonder] if we all could at least get that  general feeling that the economy is slowing [but] it's still fairly well balanced in the sense that there  are no major sectors that are either expanding [or going] down rapidly  We're talking nationwide   Obviously, cement is short in some places but generally there are no capacity constraints  There  seem to be no general excesses of inventory and there seem to be no general deflationary pressures  in any particular sectors  It’s a fairly well balanced situation with some leeway  Paul       Phil       Phil, I was particularly waiting for your remarks because anyone  who spent two weeks in the wilds of Canada has the most balanced view of what the outlook might  be--not contaminated by being too--       Chuck       Thank you, Chuck  George       Mr Winn       So competitiveness makes no difference, even with slack?       Thank you  Dave       Thank you, Dave  Bones       8/15/78             12     Thank you for the report, not the information  Don       Thank you  Let’s pop over [to the other side of the table] to  Henry       Okay, thank you  Bob       Thank you, Bob  Mark       I like someone who'll stick his neck out!  Remember we're  keeping the record, Mark       Thank you, Mark  John       Prudent       Thank you, John  Ernie     8/15/78             14       I'm curious about those feelings, which I'm sure are accurately  reported  In a sense it's hard to believe that this Congress could be motivated between now and  their election to put in wage and price controls It's hard to see the circumstances where that could  be  You can't get them to do sensible legislation, let alone irrational legislation!  Then that means  we're into the next session, because I don't believe you could bring back a lame duck Congress to  do it either  We don't have any wage and price controls on the books, so we'd have to have an  awfully big emergency to get either this Congress or the lame duck Congress to do it  Starting with  the new Congress I guess the President would have to announce a request for it [and have] a date in  mind [with] no changes past that date--or ask for legislation barring changes past a certain date   And that's a very clumsy situation       Yes, that's the people who are tired of inflation and wouldn't have  to deal with whether it would work or not  Everybody is in favor of stopping price increases, I  think; that's what public opinion polls are showing  I can't translate that easily--in the next six  months--into legislation myself, unless there's a much bigger crisis  But I'm sure that's the [view]   It's very disappointing to see bankers say that the problem is labor, but we're raising our salaries  above the guidelines because we want to be ahead of the wage and price controls  However, labor  is guilty  Now, that kind of attitude [among] people who presumably should be leaders of their  communities is really shocking  Well, it's fairly discouraging  And they point the finger at labor   We're taking care of ourselves and our own fat salaries, but we're going to blame it on labor  It’s a  very sad situation       Very, very discouraging  And there’s little hope that you could  keep a system together if people have such little willingness to show restraint  And there’s so little  competitiveness taking place  I would think some businessmen would want more share of market-- apparently not       8/15/78             15     Well, let us move to you, Frank       You may lose your position this time       Where does that take place, Frank?  Do you see it being a  progressive downslide?  That's a very low average  If you start off with over 3 percent in the third  quarter, you have to get down pretty low before you're through       You're looking at a pretty low first half  Okay       I think you do win  Okay  Thank you, Frank  Phil       Okay  Henry       Thank you, Henry  Steve       You have a clean slate       Thank you, Steve  Just looking down this quickly, in outline, for  real GNP we seem to come out with a consensus lower than the staff’s--that is, a little lower than  3-1/2 percent  Inflation looks to be maybe a little stronger than the staff projection, at 7-1/2 plus,  and unemployment looks higher at a 6 percent plus figure  That’s very helpful to us  I think this is  a very helpful process       That's correct  It looks like there are not many below 6 percent,  so it's a 6 plus kind of thing  Interestingly, it looks like on labor [our view] is that we're in that  range and the other things are going to slow down the economy [but firms will] not discharge labor  because apparently productivity is not going to [increase]  So apparently that is the judgment built  into this and that's not surprising     Well, may I [say that] I want to give the Federal Reserve medal of honor to the  counterclockwise process, considering that this time we completed the whole circle in the time it  took us to go through three speakers the other way last month  I want to commend you and I won't  say who was sitting on which side at the time  Too beaten down to make a speech, it is kind of a  dull, dreary thing  We have a few minutes before the coffee is being sent up and I would like to  indulge your attention and have Peter Sternlight report on the open market operations and ratify his  transactions before we take the coffee break  Peter       Peter, it seems to me that the Committee at the last meeting gave  you a very difficult assignment to operate in the intervening period  I think you've done it very  credibly and I commend you for it       I didn't think you were going to be able to do it  [I don’t know]  whether it was luck or skill  I have to assume that it was skill, so you have my congratulations   Are there any questions or comments?  A motion would be in order to ratify the transactions since  the previous meeting  I believe they have been reported to you  Is there--       Any discussion?  All those in favor say “aye”     8/15/78             18     SEVERAL  Aye       Opposed?  So voted  We will take a recess for coffee     [Coffee break]       Before we proceed, let me just mention a couple of things that  have happened with the breakout of the yen  A couple weeks ago we began to look at the bag of  tricks that might be examined in connection with the foreign exchange markets  I guess we had a  little premonition because now the foreign exchange markets are [being] disorderly  Yesterday  afternoon, Henry Wallich and Paul Volcker and I met with people from the Treasury at their  request to see if we could review some of the possible steps that might be taken to counter  disorderly conditions and to look at the more fundamental causes of the continuing decline of the  dollar  I think our discussions today are relevant because the international situation does become a  relevant factor when you have such dramatic changes and all the repercussions that may come from  them  I don't need to spell out to this group the possibilities of this kind of disorder becoming  increasingly disturbing and leading to wholesale disruptions and long-range problems that would  be very serious indeed  And we know that in the absence of some sense of direction, there is a very  large potential for disruption that could continue      Things that the Federal Reserve could do are, as usual, relatively limited and might be  ineffective unless coupled with Treasury Department/Administration actions that look to things  within their control and in some longer-term areas  It's a very sensitive area and I would ask you to  pay particularly close [attention] to security possibilities in this area because we are dealing with  markets that can run any direction just from a leak at the meeting  I was called out from this office  a moment ago to respond to a call that has asked me to come over to the White House this  afternoon and see what can proceed along these lines  I would ask you not to indicate that such a  meeting is even being held because that's, I think, in the control of the President  If he wants to  announce it or indicate it, I think that’s how it should be  Just as Scott said--or someone said  The  Swiss cabinet is meeting, and the market reacts just to a meeting  I think we should avoid any such  discussion from our side  The White House security is terrible because the message came through  some of our staff not cleared for FOMC [materials] even  That shows you my problems [on  security]     Anyway, [there are] things that we might consider doing, obviously  In combination with  [our] economic views, we might look at changes in reserve requirements for CDs so that we could- -the Board of Governors could--substantially increase the reserve requirements for domestic CDs  short-term, and we could lower to zero the reserve requirements for CD dollars acquired from  abroad  [That would] therefore make it possible for banks to offer a higher interest rate without  changing domestic interest rates, in terms of attracting capital from abroad--making it more  interesting to hold dollars  We could also consider raising the discount rate, which--if coordinated  with other policies we'd do anyway--would be perceived as an announcement signal that we intend  to [do something about this situation]        8/15/78             19   Another thing we might do--and we'll discuss this later--is to consider activating the swap  line on yen, provided we could get a series of commitments from the Japanese  That would include  a commitment to lower their discount rate to 2-1/2 percent, say--thereby greatly widening the  differential and assisting the exchange adjustments--and a commitment to go forward with their  stimulus program of 4 trillion yen  [They can] no longer have it be “we'll think about it in  September;” but the Prime Minister will say he is going to call on his cabinet and endeavor to do so  and perhaps take some steps on trade and other things  It's possible that we can agree with the  Treasury--incidentally on the yen swap we'd want Treasury participation and we'd want to leverage  it with considerably more commitment with the Japanese intervention than our intervention so that  we'd get more bang for the buck  Or yuk for the yen or whatever it is  If it's possible, the Treasury  [may] announce that it is going to draw on the IMF to acquire currency to replace swaps, thereby  taking the reverse market pressure off  It would be possible for the Treasury to announce that it  might increase its sales of gold, which we might admit doesn't have tremendous technical  advantage, except that it has psychological advantage  It may be a good way to bring in dollars at  these prices of gold It does, at least, put the supply [as a] factor of the gold situation  We could  persuade the President to put on quotas on oil as a definite step--that no longer will he wait  considering the disruptions in the international situation, etc      I don't know how any of these will come out, but it seems to me that they may be relevant  to this Committee in terms of the directive to the Desk in the interim period  They certainly are  relevant in terms of the authority of this Committee to decide on swaps and, as I say, before this  meeting is over I'd like to get some sense in that direction  Up until now there's been a strong  consensus--at least I felt there was a strong consensus on this Committee--that it was not  appropriate to go into yen intervention  And I have certainly shared that view and expressed it  consistently  On the other hand, we have not foreclosed that forever and ever, because conditions  do change  They may be at a state now where we want to think about it or be prepared to do it  rather quickly  If we're going to do any of these things and be effective, they must be done  promptly  If we can put together a package of actions and proposed actions, it must be done  probably within 48 hours to have an impact--or by Friday, let's say      Meantime, we have the problem of what the Administration says, because they cannot  remain silent  If they remain silent, that would be interpreted in the market as not caring at all  If  they say something that is in the nature of a promise that is interpreted as something dramatic like  capital controls or wage and price controls, that could be disruptive  If they tell the truth, nobody  knows what that is until we decide what to do  So it’s a very, very ticklish situation and I hope you  all will bear with us as we try to struggle through it  With that preliminary to excite your  imaginations, let us proceed with what is your pleasure on the directive  We'll start with our  eminently attired Steve Axilrod       A twist       Thank you, Steve  Any questions before we begin to give our  personal views?       Gentlemen, I think we might as usual call the roll--with voting  members first and then the other Presidents--and ask for views  I might express a little personal  statement before we start that  As you know, for some time, after substantial tightening up in the  spring, I've been interested in being sure that we didn't move too rapidly until we saw how the  economy was behaving after what I considered to be abnormal conditions of the second quarter  I  say abnormal because of the carry-over from the first quarter of a strike and winter weather, and  because of the pull forward [from] the third quarter because of anticipatory buying  At the same  time, I feel the timing is extremely important  Nothing in recent events, as seen in the external  world, would indicate a particular need to change the Federal Reserve’s policy  In fact, the  morning paper predicts that we'll stand pat because what the world has seen is a rally in the bill and  bond markets  And they’ve seen a slowing in the rate of growth of the aggregates--slower than  we've seen for quite a while--and the economy is slowing down and unemployment is going up  So  the expectation would be--with all those things happening, and the Fed's policy beginning to bite  and things happening that one would like to see happen--no need for change      However, my view is that we have the aggregates moving in the right direction and we  ought to keep them moving in that direction and not let them bounce back up on us  Second, I  think the international situation is critical to our inflationary fight because if we should continue to  have an erosion of the dollar, we're just feeding inflation and making our problem worse and worse   I think we need a series of actions  Therefore, I would tend to favor a program that would be  nearer to alternative B  I tend to agree with the ranges for M1  Some of you who favor tightening  may want to suggest lower ranges but let me remind you  Considering that M1 grew last year at  79 percent and has been growing pretty much in the 7-3/4 percent area for a while and with the  economy as weak [as it appears] I'm not sure how hard we'd want to bang down on it  So 5 to 9 as  the range does have an upper limit of our long-term range, for which we expect to be hunting  around [for growth at] sort of the midpoint  The M2 ranges are satisfactory, and I would think a  federal funds range at 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 would probably be the right next move  And the expectation  is that in the interim before the next Committee meeting, if the aggregates behave along the lines  projected, we’d find ourselves getting toward the upper end of that range, which absent another  consultation I would think would be enough action in the interim  Those aren't hard and fast views;  they're views that suggest another notch is desirable     I think it would be consistent, if we moved the federal funds rate fairly soon to 8 percent,  for us to consider a move in the discount rate of perhaps as much as 1/2 percentage point  The  reason for that is, as I say, timing is something  Some of you may wonder why we haven't moved  it  Well, one reason is that now it gives us the time to move it where we can do something instead  of just having to dribble along  So we might consider a move of the discount rate--if the [Board  members] so elect and they may not--in a way that would keep it in alignment with the fed funds  rate of 8 percent And it would give us a chance to somehow make one step in accommodating the     8/15/78             21  international disorder  So with those general views, subject to being [influenced] in either direction  and being very flexible, I will now turn to the members of the Committee  Paul, would you like to  comment first?       We should put out a press release!       Thank you, Paul, I think  Ernie       Thank you, Ernie  Phil Coldwell I believe is next       You said to an 8--       We just had accounting trouble       Dave?     8/15/78             23       Thank you, Dave  Steve Gardner       Thank you, Steve  Philip Jackson       Some of us would have a telephone meeting       Phil missed that experience  We lost five [of the participants on  the phone call] the other day     8/15/78             24       Thank you  Chuck       Assuming a tightening up       Thank you, Chuck  Henry, you didn't get [to hear] all of the  discussion; perhaps you picked up most of it  Did you hear me when I gave my views?       Thank you, Henry  Mark       What would you move to immediately?  You have a midpoint of  8       Thank you  Willis       Thank you, Willis  John       Thank you, John  Bones       Thank you very much  Bob Mayo       Thank you, Bob  Frank Morris       Thank you, Frank  Did you have an 8 percent midpoint?       Henry       Thank you, Henry  Don       Thank you  George       Thank you very much  It will be very helpful if I can see where  we stand  We have [by my count] nine of the voting members who have suggested a range on  federal funds of 7-3/4 to 8-1/4, [though] not necessarily the same [on the] other ranges  On the M1  range, there are five who are for 4 to 8  If we take the alternatives, there are a couple of those at 3  to 8 or 4 to 8, so I assume they'd go with a 4 to 8  And for 5 to 9, we have four  And 5-1/2 to 7-1/2     8/15/78             28  is a maverick  There seems to be a little more sentiment on the lower side of M1  For the M2  range, six are at 6 to 10 and three at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2  How many does that add to?     SEVERAL  Nine       We're missing a couple  We are going to count again Well, we  have one 6 to 11 and one 6-1/2 to 8-1/2  The midpoint is 8 for almost everybody except two  indicated they’d stay at 7-7/8 and several indicated slowness in moving [to 8 percent]  Let's see if I  can formulate a consensus  I don't know if the consensus would be to fit M1 at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2   Steve, do you have any comments before we go forward?  Peter do you have anything to add?       Does anything here bother you?       Clearly, [we’ll talk about] the timing of the move--as the last  order of business, I think  First we ought to decide what ranges we are going for and see what the  order is of how to get there  Steve, do you have anything to add?       Yes, but one of those would also have the bottom at 5-1/2 so  you've got to be evenhanded       Well, let's try this for a moment 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, 6 to 10, and 7-3/4  to 8-1/4 with the midpoint of 8 but discuss later on how we will get to 8  And there seems to be a  pretty big consensus for a monetary aggregates directive  Just as a straw vote, [let’s have] a show  of hands of those who are voting members  How would that strike you?  Do we get any votes for  that?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  Yes, I suppose the difference would be if we change it to 4 to 8  Then how  many would vote for that proposition--most everybody?  Everybody who didn't vote [before]  It’s  the same--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--a split       Yes, how many would go for 5 to 9?  All right, four  Doesn't  prove much, does it?  Looks like 4 to 8 is a pretty good compromise  Yes, you’ve got company;  we have switch votes  What if we have a vote now where you only get one vote?  You don't get  two votes; you only get one vote  There were two votes, obviously, going both ways there  Let's     8/15/78             29  have a straw vote on 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, realizing you can't vote again  How many would accept the  other and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2?  Five  And those for 4 to 8?  Five  Who is missing?  Oh, Mark  Well,  you want a lower one altogether  Why don't you stay that way and we'll have a hung jury!  But you  would vote for 4 to 8 if we had the whole directive this way       Just for a moment, assume we are going to have a 4 to 8 range  It  looks like the majority was lined up that way, by a very close margin  Then the next question is  How [directly] do we get to 8, as the midpoint of the [funds rate] range?  There's some possibility  that we might want to [wait] a few days on moving to 8 and keep where we are so that we can see if  some international program will develop in the next couple of days       The only reason I would think of hesitating a little, although I  think I originally said move it to 8, would be if in the next few days or by the end of the week we  have some international package  Then I think we might reserve this to flow out of that process   That might just be a little running room for us  How do you feel, Scott?       Not much effect one way or another       Actually, Peter, you'll find that people will test you today or  tomorrow       What is your preference as the person on the firing line--give you  the freedom to go ahead?  If it takes too much to hold it below 8, to let it stay at 8?       8/15/78             30     I think that's a sensible approach  I think there's just too little in it  for the international to hold off if you're getting [market resistance]  Now, if the market is just  quiescent, I would leave [the funds rate] where it is until we see what things look like this week   That directive language--does that formulation create any problems?       Anybody feel differently?  So we will let the market judge a little  But certainly once the international matter is decided, if the rate hasn't been moved by the market, it  will be moved by the Desk to 8  And then we will proceed       I think that's the truth  Well, thank you  Now we will have an  official vote  We will call the roll  It came out that the majority had 4 to 8 and 6 to 10 on M1 and  M2 and the range for federal funds is 7-3/4 to 8-1/4  And the midpoint is 8, with the instruction we  discussed for moving to 8      On the draft directive a suggestion has been made that on page 1, line 16, we point out that  [the value of the dollar against major] foreign currencies declined sharply further because since this  was written there has been a sharp decline  Another suggestion is that, using a monetary  aggregates [directive] line 66 on page 4 should read--I was going to read it starting on line 64, but  in fact I will read the whole thing--as follows “In deciding on the specific objective for the federal  funds rate the Manager shall be guided by…” strike “mainly” and insert ""developing conditions in  financial and foreign exchange markets and by the relationship between the latest estimates""  The  reason for that is--this is a suggestion--if the aggregates should come in a little weaker than  projected and money market conditions are still disorderly, we might want to keep a little firmer  hand on it       Well, let's see       Well, you can say “domestic and international financial markets”  or you can--       Well, what was used before was in that place  The language for  the short run that we used before said “In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be  taken of emerging conditions in domestic and international financial markets""  Where do you  prefer it gentlemen--in the paragraph on page 2 or page 4?       That is Paul's point       It sounds like there's enough confusion; maybe we better put it in  page 2  I think we are going to have to have a consultation if things get wild anyway  I don't like  to see us operate without talking  So let's do it that way if everyone's agreeable  Hearing no  dissent, they are agreeable  Now, let’s vote on the proposed consensus I have just outlined  I need  not repeat it again  And I will vote for it       The specs were 4 to 8 and 6 to 10 on the M1 and M2 ranges,  7-3/4 to 8-1/4 on fed funds, and a move to 8 on instructions that we have discussed  Now we will  take votes       I think that is a remarkable vote  One is negative because we  should be higher on M1 and one is negative because we should be lower  So we have two dissents  in this case  It’s too bad we can't have a series of votes so we could have a unanimous vote on the  [funds rate] range  I don't think we’ve ever formulated a vote that way but it would be nice  The  dissent will actually show the individual reasons for dissent       Well, you tell us what we are supposed to choose       Is “slightly” satisfactory?     SPEAKER(?)  Is “somewhat” bigger than “slightly”?       You have to know the code words  That's why I asked Steve to  tell us what to say  Thank you very much; you had a great contribution       Pardon me?       I think you have a very good point  Initially means that he should  do it immediately       Yes, I think you are absolutely right  We can change the word  initially to promptly in due course         Why don't we just say “directed at attaining” and leave out  “initially”       Right  Thank you for catching that  Are there any other  comments on this?  We have a vote  Thank you very much  We have the confirmation of the date  of the next meeting, which is September 19     Now I'd like to discuss the international situation  Henry, is there anything you'd like to say  before I do?       I've outlined some actions that might be taken  As we discussed  yesterday, one of the actions is to be more aggressive in the D-mark intervention  But there I  believe we have to have a better concept of where we're going or we may find some disagreement  from the Bundesbank on what to do  We certainly need to have a more comprehensive program;  otherwise it will be viewed as sending good money after bad  So we have to be careful there      I'll reiterate some of the things the Federal Reserve could do  As I said, one is to adjust the  reserve requirements on short-term CDs as to domestic and foreign, to skew it in favor of attracting  foreign dollars  Yes, I mean all of the skewing could be accomplished       That's right  The skewing is a matter of how many basis points  difference it makes, Chuck, which would be up to the Board of Governors  We could raise the  discount rate  The activation of the yen swap line would be, I think, the one area we should get  some viewpoint on now and some direction to us as to proceed or to not proceed, since I believe  that has to be decided very shortly  The argument that we've had for not doing it has been, of  course, that to us the Japanese have not been terribly forthcoming in solutions to adjusting their  surplus and, therefore, to intervene without a more fundamental attack on the problem would be to  put band aids on and not solve anything     More recently the Japanese have been sending their emissaries here to visit and probe again  on whether we would activate [the swap]  Among the Administration and ourselves we intend to  ask the question  What good is intervention unless there's a package and what kind of package do     8/15/78             34  you see?  The package could consist of a commitment by the prime minister to go ahead with the  stimulus package in Japan of, say, 4 trillion yen  It could include a commitment to lower their  discount rate, which is now 3-1/2 percent, to something below 3 and perhaps 2-1/2 to widen the  spread  It could contain some other features in terms of trade and whatnot, but they get very hard  to tie down because of the complications  But it could be beefed up with a few other primary  things; it might not be those  The terms would have to be worked out where we would have a  50-50 sharing And the amount that we can activate I believe is $2 billion; we might or might not  want to go that far         I think it's already--       We'd also have to agree on the method of operation  It seems to  me that we would want to have an agreement on the amount, on the relative amount of intervention  they would do for their own accounts in New York and in Tokyo  And we'd want some  understanding on the repayment  Those points, Scott, I believe you feel you could work out in  fairly short order       And the interest rate would have to be discussed       Right         Yes, you're right; we'd probably have a hard time getting them to  agree to that, because it isn't what we're doing with the Bundesbank       And they're changing in the wrong direction  If we change the  non-50-50--incidentally, the other condition I think we would want, if we did this, is to have the  Treasury in either as a participant in our swap line or opening a swap line of their own  I don't  believe necessarily that we should do that unless there were these other actions by the Federal  Reserve contemplated and some actions by the Treasury contemplated and something from the  Administration  But I don't know what those can be, so it's hard for this Committee to act [for or]  against an unknown package  It's a very difficult problem and crisis  But I would like to know the  sentiment of the Committee as to whether there would be a willingness to move in this direction  It  would be a change in policy  Now, Chuck Partee’s name is first and then John Balles and Phil  Coldwell  You better start putting names down, [Murray]       Thank you, Chuck  John Balles       Thank you, John  Phil Coldwell       Between the two combined you mean       And the Japanese, too       Thank you, Phil  Frank Morris       Well, Chuck, if you did $2 billion under one swap line and 50-50  sharing, we're risking $1 billion, other than the interest cost  And if the Treasury did $1 billion,  that's $3 billion; if the Japanese did $2 billion more on their own, that's $5 billion       Oh, I see       Well, now to get us back in order  Murray, you'd better put  Henry’s name down  Phil Jackson       We can't have a zone or a peg       Ernie Baughman       In marks, too       The Board of Governors has the right to set any reserve  requirements they want     8/15/78             40       No, no  Steve, am I correct?       It's 4 on all       The question is how much--you can go up or down--you can  differentiate them and create a bias in favor of pulling in eurodollars  Thank you  Bones       Thank you  Bob       Thank you, Bob  Henry Wallich       Thank you, Henry  Paul       Phil, did you mean a take-out from Treasury in terms of how we  get the yen to repay?       8/15/78             43     From the time you close out, they take the risk  The only reason I  wanted to raise the question again is that I'm not sure it would be possible in 48 hours for the  Treasury to commit to a yen-denominated [bond]  I just don't know       What I'm talking about in the Treasury is that I'm not sure they  can take the currency exchange risk--an unknown risk in advance without legislation  That is what  I'm saying  I don't think they have any room in their--       It's completely out of line       So I don't see how they can agree to something [like that]         8/15/78             44     They may not be able to       As far as any loss on transactions is concerned, it comes right out  of the Treasury because our earnings go to the Treasury  If we don't have it, it comes out of the  Treasury       In that sense, it doesn't make any difference which pocket it is   Okay thank you, Paul  Dave Eastburn has been trying to get a word in here edgewise       Thank you, Dave  I think we've heard from all the members of  the Committee, except Willis Winn and Mark Willes  Do you have anything to say?       [Would you] say yes or no?       Mark       I would add only a couple of words  I don't think there's any point  in our taking action on a swap agreement to do intervention for the sake of the Japanese  We     8/15/78             45  should only do it for the sake of the United States, believing that there is no good mechanism to  prevent money panics in the world, even though we may have created some ways to prevent them  in the United States and our own domestic economy  [Given] the amount of money that could shift  around in disorder and the amount of harm that could be done in the United States from a change in  pricing of oil constantly or demanding gold for it or something else, it could be very serious      I do not project that there will be an international panic but I know one can be created if  you get a whole series of events  Therefore, I also look upon this in terms of a very simple thing   How does it affect inflation in the United States and how does that affect our long-term objectives?   How does it affect the possibility of more serious things happening, in terms of creating recession,  in the world?  You go on and on and you can [escalate] it up to warfare  As someone said,  economics is the profession where if you're wrong, people go to the barricades  That has often  been true in history  But if we could couple this with a series of actions and commitments from the  Administration to help address a broader program, I think we might be aiding the United States  I  don't think we should do it to aid the Japanese at all  Henry's comments along those lines were, I  think, particularly pertinent, although on a different slant  I think that's correct     Steve, I was incorrect  You were silent  I just checked over this [list] quickly and I--       If I counted noses correctly, on the Committee there were seven  who expressed themselves in favor of pursuing this course and four who either felt we shouldn't do  it or were skeptical  The four who expressed disagreement or skepticism would be Ernie, Dave,  Mark, and Willis       Okay, let's put a question mark  It depends on the terms in your  case  I think it depends on terms for all of us     SEVERAL  Yes, the conditions are important       So I think we would need [to know them]  I want to be sure I  don't mistake this  But there seems to be a clear majority to let us see what can be developed   Obviously, we don't want to open the subject with the Japanese until we know more about a  governmental program because the last thing we’d want is to have the Japanese saying we have a  swap agreement being activated  So it's a touchy business  All I can say is, with that guidance, we  will go forward and see what we come up with  I'm supposed to be over at the White House and  I'm going to have to beg off for lunch if you don't mind       That clock is very slow  That's right; the electricity must have  been off  I think the only thing we can do is to come back to the Committee by phone or otherwise  and get clearance for the details  Dave       Oh, yes  Anyway, with that guidance, we will go forward   Unless there are any more comments on that, we'll keep you fully apprised and ask you to keep  extremely close confidence about this because this is information that can affect markets   Therefore, we have a very high fiduciary duty to see that it is not handled the way the White House  handles it      There are several subjects at lunch that I hope will go forward in my absence  One is to  report to you on developments on the membership situation  I think Steve can give you [an  update] I must say that the staff has done an outstanding job in responding to developments since  last week and working over the weekends so we could make a response after our discussion on  Friday; they continue to work with your comments and are making a number of changes  So we  can bring you up to date on where that stands  And Ken Guenther can bring you up to date on the  legislative posture of it  In terms of other legislative matters, I think Ken Guenther will be there to  brief you      I've asked Janet Hart to come to the luncheon  I feel it's important that we begin to get a  clear understanding within the System of our professional obligation to be diligent in the  enforcement of consumer and civil rights legislation  I'm not saying we're not doing it but the  internal report of our consultant indicates that we're slightly confused and we're not adequately  focused  And I think we have to be  We're starting some things at the Board in terms of direction  and resources, and I think Janet can brief you on those issues      There was going to be, if time permits, an opportunity to bring to your attention some of the  subjects that might come up at the IMF meeting in September  Time may not permit  That may  have to go by the way  And Tom O'Connell wants to brief you in 30 seconds--right Tom?--on a  couple of the court cases  There's nothing about those things that you need me for  I apologize for  missing it but I think I'd better pursue the other course and see what I can report to you       The luncheon is on for the Presidents and the host will be the  Board’s Vice Chairman Gardner  And I'll have a sandwich in my office in five minutes       END OF MEETING      "
850,1978-09-19,"  We're missing a couple of people, but it is 930 so I think we will  proceed  I think the most important order of business this morning is to welcome Nancy Teeters to  the Board of Governors and to the FOMC  It's very nice to have your first full day at the Federal  Open Market Committee meeting; my first day was testifying before the House Banking  Committee  I think you're going to have a more pleasant day than I had, but I hope you've done as  much homework as I had to do       Well, it gets worse  I would also like to say, Larry, how pleased   we are to see you back [though] with your cane  It was probably the low point of humor last night- -I won't give any attribution--when they said that was because you were a Keynesian  I thought I  would not really be able to have [your] support  Nonetheless, [we are pleased with] your rapid  recovery  The fact is that we missed you last month and are delighted to have you back  If you  vote right for a couple of times, we'll see that you don't get injured further!  Welcome to you both      The agenda is before you, I believe, and the first order of business is approval of the   minutes of the Committee meeting of August 15 and the telephonic meeting of September 8  That  has been circulated for comments and corrections  Hearing [none,] those will stand approved   [Next is] a report on foreign currency operations since the August 15 meeting  Scott Pardee       Larry      Bob Mayo      Thank you very much  Now we'll turn to action to ratify the  transactions since the previous meeting  You've all had the packet on transactions  Are there any  questions or comments? May I have a motion to approve?     SPEAKER(?)  I move      Second?    SPEAKER(?)  Second      Any discussion?  All in favor say “aye”    SEVERAL  Aye      Opposed?  So voted  Now we’ll turn to consideration of the   Manager's recommendation with respect to foreign currency operations  Alan Holmes      Fine  You've heard the recommendation  Is there any discussion?    Henry      We may have to use them      Is there a motion to approve the recommendation?    SPEAKER(?)  So moved       9/19/78            4      Any further discussion?  All in favor say “aye”    SEVERAL  Aye      Opposed?  So voted  Thank you very much  We'll move from the   international to the--      You have a couple of other things, excuse me      Otherwise, we could be in default?      Any discussion?    SPEAKER(?)  So moved    SPEAKER(?)  Second      All in favor say “aye”    SEVERAL  Aye      Opposed?  So voted  Alan, you also are going to discuss the   possible terms of renewal?      Thank you  Paul, you have a particular comment on--      Henry, do you have any comments?      Thank you, Henry  You all will receive a copy of the   memorandum and at the next meeting we'll have an opportunity to consider this I hope, because  the next meeting is the meeting for setting ranges, that we will use the interim time [to look  carefully at] the memo so that we'll be prepared to respond to this  I think the proposals are  reasonable  It doesn't make sense [currently]  The United States should be grown up  If it's going  to intervene, it should intervene for its account like other countries and not expect somebody else to  share [the risk]       To counter disorderly markets      No, I don't think so, Chuck, because you're just saying split it in  two  [When] they intervene in the market and we don't share with their intervention, we don't take  half of their risk  It isn't that this is the only intervention  If this were the only intervention, your  argument would be sound  The Japanese intervened with how many billions of dollars?       We don't share that  We intervene for $3 billion and we go   around and ask like beggars that somebody share with us and it's not the sole intervention      That is our report on the international situation  Now we'll move   to the staff’s comments on the economic and financial situation and outlook  Jim Kichline      I would like to suggest [a change in our] procedures this morning   Nancy, in the past we've not only had an opportunity to question and comment on the staff's report,  but we've then had a round robin and asked each participant to give his own estimate of real GNP  growth over the next four quarters, what price [developments] will be over the four quarters, and  what the unemployment rate will be in the fourth quarter out      I think that it might be desirable today to omit that particular round robin since we've done   it fairly frequently on the second quarter  There isn't that much change and perhaps we'll do that  quarterly instead of every time  Instead, I would suggest after a chance to comment or question the  staff that we just go briefly around and see if anyone has any particular variations or additional  points they would like to make from their region or from their own analysis of the overall situation  So are there any questions or comments?  Dave       Other questions of the staff?  Roger      Willis      Well, ladies and gentlemen, the staff projections would indicate   that from second quarter of 1978 to second quarter of 1979, looking at four quarters, real GNP will  grow at 3-1/2 percent and prices on the gross business product fixed-weighted price index will be  up 71 percent  For the unemployment rate--I believe I'm correct--the average in the second quarter  of 1979 would be 58 percent  Is that right, Jim?       So those are the kinds of figures the staff is looking at  [For] the   fourth quarter of ’77 to the fourth quarter of ’78, they're looking at 3-1/2 percent real growth, 8  percent prices, and unemployment at 59 percent  So, those are for the calendar year 1978 and for  the four quarters--second quarter to second quarter     Why don't we mix up the order of batting this time and start down here with Roger and   come around this way?  I would suggest that so that we can be through [on time]  We found out,  Nancy, that the first three speakers take up all the time  We have to start at different places every  time or some people would never get a chance to talk!  When you start with Governors, it takes  particularly long  I try not to start with Governors; they've been schooled in 45 minute lectures or  something  Roger       You're talking about to the second quarter of 1979      Thank you  Bob      Thank you  Mark      Okay, thanks Mark  John      You expect less inflation?       9/19/78            11      Thank you  Ernie      Thank you  Frank      Frank, the ticker tape this morning says chief executive officers of   US companies turned more pessimistic about the economy according to the Conference Board's  latest survey  Its measure of business confidence fell to 49 percent in this year's third quarter, down  from 58 percent in quarter two  Phil       Yes      Henry      Thank you, Henry  Steve      Thank you, Steve  Paul      Thank you, Paul  Phil      Phil, do you have any particular reaction to the housing outlook in   the forecast?      Thank you  Chuck      Chuck, that comment you mentioned is in here--that they're not   only pessimistic for the general economy but are now becoming more so for their own [businesses]      Thank you  Nancy      Aha!  So there's been a leak      Thank you, Nancy  Bob      Thank you, Bob  Willis      Thank you, Willis  Dave      Thank you, Dave  Bones      Thank you, Bones  Our clean-up hitter, Larry      The [responses to the] Conference Board's survey are confidential,   so it has no effect on the stock market  When the executive speaks publicly he must say his  company is going to do well     Thank you, Larry  I must say that I appreciate everyone's cooperation This has been the   most cogent set of comments in the briefest time that we've had  So we must be setting a new  record  I commend you all; you may get the Congressional Medal of Honor if you keep this up!   May I summarize?  Didn't I hear a consensus that seemed to show very few significant variations  from the staff [forecast]?  And I would say the consensus of the balance would be a little slower  growth and a little more inflation--with some a little more in either direction  That's a very helpful  rundown  Does anybody have any additional remarks?       And the portfolio is rolling over from other sources of funds      We may have to knock off those certificates  Larry, you had a   question?      I take the fifth      Let me make a couple of brief comments, but I really think this   belongs in our monetary discussion because we could spend the whole meeting on this  But let me  just observe a couple of things  One, when I came here six months ago the outlook for the growth  of the economy in real terms for the current calendar year was 47 percent  The staff projection is  now 35  I would say that one of the main forces in that reduction has been monetary policy  So,  have we had any positive contributions to the slowing of the forces of inflation?  I would say there  has been a conscious effort, Larry  I would say, in the argument that the Federal Reserve should  not be left to do it alone, that the fiscal plan for stimulus in the next fiscal year has been changed by  $20 billion less stimulus  I would have to say that’s substantive  Maybe some of you would argue  for more or less but I would have to say that these are substantive consequences of the exercise of  monetary policy in pointing out the dangers of monetary policy and getting, therefore, a response  from the Administration and from the Congress to spread the burden         9/19/78            18    So I think in isolation we are suffering from the inflation buildup over twelve years and in   my opinion some misguided steps over twelve years  If we think we have been able to turn it as  much as I have just described in six months, in terms of the outlook and the mix of things, I  wouldn't exactly be critical  And I would be very cautious to restrain the system more in the face  of the pessimistic comments we already have and [precipitate] a recession just to make us all feel  that we have done something more  I don't think that would contribute enough to solving the  problem  You know, we are already down to growing at or below the trend line  Really, is there  more that we can do short term?  And don't we have to live through the cycle?  I don't know  We'll  come back to this in the monetary policy [discussion]  John, did you have a final comment?       Vintage mania, I would say      Actually, this was reported as being milder than expected        Let’s [cover that] perhaps in the general discussion  And before   the break, let’s cover the domestic open market operations  We have a report on operations, I see,  from Paul Meek       [Secretary’s note This question was asked during the statement]    You said 14 to what?      Thank you, Paul  Let me first get the routine business out of the   way and then move on to the secondary  Routine is just to ratify the transactions of the Desk since  the last meeting  Paul made a voluminous report, I believe, available to you  Are there any  questions or comments or may we have a motion for approval?     SPEAKER(?)  So moved       9/19/78            19    SPEAKER(?)  Second      It has been moved and seconded  Discussion?   All in favor, say   “aye”  Opposed?  So voted     The second point you made, Paul, was the temporary increase in the authorization--to raise   [the limit] on the change in the open position over the period stated      You said temporary  I understand temporary to mean what in   terms of time?      [Until] the next meeting  All right  Steve, do you have any   comment on that particular question?      On that particular question, does any member have a question or   comment or concern?      Well, we need a motion to approve that increase, which will run to   the next meeting      Any further discussion?  All in favor, “aye”  Opposed?  So voted   Now, are there any questions or comments on the report that Paul has given?  Yes, John      There's still quite a bit of liquidity waiting for that time, isn't   there? So it may take a considerable time--      Henry      Chuck      Well, thank you for your report  We will now take a break for   coffee and rest and come back and finish off the meeting     [Coffee break]      All right now, Larry, I expect you to make prudent monetary   policy since you raised the subject  Let's hear from Steve Axilrod      Thank you very much  Let me call your attention to a couple of   figures on pages 6 and 7 in the Bluebook  On page 7 you see the September estimate for M1 is in  the 10-1/2 range--108 or 104 depending on the alternative  And it’s in the 6 percent range in  October, according to the Board staff's estimate  That means about an 8-1/2 percent growth in M1  because of the strong growth in September, which is already pretty much a reality  And the  projection is that there would be a considerable reduction of growth rates in October  Now, the  New York Bank, as I understand it--Alan, you can correct me--is estimating slightly different  figures  They are looking at 8-1/2 or so in September--a lower rate in September--and are looking  at 7 percent--a slightly higher rate--in October, for an average of about 8 percent  So the averages  between the two views of New York and the Board would be 8 percent in New York and 8-1/2  percent at the Board      That's the situation we are looking at because of the strong growth in the aggregates in   September  For that reason, it would take a phenomenally low growth in October to bring the  2-month average rate very low because if you start off with either 8-1/2 or 10 you are already up  there pretty high  It seems to me, therefore, that we have somewhat of a dilemma because we need  to set ranges for growth and we are somewhat constrained by the existing strong figures in  September  My general view is that a federal funds rate range of 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 would probably be  appropriate as the next step in our efforts to meet the targets  I think the 8 percent bottom of the  range is too low, considering the unlikelihood of any need for or desirability of easing  And I think  it is premature to go to 9 on the upside until we see more of what's happening     As to the ranges for M1 and M2, given the figures that I have just indicated to you, if you   place New York at 8 percent as your guide and bracket that somewhat you see where we're  heading If you take the Board's 8-1/2 and bracket it you see the kind of problem  Just how we  should deal with that is a bit of a difficulty  It probably means we need a range of 6 to 10 or 6 to 9  percent or something like that on M1     Well, with those introductory comments--and I will come back to perhaps some summary   comments when we've heard from all of you--I would like to run through the Committee  First, I’ll       9/19/78            22  ask for Vice Chairman Paul Volcker's comments and then go alphabetically through the  Committee’s voting members and then the other Presidents       Please, we need to clean up our language      Thank you, Paul  Ernie Baughman      Thank you, Ernie  Phil Coldwell      Thank you, Phil  Dave Eastburn      Thank you, Dave  Steve Gardner      Well, the acoustics aren't that good and I am having difficulty too    So if all of you get up and speak into your mike we'd all hear you  So now reciprocate      If we have a massive outflow into savings, we will be right for the   wrong reasons for the first time      Thank you, Steve  Phil Jackson      Thank you, Phil  Now Chuck      Thank you, Chuck  Nancy      Thank you, Nancy  That's what I call a very tactful cop out,   Nancy  You are not going to get off the hook  You are going to have to give your aggregates          Okay, Henry  Mark Willes      I probably have made two or three you could agree with!      And what midpoint, Mark?  What would you do immediately?      All right, thank you  Willis      All right  John Balles      Thank you, John  Bob Black      Thank you, Bob  Roger      Thank you, Roger  Bones         9/19/78            29    Thank you  Bob Mayo      Thank you, Bob  Frank Morris      Thanks, Frank  Larry, you not only drew the clean-up position on   the circle this morning, but alphabetically you do too  It would not be inappropriate, nonetheless,  to stay within the time limit          9/19/78            31    Larry, before I respond to that, I'm not sure we understood your   federal funds rate range  Did you intend--      Let me say that I certainly welcome inputs at the next meeting,   from those who care to do so, on how you see the strategy for reducing aggregates growth without  bringing on a recession  I wonder if we really want the rigidity of written papers  I can see that  that might become a situation where when we're in a collegial atmosphere and we're trying to  consult with each other, and I'm not sure that the papers are so necessary  The input could be made  verbally, I would think, and we'd probably be more comfortable that way       We do have the problem, however we strategize, that the way the Federal Reserve operates   at this point is to give directives to the Desk, and the Desk needs something to guide it  That's why  we get into numbers, unfortunately  If we give the Desk vague comments on this, we're in trouble       9/19/78            32   I think our struggle with numbers is not because we like a numbers game but because we need to  give the staff at the Desk some way to govern their actions that is responsive to a directive from  this Committee       I understand  I regret that we have to deal with this great matrix    Now I have to make sense of this complicated matrix and see if we can strike a consensus  But at  the next meeting we're going to be setting long-term ranges and I certainly would welcome inputs  on how we can restrain the growth of the aggregates without triggering recession  Because there  are nineteen of us, we have to realize that 19 times X minutes means that could take all day, so I  think we have to be able to verbalize that with some conciseness  So I caution you to come  prepared with your two pages but condense it to one paragraph when you recite it  In fact, prepare  thirty pages for your private use      Let me see if I can go through this  In the first place, I'm not sure whether Ernie Baughman   had a move to the midpoint on his preference  Your range was 8-1/4 to 8-3/4, but did you intend an  8-1/2 percent midpoint?       And Dave Eastburn?      And Steve, the same for you?  I don't think you expressed--      In that case, let me see if I can recite [a summary]  On M1 I'll   take the bottom number first  Will you keep score?  One bottom number is 3; three bottom  numbers are 4; three bottom numbers are 5; and four bottom numbers are 6  Does that add up to  the [number of] voting members?         So the brackets go in that range  If you stuck with the largest   number, you would have 6 to 9  Is that correct?  Yes, the 6 to 9 would be the most prevalent one   On M2, I see one 5-1/2; five 6s; one 7; two 7-1/2s; and an 8  And I didn't give one; I just didn't get  around to it  Let's see  On the up side we have two 9-1/2s; four 10s; two 11s; one 11-1/2; and one  12  Again, there you get a 6 to 10 percent range as the mode  It looks like we have much more  agreement on fed funds  I'm talking now of the voting members, as you know  There’s a similar  pattern--it isn't far off--on the nonvoting members  It looks like a very strong consensus; eight out  of the twelve members are at 8-1/4 to 8-3/4  And the 8-1/2 appears in eight also  There are two       9/19/78            33  midpoints lower than 8-1/2--at 8-3/8--and one at 8-3/4  I should add them up  It’s eleven because,  Paul, you didn't give us a midpoint       Okay  Well, that makes nine at 8-1/2  So, one could say that this   looks like an M1 range of 5 or 6 on the low side and more like 9 on the up side  And it looks like  M2 is kind of at 6 to 10  And we have 8-1/4 to 8-3/4, with a move to 8-1/2 as a fairly broad  consensus  What is your pleasure?  Let me first see if we can have not a vote but an indication  Suppose it were 6 to 9, 6 to 10, 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 and an 8-1/2 midpoint  And I gather there was a  consensus for an aggregates directive, assuming that was the case  How many voting members  could support that?  Five  How many can not support it?  Four  Would someone like to change it?   I think some of the votes are going to go one way and some the other       What do you do if you go to 5 to 9?  You increase the probability   that there will be an 8-3/4 percent funds rate      A 7-1/2 midpoint      4 to 8?  I thought Paul said 5 to 9      Well, I'll take any series of straw votes you want  You want to   strike M1 at 4 to 8?  How many want to support that?      You have to hold your hands higher      Four      Let me run the meeting, if you don't mind  How many would be   willing to accept 5 to 9?  I count one, two, three, four, five, six  Is that right?  And apparently there  is a very large consensus on the funds rate, as I gather  I may be kidding myself  It's funny  We  add up the numbers, and people go for numbers that are different from what they indicate; it's hard  to make this matrix work  Let’s go one step further  If you had 5 to 9 and 7 to 11 and the same  interest rates, how many are able to support that?  Five  This doesn't make any--       All right, let’s try 5 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2  How many are able   to support that?  I need hands held high  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven  All right  Let's run  a vote then on a directive that would have an M1 range of 5 to 9, an M2 range of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2,  and a fed funds range of 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 with a move in the near term to 8-1/2, and an aggregates  directive  Mr Axilrod, do you have any comment--besides agony?       Anybody else?  Alan?      Let’s read the proposal  Does everyone understand it? The   proposal is 5 to 9 for M1; 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 for M2; a fed funds range of 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 with a  midpoint of 8-1/2, and an aggregates directive  Let us call the roll       It's a vote of 10 to 2  Our next meeting, ladies and gentlemen, is   on October 17  Through arrangements of the management it will be here  There are two important  events that are about to take place  One is luncheon, during which we hope to discuss a number of  things, particularly the members with so-called equity and the fair competition in banking proposal  And, of course, there is a very important event at 230--a reception for Governor Teeters--which I  hope many of the staff will be attending  Unless there are further comments or discussion, we will  adjourn          END OF MEETING        "
873,1978-10-17,"  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen  We have a busy agenda  today, so I will ask your indulgence to take care of those matters we can expeditiously in order to  leave as much time as we can for the weightier subject  I'll remind everyone that we do have a  luncheon planned after the FOMC meeting  As usual, we have a number of items to discuss of  importance  But without taking more time this morning, let us proceed quickly with the routine  part of the agenda  First is the approval of minutes of the meeting held on September 19  Those  have been circulated  Are there any comments or corrections?  Hearing none, those are approved  The second item is foreign currency operations, and first we have a report on the operations since  the last meeting by Scott Pardee  Scott      Normally I would say thank you, but I'm not sure I will  I  appreciated your report  Any questions?  Henry       Chuck       Larry Roos       Dave       Phil       Ladies and gentlemen, we need to ratify the transactions since the  previous meeting; [a report] has been circulated  Is there any dissent or objection to ratification?   Hearing none, that is approved and we move to consideration of the Manager's recommendation on  foreign currency operations  Alan Holmes         10/17/78 4                You'd like approval on the renewals?       Is there any objection?  Hearing [none], that is approved  And,  Alan, while you have the floor let us move on  I believe you and Scott have written us a memo  regarding those discussions to amend the swaps, and I believe you'll report to us on the  recommendations  Excuse me, Phil       You’re talking about domestic, aren't you?       I think we increased it from $4 billion to $5 billion on the  domestic  You're thinking of the intermeeting limit on activity in foreign exchange       It's a $300 million limit between meetings       Let’s see how it goes       [MR HOLMES]  On September 29, Mr Chairman, we transmitted to the Committee a  memorandum on Dr Gleske's proposals for revision of our swap arrangement [with the  Bundesbank] which, along with other swap agreements, will be up for renewal in December  I  really have nothing to add to that memorandum unless there are some questions  Then I'd like to  go on with the recommendations if there are no questions       Let's have your recommendations  Then we'll have questions and  [discuss] the recommendations       There were four proposals to the Committee       You recommend that we go ahead--       And defer the other two at this point because of the problems that  they would raise in terms of current perceptions of our swap arrangements       We would defer that       All right  The proposition for consideration is whether there is  general concurrence on the two you recommend and whether there are instructions on the other two  to work in that direction  I'd like to put it into context at this meeting that, whatever we decide, we  authorize the Manager to negotiate these technical changes subject to the final approval of the       10/17/78 6             Foreign Currency Subcommittee  I don't think we want to approve the language since we all  haven't seen it; but we can’t put it before us at this point because you haven't negotiated it       So that would be how we would proceed technically  Are there  questions on those proposals?       Both of these are asymmetrical  The 50-50 sharing happens only  when we draw; when they draw, they take 100 percent and the interest rate based on our bill rate   [For us] it’s just reverse from what they do when they draw  Any questions or comments?  Any  viewpoints?       Let's first see--since there doesn't seem to be a groundswell of  comments--if we can have your concurrence on the first two recommendations  Is there any  objection to those two recommendations that Alan has made?  Hearing none, we'll instruct you [to  proceed]     Now, how about the other two, which Alan says the Treasury isn't too excited about?  And  thanks to Henry's discussions, these can be put off at this point  My own inclination is to believe  that at an appropriate time, we probably should work to change those [terms] to make them  symmetrical  I really think that's the direction we should trend toward over time  I don't know  when it should be done  Paul       Phil       It would historically; we don't know the future  Henry       Sometimes it's the other way, yes  But it's the most logical  expectation  Chuck       Chuck, may I interrupt for a technical question?  I may  misunderstand, but as I understand it, under the charter of the IMF we're obligated to intervene to  counter disorderly markets       I understand that's a debate, but when that debate comes up it's  often just as much our urging somebody else to do something as somebody else urging us to do  something       I fear the converse  If we're urging other countries to intervene, I  don't want to see us taking 50-50 risks with them  That's the problem  And I think we've urged just  as much intervention  In fact, the amazing thing is that the obligation is for the weak currency to  intervene to counter disorderly markets and actually the intervention for the dollar mainly has been  by other central banks  We have really pushed the burden on to others who have intervened  directly, taking 100 percent of the risk  I think it's very hard to argue, therefore, that we should  [take only 50 percent of the risk]  It seems to me that [the argument] breaks down a little       An unfair one     Let me ask this because I think we've spent the time we can spend on this issue today, since  it's not up for action immediately  Chuck's comments are consistent with the comments I've heard  from him since I've been here--so he at least has a consistency though I will not characterize it--but  I've heard other sentiments  Considering Chuck’s comments, would the general consensus be to  continue to look toward this with sympathy--at a proper time to go on a symmetrical basis on these  matters?  I see a lot of heads moving this way  Besides Chuck, are there many reservations?       Oh yes        Well, we will continue to give you that guidance, Alan and Scott  Thank you very much  And, Phil, if it's still all right, we could put off your question until we come  to Peter's report  Is that all right?  Fine  Then we'll move on to [agenda] item 3, which is the  economic and financial situation and outlook  Jim, you can lead off here     MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN  [Statements--see Appendix]         10/17/78 10                Thank you very much, Jim, Jerry, and Ted  We are open for  general questions for the first part of our follow-up  After a period of questions, I would appreciate  another go-around where I would ask each of you to comment on any variation [in your views]  from the staff projections       John Balles       Excuse me, Chuck, I didn't mean to cut you off       John Balles       Bones Kimbrel       Bones, was he talking overall or as to some particular segment of  their business?        It sounds out of touch doesn't it, Jim?         10/17/78 13                It could be one company  Mark Willes       It's got to be proved throughout the cycle       Bob Mayo       Well, ladies and gentlemen, according to my reading of the  Greenbook the staff has projected for the third quarter of ’78 to the third quarter of ’79 a real GNP  growth of 3-1/2 percent, a gross business product fixed-weighted price index of 7-1/2 percent, and  an average rate of unemployment in the third quarter of 1979 of 59 percent  I don't think it will be  necessary for us to ask you to give precise figures on those three; if you could give us any       10/17/78 15             significant changes, qualitative or quantitative, that would help us sense whether we're  [unintelligible]  In keeping track of where I started last time--and it's my determination that we do  better when we start with Presidents--I want to start with Larry and come down this way this time  We started with Roger last time around       Unemployment?       Thank you very much  Bones       You're different in both directions from Larry  Thank you  Dave       Willis       Bitterness?       Translated into what?       Bob       Nancy       Thank you  Chuck       Thank you, Chuck  Phil       Thank you       We all remember what that was         10/17/78 18                Thank you  Henry       Phil       Frank       Ernie       John       Mark       Bob         10/17/78 21                Roger        Bones, do you have any comments you want to make?       I'm not in the loop, so I can't share them  I think they have gone  underground with their program after considerable discussion early in the year about the  framework of what might be done  I'd just comment on a couple of things  I think we are now in  an era when labor--skilled labor--is less mobile  Therefore, when you have a buildup in the aircraft  industry, you'll have shortages of skilled labor in Connecticut building engines and in Seattle  building airframes  In the past you were able to move people much more quickly; now they don't  want to sell their homes and families don't want to move, for all kinds of [reasons]  Also, since I  remember going into business in 1956, [based on] every meeting I have been to there is nobody  who wants to work at dishwashing  So Chicago is up-to-date; that hasn't changed in 22 years      My own view of the situation is that I would be within the range of the staff’s projection  I  have generally through the year felt that the staff was on the high side--I thought we were coming  down from the forecast earlier and we have been doing so--because I thought we would restrain the  economy deliberately  I still think [that]; they're closer to my view now, although I would put it at  3 to 3-1/2 on GNP, 7-1/2 to 8 on prices, and probably 6 to 6-1/4 on unemployment  The real issue  is up to us     Incidentally, Mark, you were talking about how businessmen behave  Was it behavioral or  rational expectations or what do you call it?  When I was in business, I never gave up business and  had my overhead sitting on me unabsorbed because I had somebody tell me that I voluntarily  shouldn't increase prices so much  I don't think businessmen behave that way because their profits  are far more destroyed by leaving part of the present plant and capacity idle rather than sell their  product  I just don't believe that's the way they behave       So, you may find other reasons why they ignore the President's  program and break it, or you may find reasons that they can sanction it and keep them in it  In my  company we did business with the government and if they could sanction us and hold us, we would  have gone out and worked like the dickens to get more unit sales and absorb our overhead and  improve our margin and maintain our profitability  I think just the reverse psychology would have  existed  We could not give up our long-term market position in major products--sophisticated  products--because of a 1-year situation  We would never have stopped our capital spending or  research or anything over such a phenomenon  I don't believe businessmen behave that way       We sit here and talk about these things technically, but I've just come from the business  council and, while they don't like these things, there's no pessimism around  These are the big       10/17/78 23             businesses  They look for a continuation of relatively modest growth, but they look at it a little  differently than we do around this table  My view is that the real future of this time period is up to  us  You know Pogo said “I have met the enemy and he is us”  And the gist of the question is   Will we, in our exuberance to prove our theories, trigger a recession?  Because once you trip the  psychology of the buyers or scare them, you drive them underground, as happened in ’74  You go  within months [from] boom and worries about inflation to a deep, deep recession where you have  strung out inflation to 6 percent and you have it back in two years to 8 percent because you haven't  accomplished [anything] fundamental  What we need is a steadiness of purpose  Inflation built up  over twelve years; we are going to have to wring it out over five to seven years  If we think we can  do it in a quarter or two quarters, we are fooling ourselves  My worry is that once again we will  use high amplitude action to deal with what really requires a dampening of the process  The high  amplitude action we got in the early ’70s was not perceived as solving the problem       Larry, I was not present at any FOMC meeting in 1973 or 1974,  but I assume the Federal Reserve didn't deliberately intend to [precipitate] a recession  I sat in  Boston in ’73 and ’74  And yet we had the most severe one we have had  So I just have to say that  my own experience is that the leader of economic policy will tell you all these wonderful things  and that in three months it will turn around  And in three months people have gotten scared so they  stop buying  And inventories that today look very balanced are suddenly excessive  If there is a  drop of buying we suddenly have to have rebates to get the automobiles off the floor  They are  being built now on the basis of selling 10 million a year  If consumers start buying at a rate of 7  million a year, you have a crisis And that can happen         10/17/78 24                SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman       I don't think this is the time to debate  I would say only one thing   We have pulled off a minor miracle and I think we should take a little more confidence ourselves in  pulling off that minor miracle of contributing to a slowdown in the economy on a balanced  condition  The decision to authorize the money market certificate was a decision that cost us in  these theories because we have maintained funds in the money supply that would have flowed out  of the money supply and made us look better--if you want to measure by aggregate growth--if we  had not done that  So by trying to maintain housing, we have worked against ourselves--in my  view properly--because we now have a balanced economy in which nothing is dragging us down  into a recession unless we find the place to crack it      The miracle is to have the Wallich soft landing  And I would merely say to you that to find  that soft landing, I don't know how much more we have to do  But I know that since we have  seven years to do it, we'd do better to gently come at the problem rather than whack it too hard on  the head and be sorry  Because once you trigger the point where the public gets scared and stops  buying, you can't reverse it; [economic activity] will go [down]       I understand you don't  I only look at the nominal interest rates and  I know that we are getting very near the point where we will have results in the economy from  interest rates  That's the way people behave  We can have a theory all we want  We can do it as  gradually as we want but if we have to get 12 percent interest rates to do it, look at the chart over  there  When we get that, that's when the recession comes because people get scared; rightly or  wrongly, they do  And they did very quickly in that time period  That spike, that Mount Everest,  stands out there as a warning to us  It has nothing to do with how gradually you try to [reduce the  growth of the] money supply  It's how much you affect these other things     I'm just expressing my personal opinion  I think if we try to continue to accomplish this  slowing in the rate of growth in money supply by driving up interest rates, we are going to trigger a  reduction of consumption and buying and spending that will send us into a recession  And I think  we will be back with $100 million federal deficits  And we won't have accomplished very much  following that exercise before we have the highest federal deficits we have ever had, taking away  all the monetary restraint that possibly could have been put into the system       We need to take a break and come back after coffee to pursue this     [Coffee break]       Ladies and gentlemen, we have a busy hour ahead, with a couple  of small matters to take care of  We're supposed to at this time look at the long-run ranges for the  monetary aggregates  And we have, of course, complications because of the automatic transfer  service being available effective November 1, a short period from now, unless there's a court  injunction or stay  I don't know if our Counsel is here or not  Tom, any report on the court action?       You might all turn to page 5 of your Bluebook  Steve, if you  would lead off with your comments, I would appreciate it       Completely in vain, as I recall       Thank you, Steve  There are a couple of points I would make on  the long-run ranges  I could be persuaded to drop M1 but, on balance, I suspect that it might be  better if we retain it in some form  I might point out that over the weekend Congress did pass the  modified Humphrey-Hawkins bill, and I expect the President to sign it  That bill includes an  amendment of the Federal Reserve Act to deal with our reporting to Congress on monetary policy        10/17/78 28             We had worked out the language with the Senate Banking Committee and it survived, as I  understand it  It involves a process, fortunately, that keeps our cognizance with the Banking  Committees and doesn't begin to confuse it with the Banking and Joint Economic Committee and  other committees, which would make our life even a little more difficult because we'd constantly be  in cross battles of the committees  But instead it provides for us to report twice a year instead of  four times a year  Instead of asking us to [provide] independent estimates of what the economic  plan should be, it merely asks us to comment on elements of the economic outlook from the  Administration's plan submitted to Congress and to indicate in the first report what the FOMC's  intent is as to monetary policy over the calendar year  That first report would be February 20th and  that would cover our response to the President's proposed plan and give our indicated monetary  policy for the calendar year of 1979      On July 20 we would testify again, giving our update of the monetary policy intended for  1979 and a first look at our policy intended for 1980  In all cases the language says that nothing in  those reports would bind us to stick to that policy if circumstances changed and we felt that we  should change it  It doesn't lock us into the policy; it's language that we've seen before, but I think  it does get us into a fairly comfortable format, compared to earlier proposals which would have  required us to [give] independent  recommendations as to economic policy and to report to various  and sundry committees  So that's the situation      That being so, we are going to have somewhat of a different outlook in our presentation and  preparation for next February 20  In the meantime, I think we might be wise to maintain a form of  M1 for this go-around until we [know] more  And I tend to agree with Steve that we ought to have  a range that's wide enough, given the uncertainties involved with both the ATS and the President's  program, so we could with reasonable expectations make it realistic  I don't know whether I  completely agree with the 2 to 6 range; it seems awfully wide  I could live with something a little  narrower, but it's reasonable  I tend to agree that we [should retain the ranges for] M2 and M3  There might be an increase in M2 because of shifts from thrifts into banks with automatic transfers  but we don't know how much or what  So I would tend to leave those until we see how that works  I think we have a wide enough range that if the President's program is effective, we'll still be within  it in terms of it dampening inflation  And I just believe all in all that it's fairly reasonable  Now, 5  to 7-1/2 is anybody's guess on M1+, but I think it's a reasonable place to begin this  experimentation Chuck, I believe you had--       Thank you  May I add, Chuck, one other thing?  And that is that I  think we shouldn't mix this up with what we may want to do on the short range       We may or may not want to use M1, so I think this is a different  issue  I don't want to get involved in that now, but it seems to me for this purpose of testifying--on  November 16, is it Steve?       Now, I would caution one thing  We have quite a bit of time  between now and the time of that event  If we should have a court decision adverse to us--a stay or  something else--I think we have to come back to the FOMC and not go to the Senate Committee  with something that's out of date  So I think we have to adopt something today subject to change if  anything drastic happens that would make us want to fit different ranges to the outlook       Yes, we have a lot of problems       There won't be the quarterly updates  Maybe there will be a new  one every year  It could be a mid-course correction  Before we start the round questions, Paul, you  may have something you would like to comment on this       Mark Willes       I'm confused  If you take the other side, and you have 1-1/2 as  another probability, you're talking about an 8 percent M1       Bob Mayo       Phil Jackson       Phil Coldwell       Chuck       Especially since we're not giving up the other measure, so we are  not losing--       We'll keep M2 and M3 also       You could pull in some funds from the thrifts but probably the  magnitude is not that enormous       At this stage  John Balles       I'd like to see us get the long-term ranges set and we'll come to the  short-term  On whether we use M1 at all, I think we can have a different decision there, John   We're dealing with this requirement to report to Congress and give these ranges and there are quite  a few people who want to speak on this  I hope there's going to be a [chance] for us to focus on  this  I'd like to get a straw vote as to whether people want to continue to put out some number on  M1 or not and then maybe we can at least know what we're talking about  If there's an  overwhelming consensus, we can cut this [discussion] a little short and we can get at that  How  many of you would like to continue to use M1, [given] the factors we've heard at this stage? Seems  like a pretty strong preponderance  So that means [we need make a decision on] what number   And how many of you would like to publish as a collateral item M1+?       A memo item       Yes  We put these things in and the associated [developments] in  M1+ would be in the footnote, yes  I gather there was a pretty strong [consensus] for that       It makes no difference to me  I don't know  We normally go  through the M1, M2, and M3 and then say the [associated range for] bank credit       You realize, John, there is no weight associated with these       Yes, it could be handled in a way that does not [characterize] it as a  substitute target or tolerance range  Maybe we ought to try some language on you  I think we'll  have time to circulate this before I testify, which is quite a ways off       M1, I assume, would be given as a normal tolerance range  We’d  have ranges for M1, M2, and M3; we’d treat bank credit as we normally do; and then we'd have  some comment on M1+ by way of a [memo item]        We're going to have to revise our targets if the ATS is [not put into  effect]  We'll have to have a telephonic meeting and change our targets if ATS is blocked  That's  what we'll have to do       SPEAKER(?)  But we would not have M1+ in the directive?         No, M1+ wouldn't be one of the [ranges stated there]; that's what I  sensed everybody wanted       I think so  Let’s do it again  An M1 range is to be stated but in a  downgraded mode  Is that what everybody's agreeable to?       M1 downgraded--not eliminated but downgraded       A textual comment to qualify it [along the lines of] This has  uncertainties associated with it because we haven't been able to assess the effects of ATS  There’s  no weight on this one; this is the long-run range  This is just each individual one  So I think all  you do with M1 is say that this range is set with the recognition that we have uncertainty because  we don't know for sure the effect of ATS  Yes, Mark       Well, I'm delighted to do it any way you want because I don't think  it’s going to shake the world one way on the other whether we just leave it cold or comment about  it       I have no strong feeling  I'll do what the Committee wants  But  let’s resolve it one way or the other  There's no problem in M2 and M3  There is no problem,  apparently, in putting in M1+ as some sort of range with a comment  First, how many of you want  a qualifying statement about M1 that would be of the nature of indicating that the range has been  set with some degree of uncertainty about the effect of ATS?  How many of you just want to state it  with no comment?  So it looks like we'll put in a qualifying statement       Yes sir, Roger       Disintermediation could affect it       I'll go back to our list; Larry       Well, Larry, I think we can't wait until January when we're making  the decision; we will have to make the decision at the February meeting  I don't know how our  schedule fits with the 20th but that being [the date of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony], I do think  we do need some pre-discussion  We can't come up to the wire without this being resolved   Chuck, do you think the Subcommittee on the Directive could provide the Committee with some  inputs so we get a chance to kick this around?       Can we have something in December?  Then there will be time       I think we need some lead time  I think Larry is absolutely right   None of us can digest this in one meeting or one session  We want to go back to our staffs and  discuss it  Paul       Well, let's see if Frank Morris has any more on that       What we need is to return to the halcyon days when the Central  Bank operated in secrecy       Roger, have you covered your point?       Okay,  Dave Eastburn       Well, we have heard a number of comments  Let me read you [my  summary]  I think we have settled that we will publish [a range for] M1  I think that was pretty  well recommended  We've had a rather large plurality in favor of footnoting or indicating  something on M1+, but now we have heard some contrary arguments  Shall we reexamine that  question?  And we will first assume [we’re talking about] M1+ as now defined, Chuck, so we don't  get too many confusing things here  Do you still want to use M1+?  I don't think we get bound by  it  I think we can come up in January with whatever we want  I wouldn't feel personally bound by  the precedent  But do you want to do it as some sort of textual indication at this point or not?  Once  again, let’s have a show of hands on yes  We had a large number a moment ago       Yes  [I count] 10  That's a pretty large percentage  We weren't  counting  How many don't?   Let's see, that’s six  Now let's have the voting members  How many  would like to use it?   [It’s] seven; we have a plurality  Okay       Yes, okay  Now we’ll come back to substance, Paul, and get our  ranges set in three minutes       I don't think inflation has accelerated since I have been at the  Board, to put it bluntly  It has gone down since I've been at the Board  It was 10 percent; now it’s  8 percent  So I'm not sure that I can share those sentiments  Since I've been here I’ve been  presiding over a decline [in inflation] of 2 percentage points       Well, you fellows fouled it up before!  Nancy and I didn't       Let's try something, Paul  We do have a time constraint and  everyone has this in mind  Suppose we take Steve's suggestions first  He had 2 to 6 for M1 and  maintaining 6-1/2 to 9 for M2 and 7-1/2 to 10 for M3  So that M2 and M3 are the present ranges  and M1 would be 2 to 6  I don't want to cut off the options, but let's just see  Let's just ask right  now for the voting members to show their hands if they would be amenable to that kind of position  at this point  Five       Yes, that's the trouble  How many did you count?       Try it again  On the voting members how many would accept the  proposal Steve has made?  Six  Okay, how many could not?  It couldn't be more than five  Three   Phil, you didn't vote, did you?       Pardon?       Well, we are going to come back if there's no ATS       If there's no ATS, we are going to have to have a conference call  and decide what we do with the ranges       We would have had the range too [low]  We would be outside our  range  We wouldn't get it down to 6 percent  That's the risk of the 2 to 6 percent       All right, let's call the roll on that  I think we have enough, so let's  call the roll  We are doing M1 at 2 to 6, but with the understanding that we will have a new  meeting to decide this by telephone in case we have a block on ATS       Yes, it’s qualified  We agreed to that before  All right I'll vote for  it       Okay we have the ranges established  Thank you very much  Let's  go to the next item--domestic open market operations and a report by Mr Sternlight  You have  been waiting patiently, Peter       Thank you very much  I believe our legislation passed over the  weekend and included the collateral matter  Did you know that?       So we thought we'd give you that good news       Ken will report to us on these legislative matters at lunch  I think  that will help us a bit  All right, we need the ratification of the transactions since the previous  meeting; [a report on them] has been circulated  Unless I hear an objection, we will consider those  ratified  Hearing none, we so order      The next item is comments by our Economist on prospective financial relationships  Steve,  can you pull this one off?       Steve, thank you  I happened to come to the same conclusion in  the sense that I think we're dealing with considerable uncertainties and I would prefer to have a  money market directive under these conditions  However, I don't find any one of these [Bluebook  alternatives] too attractive  My feeling would be that we should have a fed funds rate of 8-3/4 to 9  percent  I wouldn't like to see it go below 8-3/4 in present conditions and I'm not prepared, [given]       10/17/78 44             what we've been doing in the past month with substantial increases in rates, to see it go beyond 9  percent       As to the ranges, if it's too dangerous to use just M2, then I think we really are going to have  to leave the Desk a bit more latitude in looking at these various movements  I don't know what to  pick for M1, just to pick something  But for M2, because there might be some shifts of funds from  thrifts into bank savings accounts to get the ATS, I would tend to use the 6 to 10 percent range   M1+ I don't feel that strongly about  Again, I'm just guessing  I'd like to hear from other members,  but my inclination would be to start with 8-3/4 to 9 percent and a money market directive and M2  at 6 to 10  I don't know how the others [unintelligible]  Let's run down the list and see  Paul,  would you like to express your view?       Ernie       Okay  Phil       Dave       8-3/4 to 9-1/4?       5 to 9  Murray, did you get Dave's?       Alternative 2  Thank you  Phil Jackson       Nancy       Okay, thank you  Henry       Mark       What's your bottom on that Mark?       Okay  Willis       Alternative 2?       Okay, thank you  Next, John Balles       Thank you, John  Bob Black       You'd rise above principle also       Thank you, Bob  Roger Guffey       Thank you, Roger  Bones       Thank you, Bones  Bob Mayo       Frank       Thank you, Frank  Lawrence, are you clean-up hitter again?       I missed your M1  What was it?       Well, thank you all  Let's see what we have  A mess  Well,  looking at the voting members, the consensus on the federal funds range is 8-3/4 to 9-1/4, I would  say  There are a few 9-1/2s and there are a few 9s, but we don't have a majority of 9s without  getting some 9-1/4s  On M2, it's about split between 6 and 10 and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  Let's forget M1  for the moment and come back to that later  I can't really tell, there were so few people who really  had an opinion  It sounds like the Partee dictum of a 7 percent cap might be as good [as any in  terms of the] consensus that occurred, although there were some who were slightly tighter  What?       Well, you may be right because not many people really put a  number down  So there were several drops and several passing  What is your pleasure?       Oh yes, I think the money market directive is clearly the  consensus And I would say using M1 in some way was a consensus, too   M2, if you want to split  it, it's 5-3/4 to 9-3/4, obviously  Have you ever done that?  And on the fed funds rate nobody is  below 8-3/4 and [most have the top at either] 9 or 9-1/4  You [suggested] having the cap put on it,  and there were two or three 9-1/2s       Well, of those who expressed [a view on] that, five expressed  going to 9  That's a little less than half of the eleven [voting members]   The others didn't [say]   One of them was 8-7/8 and that was Phil Jackson  Nobody else expressed much--       What was yours, Ernie?       We're going to have to try some go-arounds and see what we can  come up with  One thing we're going to probably [agree on], if you look at the consensus, [is] the  money market directive  So let’s forget that; everybody or a very large preponderance seems to  [prefer that]  I don't know of anyone who [favored] a monetary aggregates directive among the  voting members  Let's take the M1 at a cap of 7 percent  Let's take M2 at 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  And let's  take federal funds range at 8-3/4 to 9-1/4, going to 9 [promptly]  Let’s get a show of hands on that  directive     SPEAKER(?)  Just the voting members?       Just the voting members       M1, not to exceed 7; M2, 5-1/2 to 9-1/2; federal funds, 8-3/4 to  9-1/4, and going to 9  How many of the voting members would vote for that?  Six  That's a  majority isn't it?       You didn't vote in favor of this?       We need some compromise to get a broader consensus here  I  assume that the weight on M1 is not equal the way it usually is on this  I assume everybody kind of  agreed with that       I don't want to take an official vote because I'd like to have more  than a very thin majority  Paul, can't you see your way clear to this?  It's a very reasonable  proposition        Would you prefer a 6 to 10 on M2, and 6-1/2 on M1?         10/17/78 52                We have a majority for this proposition but I think it's too thin and  I'd like to see if we can gain some other support  Let's see  Paul didn't vote for it; Willis didn't vote  for it, Nancy didn't vote for it, and Mark didn't vote for it   Well, let's try another one just for a  second [For M1] a cap of 7; for M2 a range of 6 to 10; for federal funds, 8-3/4 to 9, with [a move  to] 8-7/8  How many would vote for that?  Three  Phil Jackson, did you vote for the other  proposition?       Let's just do it  If we had a cap of 6, and the others 5-1/2 to 9-1/2,  and 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 going to 9, how many would vote for that?  Seven  That got more votes than the  other one did  Here's my final proposition  I’ll give you a deal you can't turn down M1, a cap of  6-1/2; M2, 5-1/2 to 9-1/2; and fed funds, 8-3/4 to 9-1/4, going to 9  How many would vote for  that?       We could have that       We were already there last month  This month we're starting off  with a much lower base       10/17/78 53                  We’ll start out with 6-1/2 to see if we can get more than 7 votes       Come on, Willis, goodness gracious  All right let's call the roll on  my last and final offer 6-1/2, 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 moving to 9, money market directive,  and pray       I think it would have [unintelligible]  I don’t think you can watch  it and be guided       No one can [unintelligible]  If it gets up above 6-1/2 for M1, then- -        So I will vote for that          We'll have canceling dissents  Well, thank you very much  Next is  confirmation of the date of our next meeting, which is Tuesday November 21  Luncheon is next  I  have one other announcement  Yes       May I just ask a couple of questions?  If we were divided on the  effectiveness of this program, I'm thinking this could backfire on us--the fact that we're meeting  and it would become known       Then I would wonder, if we came out endorsing the program and  commenting on parts of it favorably and other parts of it unfavorably, whether we politicize the  FOMC  If we indicate that we really intend to take other kinds of actions that we haven't consulted  with the President about, it [might] be read as counter to his program and superseding his program       10/17/78 55             Would that get us into hot water?  I don't know  These are the kinds of things that I would be a  little concerned about     SPEAKER(?)  I think we all will       Yes, but there's two things, the FOMC and the Board of  Governors And if we're asked, do we opt to respond as a Board position or should it be ducked?   Or are they to be individual comments or what?  Those things I think have to be handled with great  care  Paul       I think the probability is just the reverse; I think the probability is  that he’s going to have a statement which says this is going to be so effective that monetary policy  can ease up       And a statement is likely to be touchy for us       Frankly, I think that we'd all be so wise if we’d learn after these  FOMC meetings not to take calls from the press  You have no obligation to answer calls from the  press  You get drawn into these individual comments that lead them to pick through and surmise  what we're doing  And I don't think the FOMC ought to come back in and get into a public debate  with anybody in Washington over whether somebody else’s policy will [lead] us to do A, B, C   [That’s my view] on that issue now   Now, the other issue is a broader one  If they say this will  make it possible for monetary policy to be easier, I sure wouldn't want to see us go into the street  the next day and say, “Oh no, we're going to tighten up”        No, I'd say that we would like to see neither       What I was about to say before I forget is that Larry Roos had  circulated a statement, which I got just before I came in here and didn't have a chance to read, and  he has asked that we put it into the record  So I wish you all would read it and it would be  officially in the record       What is going on, Steve, in terms of looking at the definitions of  money and the aggregates?       I don't want to duck the issue  I think it's a subject that needs  exploration and I assume the Committee has done it before  It came up when I was first  [appointed] to the Board of Governors  And the decision was--and I didn't have the  background--that no changes be made at that time  Now we're coming up with a lot of new  changes and I think we ought to restudy it       Let's not come up to our January and February meetings where  we're trying to decide on our new policies without some pre-thought because all of us need to  digest these things  They're too complicated and too difficult      Well, we have a 230 meeting with your Committee, John [Balles], and we might be a little  late     END OF MEETING      "
898,1978-11-21,"  Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your early attendance   It may turn out that you will like this arrangement and we will continue it in the future  There is  only one danger; I have found that Parkinson is right that work will expand to fill the [available]  time  So if we came in at eight o’clock, I'm sure you'd still talk until one o’clock regardless of my  admonitions  So maybe we'd better meet at eleven and that way we can shorten these meetings!     But we have this [early] meeting for a sad reason and that is, of course, because of the loss  of Steve Gardner who was certainly a gentle person and a wonderful colleague  I think we might  start our meeting, if you don't mind, by perhaps just standing for a moment of respect for Steve      [Moment of silence]       The first order of business is the approval of the minutes for the  actions at our meeting on October 17th  And all the intervening events are included, I believe  Is  that correct?       All right, are there any corrections or changes to the minutes?   Hearing none, they will stand approved       Next item Submitted to you on November 9 was a report of the examination of the System  Open Market Account  I believe all of you have received a copy  We need your acceptance of that  report  Are there any questions or comments you care to make?  Hearing none, we will record that  as accepted by the FOMC  Now we turn to foreign currency operations, and first is a report by  Scott Pardee on these operations since October 17       We don't want to settle for that  Thank you, Scott  Well, timing is  everything and the timing wasn't too bad  Now we've got to be sure that the Treasury promptly  issues some of the foreign currency denominated securities, which will allow resources for  intervention without expanding the money supply in other countries  That will be very popular and  will be a breakthrough of policy; it's as important as anything else we've accomplished and  exercised       Yes, of course  The amount we agreed on was up to $10 billion,  which would be [issued] over a year or so  In December they probably will issue two to three  billion in German marks through a private placement  And we're trying to encourage them to  place, probably before the middle of December, an issue of one or two billion Swiss francs at the     11/21/78              2  same time, and as promptly as possible a small yen issue just to establish the principle  Once it's  established, we're over the hump of the possibility of withdrawal pains and once it’s done I think  there is a psychological change in the Treasury  They now see this as a desirable instrument in  debt management and, therefore, I think we have crossed that [hurdle]--I hope       The maturities we are discussing  But the market is really for 3-  to 5-year notes in Germany  And these can be placed without being termed under German law  “securities”  They would carry 6 to 6-1/2 percent interest and would probably be non-callable   And if the Treasury wanted to hedge during the period of their being outstanding, they could  acquire marks to offset their obligation--if they felt the exchange rates were reasonable  And, of  course, then the question is [where] to reinvest the funds and that's being worked out  Possibly  [there could be] an issue from the Ministry of Finance that would allow the funds to be invested  until such time as we use them because the Treasury needs to get a yield on them  In the Swiss  franc market you're talking somewhat the same order of magnitude, [and that’s] much easier to sell   They can do very much larger amounts if necessary and the interest rate is 2 to 2-1/2 percent  Yes,  Willis       As you all would expect, the great difficulty in this operation has  been in D-marks  I think the operation in yen and Swiss francs has gone remarkably well and the  coordination has been superb  [In] our intervention in Swiss francs, Scott, we've had an equal 50  percent intervention by the Swiss National Bank in New York  They've intervened directly in  addition  And, of course, we've intervened very modestly relatively in yen, and the Bank of Japan  has operated very strongly  The problem [is] with the D-mark, of course; it's the [currency] that is  most subject to speculative trading and testing  And because of the 24-hour market, the  marshalling of a rate on the dollar or whipsawing is possible between times when certain markets  close and others open  We've had a little bit of trouble in that regard, which has been attenuated in  more recent days but was worrisome for a while        11/21/78              3     And when we think of these numbers we must recall that the risk  on our intervention through the swap line is shared 50 percent by the other parties  So our  exposure, which is what Scott is giving you, on the profit [or loss] side is only half of the amounts  that we intervened through our swap lines  So when you take it all into account, our intervention  would be half of the $36 billion since November 1, right?       So our risk is half that amount; that's all I wanted to point out  So  what we have in risk is not the $36 billion but half of that, in terms of our exposure to gains or  losses  Any further discussion?       May we have your approval to ratify the transactions since the  previous meeting in the foreign exchange markets?       Any dissent?  Hearing none, we will record that as approved   Now we have Alan Holmes with recommendations with respect to foreign currency operations       Just to make it clear, Alan, to the extent that we do acquire these  currencies, we may be paying these down instead of rolling them over  So your comment was to  roll them over if we had not paid them off       Any comments or questions?  Yes       I think in our published reports that is set out separately  Is that  correct?       I think they're very distinctly separated in the public report   That’s a good point, incidentally  That happened on somebody else’s watch  I assume you were all  here during that time; I wasn't  Any other comments?  Then do we have your approval to follow  the Manager's recommendations?  Hearing no dissent, we'll so order  We'll turn to [the report on]  our economic and financial situation       11/21/78              5     Any comment?  Is that satisfactory to everyone?       What is the Committee's desire?  Would that be satisfactory?  I  think the operation has been going well, and I do think we need this leeway until we stabilize       Alan, as I recall, when I first came here this warehousing plan was  approved, so you're merely reporting that it might be activated       But the arrangement that was approved here in March, as I recall,  was general       As you described it       Chuck, did you have a question?       In the currency of whatever country it happens to be       And they take the exchange risk, Chuck       It’s just so we can hold [the foreign currencies] and they have  dollars, that's all       The present authority would be up to $1-1/2 billion        Also, Chuck, we don't have a free draw on that swap; we have to  consult with them  But if we have our own resources we have free leeway  If they are Treasury  [resources], the Treasury can authorize us to use them, in effect  Any comments from others?   Alan, thank you very much  I'm sorry I didn't let you complete your very interesting report of  proposed actions and possibilities  Yes, Willis       Well, knock on wood, so far this has been a fairly peaceful war       Very  I really expected that we'd have to use more resources, to  be frank  So if we just continue [working] on the fundamentals, we can make some progress  Any  other comments or questions?  Then we will proceed to Jim Kichline, who has been waiting  patiently to give us the news, good or otherwise, about the economy       Thank you, Jim  Mark       Could that be formulated through appropriations of spending very  quickly in your area, Mark?  Or would it be delayed until the last half of next year when we have a  softness or slack in the forecast?       They are not rushing out to buy a piece of equipment These are  long-term plans for--       11/21/78              8     Any other comments or questions?       Yes, John       I think we have a real risk of talking ourselves into this--a  recession that we don't need       Phil       That's a smaller percentage though       Dave       Well, some of them want it  Willis       Chuck       Frank Morris       Ernie       Well, we have a very small ratio of expert anything       Henry       I've cut off the list  We'll have three more comments and we will  do a little go-around  Larry       Bones       Nancy       We have been scattering the shots recently and I'm going to  suggest that we give brief comments individually on how we view the economy and its key  elements of real growth, the fixed-weighted price index, and unemployment for the quarters under  consideration here as compared with the staff's forecast  And I think we could add any particular  comments as we go around  We'll start with Paul and go around counterclockwise       Yes  Well, no, I would like to do the fourth quarter to the fourth  quarter on real GNP and also on the price index and your estimate of the unemployment rate for the  fourth quarter of 1979  Those numbers by the staff are 21 percent for real growth, 74 percent on  the fixed-weighted price index, and 64 percent on unemployment       Well, I think it’s time to start looking at the full year       Yes--or an indication       Well, [tell us] third to third; we'll give you that much leeway       Well, we might all prefer to do the policy period  Why don't we  do that?  [The staff’s figures are] 26, 75, and 62       Thank you, Paul  Chuck       Chuck, that's the first time I've had the Boston snow theory  explained to me  They always said that the economic forecast depends on the amount of snow in  Boston before Christmas and I now know why  It means a weak Christmas  I always wondered  why that was  Did you ever plot the stock market against the snow in Boston?  It’s absolutely the  greatest       Any numbers?       Thank you  Bob     11/21/78              15       Thank you, Bob  Willis       At least for galoshes       Dave       Thank you, Dave  Bones       Thank you, Bones  Larry       Roger       Thank you, Roger  Bob       Anything further, Bob?       Thank you  Mark       Thank you, Mark  John     11/21/78              18       Thank you  Ernie       Thank you  Frank       Thank you, Frank  Phil       Resist the temptation!       More or less       Thank you, Phil; that was a good speech  Henry       Thank you, Henry  Yes, you're very close  Well, I want to thank  you all for your unanimous agreement that we are going to stay in business for four quarters  What  I gather from this is that we will still be here       For the first time, I don't have to correct the staff!  I think they are  in the range, with the usual margin for error that represents a fairly good probability  I've been on  the low side of the staff all year and now I think they are coming into the range that I think is  reasonable  What we might do now, if you don't mind, is turn to the report on open market  operations and complete that before a short break  Then we'll come back and deal with our  monetary policy directive  Peter Sternlight       Thank you, Peter  It's rather interesting to have the November 1  action fall in the midst of a refinancing and turn out the way it did  Tricky to signal in advance so  that that was not a problem  Any comments or questions?  Yes, Chuck        May we have your approval to ratify the transactions by the Desk  since the previous meeting?  You have had the report circulated  Are there any dissents?  If not, we  will record that as approved      I would suggest a brief break now and we’ll reconvene as quickly as we can so that we can  complete our deliberations in time to make the memorial service  I think you all know that there  will be transportation at the C Street entrance as soon as we finish here to take us to the memorial  service at St Alban’s  Then there will be a lunch back here at 100 pm with Governor Jackson     [Coffee break]        Well, ladies and gentlemen, would you like a discussion or are  you ready for the vote?     SPEAKER(?)  Yes, let's vote       [Let’s turn to] Steve Axilrod  I'll give him one chance and then  we will vote       Did you want to say something, Paul?       Well, our usual practice is to go through a rather long process  with everyone indicating his reasons  Let me start off by suggesting a possible directive and  perhaps soliciting comments on whether or not this would be acceptable or whether variations of it  are necessary      I would tend to agree with Steve that we might deal with M1 as we did last month, with an  upper limit rather than a range  And if we did that, I would think that perhaps a 5-1/2 percent lid  would be an appropriate number  As for M2, I rather think the 6 to 10 range would be appealing   As for M1+, I think it ought to be treated as a nonoperative shadow aggregate that we have ranges  for so we can learn to watch it and deal with it  Therefore, I would say that 2 to 6 percent would be  an adequate indication and a shadow comment  My preference for the fed funds rate at this point  would be to use a 9-1/2 to 10 percent range and to move it to 9-3/4 percent       11/21/78              22   I'm a little open-minded on the form of the directive, but I tend to think we are still  operating in a period where a money market directive might give us more flexibility  I think Steve  is correct that next month and in coming months we're probably going to want to pay very close  attention to the aggregates, but we are still sort of in a transition phase  I could go either way, but I  think it might be just as appropriate at this time to have a money market directive  I can follow up  with any comments or we can just go down the list  Phil, did you want to say something before we  start down the list?       Okay  Paul, would you like to add anything as Vice Chairman  before we start this?       Paul, of course, if we run past our aggregates [figures], we would  consult--and I think we have learned to consult--with the FOMC  I'd rather have us consult in an  intermeeting period than get locked into motions  It’s just a personal preference  It has turned out  that our communications have been fairly good  However, let's see how others feel  We will start  with Ernie Baughman       I think we are going to run short of time now  Could we get your  numbers and move on because we do have this memorial service  We have to keep an eye on [the  time]       Okay, thank you  Phil Coldwell       Thank you, Phil  Dave       What did you say on the funds rate?  I'm sorry       Thank you  Chuck       Consult, yes  Thank you         I think we are doing better on that, yes  Nancy       Okay, Nancy  Thank you very much  Henry       Thank you, Henry  Mark       Join the parade  Thank you  Willis       All right, let's go through the others quickly  John       Okay, let's get that marked  Bob Black       Thank you, Bob  Roger       11/21/78              26     Thank you  Bones       Bob Mayo       Frank       Thank you, Frank  Larry       Well, thank you all very much  Looking at the voting members  for a moment there seems to be a preference for a money market directive  As far as the immediate  action on fed funds, there is a very high consensus for 9-3/4 percent  As far as the range is     11/21/78              27  concerned, it appears to be a tossup between 9-1/2 to 10 and 9-3/4 to 10  A few are over 10 but not  many  We don't seem to have that much variance on an M1 cap; 5 percent looks like the  consensus It looks like a 6 to 9-1/2 percent range on M2 would be a compromise from a scattering  of around 6 to 9, 6 to 10, and 6 to 9-1/2      Let me just suggest the following a 5 percent cap on M1, a 6 to 9-1/2 percent range on M2,  a 9-3/4 percent fed funds rate--with a 9-3/4 to 10 range, but maintaining 9-3/4 as both the bottom  and the midpoint for this purpose--and a money market directive  Is that something that could be  supported?       Tight  What would you [change]?       On page 15?  Well, it would be raised or lowered within the  range That’s true, because it could go up and come back down        I think that would be a great change  All of the people who would  track us carefully would notice that change and figure that it has some significance  So why don't  we take that out?       I think that's a good idea  Incidentally, I didn't even mention  M1+; I think we put it in as a side note  I think 2 to 6 or something like that is maybe the best thing  to do       Maybe we will just leave it out  Why don't we just leave it out  and keep track of it?  That will be much better  Then we won't confuse everybody  Would you buy  the latest proposal?       Come on now, we haven't any time for messing around       You mean you are worried about the down side?       Yes       Let's find out  There seemed to be quite a majority for a 9-3/4  funds rate at this point  So let's try this one on a straw vote and see what we have  How many of  the voting members would accept--I'm not saying would propose but would accept--the proposition  I just tried to get out of this?  How many would go along with this?       A 5 percent cap on M1, a 6 to 9-1/2 range on M2, and a 9-3/4 to  10 range on fed funds, using 9-3/4 as the initial positioning point and a money market directive-- and M1+ just tracked on the side       Yes, tracking it to see how good we are at guessing  How many  of you would support that?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5       I didn't count myself       1, 2, 3, 4, 5, well--       Sure put it in  The midpoint at 9-7/8  We will take a vote on that  How many would like that?       Yes, everything else the same       Oh, yes  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  Okay  I think that's a majority  Now  let's take a vote  Let's get the others to swing in and realize that like a convention when they are all  through they say, “Mr Chairman, I move that it be unanimous”  There's real opportunity here       Three weeks  All right, I'll vote for the Coldwell compromise       Keep with the club       He abstained       Well, just a minute now, Willis Winn       Now Mark       A vote for Christmas  Thank you  I think that's the most  marvelous vote I have had since I have been here       We did take the money market and we did--       On page 15?       11/21/78              31     All right, let's look at page 14       You want to leave in “giving due regard to developing  conditions” don't you?  And add supporting--        We were countering disorder       That's because the whole market was in considerable disorder       Do we want to leave in this language “giving due regard to  developing conditions in domestic markets”?       That's what it says here--giving due regard to strengthening the--       Well, I think we need a little more positive statement  Support is  okay  There's nothing wrong with support  I think we ought to leave something in here about the  domestic markets  I really do  We shouldn't [base] our actions solely on international [markets];  that's the only point  Okay  Any other changes on page 14?       Well, does the Committee buy the Volcker language with the  word “support”?     MESSRS PARTEE and COLDWELL  Paul, could you read it?       “and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets”   All right, I don't hear any dissents  On page 15 was there a problem, Steve?       Yes, we did it before and we took it out the last time because of  the particular circumstance  I think it should go back in  Now that we have done all of this--       That whole section will come out  And we will take out the  reference to M1+  Now that we have done all of this, let me ask Alan and Peter  Can you fellows  live with this?       11/21/78              34     Is the range too narrow for you?  You're okay  Well, thank you all  very much  We have a few minutes to get organized to make our trip, and I appreciate it  We will  come back here for lunch  Now, we do have a meeting on December 19 for Christmas, and at that  time Mark will be even mellower       Do we have a schedule for '79 yet?  We had a problem, Steve,  about meetings  Chuck       Because of the timing of these special reports       If we are going to have a 2-day meeting, the sooner we get it on  people’s calendars--       Well, can you give us some tentative dates at lunch?       So we can at least block out the time       Just February and July  Let's get February tied down for sure         [END OF MEETING]      "
922,1978-12-19,"  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen  I appreciate everyone’s  willingness to meet so late in the morning, given your usual preferences for early sessions  I’ve  taken the liberty of trying to develop a format for today’s meeting that I hope will prove useful and  beneficial  If not, we can certainly adjust it back  I would like to experiment with some way that  would accomplish all of our purposes and perhaps make it easier for the Committee to get our work  done in the allotted time  What I am going to suggest is that we go directly through items 1  through 5  Item 4 we’ll be hearing from the staff on the economic review and 5 we’ll be hearing  from our Economist on his views      Then what I would like to do is to get the round robin in, where every member of the  Committee gives comments on his views of the economy--without necessitating numerical  variances from staff--and indicates any important signals, regionally or nationally, seen that would  cast light on our overall evaluation  But indicate at the same time what this implies from your point  of view in terms of policy direction  Again, not numerically but in terms of does this imply  tightening, easing, steady as we go, or substantial this or substantial that  And by the way, we can  get how everyone sees it and after the coffee break perhaps we can then focus on the specifics of  the directive and the guidelines and see if we can in that way streamline somewhat the process  without in any way curtailing the search for inputs and comments  But by making comments on  both the economy and the monetary outlook at the same time, I think it will shorten the process  from going around twice  I’d like to try that today, if you are willing, and see how it works      The first order of business is to approve the minutes of the actions taken at the last meeting;  they have been circulated  Are there any comments or corrections?  Hearing none, we’ll record  those as approved  And the next item is to deal with foreign currency operations, the report on the  operations since the last meeting  Scott Pardee        Thank you, Scott  Any questions?  Henry        Phil, did you have a question?       Yes, Dave?       Chuck       Scott       Thank you, Scott  We need an action to ratify the transactions  since the previous meeting  I think the details have been circulated  Are there comments or  objections?  Hearing none, we will record that as approved and move on to domestic open market  operations and the report from Mr Sternlight         12/19/78          4       Thank you, Peter  Questions or comments?       Bob Black       Phil       Thank you, Peter  We need an action to ratify the transactions  since the previous meeting  [A report] has been circulated  Are there any comments?  Are there  any objections?  Hearing none we’ll record that as approved and move to item 4 on the agenda,  which is the staff report on economic situation by Jim Kichline       Normally I would say thank you  In this case I’m not sure I can  say that        I think with these odds, Jim, we’ll call you Jimmy the what    Well, anyway I’ll thank you  Before we start our discussion of this, Steve, would you give us your  comments on how you see these relationships?       Again, can one say thanks for that clear-cut definition of policy?  Thank you for outlining the choices  Before we start the go-around, are there any particular points  that need clarifying?  If there are technical questions that could be handled elsewhere, that might be  better  But if there are any things that should be clarified here--  Yes, John?          That was after he lectured them       Yes, Bones       Jim, what about the seasonal adjustment in November?  Could a  small increase in actual starts with good weather show up as a bigger number in the seasonal  adjustment?        In the Northeast?       Nancy       Which was from January 1, incidentally  So you have to realize  that it is only less in the beginning and more at the end       12/19/78          8       Paul       Which year is that---the ’79 fiscal year?       Well, it’s hard--  Jim, let’s get it back in focus  Jim, tell us about  all that new employment and personal income that’s going to [generate] all that revenue         Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are perhaps ready to try to get  your inputs individually  Through careful analysis of past meetings, it has been determined that the  proper procedure today would be to start with Henry Wallich, who isn’t here, and go clockwise  I  suppose he is frightened about the possibility of being the lead-off!        I would ask for three components, or two particularly, on the  economy as you see it, in terms of any variance from the staff forecast  It need not be numerical; it  can be qualitative or quantitative  Also, I would particularly like each of you to comment on how  you read the implications for monetary policy at the moment, particularly [regarding] the directive  between now and the next meeting  So we will start with you, Phil, and when Henry comes in we  will pick up       Thank you, Phil  Henry, you were the lead-off man, but we  skipped you  So we are going to come back to you  We are not going to omit you       Please       Thank you, Henry  Frank           I’ll go along with that       That’s right; we haven’t had any experience        Thank you, Frank  Ernie       Thank you  John       Thank you, John  Mark     12/19/78          14         You have turned soft  You are only recommending 11 percent!       Bob       Thank you, Bob  Roger        Thank you, Roger  Well, we’ll leap across the table to our  colleague       Thank you, Larry  Bones       Thank you, Bones  Dave       Thank you, Dave  Willis       Any chance of it coming to Washington?       Thank you, Willis  Bob       Thank you, Bob  Nancy       Did you ever doubt?  They’re all on this side of the table          All right, thanks, Nancy  Chuck         Now, Chuck         But you’re going to have to vote       12/19/78          22          Thank you, Chuck  Paul       Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for two hours of attention   This go-around has indicated about as much unanimity as I’ve ever seen--namely, confusion  But  one interesting point I noticed is that I don’t believe anyone actually suggested easing  The  discussions were around standing pat or firming or being prepared to let the results of the  aggregates direct us in the coming weeks  I suggest that we take our break now and perhaps we  can pick this up again with some suggestions when we come back  Let’s break until ten past [the  hour]                  [Coffee break]       Well, ladies and gentlemen, we can reconvene  I did not indicate  my own position  I might say, as I said to some during the break, that the meeting this morning has  a certain Biblical quality in that it seems to me the first shall be last and the last shall be first  As I  read the discussion--which proves that we [must] have logic here--it seems to me that in the nine  months I’ve been here, as you look over the difficulties from month to month [and] look overall at  the objectives, there has been a definite and I think unanimous policy objective of slowing the  economy and doing so while maintaining balance and doing so on a smooth basis without undue  shocks  We’ve now seen the aggregates begin to move down  That’s encouraging but the  economy itself has surprised all of us, I think, with its strength in the fourth quarter; it should have  continued the slowing process that had been evident in the third quarter     To be consistent with our policies, it seems to me that what is indicated is a slight degree of  additional restraint with, I hope, some greater flexibility to act in the interim based on the facts-- what happens in the economy and what happens to the aggregates in particular  And [we ought] to     12/19/78          24    be prepared to continue the process we’ve been at until we find that point where there is a smooth  and gradual turndown in the economy without major disruptions      It also seems to me from the sentiment expressed here that we might plan an interim  consultation; I might suggest that we plan an interim consultation on January 16 by telephone,  recognizing that seven weeks is too long and that a full-blown meeting a few weeks from now will  probably [not be warranted]  We won’t have any new data of any significance because of the  nature of this time period, [but I suggest] that we make an agreement to consult again--not wait to  see events but plan it so that we’ll be in touch with everyone and make sure that there are no  indications of new directions       Now with that in mind, I’ll ask Steve to outline a proposal for your consideration--again, a  little different procedure this time  If we could put before you a proposal and then ask the voting  members of the Committee to indicate as we go down the list whether this is acceptable to them or  whether any parts are not acceptable--and if so what they are--I think we could focus on a  consensus more rapidly  Steve, will you please give your inputs?       Does everyone understand the proposal?       Yes he did, 9-3/4 to 10-1/2       An immediate move to 10 is a suggestion  Does everybody  understand this?       You have a money market [directive] on the down side and an  aggregates on the up side       12/19/78          26       You have to get to the bottom limits to reduce [the funds rate] but  on the tightening you can do it on the way up  It’s a new Federal Reserve invention       It’s a hybrid directive  Yes, Mark?       Yes, please  I want everybody to understand it before we  comment on it  That’s one of the rules--that we understand before we play          Any other questions about the substance of the proposal?  Then let  me just ask how the members react to that  Paul       Okay  Ernie       Sounds like you don’t buy it        Yes, but you have substantial differences on the ranges of the  aggregates, as I understood you          Thank you  Dave        Okay  Chuck        Okay  Nancy        Okay  Henry        Okay  Mark is next        Thank you, Mark  Willis     12/19/78          29          But you would accept the specifications?  Well, I would certainly  agree that we could go with this proposal at this time  I would think that the idea of erring on the  up side of 10 with a little flexibility makes a little sense  I think the Desk could see the advantage  of not letting it drop below 10 again and, therefore, err a little on the positive side  It seems that  there are 2, 4, 6, 7 members who would be agreeable as specified  I don’t know if the others would  feel, despite slightly different preferences, that they also could go with this with the one  modification  Why don’t we run down a vote and see?        No, no  Unless a change in the aggregates indicated a shift, if  we’re moving to 10 now, that 10 would be operated erring above 10  But changes would move  from that point in either direction          We would consult  We are going to consult on the 16th of  January in any case, but we would consult in the meantime              One [in] three       12/19/78          30        Look at the roller coaster, what I call Mount Everest  It came  back down         One of the problems is that growth was supposed to be about  3-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter and it’s over 4 percent  That’s one of the problems,  unfortunately  Well, let’s run down your check list  I will vote for that proposal             Thank you very much  We completed that action at 1140; we are  doing very well  I don’t know if you liked that procedure or not but I think that we got all the  comments  Perhaps you can give me privately your evaluation of whether that’s going to be a  better way to do it or not        We now need to move to a few other important matters  Item 8 is the consideration of the  Manager’s recommendation with respect to foreign currency operations  Alan Holmes        Yes, we have one on the 6th         But Chuck was pointing out that some of those come due after our  next meeting        The answer is that we have to roll them over  The authorization  would be to roll them over in the absence of acquiring the currencies with which to repay        May we have your approval for that proposal?  Hearing no  dissent, it is so ordered  You have other proposals?            So this was a period of 100 percent funding by the Treasury  which, as you know, is unusual and it should be noted        For two days     12/19/78          32          Well, this is a point on which we don’t have strong feelings  I  might say that we’ve been somewhat concerned about a series of [announced] actions that would  allow foreign currency traders to track what our intervention has been  Therefore, one of the  reasons for a larger open position than we normally would like for control purposes has been to  give us flexibility to maintain confidentiality on the degree and the extent of our intervention  So  for the same reason, we could go one of the two ways  Recognizing that the limits of the swap  agreements themselves provide the outside limit, we could just have no specified limit  We  recognize that the Desk is in very close consultation with the Subcommittee, which is really  tracking this carefully  Or we could do as Alan suggests and put in some limit that gives us leeway  of about $3 billion until the next meeting  Now, we really have no strong feelings  If there’s any  preference on the Committee, we could go either direction  Henry        But we would still have to suspend the aggregate limit        No, they are different things        We either have to give a specific number or a suspension     12/19/78          33          As I say, there’s no strong feeling  If there’s any sentiment for  setting an $8 billion limit--the previous one was $5 billion--we’ll move it to $8 billion  That would  be perfectly fine  It will be disclosed; whether that will create any concern or not, I don’t know  It  shouldn’t  It would indicate to people we’ve gone over $5 billion  Any sentiment?        Why don’t we then consider the proposal to move the limit to $8  billion?  Are there any comments or dissents?  Hearing none, we will approve that  Oh,  incidentally, I should say because Henry said it, but I’m not sure it was disclosed properly and  perhaps you are [not aware], our relations with Treasury from here on are going to be on a 50-50  basis  We have arranged that with them  Now they have resources  Alan, you have further  recommendations?         It reverses out when we use the D-mark for intervention         Any other discussion?        We’d probably have to raise it if they go to the market again in  February        Either way        Which we don’t have and we transfer to them so they take it  directly  It’s the same difference        Very much so  Henry     12/19/78          35          I have been going on the assumption that at this stage of  discussion this Committee did not want to buy that foreign currency position and own it for its own  account and for its own risk  I may have misread that; some day that might be a decision we’d like  to take  At the moment I think if we did that, we’d be accused of moving the potential foreign  currency exchange risk outside of the budgetary process, where it now resides with the Treasury   See, we are taking up foreign exchange; if there is a loss here, it will be a Treasury loss in their  accounting under the appropriations procedure  So I’ve assumed that  I’m not saying it wouldn’t  be good policy for this nation for us to own those reserves  But I think we want to do a lot of  homework and a lot of preparation before we make that decision because it has some political  repercussions        Especially since we urged it so hard     12/19/78          36          That’s a question that’s coming--to consider downstream  Dave  Eastburn has been trying to get his word in edge-wise        Yes, we certainly can        To repay debt  It seems appropriate to me--in fact, [if we do not],  I think it would be somewhat of a breach of faith since we’re the proponents of this process, which  is essential if we’re going to finance our current account deficit in a way the deficit nation should  do--to make this policy shift  And for the central bank to make it more difficult or more  inconvenient for the Treasury I don’t think is an appropriate way to go  On the other hand, I think  it’s a big issue I think it would take a lot of study and a lot of staff papers to decide that we would  want to become the holder of foreign currency reserves ourselves  So I’m not saying we shouldn’t  look at that  Anybody else?         All right  Now we move to a kind of pro forma subject, item 9,  the discussion of the report of the Subcommittee on the Directive  Chuck  Excuse me?         Oh, I think that makes sense because it will be used in the  meantime  Certainly some of it will be used        It seems inconceivable to me that we wouldn’t hold their  currency         I don’t think we’ll have any problem in buying them        Well, my preference is to go for the year, so we don’t have this  [twice]  We are going to study some things in the meantime  I think if we go to the Treasury with  a proposal or plan, they would be perfectly amenable to a plan  But my preference at least is not to  have these housekeeping issues keep rolling in here  What is the preference?        Yes, I would rather have a year        No, I think we have to do so much homework with the Congress  before we’d want to hold these because of the implications to us  We might be bringing ourselves  under the appropriations process by starting this        Yes, we’d take this from the Treasury, you see       It’s chargeable to the current account  That was one of the big  legal and accounting decisions that had to be taken to get them to agree to do this  If they had to  charge it to the Exchange Stabilization Fund, they were out of resources  If there is any currency  exchange loss, it will be booked as you go as an additional interest cost, in effect--an additional  cost of holding a resource      SPEAKER(?)  It will be a realized loss?        I think they’ll follow the process of realized and unrealized so that  they’ll put it into the quarters as they go by  They’ll follow FASB, and count it on a realized or  unrealized basis, which makes sense, because otherwise you build up a big blob and it may come  all at once  This way it goes in [currently]  And it can go either way  You can have an interest  reduction or an interest increase  The cost of these initial ones was quite satisfactory, I thought  595 percent for 3-year notes and 62 percent for the 4-year  So you already have roughly a 3  percent cushion on the exchange risk that would bring you out even      Well, what is the preference?  I don’t have a strong preference  Would you prefer six  months or twelve months?  Incidentally, the deal before was half and half  How many would  prefer to go all the way to one year for the whole thing and let’s work it out?  That would be my  preference, I think  How many would prefer six months?  Looks like the twelve months have it  Is  that all, Steve and Alan?  I didn’t mean to cut that off--        Do you want to be recorded as dissenting or would you join the  [majority]?        Now we turn, Chuck, to your directive        Let me answer your question very simply  It’s the will of the  Committee  If the Committee is comfortable making a decision today, I think that will be the  process  If it isn’t, we’ll have to schedule sessions as necessary or alternative means to get us to  where we need to be  We do need by February 6 to have at least a conclusion on how we will  handle it for our February 20 report  It would be a precedent and could be hard to unlock it  So we  ought to make a very conscientious decision  But I think it’s the will of the Committee  If there’s a  general feeling that this needs another meeting for further discussion, we’ll have to find a way to  arrange that         Well, let’s give the subcommittee a chance to present it and we’ll  see how it goes  We’ll see how good they’ve done their homework  There are, however, five  members of this subcommittee and we only have two dissents within the group, so probably that  means--       12/19/78          40        Wouldn’t it be wise to see if there is unanimous approval of any  recommendation?  Let’s get that one out of the way          That’s because he was nearby        Both        We tried to sell a revision midyear just in the current year; they  wouldn’t buy it  And instead of much worse things, the compromise was for the revision of the  current year plus a preliminary look at the next year     12/19/78          41          Well, this one is procedure  Does anyone have any problem with  this?        Yes, Willis         That’s correct, that’s specifically in the law; it says that our--        That’s correct        That would be a little deceitful       We’d have to keep too many books  One second, Larry needs the  floor     12/19/78          42          I think we have to report our intentions and we should report them  honestly; there’s no question about that  But if we are reporting intentions, and if there is a big  strike in the interim or if there is an oil boycott, we would change our program  And we would say  that’s why we had done it  That’s what you’re talking about          “Ranges” is the word in the law        The first [sentence] is right, though        These ranges or guides  Sure, why not?  And the next [sentence]  says “ranges”  Okay  Do you want to move to proposal 2, Chuck?         You would adjust the current year upward        Well, point-to-point is just too sloppy  So it’s some sort of period  to another period  What is the sentiment here?  Is this an issue on which there is a difference of  opinion?        We wouldn’t start one of these new periods from a base in July;  we would go back to the fourth quarter of the prior year        12/19/78          45        What is the will of the Committee--to approve this proposal or to  disapprove it?  John          Well, I would like to reserve judgment on that  I don’t think it  really comes up at this point  And I think actually the 4 percentage point spread we have now is a  special one  We’ve had 2-1/2 point spreads on M1, from 4 to 6-1/2  And if you would look at that  out for a year, you are still talking about the same scatter; you can be only 1-1/4 percentage points  off of your midpoint after a year  And cutting it down to a quarter doesn’t change that  It just  means that on a shorter period of time you could be 1-1/4 percentage points off  So, I would have  strong reservations because I’m the one who will have to explain why we don’t hit these things   And the narrower the target, the more we’re going to miss it        That’s the problem  Where we get the problem now is slipping  the base  If we stuck by our original one-year projection and had a 2-1/2 point spread--  Now, we  are off the subject, but we may want to create a band rather than a cone  There is a lot to be said for  that  But I think that’s a separate question          I think it does        It comes up every meeting because I don’t know that you can bind  future FOMCs to having only certain spreads  I think any FOMC can put on any spread they want   New people come on and change their minds        No, you go back to the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  You just  change--       Annually there would be a base drift but during the year I think  we’d merely move our targets if we decide to change them  We would reaffirm them or say we’ve  moved them up or down; we’d have to admit we were wrong       Yes, being spread out so that you--        Just on the narrow point, do you want to go fourth quarter-to- fourth quarter?  Can we get that one solved?        Going, going, gone  What’s number 3?       What is the pleasure of the Committee?          You would rather go to six and six?        Have you considered going back to quarterly meetings?        Well, we’ve heard sentiments around  How many would accept  this schedule for 1979 with or without the Coldwell codicil, which is the telephone meeting?        Everybody  Okay, that looks like it  Is anybody unhappy with  that?        We will refer the Memorial Day issue to the subcommittee; this  will get our schedule going for February       So you want to cancel the May meeting?        You’ll have a hangover on Memorial Day?       What will you have, a Memorial Day [unintelligible]?          We can go another week more and have it on June 5        Wild enthusiasm, I would think       I don’t think anybody will know the difference unless we--        The release is three days after the next meeting         That’s right, to consult on that date  So we wouldn’t have an  official meeting or we wouldn’t have problems with new policy directives and the release of the  other--        If anybody asks about it, don’t you tell the truth?  It’s that we are  having it a couple of weeks [later] because we have to prepare for the new presentation to Congress  and we have to wait until we get the budget to do it        I’d inform everybody  My first reaction is that I don’t think there  will be any feeling of letdown because it’s very logical  If we have to report on the 20th of  February, we don’t have the data until quite late in January  It’s hard for us to do otherwise        Well, Joe, all you have to do in giving out the schedule is to add a  paragraph to your release saying that this has been scheduled at this time to permit preparation for  the new reporting required under Humphrey-Hawkins       Okay, where do we stand on meetings?  There seemed to be acceptance of the proposal,  with I guess a careful hope that you do something about Memorial Day--perhaps cancel it          I’m not sure I understand this issue  Under the Humphrey-  Hawkins we are to make our report with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of monetary  and credit aggregates, taking account of past and prospective developments in employment and  unemployment, etc  So, won’t we have to look at the prospective [developments] as we see them?         But we’d say here’s our monetary policy and it is based on the  fact that we expect unemployment to be slightly different or substantially different [than the  President’s objective]  Won’t we have to say that?       So are you arguing about what you know in advance [as to]  whether we are?  Because if it happens to be consistent, Nancy, we have covered your point,  haven’t we?        No, I don’t read it that way  Do I misread it?        Yes, first we say what our plans are--the objectives and plans of  the Board of Governors and the FOMC        [It says] the “relationship”  It doesn’t say that we tell what it  takes to get the President’s [objectives]  We say what we are going to do, and then we give the  relationship to the President’s [goals]  Either it’s going to be consistent or inconsistent        [It says] taking into account the prospective relationship of our  objectives and plans  Take into account [prospectively]         No, but you can’t hardly say that you have taken into account  prospective employment unless you have taken it into account          If that’s the case, we ought to be saying so under three        But our reports to the Congress this year have rather consistently  been at variance with the Administration on growth of the economy, for example  We said here are  our ranges and we expect the economy to grow at this rate and it was always less than the  Administration’s  I don’t think that will [lead to] any particular crises         I’m just trying to reconcile this difference of opinion  It seems to  me, having decided what our objectives and plans were, if we then came to the point of what is  their relationship to those in the President’s economic report and found a variance, I think we  would have to report that         No, if you’re at variance  If you’re not at variance, you’re really  saying you are consistent with that forecast           I don’t [know], Larry  We may have gone procedurally one way  or the other  But it has been my experience that we have been adopting monetary policy for the  conscious purpose of achieving a slower growth rate in the economy than was in the  Administration’s forecast  And we have been reporting this publicly all year         Oh yes, I understand  What we have said is that I have listened to  everybody and I’ve said what I think  That’s correct        Okay, I see  Now I’m getting the point          Dave          Are we covered?  Anybody else?        Yes         Mark        We are going to face some serious problems on our first go- around because the Administration’s plan will face the dilemma of whether it’s opportune to  forecast more inflation and therefore to have a lower budget deficit  It is an interesting dilemma  because the more inflation they forecast, the more they meet their target on the fiscal deficit  And  the more they are optimistic on inflation, the more their deficit will go up          Well, we will have to see        We may have to spend all day on the 6th        You said that about the [meeting] dates!        This is on the ranges only, not the directive in the--       12/19/78          59        Anybody have any problem on 6?  Larry, do you have something?   [Unintelligible] can’t believe it        No, please read it        Dave, you have [a comment]?        Yes, please        Well, how many prefer the--        What do you expect me to say?         It’s subject to change at any time        But I think there needs to be some understanding on how we are  going to be operating       I have trouble with it on two counts  I don’t see how the  Committee can lay down a rule that requires future Committee members to vote a certain vote  I  don’t see how you can do that  As a matter of procedure, I don’t see how you can vote today and  say that next July every member of this Committee is now committed to a certain mechanical  process  Even if you voted that, I don’t think it would be valid  Members could throw it out  because it’s just wrong procedure  No Committee can bind a future meeting--        Yes, that’s fine  It seems to me that what is being suggested is  that at each meeting of the FOMC there will be available data as to a track that could return us to  our range, if we are off it  And at that point members of the Committee can vote to get on the track  or vote not to get on it  I think that’s the only procedure we can accept  We will have new  members; we will have two new Governors coming on  They can’t be bound to vote [a certain  way] later          But if you present the choice, the Committee has a choice to  decide to return on a 1-month basis, a 3-month basis, a 6-month basis, or to say in its reports that  we have decided for factors that have come up to change our long-range objective        No, this is very important  Don’t hush up        Yes  Well, I think the point has certainly [been made]  I think  Ernie Baughman had a [comment]        Yes, I think that’s right        Paul       12/19/78          63        Well, what is your pleasure here?  Do you want to vote on this or  do you want to keep it as an open and continuing discussion from meeting to meeting?  Or do you  want to settle one?        Would that be satisfactory to everyone?        To keep it open?        I think that’s absolutely right  And in any case, we will be getting  options before us in every meeting  All right, we will proceed to 7--before we have another  dissent        You dissent on keeping it--         Paul Volcker  Go ahead        I won’t say anything about [unintelligible]  Frank Morris     12/19/78          65         The [subcommittee] chairman was about to throw it out           Steve        Dave has been trying to get the floor         All right, now I want to hear from Bones        Well, for something that is being tossed out, it sounds like there is  a lot of support  Steve, do you have any preference?        Were you saying that if the aggregates are too high, a longer  period will keep them high longer?        Bob Mayo       12/19/78          67        Is everybody more or less willing to accept that at the moment,  despite the preferences?        It’s not going to die; it’s going to be immaterial  All right, put it  in the Bluebook someplace        I’m surprised it’s weak  It’s only physically weak  Does anybody  else have any comment on that?  Yes, Willis        Bob, you had a point        Henry        Your committee is going to be looking at that  That’s very nice   Bob, is the memo that you circulated being handled in any way?        That’s what I was wondering        Do you feel they are making progress on your viewpoints?        Okay     "
947,1979-02-06," Good morning, ladies and gentlemen  Welcome to our historic meeting It‘s not only earlier [in the month  than usual] but also involves for the first time the new Humphrey-  Hawkins process I assume that doesn’t mean much [will be different],  but it does mean, [since we cancelled our regularly scheduled meeting  in January], that we haven’t met as frequently So if I forget your  names, it‘s because I haven’t seen you for so long! We do have a  couple of absentees because of our rescheduling Willis Winn is not  able to be here, and I understand that Bob Mayo will be voting as his  alternate Is that correct?   M R   MAYO Yes    Okay And Mr Kimbrel is not able to  attend So from the Cleveland and Atlanta Federal Reserve Banks, we  have First Vice Presidents Walter MacDonald and Kyle Fossum here I  think all the Reserve Banks are covered   I have a very sad chore to face--it’s happened to me twice in  my short tour here, which is historic in my experience--and that is to  inform you that we have lost another of our close associates I  wonder if we could take just a moment in memory of Tom O‘Connell  [Pause] Thank you   Our first order of business this morning is to deal with the  minutes of the last meeting, which was on December 19 They have been  circulated Are there any corrections or additions? If not, we will  record them as approved The next item on the agenda is the report on  foreign currency operations from Scott Pardee    Thank you, Scott Any questions OX  comments?    Yes, Ernie    Yes, Dave     2 / 6 / 7 9  -2-     If it happens on the same day that there is  a large strike in the Baltimore Canyon, the answer is that it would  have no effect on the dollar    Larry    Thank you, Scott Our next step is to  ratify, if you are willing, the transactions since the previous  meeting Is there any objection? Hearing none, we will approve those  transactions Next we have the report on domestic open market  operations Peter Sternlight    Diversity is the spice of life [In some  respects] it’s too bad that it’s a good thing Peter, I guess there  will be four times a year now when the period between meetings will be  a little different than in the past Should we put your [intermeeting  leeway] authority on a per week or per month basis?  or would it add to the problem?   Would that help    All right Questions or comments? Phil   It‘s $3 billion, not--   Well, we had [increased it to $5 billion  and then raised it $1 billion more, which] put it at S6 billion So,  when you say ""keep it,"" YOU really mean ""set it"" at $5 billion    Any other comments or questions? Shall we  authorize $5 billion between now and the next meeting? Will that be  satisfactory?    So moved and seconded All in favor say  ""Aye"" Opposed? So voted We also need to ratify the transactions  since the previous meeting Is there any dissent from approving those  actions as reported to you in the usual [written] report plus the  verbal report? Hearing none, we will approve that Thank you very  much, Peter   Now we turn to the longer-run ranges for the monetary  aggregates A number of presidents and governors mentioned after the  last meeting that they liked the experiment we tried of combining the  discussion of one's viewpoint on the economy with its policy  implications As I said at the time, if that turned out to be  something that people felt was a more useful way to [approach our  policy deliberations], we would continue it We may have to modify it  at this meeting because we're dealing with both long- and short-range  issues, but I'll take into account the general reaction I got to our  effort to lean in that direction and see if we can continue that sort  of [approach] To get into the subject this morning of our long-run  ranges for the monetary aggregates, we're going to start off with some  reports from Jim Kichline, Jerry Zeisel, and Ted Truman Jim   MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see  Appendix I    I suggest that we take a few minutes to see  if there are any questions of Jim or [his colleagues] Yes, Larry    Bob Mayo    John Balles    Which one do you want?    From stimulus to restraint, yes Mark  Willes    Let us proceed then to ask Steve Axilrod to  give his comments and recommendations on the longer-run ranges Then  we'll go around and have each of you give us your input on how you see  the economy and the policy implications in tenns of how you see the  long-run ranges    [What about] bank credit, Steve?   M R   AXILROD Well, I think I would stay with the alternative  B range, which is 1 percentage point lower than what we now have; that  would seem to me quite consistent with the slowing in growth    I would just like to remind everyone--as  you know since we've talked about the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation and  Steve mentioned this--that what we're really talking about involves  one important difference in setting long-term ranges And that is  that we will not in this calendar year have new ranges based upon new  base periods we are now going to operate for the whole year on a  fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis So these ranges will not have  the famous Henry Wallich base drift that has allowed us to go with the  times We will have [the opportunity for] a mid-course correction; in  July we're supposed to report on any changes we think appropriate for  the ranges for this year That does not mean updating the base to the  second quarter or [adopting a range] for the third quarter of '79 to  the third quarter of '80 It means relooking at the ranges set for  the fourth quarter of '78 to the fourth quarter of '79 And we'll be  asked to give at that time the first indications of our policy     2 / 6 / 7 9  -9-    objectives for the calendar year 1 9 8 0   So that's an important  difference   Specifically, in our report, which the Board of Governors  will file in time for us to testify on the 20th of February, we'll  need to report on ""the objectives and plans of the FOMC with respect  to the ranges of growth or diminution in the monetary and credit  aggregates for this calendar year, taking account of past and  prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production,  investment, real income, productivity, international trade and  payments, and prices""  these objectives to the short-term goals set forth in the President's  Economic Report So this is what we're going to be doing   We also need to provide the relationship of   what I think might be most helpful, having had Steve's  recommendation, is to go around the table and have each of you make  any comments you wish about the economic outlook and your views on how  that should be translated into these ranges Then we'll be able to  see if we can synthesize some decision from that I think last time  we started in this direction [around the table] so this time why don't  we start the other way   M R   ROOS May I ask a question?    Larry    Too bad we didn't have a tape recorder on    Actually, I think we did have the tape  recorder on Certainly we can have it transcribed and sent to you  That's no problem at all    I forgot that there's no green light [in  front of me, as there is at Board meetings, to indicate that the tape  recorder is on] But we have the recorder on without a green light at  the FOMC meetings So, we'll start with Paul    I assume we're going to get float down,  aren' t we?    Thank you, Paul Chuck    Well, I think the staff can guarantee that  their dotted lines will not be achieved    Plus or minus 3 percent    Well, Chuck, I think that’s another issue  I have the language right here and we are to give our objectives onl\l  for 1979      And we’re to say what the relationship is  to the [Administration‘s] short-term goals--the relationship for 1 9 8 0   would be my guess    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Bob    Good planning!    Thank you, Bob Walter     2 / 6 / 7 9  -15-    Thank you, Walter Dave    Thank you, Dave Kyle    Alternative C for M2 and M3?    Thank you, Kyle Larry    Thank you, Larry We'll hop across the  table to Roger    Thank you, Roger My list says ""Boy"" Mayo,  but I think it's supposed to be Bob    A little seasonal adjusting    Thank you, Bob Mark    Thank you, Mark John    Thank you, John Ernie    Thank you, Ernie Frank    He just wanted to check to see whether you  read it!    Thank you, Frank Phil    Join the others!   M R   COLDWELL The prospects are highly uncertain but still  couched on the favorable side The hard evidence we have had to date  is for a strong economy with a very high rate of inflation As for  the monetary aggregates, I must admit I have never had much hope for  them And what they’re showing right now I would say is of doubtful  validity We are uncertain as to the implications and we can’t even  describe why the changes are occurring The information we have about  the Administration’s estimates for 1979-80 suggest that those  projections are unrealistic I don’t think we are going to get a  reduction in the rate of inflation, the rate of unemployment being  held down, and a resumption of growth as promptly as they show Even  our own staff’s forecasts I would quarrel with in terms of the rate of  inflation; I don’t think it will go down that smoothly In my view  the possibility is high that our rate of inflation will be in the 9  percent range   On net, then, the result is that we may face a problem of  communication with the Congress, a little communications gap In  terms of [our objectives], I hope the Committee comes out somewhere in  the area of 1 to 4 percent on M1, 5 to 8 percent on M2, and 6 to 9  percent on M3 I‘m coppering my bets a bit but I wouldn‘t go as far  as Mark has I don‘t think it is desirable to hold out to the rest of  the world that there is the potential of a 6 to 10 percent increase in  M1 if we are going to tell them that we have a 3 percent shift because  of ATS and another 2 percent downward shift; that I think is  unrealistic I don’t like the idea of narrowing the ranges in a  period of extreme uncertainty   C H A I W  MILLER Thank you, Phil Henry    Thank you, Henry, and thank you all I  would suggest, before we try to synthesize this and before I give you  my own reaction, that we take our coffee break The coffee has been  cooling €or the last half hour S o ,  why don't we do that and then we  will resume   [Coffee break]    Let's see, are most of us here? A l l  those  who count are Well, let's see if we can resolve the problems that we  face on these long-run ranges I was first guided by the eloquence of  the discussion that has already occurred Then to be practical I  looked at the numbers that come out on paper and the eloquence goes  away and the practicality comes out I don't think we will be able to  bracket everyone's first desire and have numbers that will be  supportable Perhaps we should try to do something unusual, and that  is concentrate first on M1 If we throw out a lot of numbers we may  get confused It seems to me that I heard perhaps less immediate  concern about--or firmness in people's views on--the ranges for M2 and  M3 If you are agreeable, I would like to see if those of us on the  Committee could [reach a consensus] on what we should use for M1 and  then see if we can adapt the M2 and M3 to it Will that be all right  with everyone? That's an unusual procedure, I know AS I looked down  the numbers [you suggested] and then asked myself what I think is  desirable, considering the probabilities on ATS and a shift in the  demand function of money, it seems to me that 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent  brackets most people's views [for Ml] and is probably a range that we  could live with in terms of our own objectives Now, there are a few  people outside that range but that seems to be most compatible with  [the preferences of] most of the members I'd like to try that out  and see if it is supportable It happens to be exactly consistent  with Ernie Baughman's suggestion He's the only one, I guess, who had  the right number! The rest were bracketed around that    Chuck came close with 2 to 4-1/2 percent  I don't know whether he's willing to drop his bottom number to 1-1/2  percent     2 / 6 / 1 9  -25-    The [lower] end of that, yes, but it  depends If we are at the upper end of that and if some of these  other things take place, our money rate growth will be faster than it  has been    On the up side [Ml growth] will be faster  than it has been on the down side it could be consistent with what we  have had or it could be lower So, what we are really doing is  widening the [range], which just means I will catch a little devil  from the Chairmen of the [Banking] Committees, but I am willing to do  that They won't like this spread, but if we take this spread plus  the variables and add them, we have a range of minus something to plus  10 percent That's how I read it, as I look at the mathmetics or make  certain assumptions That's why it seems to me to be a range we can  live with Now I also believe that we have to be sincere about being  willing to rearrange these ranges at midyear At that point we may be  wise to begin to narrow them because we will have six months of actual  data and we will be looking at what we should do for the balance of  the year within the same cone Whether the cone should go out and  then close in after midyear when we've seen [some data], I don't know  Anyway, how many of the voting members could support a range of 1 - 1 / 2   to 4 - l / 2  percent now?    We should [adopt] that, I think, although  that's short term    It looks to the fourth quarter    Which is the 1-1/2 to 4-1/2  percent    Yes, and that’s why it can grow faster from  here on    Well, these ranges have been created from  the fourth quarter, without the expectations of the low rate of growth  we have had in the aggregates so far in the year Is that correct?    All right Let’s try the 1-1/2 to 4-112  percent again How many of the voting members would be willing to  support that? I saw Paul’s hand, and I count Chuck, Ernie, Bob, Dave,  Phil, myself--oh and Nancy How many is that? Okay, thank you How  many would not? I count two That sounds like a pretty overwhelming  concensus Now we will have to work on the other two members to get  them straightened out so we can have a unanimous vote! Before we  decide on that, however, let’s look at M2 and M3 It’s hard to make  much of the figures and it‘s tough to come up with the right numbers  The question of widening the ranges is with us again If we were  willing to widen them, Steve’s suggestion, if I interpret it  correctly, was for ranges of 5-112 to 8 percent and 6-112 to 9-112  percent    Excuse me, did I say something wrong? It  was 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent and 6-112 to 9-112 percent Jot those  down Put along side them two alternatives of 5 to 8 and 6 to 9    That is shaded down just 1/2 point How many of the voting members  would like the widened Axilrod numbers of 5-112 to 8-1/2 percent and  6-112 to 9-112 percent? Two members How many would like the 5 to 8  percent and 6 to 9 percent? Three How many could accept it? Four,  and I could accept that, so it’s five Five and two is seven  Apparently three want something else Is that right?    I‘m just looking [at my notes] You would  want something lower, [Mark] Who didn’t vote? Dave, what would you  like?    I just want to get the votes again These  were straw votes There were two for the wider Axilrod ranges and  five for the slightly lower ones [One] would like to be higher than  either of these and I gather the other two would like to be lower, is  that right? Having heard all of that, let’s put together another  proposal of 1-112 to 4-112 percent for M1, 5 to 8 percent for M2, and  6 to 9 percent for M3, with an associated range of 7-1/2 to 10-1/2  percent for bank credit Maybe I should have left that off We can  come to that separately, if you like I didn’t find anybody differing  from what Steve suggested [on bank credit] Well, in fact there was  only one suggestion that was different Kyle, I think you suggested  shading it a bit But I think everybody else either accepted it or     2/6/79 -28-   ignored it Now, forgetting bank credit, just taking M1, M2, and M3,  let's do a tentative vote by roll call to see if we could get support  for that I would support that package    For the upper end of the ranges, it could  imply, I would assume it would imply the higher--    Except that we have M2 and M3--    --a little higher than the staff's "" B  ""     We'll have lower rates   M R   PARTEE --rates are going to come down    These will be disclosed publicly in the  written report to Congress That will be the first and only public  disclosure It is contemplated that the report will make it very  clear that the M1 numbers are based upon an adjustment for ATS and it  will say something about velocity and demand, but I don't think--    I don't think the 5 percent will be but 3  percent will get discussed because if it isn't in the report I will be  asked specifically what we have assumed We can't be deceitful about  it; we have to tell them the truth The truth is that on the basis of  [our estimate of the effects of] ATS accounts, forgeting any change in  demand curve, we have 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for MI     2/6/19 -29-     Which is what we were trying to do before,  so we could get within it    We were going from 4 to 6-1/2 percent and  we were always on the upper side or out of the range    Now let's take an official vote    No Does anyone wish to change his or her  vote from that?    Okay, thank you That was a pause brought  to an affirmative    Well, I don't think so We should operate  on a rule that everyone votes as they see fit; that has been our  policy We are in a time when we see foolish stories about this sort  of thing in the press that people love to play on, but I don't think  we should let that change our desire to vote our conscience I don't  see any embarrassment It always is better to have stronger support,  but it isn't essential    You certainly may    Well, no matter what we say about M1, the  fact is that M2 and M3 are lower So in that sense the people who  don't want to listen to us on M1 are people who just don't want to  listen, because we are just getting a more logical M1 range consistent  with monetary restraint and the other ranges are coming down S o  if  they are willing to give us even the first opening statement, they  have to see this as a posture that is consistent with what we have  been trying to do    Yes, I think that's right The ATS doesn't  go the other way but we could get--    So we are talking 0 to 9 percent    That's what I said when I introduced the  subject I said we have widened the range The probability of  hitting it is better    Of course I hope we don't hear about it  elsewhere or in any other way Dave, do you have a question?    Well, the question is not the consistency,  but the relationship    If one looks at the Administration's short-  range goals, I would say based on our own [projections] that for 'I9  those goals could be achieved within this [set of ranges] Now, I  think that we have more possibility of divergence in 1980, but we have  not yet locked in our 1980 ranges And, therefore, I think our report  can indicate that kind of posture    And it depends, of course, upon real events  in the economy over the period of time as distinguished from goals  They have changed and shifted a little, of course We have been  talking about our projections of what will happen under certain  assumptions But our comments are to be against what the  Administration might be intending to accomplish And they may not be  able to achieve what they are hoping    That's right So they have an out They    Well, we will get into the report next  week Did we have any final shifts one way or the other? We didn't  pick up any more positive votes All right then, that's a vote   Let's turn to the next subject on my agenda which is to deal  with current monetary policy and the domestic policy directive We  will turn to Steve again for his recommendation As you know, [on the  long-run decision] we have been referring to the alternatives as ""A,""  ""B,"" and ""C"" We now will go through alternatives ""I,"" ""11,"" and  ""III"" on page 11, which is also relevant to page 14    So are you suggesting alternative I for M1  or are you suggesting 4 to 9 percent?    And leaving the fed funds range where is  is Is that what you're saying?    May I ask the Committee, all members,  whether there is any sentiment for the alternate directive, which  would deal with the proposition of not reducing the funds rate between  now and the next meeting but would look to the possibility of raising  it? That is, in effect, putting upper side limits on M1 and M2 and  upper limits on the fed funds rate This is the alternative  [directive wording1 that's on page 21 in the Bluebook If there is a  sentiment for that, we should go into depth on it; if there is not we  might turn back to the more--    Would you raise your hand if you are  interested in this [alternative language] on page 21 and then we will  see who is not   SPEAKER(?) Voting members only?    Well, let's just get everybody's sentiment  for the moment    Just whether you'd be interested in--not  that you are voting for it--what's on page 21 If there is no reason  to discuss it, we needn't waste our time One, two, three, four,  five How many would not be interested in it? Okay We'd better do  that again with voting members, hadn't we? HOW many voting members  would not be interested in the directive type on page 21? One, two,  three, four, five That's going to make it tough Why don't we see  if we can work out the other [directive formulation] to everyone's  satisfaction?   If I could give you a little guidance, my preference, if we  go for the directive language on page 19, is to have the same sort of  asymmetrical directive we had last time My reasons are simply that  all of the discussion today, taking into account both domestic and  international considerations and the confusion about what the real  economy's performance means in relation to the performance of the  aggregates, would indicate that we should be in an even keel stance  until we see some reason to change Or to put it another way, when  you don't know what to do, do it very cautiously Therefore, that  would be my approach Do you want to say something, Chuck? I was  going to say if that is the case, then I think Steve's suggestions of  4 to 9 percent for M1 and 5 to 9 percent [for M21, looking at the  possibilities indicated on page 14, would seem to be reasonable That  would mean that if we got toward the upper end of those ranges we'd be     2/6/19 -33-   looking at tightening; but we'd have to go to the bottom and through  it before we thought of relaxing I would also like to say that,  considering the time between this meeting and the next, if there is  any real reason to shift policy, it seems to me that we should have a  telephone conversation I feel that we shouldn't get ourselves too  locked into these numbers with the situation so fluid We have a good  telephone set-up now--it seems to work well--so it's not so hard to  get everybody on [a conference call] to discuss [a policy move] Now,  if we do what I've just described, the question I'd like to hear  discussed is Should we leave the fed funds range at 9-3/4 to 10-1/2  percent or should we change it to 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent, looking at  the fact that an even keel approach means we're not going to be  putting much room on either side Why don't we just get inputs   M R   PARTEE I was simply going to point out that I agree  totally with what you said about even keel--that is, I think this is a  time for a sticky funds rate unless we see something big happening  But then your specific proposal was a biased proposal, that we raise  the funds rate if the aggregates are strong in the range and not  [reduce] it if they are low I see no reason for that asymmetrical  treatment when, looking at that table on page 14, we are well below  the lower end and indeed won't be getting up to the midpoint of the  [longer-run] range by March unless we are at the very top of the  [February-March] M1 range I'm speaking of M1 now So it seems to me  that the idea at this stage of the cycle of an unbiased approach to  rate-setting, depending on the performance of the aggregates is the  one--    Yes, Chuck, I'm probably influenced a bit  by the concern that if we reduce the fed funds rate in the next few  weeks--unless something is happening that we can explain--I'd be  worried about the international situation    Paul    He is absolutely purist    Bob Black    Thank you, Bob Dave    Our directive would be even keel and we  would [have a conference] call if we think a change [is needed] That  solves our directive because it gets us ready for the Merrill case  If we lose the Merrill case, that will be our directive for the  future Go forth and do well and we'll be in touch    That's not a bad point Maybe we ought to  have a directive that says we will even keel it and if there are any  significant changes, we'll consult    On average Steve is always right, but not  from month to month Larry     2 / 6 / 1 9  - 3 5 -     Well, Larry, I don't know what the  sentiment is but I have a bit of a trouble thinking that we know  enough about these aggregates and their stability to operate that way  We have this phenomenon that at some point, for some reasons, the  money function shifts around on us And how one measures that in a  particular week or at a particular time I think is a very tricky  business    Yes, but you keep adjusting the base so  that you go back to a constant situation and give no effect to the  shifting around of the demand function of money I would have very  deep trouble [with that] because that isn't what is happening in the  economy The economy is shifting its preference as to how it holds  these funds If we say we're going to ignore that, yes we can operate  that way But I think we'd be out of touch with reality    Absolutely    Well, if we want to put reserve  requirements on mutual money market funds, that would be one place to  start in order to get our aggregates back under the same definition  and so forth Mark    If we could only get other members to give  in we would--    We're talking about discussing either  direction    Well, if the directive were even keel, then  we would not have any change from that even keel unless there were the  votes for that So it’s decided by whether more people think [the  funds rate should be moved] in one direction or the other    Bob    Well, there is no reason we can’t design a  money market directive in the traditional sense with the understanding  that if we get near the [limits] on either side [of the ranges] we  won’t really move until we consult It’s very simple That will  serve everybody’s purpose, and then if something is happening in the  economy or something is happening that we don’t understand, we can  have a telephone conference How would you all like that?    Well, we are going to even keel and we're  going to have a money market directive, but we're going to have an  understanding that we are not going to move the funds rate until we  talk to each other    Well, this information will not be  published They never have bothered us on that    No they really haven't they've been very  good about that   reference [to neutrality] in the directive but the fact is that I  don't feel neutral And to word the directive like that sounds as if  we're operating entirely biased against any change at all and that the  only thing that's going to [trigger a] change is the aggregates It  ignores the foreign exchange market aspects entirely and ignores the  fact that the risks to the domestic economy are on the inflationary  side anyway And we should be able to--    I'm not sure I follow that If this were a  regular directive with ranges for fed funds and ranges for M1 and M2,  why would it seem neutral?    It's tied in to the aggregates    The trouble with that argument, Paul, is  that we have a directive out now that has the same characteristic  [Money growth is] below the bottom of the range we published and yet  we haven't reduced the fed funds    It’s money market on the down side and  [refers to the] aggregates on the other    All right Let‘s go around to the voting  members and ask what you want to do I’m not talking about the range  now but I think we need to crystalize this one way or the other Are  we going to have a money market directive, are we going to have just  an understanding, or are we going to have an asymmetrical directive or  what? Let me go right down the list Ernie   M R   BAUGHMAN I could go either with the suggestion Bob  Black made, which seems to me to capture--    Okay, that would be a money market    We’ll come to the top of the ranges in just  one second    Okay, the type we had last month Dave    I’m sorry, I skipped Phil Coldwell; I just  missed the initials here    You have a narrow bias upward Chuck   M R   PARTEE Well, I would like an unbiased money market  directive I would accept some language about taking account of  foreign exchange market developments but that’s as much of a bias as I  would want    Nancy    And, Paul, you‘ve expressed the view that  you would prefer the asymmetric directive Henry    Mark    An unbiased money market directive?    Bob Mayo    Well, if I read this right, Ernie would  accept the money market alternative, Dave would prefer just the  consultation--    Nancy was for a money market directive, as  were Mark and Bob, and Chuck--one, two, three, four, five, six I  think that‘s the way we‘re going to have to go if we are going to hang  this together Can we just look at this and see if we can get some  agreement on the ranges and a money market directive?  that Steve made was 4 to 9 percent on M1, 5 to 9 percent on M2, and  the present range for fed funds, which is 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent  Perhaps I’d better have another go-around now that we’ve decided what  we’re going to do [on the directive wording]  with a money market directive, what is the sentiment on those ranges?   The suggestion   Assuming we‘re going    Ernie?    Phil    Dave     2/6/19 -41-    Chuck    Nancy    Henry    Mark   M R   WILLES I agree with what Chuck said, assuming he meant  a low enough range on the aggregates    Both ends or just on top?    All right Bob    Okay Now we‘re in good shape Let’s  leave the rate question; the rate question sounds as if it’s whether  to leave the top side at 10-1/2 percent or cut it back to 10-1/4  percent  will accept 3 to 8 percent and 4 to 8 percent   What we’re going to do now is see if there’s a majority who    Well, Steve is frank to say that he is  expecting these aggregates to pop back up and adjust this process He  is very frank to say so and is worried about dealing with that, right?    We had a lot of sentiment going for ranges  of 3 to 8 percent and 4 to 8 percent We had at least 3 or 4 folks  who said they would buy that    Well, I want to be sure we understand that  we’re going to consult before we move [the funds rate]; we’re going to  do that in any case So these are triggering consultation more than  they are triggering action, and I think that should be borne in mind  in trying to resolve this    Here is a proposal, and you've got 3  minutes to decide and then we're going to lunch Steve is suggesting  that we could say this ""System open market operations are to be  directed at maintaining the weekly average funds rate at about the  current level, provided that over the February-March period the annual  rates of growth of M1 and M2, given approximately equal weight, appear  to be within ranges of 3 to 7 percent and 5 to 9 percent,  respectively If growth of M1 and M2 for the two-month period appears  to be outside the indicated ranges, the Manager will promptly notify  the Chairman, who will then consult with the Committee for  supplemental instructions""    Yes And there is no fed funds range    But he compromised; he gave you 3 to I    And if any of you wants to consult earlier, give  me a call I'm a very good consulter; I'll consult with the Committee  on whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions    No range on fed funds; leave it alone and  if we're within these ranges, we hang in there If growth moves out  of those ranges we consult with the Committee to see if anybody wants  to supplement the instructions This is known as ""copping out""    Well, the instruction would be to do that    Alan, do you have any problems with that?   M R   HOMES None at all, Mr Chairman    Well, we could have said it in fewer words,  couldn't we? Let's call the roll I'll vote for that, which is known  as the Axilrod compromise    Just as we've done in the last seven weeks    What we can read now is that we've decided  after our consultation not to lower the rate despite the aggregates  If anybody wants to read that the reverse is true now, they haven't  read recent history I'll vote for it anyway    Okay, we have two recalcitrants who can  finally redeem themselves by shifting their votes    We'll give you up to 6 words to improve  that if you change your vote   Well, what it says is ""while giving due  regard to the program supporting the foreign exchange value of the  dollar, to developing conditions in domestic financial markets, and to  uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS ""     2 / 6 / 1 9  -45-     Well, we could say ""to the uncertainties  associated with the introduction of ATS and other shifts""--    That phrase could be left out, really    We probably should take out the reference  to ATS; I think you're right, Bob We're singling out something  that's a dead horse We can just say ""due to uncertainties,"" the fact  that we don't really know Phil, we're up to you Did you shift your  vote?    While you're thinking about it, we'll go on  to consideration of the Manager's recommendation with respect to  foreign currency operations Alan Holmes    Alan, as I understand it, this informal  limit i s  really a limit [within the formal amount] of what otherwise  could be held under the Foreign Currency Authorization So what we're  doing is saying that if we're on the long side, it will be less than  the total allowable position--which could be bigger if we were on the  short side And I think that's a reasonable proposition, particularly  if it is to be coupled with your proposal to bring us a memorandum on  this so we can give it more careful attention I don't think we run a  risk during the period until you submit that memorandum, at the next  meeting or so, in contemplating that we could hold up to $500 million  of currencies Does anybody feel differently?    I don't think we will either But we have  [acquired] a billion dollars of D-marks in a couple of days which was  very favorable to us And we might have other occasions where we want  to continue--   M R   PARTEE Well, I don't think we ought to get ourselves  into a substantial long exposure willy nilly, but I think what Alan is  suggesting is within the range of operating necessity Nevertheless,  I would hate to see us acquiring $500 million, [going] up to $1  billion and then to $15 billion Those things sometimes happen     2 / 6 / 1 9  -46-     Also, we don't want to make such a decision  unless we intend to look at it in depth; this is not something we are  trying to sneak up on I just think we need some operating room    Absolutely    That's right    Then you are going to be long    ?my other comments? Alan, we need approval  on the rollover of some our maturing swaps, right?    Is everyone familiar with this?  [Information on] this has been circulated May we have approval of  that? Hearing no dissents, it is so approved I must say the vote on  our short-range specifications in the directive was 9 to 1 We had a  famous switch for the final count    Paul switched; Phil decided to be lonely  I thank you all for your patience It has been a very difficult task  to cope with this and we're breaking some new ground I hope we can  continue to make the process work to your satisfaction We will now  adjourn for lunch   END OF MEETING    	790206meeting 	790206staffstatements1 	790206chartshow 	790206staffstatements2    "
971,1979-03-20," Good morning, ladies and gentlemen The  time has arrived for our annual meeting This is a special meeting  because it completes the 12-month cycle [for Reserve Bank Presidents  to serve as voting members] Spring comes and the FOMC is  reconstituted I don't know if that is supposed to be a coincidence,  but we are one day ahead of time, aren't we? Tomorrow is the first  day of spring I guess we don't need to pursue that   So, the first order of business, at least from my point of  view, is to welcome the new voting members I believe you have all  been elected to your new responsibilities without too many dissents  Paul Volcker, you were re-elected Well, thank goodness! Bob Black,  Bob Mayo, Bones Kimbrel, and John Balles will serve as members, with  your alternates in line I don't think that requires action, but we  do note it   The first item on the regular [agenda] is to approve the  election of officers For that purpose I will turn over the meeting  to Henry Wallich to see if he has any suggestions for Chairman or Vice  Chairman I hope he has the right ones!    Could you elicit a second, Henry?    I think you need to get a vote    No objections? The way you put the  question the answer is ""no"" they wouldn't like to but ""yes"" they  would! Now we will get down to something serious, the other officers  DO you all have a list before you? No? I do All right, I will ask  the Secretary to read the list of proposed officers    Are there any other suggestions or  qualifications? All those in favor say ""Aye""   SEVERAL Aye    Opposed? S o  voted Now, before the  meeting, a number of items were sent to you that involve the  continuation of various authorities [in their existing form], with the  request that you indicate to us if you wished any of these to be  placed on the agenda We received no such indication and, unless I  hear a contrary view, we will assume that those items have been  approved Does anybody have any problem with any of those items?  Hearing none, we will proceed to item 2 on your printed agenda, which  is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for  the System Open Market Account This has been and is proposed to be  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Is there any dissent from that?  Hearing none, that will be approved   Next is the selection of the Manager of the System Open  Market Account, the Deputy Manager for Domestic Operations, and the  Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations We are proposing for those  positions Alan Holmes, Peter Sternlight, and Scott Pardee,  respectively Are those acceptable to the Committee? Hearing no  dissent, we will approve those   Next is the approval of the minutes of the meeting on  February 6 and of the telephone meeting on March 2, which have been  circulated to you [Secretary's note No transcript of the telephone  conference of March 2 exists in the Committee's files] Any comments,  corrections, or suggestions? Hearing none, we will report those as  approved and move to foreign currency operations with a report from  Scott Pardee    Thank you, Scott I should have mentioned  at the outset, and will now, that we are pleased to have you here, Tom  Gainor, for Mark Willes I hope you will join in at any time in the  discussion At this point are there any questions or comments on  Scott's report? Henry    Any other comments or questions? Thank  you, Scott We need a vote to ratify the transactions since the  previous meeting I understand [reports] have been circulated or are  available Is there any question? If there is no dissent, we will  record the ratification of those transactions and move on to the  domestic open market operations and a report from Peter Sternlight    Thank you, Peter Any questions or  comments? Yes, Chuck   M R   PARTEE Peter, the funds rate did average 1021 percent  in the week of March 14, according to the Bluebook So do you think  the market now perceives that as just an erroneously high number and  is thinking of a 10 percent rate as again being the level--?    Any other comments? We also need to ratify  the transactions on the domestic side since the last meeting The  reports have been circulated Any questions or comments? Hearing no  dissent, we will record them as approved   Now, in December the procedure we followed worked extremely  well and I thought we might try it again today In the intervening  meeting we had the more complicated issue of setting long-run ranges  today we are dealing [only] with the directive I am going to suggest  that we try the system where we ask Jim Kichline to make his report on  the economic situation and then get comments on policy from Steve  Axilrod Then we’ll do a go-around to get the comments from each of  you on your views of the economy and your feelings as to the policy  implications I’m looking not necessarily for quantitative but  qualitative views on where monetary policy should be going in the  intermeeting period Then after the break we can get down to the  specifics of the directive I think that worked extremely well before  and we will try it again if you are agreeable So, we will start off  with Jim’s report     3/20/79 -4-     Thank you very much, Jim Are there  questions of Jim before we turn to Steve?    Thank you for your decisiveness! Are there  questions of Steve, besides what did he say? Dave     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -7-    Certainly    May I interrupt this dialogue to give you a  flash? We always like to have some drama in these meetings! So if  you turn to page 8 in part I of your Greenbook, I have data that have  just flown in The second column on page 8 shows the [nominal] GNP  number at 150 percent for the fourth quarter of 1978; that has just  been revised by the Commerce Department to 156 percent If you go  across the columns to real GNP in the fourth column, it shows 64  percent, which was the last estimate we had; that has been revised to     3120179  -8 -    69 percent And the fixed weight business deflator was maintained at  the 80 percent shown If you go down one line to the data for the  first quarter of 1979, we have the first estimate of the Commerce  Department for quarter one    A projection, excuse me It‘s not an  estimate but a projection, for whatever it’s worth As you can see,  the staff has 122 percent for nominal GNP; the Commerce Department is  saying 106 percent If you go across to the fourth column, the staff  is now saying 30 percent [for real GNP]; the Commerce Department  projection is 14 percent If you go across to the deflator, the  staff has 96 percent and Commerce is now saying 100 percent Now  you can pursue your question, Dave I didn’t want you to get trapped,  you see   M R   EASTBURN I wouldn‘t have been if you hadn‘t given the  figures !   M R   AXILROD President Eastburn, the only way I think I can  answer is to say that, as you know, the System does no more than  accommodate to whatever amount of money the public wants to hold at  today’s interest rates So in that sense we could always have more  money [growth] if the System were to provide reserves more  aggressively and let interest rates go down in the short run That‘s  the way I would answer [As for] whether it’s a demand or a supply  phenomenon, it‘s very difficult to disassociate the two    I have John Balles next [on my list] and  then Larry Roos    Larry    Bob    Well, why don‘t we do a go-around before  our break As I said, I’d ask you to give your own ideas of how the  economy is going and what you think the policy implications are I  forgot where we started last time so we‘ll just start with Paul and go  around that way    NO, at this point, it‘s the qualitative  direction you think [on policy] rather than specifications Then  after the break we’ll come to those    Chuck    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Bob    Thank you, Bob Willis    The latter they can always do     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -14    That’s the one place where it‘s quite weak    Thank you, Willis So far it has been a  very cheerful report! Now we come to Dave   M R   EASTBURN Mr Chairman, before I start, could I ask you  a question? Is there anything that you would care to say about the  discussions going on in the Administration currently?    I don’t know that there’s anything I am  able to say The President is giving very careful consideration to  making some decisions about energy He hopes to do so by the end of  the month and then announce them I think he is perhaps trying to  bite off an awfully large number of issues I don‘t know whether  he’ll end up doing that Of course, the core one is whether he will  do something about decontrol or not But there‘s a whole series of  other things He has not made any decision so far; it’s a question of  options On the economic side, I think the main concern is whether  the wage and price standards program can hang together There is good  compliance by the major corporations, but there’s a feeling that  medium and small corporations are ignoring it They are going to put     3/20/79 -15-   some effort, I think to [change] that They’re also doing some  technical things They’re sweating it out as to whether they can get   to fall into compliance, but it has been extremely  difficult    I think the Administration is frustrated  There’s nothing much they can do in the fiscal area now that would  have much impact [in 19791 The deficit for this year is going to be  less in any case, mainly because inflation is higher and, therefore,  revenue flows will be higher And there has been some shortfall of  spending so that the deficit is now projected to be $33 billion [in  fiscal 19791 I wouldn‘t be surprised to see it near $30 billion  And yet if they begin to cut back their $29 billion deficit projected  for next year, that’s the short-term problem So I think they look  with great anxiety over to 20th Street and Constitution Avenue to see  whether we can contribute to a solution I don’t think they have any  particular views on what, if anything, we can do    Thank you very much Bones    Thank you, Bones Larry    I must need glasses, I guess All my life  I've never had glasses but I can't quite make that out    MB 10-5? I could read that as more bunk  for 10 minutes instead of 5    It's an historic occasion! Thank you,  Larry Roger    Thank you, Roger Bob    Thank you, Bob Tom    They built two houses!    Thank you, Tom John    Thank you very much, John Ernie    I didn‘t know anything was conspicuous in  Texas !    We're running a little low on time and I  wonder if you could just conclude    Thank you very much Frank    Thank you, Frank Phil    Do you agree with any of it?    Thanks Did you indicate which direction?    Thank you, Phil Henry    Thank you very much, Henry Well, this has  been very helpful I think the best thing to do is to take a break  for a few minutes and come back as near to 1130 am as we can and  see if we can wind this up   [Coffee break]    Let me make a couple of observations One  is that in the course of these four years of business expansion, we’ve  had all the elements of a long expansion And we’ve had some new  territory to explore since we‘ve had only one other period in our  lifetimes when there has been high inflation during peacetime in the     3 1 2 0 1 7 9  -24-   United States We‘ve had it in the whole decade but it’s higher than  even the ridiculous rates of 6 percent we had in the ‘ I 3  to ’75  timeframe We don’t have much in our models to help us understand  those periods There were peculiarities in that period related first  to the aftermath of mandatory controls and then the oil boycott, so we  can’t crank that into our model and assume that that was an experience  or a base from which all future periods of like rates will track   In this particular cycle we’ve had an usual experience where  we have alarmed the public about inflation in order to get policy  changes and they reacted by finding out that inflation is a danger,  which makes our policy direction more difficult Nonetheless, without  alerting them, we couldn’t get the policy changes And one of the  things that consumers did in the face of this was to engage in  preferring goods to money and, therefore, there was anticipatory  buying which worked against our efforts to cool the economy And  businesses, having been burned so badly in 1973-74, have behaved  extremely cautiously during this period Their investments in either  capital or inventories have been cautious On a net investment basis,  after replacement, we are not back to where we were at the prior peak  [Business firms] are actually investing less today than they were at  the peak of the last cycle on a net basis So there has been nothing  exuberant about business behavior They‘ve been quite prudent, I  think We now have recently [unintelligible] And the question  before the house is Does this mean that businesses also have begun  to cave in to the inflation psychology and have begun to opt for goods  over money? And will this create a speculative boom that [produces]  another peak of sustained inflation, which then will result in a  bigger bust?   Well, the data appear to be confusing To the extent that  any business decisions currently represent capital commitments, I  would say that we should have little concern Number one, the actual  expenditures will be spread over a time [period] that we all predict  to be soft economically at any case In terms of material actually  bought and paid for and labor actually employed, it will come at a  time when there’s not excessive economic activity To the extent that  it works on the supply side and deals with increasing capacity and  modernization and reduces unit costs and contributes to productivity,  we should all be applauding and encouraging it To the extent that it  represents inventory accumulation, on the other hand, it could be  dangerous because it could result in excess stocks, leading later to  cutbacks in production, thereby exacerbating the slowdown and tipping  the economy into unnecessary recession So one has to analyze that  Now, to the degree that stocks are being replenished because of [final  sales] in the fourth quarter being stronger than expected, that‘s part  of the solution To the extent that stocks are being accumulated  because of the fear that there may be a trucker’s strike or a rubber  strike, one has to admit that that’s not speculative behavior but a  prudent hedge which has an impact on the economy later but does not  represent a shift To the extent that the accumulation represents a  fear that the energy situation is a problem in terms of availability  and cost--[if that fear] is rippling through the world again and  feedstocks and petro-based products of all types and materials related  to that are being bid up--if that is either hoarding or a hedge or a  speculation, we have a problem And to what degree that’s all  happening [I don‘t think] any of us can judge     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -25-    In any case, what we do today is unlikely in my opinion to  have much impact on the real behavior of the economy for the next two  months Therefore, what we should be doing today is thinking about  what our policy direction should be as the year progresses, thereby  being more consistent with our longer-tern view that the monetary  aggregates affect the economy over time We could send up red flags  or white flags or yellow flags and people are probably going to behave  pretty much based on these other factors  situation is probably more overwhelming right now than anything else   S o  with all that, I would ask you to turn first to page 7 of  the Bluebook and thumb through to page 13 Look first at the staff’s  suggested alternatives for our directive for the period Then look at  page 13 where we can see [the projected outcomes relative to our long-  run ranges1 if, for example, we took alternative B and were within the  growth ranges contemplated for the aggregates for the next 2 months  under alternative B If we were pursuing M1 in the 4 to 9 percent  range and we hit the top of it, we would get growth back up to just  within our long-term range We’d still be below on M 2 ,  at the top of  our range on M3, and we would be just touching the bottom of our [Ml]  growth range; on bank credit we’d be at the upper bracket The  Bluebook also continues to present to you the rates of growth for  monetary aggregates that would be required to get back to the [upper  limit], the midpoint, or the [lower limit] of our own target ranges  over a period of time Those I believe are shown on page 10   How they view the energy   With all of that, my thought would be that the right posture  now is one of seeking to [guide] the aggregates back toward our  ranges, but not doing so with undue acceleration or signals of undue  concern by moving too rapidly I would be more patient for the reason  that I think the economy is going to pursue its own course right now  Nor do I think we ought to start to send any particular signals of  unusual tightening or monetary restraint because that wouldn’t do much  in the short term and in the long term it would work against our  desire, if we believe in our own ranges and the objective of getting  back inside the ranges For that reason I would be inclined to take a  moderate course of more or less even keeling where we are; I‘d [put]  our objectives for M1 and M2 in the 4 to 8 or 4 to 9 percent area  [unintelligible] Those are just my personal observations I would  appreciate having inputs from each of you   I might say that on the thrust of policy the score card reads  as follows John Balles, slight tilt toward a lower funds rate; Bob  Black, no action now; Phil Coldwell will tell us later; Bones Kimbrel,  some firming; Bob Mayo, hold the current position, although I gather  from what Bob said that a trifle more restraint would be acceptable;  Chuck Partee, what he said was that it‘s time to do something and  reading between the lines I think he’d like to ease Nancy Teeters,  no change in policy; Paul Volcker, some firming; Henry Wallich, hold  is what he actually said, but to demonstrate in some other ways that  we are continuing our concern about inflation, which we obviously are;  Ernie Baughman, maintain policy; Dave Eastburn, maintain the funds  rate but tilt policy to ease; Roger Guffey, if anything, move in the  direction of ease; Frank Morris, 9-112 percent today--    Larry Roos, err on the side of moving  toward ease; Willis Winn I’m not sure what you came down on, Willis    And Tom Gainor, hold the line So that’s  the rundown Now let’s see what you’d really like to do John  Balles    Thank you, John Bob Black    Thank you Phil Coldwell    Thank you, Phil Bones    Thank you very much Bob Mayo    Thank you, Bob Chuck Partee    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Paul    Thank you, Paul Henry    Thank you, Henry Ernie    Thank you, Ernie Dave    Thank you, Dave Roger    Thank you, Roger Frank    Thank you, Frank Larry    Thank you, Larry Willis    Thank you Tom    Okay As usual we have complete unanimity!  For M1, 4 to 8 percent seems to be the most popular range, with six  [members] And we have for M2 four who said 4 to 8 and four who said  3 to 7; we had one for 3-1/2 to 7-112 and one for 5 to 9 For the  funds rate, 5 people want 10 to 10-1/2 percent--six, I guess    I'm talking just about the voting members  Well, I have Phil Coldwell, Bones Kimbrel, Bob Mayo, Paul Volcker and  Henry Wallich That's five I miscounted, excuse me   ME1 COLDWELL The 10-1/2 percent is at least a ceiling on  all the ranges    Yes, nobody was over 10-112 percent    Yes, one of us, Nancy, had a 10-112 percent  top limit but that was with a 9-112 percent bottom Chuck had 9-112  to 10-1/4, Bob Black had 9-3/4 to 10-112, and John Balles had 9-1/4 to  10-1/4 But on the low side we had five with a lower limit of 10, two  at 9-1/2, and one each at 9-3/4 and 9-1/4 percent I haven't said  anything yet    Yes It looks to me as if we could cut  this on a 4 to 8 percent on M1 I don't know quite what to make of  M2, but 3-1/2 to 7-112 percent looks to be a mid-range [preference]  And the compromise area might be 10 to 10-1/4 percent on fed funds    Yes, and just have a money market  directive--stay or more less where we are That's what would seem [to  be closest to a consensusl How many would favor that?    As I look at this, I'd say the consensus is  to stay at about the prevailing rate, which is 10 percent plus Five     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -32-   were for the prevailing rate One--that was you--was for a lower  rate And Phil and Bones were for just a slight firming--I would say  something a little over 10, maybe 10-1/8 percent Some wanted higher    That's correct Well, let's try that one  in a quick straw vote On MI, 4 to 8; on M2, 3-1/2 to 7-1/2; on the  fed funds rate, continue in a 10 percent plus mode It has really  been about 10-1/8 percent, hasn't it? So let's say around 10 or  10-1/8 percent, in that range Paul, how would you feel about that?    You can't buy the funds range, all right  But you can buy the aggregates John?    The aggregates bother you?    I mean do the aggregates numbers that were  suggested concern you also?    Okay Bob Black    It shows a tick up    Phil    Bones    Which part of it didn't you like?    Bob Mayo    Chuck    Nancy    Henry    It looks as if we’re going to have a very  close vote today because we have those who think this is too tight and  those who think it’s too loose We have three who indicated they  could accept it and five who indicated they couldn’t Of those, John,  you would prefer it to be less restrictive?    The Chairman decides, obviously    But you said widen the range     3/20/79 -34-   M S   TEETERS No, [retain] the one we've been operating with,  the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent, which gets both ends of the spectrm    All right, let's try 9-3/4 to 10-1/2  percent Is that where we are now?   M S   TEETERS Yes    What was our directive last time?    That's what I thought    No, we had no range It's one of the few  times when we had no range at all However, let's try it with a 9-3/4  to 10-1/2 percent range now    From what 1 hear, let's try this on an  aggregates directive first    That means we stay where we are, the  prevailing rate We have 4 to 8 percent for M1, 3-l/2 to 7-1/2  percent for M2, 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent for the funds range and we  stay around 10 percent plus--10 to 10-1/8 is the maneuvering room--and  an aggregates directive Let's try it again Paul   Vice Chairman Volcker  President Balles  President Black  Governor Coldwell  President Kimbrel  President Mayo  Governor Partee  Governor Teeters  Governor Wallich   NO  Yes  Yes  NO  NO  Yes   Yes  yes  NO    I would vote for that, which means we would  have a 6 to 4 vote Okay, let's take a final vote Secretary, would  you read what it is we're proposing?    A n  aggregates directive    Okay, we have a vote There's some other  business for the meeting, I think    The next item is the consideration of the  Manager's recommendation with respect to foreign currency operations  Alan Holmes    Thank you very much, Alan Any questions  or comments? Henry    Any other questions or comments?    We can draw on the swap but we have to get  their concurrence    It cuts down our flexibility    Other questions or comments to Alan? Next,  we have distributed a memorandum from Peter Sternlight and Bob Mannion  on the Lending of Securities Unless there are any comments or  dissents, we could approve that    Yes    Do you want to review this in six months  instead of a year? Why don't we put it on the agenda for a 6-month  review and approve it the way it is instead of waiting for the full  year? And we will see how it goes    Okay, on that basis, may we have your  approval? Thank you very much The next item is a review of the  Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations Has that been  distributed?    Is there any change? Is there any dissent  from approving it? Hearing none, we will approve it Item 14 of the  agenda involves a, b, c, and d--the review of the Authorization for  Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, the  Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations,  and the Special Authorization No changes are proposed in ""a"" and ""d""  and minor changes are proposed in ""b"" Are there any questions about  those?    That's ""c"" and we will come to that in just  a second Any problems on agenda items 14a, b, and d? There are  minor changes in ""b"" But the changes involve taking out the word  ""proposed,"" which used to be before the words ""IMF article IV""  That's because it's no longer proposed; it's now effective That's a  big change! I hope you all will go along with that On those three  documents are there any problems? May we approve them? Yes, Bob    No, we are not there yet    Isn't that ""c""? Have you changed them on  me?     3/20/79 -38-    All right, then let's take the one that has  several proposed changes, the Procedural Instructions with respect to  Foreign Currency Operations, and deal with that Then we'll pick up  the others, which don't have changes, other than the minor one that I  mentioned Alan, do you or Steve want to comment on this?    Steve, any comment?    Are you all familiar with what is being  proposed? We went without limits for a while except the $ 8  billion  limit on the total position What's being proposed now is that we  limit the changes between meetings Would you review it for me?    I think you all have had a chance to review  [this memo] Are there questions now? Bob, you had a question     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -39 -     Yes, Henry    Are you all clear on what we are talking  about now? There could be no more than $300 million in one day,  right? And we are talking about a cumulation of $1 billion between  meetings We couldn't run this up [to $1 billion] in one day, Phil,  because at $300 million a day we would need three full days, or more  precisely 3 and 1/3 days, of maximum operation to get there So it  would have to be getting up there and we watch it every day I think  the Committee would really be doing something wrong if we were not  [aware] because we are in touch with this not [only] by the day but by  the hour often    We will do whatever the Committee wants  We can cut this back to $500 million or whatever you think, but I  don't think it represents a serious problem    I just have to disagree because we have had  to suspend these rules when we got into difficulty Now you want to  put them in so we can suspend them again if we get into difficulty  The only way we could operate on the day we did $1 billion dollars in  one day was to have some authority to do so   So on that day we did  suspend the rules You're kidding yourself about your procedures  because when we got into the real heat of battle you had to give us  complete authority Now you are saying while we don't have the heat  of battle put the limit down tight; and when we have the hear of  battle and the real danger comes and the authority could be abused,  we'll take it off completely That's poor procedure in my view    Do you want to cut it to $750 million?    Okay, two days or $600 million is fine  Does that suit everybody?   M R   HOLMES We can live with almost anything, but if we run  into trouble, we’ll come back The thing that frightens me the most,  Mr Chairman, is that if we get a sudden huge capital conversion and  the Germans come in and offer us, say, $350 million, I would much  prefer to be able to say yes right then and there--and [not] say I  have to wait and consult first--because [the $350 million] might not  be there when I get back    I think that’s all right We keep some  leeway We can operate that way With that amendment, to $600  million, may we have your approval? Any other questions or comments?  I don‘t want to cut this short, but hearing none--    Does anyone else feel negatively about  that? Certainly, if we get back into really active trading again, it  could run that [much]    Are there any other questions on that? All  those in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    Opposed?    So voted I believe that we have only one  other item unless there were questions on the other three parts of  agenda item 14 I assume that those with no changes and this one  little minor change are acceptable Is that correct? Hearing no  dissent, that’s approved The next thing is to confirm that our next  meeting is on April 17 and to adjourn for lunch, which will be in the  usual place Thank you all very much   END OF MEETING    	790320meeting 	790320staffstatements    "
994,1979-04-17," At least promptness is worth something  Accordingly, we will proceed with the agenda The first item of  business is to approve the minutes of the last meeting I believe  they have been circulated Are there any corrections or comments?  Hearing none, we will report those as approved Turning to foreign  currency operations, Scott has been taken suddenly ill and Alan,  therefore, will report on the foreign currency operations   M R   HOLMES I’m sorry Scott can’t be here to make this  report because it’s very near and dear to his heart It’s rather  historic [Statement--see Appendix]    Thank you very much, Alan Questions or  comments? Chuck    Henry     4 / 1 7 / 7 9  - 2 -     Bob Black    Phil Coldwell    Let me tell you what strategy Alan is  working under It has been a consistent one from November 1 [of last  year], which is that we would move in depth in both directions to  avoid disorderliness in the market  consistently, despite people who pressure us from time to time to do  something else   That's what we have been doing    Yes    Yes, indeed Notice what happened when the  Bank of Japan raised its discount rate The yen weakened against the  powerful dollar I'm sorry to interrupt but I wouldn't want Alan to  have to defend his own posture because it's one that he has been  working under in coordination with us And this is what we have been  trying to accomplish Other questions or comments?    Yes, Nancy    Thank you very much We now need to ratify  the transactions since the last meeting I believe you all have the  reports Are there any comments or questions or objections? Hearing  none, we will record the ratification of those transactions   Now we will turn to domestic operations Of course, we have  had great drama in this area since the last meeting We've come as  close as the nation could come to defaulting on its debt So Peter  undoubtedly will likewise have an exciting report   M R   STERNLIGHT I don't know if I will live up to the  excitement of that billing, Mr Chairman, although the delay in  [raising] the debt ceiling certainly did have an impact on operations  and on Treasury financing during the month [Statement--see  Appendix 1    Thank you, Peter Questions or comments?  Henry    Nancy    Chuck    Thank you all Again we need a vote to  ratify the transactions The reports have been circulated Are there  questions, comments, or reservations? Hearing none, we will record  those as approved We will turn now to the staff report on the  economic situation Jim Kichline    Thank you, Jim Let’s take a few moments  to see if there are any questions about this before we turn to Steve  Yes, Phil    No, go ahead Jerry    Mark    We show more inflation impact than the  Administration does?   M R   KICHLINE That’s right    I have used 05, which is what you’ve used  They have used much less, I believe    Yes, because of the lag effect    Willis    We'll just go [unintelligible] Paul    Thank you, Steve Yes, Larry, we'll have a  time for questions    John Balles    I think we have ""Balles rule number one""  now That near troughs and peaks forecasts of money are wrong in the  wrong direction    John, thank you for those inputs Chuck    We’ll have Henry Wallich’s question and  then start the go-around and see where we really come out    Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think it  might be appropriate now to start on item six [on our agenda], which  is a Committee discussion of the economic situation and policy  implications What we've been doing recently is asking for you  briefly to give your views on the economy, if they involve any  significant differences from the staff projection, and the monetary  policy implications this might have in general terms After our break  then we'll come back and look at the details and the specifications  that might go into a directive Murray Altmann has straightened me  out finally on my random walk theory and, based on his straightening  me out, I think we will start with Larry today and come around  clockwise from there    Thank you, Larry Bones    Thank you very much Jim   M R   SMOOT Yesterday in meeting with my own staff on this, I  think I suffered an information overload One of the alternatives  that was presented to me was called ""the pure ignorance theory"" That  is, we don't know how the economy got here and we don't know where  it's going And I must say that I felt embarrassingly comfortable  with that view Nevertheless--    That is the most honest comment we've had  today !    Thank you very much Willis    Fantastic I've never seen this happen at  these FOMC meetings before! Bob, you must have some different view    Thank you very much, Bob Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Chuck    They're netted out in M 7  aren't they,  Chuck?    Thank you, Chuck Paul    Plus or minus 3 percent    Thank you, Paul Henry    Thank you, Henry Phil    Thank you Jim    Thank you, Jim Ernie    Thank you, Ernie John     4/11/19 -19-    Thank you, John Mark    Well, I’m glad to get facts back into this  [discussion1 !    Thank you, Mark Bob    Thank you very much, Roger, and thank you  all Those were very interesting inputs I would suggest that we  take a 15 minute break and reconvene   [Coffee break]    While we're waiting, I'll merely say that  my impression prior to joining this Committee was that it was just a  social gathering of folks who enjoyed getting together once a month  But this meeting almost makes me believe that you've earned your pay--  excessive though it may be! I'm talking of the Governors, of course!     4/17/19 -22-   I think we're all back; Jim will be here in a moment I guess  Let me make two observations We've done a fast computer plot on your  comments and it appears that we have a perfect bell curve The  Secretary was predicting to me that we'd have a 5 to 5 vote and for  the first time in history there would be no new directive That would  mean that the Desk could go on doing whatever it is doing now, [even  though] nobody knows what it is However, just on the chance that we  can break the 5 to 5--    We continue with the old directive I call  your attention to page 5 of the Bluebook on which you see the three  alternatives the staff has laid out Having looked at that, hold your  finger there and I call your attention to page 9 If one [starts]  from the present position of Ml and M2 and plots out the ranges, in  the case of alternative B the staff didn't update their charts They  changed their minds on this after they printed [the chart on page 91  so, instead of 2-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, alternative B is actually 3 to  7 percent [in the table on page 51 But that's all right; you get the  point   The new dotted line is an innovation that I thought would be  helpful It plots from the last data the trend six months ahead to  get back to the midpoint--to show us how we're going to get back on  track This is known as the ""Black amendment"" Bob has been pushing  us to do this--to try to give us a graphic way of glancing at it So,  M1 would need to grow at a 6-1/2  percent rate for six months to get  back to the midpoint [of its long-run range] Obviously, we can't get  back on track in one month or two months without being too erratic but  [this shows howl to trend back On M 2  the ranges for alternative B  are 4 - l / 2  to 8-1/2 percent, and it would take a 9 - 1 / 2  percent trend  [growth] for six months to get us back to the midpoint of the [long-  run M2] range we established Page 10 shows the same sort of thing  for M3; we'd have to have a 9 percent rate [of growth to reach the  midpoint] and an M3 range consistent with alternative B would be 5 to  9 percent Bank credit of 6 to 8 percent is consistent [with  alternative Bl, and there the midpoint of that 2-month 6 to 8 percent  range happens to be consistent with getting back [to the middle of our  long-run range] in six months   Let me give you a couple of personal observations One, I  hope very much that we can develop a public view of the FOMC that we  perfom for substance and not for form That we don't do things  because they have some announcement value but because they have real  effects on the economy [Second,] I hope very much that we can  establish the view that we're going to take action because it directs  us toward where we intend to go and not because somebody this week or  this month has some transitory idea The more we get the idea  [across] that we have ranges [and] we're going to get within them--if  they're wrong we will change them--the more we do ourselves a service  That will diffuse the short-range idea that monetary policy can  somehow affect the concurrent operation of the economy, which in my  opinion it cannot do It's false for us to think that it can and it's  more important that we begin to educate the public that if there is  monetary action, it will have an effect in subsequent quarters It     4/17/79 - 2 3    should be looked upon as a leading policy direction rather than  something that’s going to affect today’s activity   I’ve been personally somewhat bemused by the use of the media  to send us a message that there are those who would like us to take  certain monetary policy actions There are limits to monetary policy,  limits to what we can do There are frustrations in other parts of  the government where their own policies have been disturbed by events  that they perhaps cannot control, and that may cause them to look for  monetary policy to do that which it cannot do  prices this month or next month It cannot change the real activity  of the economy Having looked at that and looked at our staff  projections, I would say that I view these projections as consistent  with the data I see on the general direction of the economy The  staff does not [pretend] that the quarterly figures can be achieved  precisely There‘s too much motion in the economy and the economy  will bounce around from quarter to quarter But I do believe their  trend is correct--that is, that the economy is in a slowing mode  Whether it will slow into a recession or a low level [of growth],  we‘ll see The action we take now will influence that real activity  six to nine months from now That’s what we‘re going to be doing  today   It cannot change   Looking at all of the factors, which you‘ve recited so well,  if we were really ready to bite the bullet [we could1 say that the  Federal Reserve knows what affects [economic] growth, we know how to  measure [the effects of1 our actions, and in our opinion the growth of  money and credit has been restrained because of our prior action TO  say we‘ve done nothing about inflation is to overlook the fact that we  went to considerable effort for a period of time to restrain the  growth of money and credit through the actions that we took, which  have resulted in those aggregates growing more slowly Now, some of  you say that’s because of a demand shift Well, that comes about  because we got the interest rates to the point where demand would  shift [After all], how did it come about? It’s just that we’ve  gotten [rates] in a range where [demand] would shift; and having  gotten them there, to say we’re going to ignore it is rather peculiar  to me because we are the ones who brought it about We raised  interest rates 3 ,  4 percentage points And we are getting the  restraint in terms of getting people to do something else with their  money instead of buying things We are beginning to get the impact,  as Willis pointed out So it would be rather peculiar if we should  then begin, as we have often done historically, to abandon our own  thinking and be affected by the transitory world around us and take an  action [as if it would affect the economy] for today instead of the  action [appropriate] for six or nine months down stream   If we were really geared up to do it, we would probably fall  in line with those who suggest that we begin to [consider easing] in  order to fulfill our commitment to the public on the levels we expect  these aggregates to be If we really believed our own monetary policy  recommendations, that’s what we would do We’re not prepared to do  that because we fear the expectations [effects]--the psychology--  because we haven’t yet educated the public to look upon us as doing  something [now that will have an impact1 in six months We’ve tended  to educate them, perhaps for our own egos, to think that what we do  today [has a] powerful [effect] in the economy And, therefore, we  ourselves have made our task somewhat more difficult by giving the     4/11/79 -24-   impression that what we are is somehow the bulwark in the fight  against inflation and we're going to change three price components  that have been out of control--namely, the cost of food, energy, and  housing We're going to lower those by tightening That makes no  sense at all We're going to lower them by bringing the economy down  to a lower rate of growth and damping demand and letting that work  itself through the system in the 6, 12, or 18 months that it always  has taken We're certainly not going to lower housing costs by  raising mortgage rates; that's going to change them up   So it seems to me that we would do ourselves a great service  if we would ignore all the static and keep on what I think under all  the circumstances is the wisest course And that is to keep a steady  hand, stay where we are, keep the aggregates under restraint over  time I do think that we have not prepared the public for the concept  of easing at this point And I think it would be a policy mistake to  take action now that would exacerbate the economic slowness later;  that in my opinion would only cause us to [face] a series of other  transitory pressures to do something else equally as unacceptable So  I recommend to you that we follow alternative B and perhaps use a  money market directive to maintain the funds rate about where it is  now With that recitation, perhaps we can go down the list and see  how you all see it John Balles    Thank you very much, John Bob Black    You'd keep the fed funds where it is Yes,  John?    Bob you were finished, weren‘t you?    Okay Phil    And where would you put the funds rate now?  Leave it where it is?    Bones Kimbrel    Okay, thank you Bob Mayo    Thank you, Bob Chuck    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Paul    Thank you Henry    A money market directive Ernie    And which way [on the directive]?    Alternative C and an aggregates directive  Thank you Roger    Did you say an aggregates directive?    Thank you, Roger Larry    Well, thank you, I think Mark    I knew I'd get you someday! Willis    Those are certainly things we have to  consider    Thank you, Willis Jim    Thank you, Jim Dick    Okay, thank you all Let's see what we  have Bob did you have a range for the fed funds rate?    What is it now?    We have a very mixed bag Paul, did you  want a money market or an aggregates directive?    We keep saying we're doing something else,  but we keep going with a money market directive, don't we?     4/11/19 -29-    Well, it’s going to be hard to make  anything out of this Five have the bottom of the fed funds range at  9-3/4 percent--1 told you it would be five to five--and one has it at  9-1/2 percent John, you said 9-1/2 percent on the bottom side?    Could we get you up to 9-3/4 percent? Then  we’ll have six    On the top side we have three at 10-1/4  percent and everybody else is at 10-1/2 save Henry, who is at 10-3/4  percent Have I misstated anyone’s views? I think Henry is the only  one at 10-3/4 As modified, John, you’re 9-3/4 to 10-1/4; Bob [Black]  had the same, 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 Phil and Bones had 10 to 10-1/2 Bob  Mayo had the “B” range, which is the [current one of] 9-3/4 to 10-1/2  percent Chuck had 9-3/4 to 10-1/4; Nancy, 9-3/4 to 10-1/2; Paul, 10  to 10-1/2; and Henry 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 That would indicate that  something like 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent might fly Let’s put that down  tentatively There are lots of 10-1/2s on the up side; we’re  bracketing everybody, you see We have nobody below [lo-1/2 percent]  and only one over it We’re going to have very little room for  dissent when we‘re through here!    We have one member for easing some and we  have five for prevailing [conditions] Now, if John Balles is a  reasonable man, he’ll stick with prevailing and we’d have six for  that    We have a range for the fed funds rate and  now the question is, do we keep the present [rate] or move it up or  down You suggested we move down Five other members of the  Committee suggested the prevailing rate And four others suggested  going up, although Bones did not; he said 10-1/8 percent and that’s  where we are now, more or less    Where we are is 10 to 10-1/8 percent, so  you are pretty much for the prevailing--   M R   MAYO I’m for prevailing also    Well, we have [a majority for] the  prevailing rate, obviously Now for the ranges For M1, there’s a  definite split Let‘s put down 3 to 8 percent We have two for 3 to  I ,  one for 4 to 8, one for 5 to 9, and a couple for 2 to 7 percent  Help me with my mathematics It looks as if we need something lower     4/11/19 -30-   to catch some who are interested in that possibility and something  higher to catch others    Well, we need two 3 to 8 percent ranges--3  to 8 on M1 and on M2 That’s the answer! Actually, we need 3 to  8-1/2 percent on M2 don’t we? Or 4 to 8-1/2 percent You all  wouldn’t stick with anything reasonable You had to have all this  individuality    Eight are calling for that directly and one  is near it Put down 4 to 8-1/2 percent There seemed to be a  majority for a money market directive, which means it’s all an  exercise anyway    Let me see if I can read what I have here  This is very hard Let‘s say a fed funds range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2  percent and maintain the prevailing rate, which now is 10 to 10-1/8  percent--is that correct, Peter?    The midpoint would be 10 to 10-1/8 percent,  the prevailing level The midpoint is slightly off center--asymmetric  if you want to be technical The rest is M1, 3 to 8 percent; M2, 4  to 8-1/2 percent; and a money market directive How many of the  voting members do we have for that?    An indication only    None Zero I knew we weren‘t going to  get a vote today! I told you we were going to keep [the existing  directive] Let‘s go [through] this How many are happy with the  9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent [funds range] with the prevailing [funds rate  initially]? We seemed to have 6 or 7 for that before I don’t know  what happened Because nobody likes the whole thing, I have to know  what’s wrong with it That [funds range] seemed to have a majority  There were about 6 or 7 people who wanted that Seven Okay, that  takes care of that    Obviously, it’s the aggregates that are  wrong All right, nobody wanted any of the aggregates [ranges I  cited] Let’s go back down the list John, what do you want for M1  on a compromise? You didn’t get your 5 to 9 percent the first time     4/17/79 -31-   around You were [not] the only one who went as high as 9, because  Bob [Black] outdid you--he went to 10 percent    Oh, we got them mixed up here    What I have down here is that John had 5 to  9 percent What did you really say before?    I‘m sorry, I’m talking M2    You had 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, right?    And you don‘t buy 3 to 8 percent Or do  you? It‘s a half percentage point each way--very precise tuning    Okay Let’s go down [the list] again  Bob, you had much higher ranges you had 5 to 9 and 6 to 10 percent    Could you live with 4 to 8-1/2?    Yes    You need 4 to 8 percent on M1    All right Phil Coldwell, you had 2 to 7  and 3 to 8      Okay Bones, you had 2 to 6 and 4 to 8      Okay Bob Mayo, you had 3 to 7 and 4-1/2  to 8-1/2    Okay Then you really can be bracketed  And you had an aggregates directive    That’s what we’ve been doing, yes Chuck,  you had 4 to 8 You don’t like 3 to 8?   m PARTEE Well, I really do believe we ought to have  something that brackets the path for getting back within the longer-  run ranges    And 3 to 8 percent didn’t do that?   m PARTEE No The 4 to 8 is close--6-1/2 percent is the  midpoint that is specified on that chart over the six months--so even  that’s a little short It really ought to be what Bob suggested, 5 to  9 percent But, I, of course--    Nancy, you had--    Yes, 3 to 7 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 Paul, YOU  had the 2 to 7 and 3 to 8 that Phil had specified    Henry, you had 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 and 4 to 8 as   ranges when the figure bounces around plus or minus 5 percentage  points   the ranges    All right, let’s try it again Where did  we come out? Murray, you’re supposed to do the rest! I think we can  sell 4 to 8-1/2 percent on M2    With 3 to 7-1/2 you didn’t pick up Mr  Partee, did you?    Yes, we have to look at the 7 and who wants  the--    We have to resolve this How do I do it?  I have to take some votes here on several options Just on M1, I’m  going to try 3 to 8, 4 to 8, and 3 to 7 Let’s start with 3 to 7  How many of those who vote would buy 3 to 1 percent? One, two, three,  four, five I’ll buy it, which makes six Well, wait a minute; I may  not Count five Who wants 3 to 8 percent? Anybody?    Which one of the three--3 to 7, 3 to 8 ,  or  4 to 8 We’re going to use those three choices for a moment; take  only one At 3 to 7 percent, I had five hands up All right now 3 to  8 percent John    All right, we’ll change it; we have 4 for 3  to 7 percent Right? And 3 to 8 percent suits me That’s two  Okay, let‘s try 4 to 8 percent That‘s two That adds up to 8, so  two people didn’t vote; two people want something different All you  folks at 3 to 7 go to 3 to 8, and all you folks at 4 to 8 go to 3 to  8 Okay? Now, 4 to 8-1/2 percent on M2 seemed all right [Let’s  assume for Ml] 3 to 8 percent--that everybody went in the middle So  now it’s 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent for the funds range, maintaining the  present rate of 10 to 10-1/8 percent, with an M1 range of 3 to 8  percent, an M2 range of 4 to 8-1/2 percent, and a money market  directive    No, it’s changed; it‘s absolutely changed  How many tentatively [can accept that], without voting [officially]  Paul    John    Which reason?    Okay Bob?     4/17/79 -34-    Phil Coldwell    Bones Kimbrel    Bob Mayo    So it's four and five What if we change  it to an aggregates directive? Let's try again with an aggregates  directive    There we are again! I suggest we go to the  next subject and have lunch I knew we were going to have no  directive today! Okay The next agenda item is--   I forgot to tell you that I have some information that will  not be public until this afternoon so you're not to disclose it, but  the housing starts for February have been revised to 1,384,000, and  for March the number is 1,793,000 The staff had 2 million in their  estimate, so the March number is lower than their estimate The  permits for March are 1,579,000 Jim, any comment?    No news to you   SPEAKER(?) Maybe after that we can reach a consensus     4/17/19 -35-    Do you want to vote again?    What is? Four?    All right, let's try that one I knew we'd  get a compromise here I threatened to leave it [and stay with the  existing directive]    Murray, we're going to take one more stab  at a vote Then we're going on to the next topic We're going to use  the same fed funds range, which is 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent and  [initially] we're going to maintain the present fed funds rate of 10  to 10-1/8 percent; we're going to have M1 at 4 to 8 percent and M2 at  4 to 8-1/2 percent; and we're going to have a money market directive  Okay Paul, you're just a constant no    I'll vote yes, so the vote is 7 to 3 It's  sort of simple! Would any of the dissenters like to change their  minds?    This is the water shed The fever has  broken and next month we will have a unanimous vote Now we will go  to the next subject, which is consideration of the Manager's  recommendation with respect to foreign currency operations Alan  Holmes     Thank you very much, Alan Quite an  unwinding job  was brought before the Committee previously and that is holding  balances in foreign currencies The Committee previously authorized  the holding of up to $500 million in foreign currencies But it was  the desire of the Committee to have the question of whether we should  hold larger amounts or none at all [studied by the staff] Developed   Now we need to have a discussion of the question that     4/17/19 -36-   for your consideration was a memorandum submitted jointly by Steve  Axilrod and Alan Holmes, with supporting memos from the Board‘s  International Division and from the New York Bank on possible  recommendations I might ask Steve and Alan to comment on this and we  will open it up for discussion Steve    Do you have a question for Steve, before we  hear from Alan?    Fine Thank you very much, Alan Now,  Larry, we will come back to your question or comment    I might mention, Larry, that at Henry‘s  suggestion the staff prepared some data on a series of currencies,  looking from 1973 to date at price adjusted exchange rate indices In  other words, the weighted average [exchange rates] would be adjusted  by CPI indices It might be worth sending this to the members of the  Committee just for their information It‘s very helpful One way to  look at it is that the difference between inflation rates of two  countries should be taken into account in terms of where those  currencies ought to be over a period of time One could also, in my  opinion, look at it in relation to the opportunity [costs of] holding  those currencies in terms of interest rate differentials That would  tell you whether the rates were being maintained in relation to [their  respective] purchasing power What will you be able to buy at the end  of the year--or after two years--by holding one currency over 12  months as compared to holding another currency over that 12-month  period? None of these ways is perfect, but they are indications I  think what Alan and Steve and others are getting at here is that if  there were a real departure from anything that could be rationalized  by inflation or interest rate differentials, we might want to say,  well, there is just total disorder in the market And we’d have to do  something as we did on November 1 to get it back in line We hope  that doesn’t happen again, but it can happen; basically it happens  when we have failed to keep up with the situation for too long    Next [on my list of people who want to  comment] is Chuck, then Bones, Phil, and Henry Chuck    What is the legal point? Paul is asking  about the legal point of holding foreign currencies    They listed what we could hold Is that  what you’re saying?    It’s the absence of a security that didn’t  exist It didn’t exist so it’s not on the list     4/11/19 -39-    That's quite different, I think There was  no expressed desire to prohibit There were just no such securities  around, so they didn't list them    Bones    Phil Coldwell    Thank you, Phil Henry    Thank you, Henry Paul    It seems to me that what has been  recommended is by no means a suggestion that we become symmetrical  When we were talking about going short we were talking about some $20  billion dollars--more than that actually [including] the Treasury and  ourselves--that we would borrow and have to pay back If we were  being symmetrical, we would want to authorize a $30 billion package on  the [long side]    We would have $30 billion on one side and  $30 billion on the other side, a $60 billion band No one would want  to do that I don’t have a strong feeling on this, but the question  before the Committee is Do we at least want to deal in what is less  than one swap line--in a series of currencies on the long side--as a  way of continuing the operation of moving in depth to counter swings  in the dollar, which is very strong again today? And we‘re not trying  to peg it As I say, we have had static occasionally from our  [counterparts] about pegging or whatnot, but we have not tried to do  that Alan has consistently taken the view--sometimes with a few  bruises--to let [the dollar] go a little and move in as it goes up and  cushion it S o  it probably wouldn’t mean the end of the world today  whether we approve this or we don’t I think some of the things Phil  said are very worthwhile If we do this, we might well want to put a  limit of a billion dollars for any currency and we certainly want to  list the currencies we’re talking about [acquiring], which would be  only the major currencies At the moment we’re only talking about  three currencies but we might want to add to that I don’t know that  we even need to add guilders or anything else at the moment    But it wouldn’t be the world’s mix of  currencies, I take it    They include the Austrian shilling, the  Belgian franc, the Canadian dollar--     4/11/79 -42 -     No, no But this is the list Austrian  schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, British  [pounds] sterling, French francs, German marks, Italian lire, Japanese  yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Swedish  kronor, and Swiss francs    Yes That's the list We could do  anything else we want I think the point of limiting it to a billion  dollars in any one currency is a wise one And I [agree] that even if  we want to do this, we would be very wise to have consulted with the  Hill and with the Administration before we [proceed] I think those  are very good comments    We could limit it to $1 billion without  prior permission from the Committee    John Balles    Bob, did you want t o  comment?    We lose Managers if the spirit gets  violated!    Thank you Ernie Baughman    Thank you Chuck    I thought we were doing it so the crops  would sell better abroad and maybe get more money on the farm That‘s  what I thought we were doing That‘s what Henry has been teaching me    It’s still our biggest export    I have exactly three minutes to wind up  this meeting so we can get across the street for lunch I hope we  will have time for discussion, particularly of the monetary  improvement program, at lunch    Let's quickly check [vial a tentative vote  on this proposition to indicate an agreement in principle--not on the  details If there is a sentiment in favor holding up to $2 billion,  let's come back at another meeting with the details worked out and  some specific proposals We don't need to work on that proposal if  there is no sentiment for it So tentatively, Paul, how would you  vote?    John Balles    Bob Black    Phil Coldwell    If those details came in to your  satisfaction Bones    And I think I would favor it That means  we have 8 to 2 [in favor] And we can have a unanimous vote if we can  get John and Chuck to straighten up and fly right! How about those  who are not voting members? I'd just be curious because I would like  to know what the general feeling is Ernie?    And we have First Vice Presidents McIntosh  and Smoot  "
1016,1979-04-27," All right, you are all on This is the process of consultation  following [our practice] in recent months when we’ve had variations in the growth of the money  aggregates from expectations Our consultations in the past have involved circumstances where  money growth was weaker than expected and we have wanted to he sure that we had an accord in  the Committee before deciding on the continuing instructions to the Desk This time the money  aggregates are growing more strongly than had been anticipated, so we also would like to get your  sense of how we should proceed Let us start off first by looking briefly at what is happening in the  economy to see what new data or updated data we have that would guide us Jim Kichline is here  to give us a brief review    Thank you very much, Jim Let’s continue with the  briefings before we come back to any questions I would ask Steve Axilrod to comment on the  aggregates numbers themselves   M R   AXILROD Thank you hk Chairman The Committee had a target rate of  growth for M1 for the two-month April-May period of 4 to 8 percent, and for M2 a 4 to 8-1/2  percent target rate We are currently estimating for the April-May period for M1 a growth rate of  8-314 percent, which would be 314 of a point above the upper end of the range That [reflects] an  April growth rate of around 17-112 percent because of the recent sharp rates of growth in the weeks  of April 1 lth and April 18th that we just published and the preliminary unpublished data for April  25th that show a further increase of $12 billion That’s after the $4 billion rise in the April 18th  week and we have assumed a fairly noticeable decline in subsequent weeks So on the assumption  that the level of M1 at the end of May will be about $2 billion lower than it is at the end of April,  we would have a zero rate of growth in May We believe that there are special factors in the April  figure that make it reasonable to assume a decline in the level of M1 following this late April  [period] There seems to be evidence that the Treasury is accelerating refunds because of some  laggardness earlier and also accelerating them so rapidly that it may be getting [funds] out that  would ordinarily have gone out in May Secondly, there is evidence that the Treasury had delayed  collecting checks that had been sent in by people to pay income taxes That, of course, would have  left more money in private demand deposits waiting for collection by the Treasury as the days have  been going by in late April Our staff has estimated the effect of these special factors to be on the  order of, say, 7 to 9 percentage points in April The ATS shift, by the way, was worth about 28  percentage points at an annual rate in April So if you added that to the 174 percent, growth [in  Ml] would be at a 202 percent rate for that month Time deposits as well are running relatively  strong and for M2 we’re estimating growth for the two-month April-May period at 8-112 percent--  the top of the Committee‘s range--with April estimated at 13-1/4 percent and May estimated at 3-  1/2 percent   Very quickly, Mr Chairman, I think there are two other points that ought to be  brought to the Committee’s attention The bank credit figures have been revised-it’s a benchmark  revision--by the staff They’ve been revised upward for the last half of ’78 and the first quarter of  ’79 Formerly, in the first quarter of 1979, bank credit rose 112 percent; on the revised basis it’s  128 percent Business loans had been up 176 percent; on the revised basis it’s195 percent, though  still showing the pattern of a high January, low February, and an even lower March Data for April  suggest a very strong rebound in bank credit But this too, like the [behavior of] M1, is related to  some extent to the high tax payments that are occurring     4/27/79 3   Then finally, Mr Chairman, on the market, short-term rates have dropped since the  Committee meeting because the market had been expecting a tightening and with the funds rate  remaining unchanged short rates dropped Also, there was the unwinding of the Treasury’s large  cash management bill offering in early April While short rates were dropping--though they did rise  this morning because of the large M1 figure that was published for the week ending April 18th-  long rates rose [That occurred] in part because the Treasury has announced a $4-114 billion  refunding, with half of that going into the 30-year bond area and in part also because the corporate  market was adversely affected by the bad publicity on public utilities and there were fairly large  public utility offerings this week In addition, rates have risen in the mortgage market, partly  reflecting these corporate bond yields but also reflecting the weakening of inflows into thrift  institutions The [growth of] April inflows to S&Ls has been reduced to around 7 percent and the  data for early April suggest a further weakening of inflows relative to what had happened in  previous Aprils, and April ’78 was a weak period So the evidence on the mortgage market is for  fairly constricted growth in credit availability there That’s all I have, Mr Chairman    Peter Sternlight, are you on the line?    Before we turn to Committee members I’d just like to ask  you for your comments on the market situation as you see it and any comments you would have on  the directive as it now stands if we were not to give you new instructions The directive now reads  --as we all recall it was a money market directive--that with equal weight given to M1 and M 2  if the  rates of growth appeared to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges,  the objective for the funds rate was to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range  So, Peter, could you just give us your comments on how you see market conditions now and how  you would interpret this directive unless we give you any additional [instructions]?    Thank you, Peter I’m going to suggest that at this time I  go down the roll--first of the voting members of the Committee and then the other Presidents or  their representatives--and ask for your views, in light of these circumstances, on what our posture  should be If you have any specific questions on the information provided by the staff we would  welcome those, but I hope the situation is clear enough that we can just get your advice on what you  personally would recommend at this time Let’s start alphabetically with Bob Black    Thank you, Bob Phil Coldwell I hope you’re on    I’m sorry you missed part of the discussion earlier but I  think you know the facts and the background in any case    Thank you, Phil Bob Mayo    Thank you, Bob Chuck Partee   h4R PARTJ3E Well, we have been looking at the figure moving up for the last  three weeks, Bob, and it is pretty high    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Paul Volcker    Thank you very much, Paul Henry Wallich     Thank you, Henry At least that’s a sign of consistency;  you weren’t paying attention to the aggregates before and you’re still not I think that’s a good  move At least it shows [consistency]    I realize that and I commend you for sticking with your  guns because that’s the point you made at the last meeting, as I recall Now we have Roger Guffey,  who is the alternate for John Balks, as I understand it    Thank you, Roger Next we have Larry Roos who is the  alternate for Monroe Kimbrel     4/27/79 I    Another consistent one!    Let me go on I hope Ernie Baughman is now on the line    Thank you very much, Ernie Willis Winn    Thank you, Willis Frank Morris    Thank you, Frank Dave Eastbum I hope Philadelphia is  still with us    Thank you very much, Dave We have Kyle Fossum on for  Monroe Kimbrel So, Kyle, we’ll hear from you   M R   FOSSUM It’s a close call for us but we come down on the side of holding  where we are and viewing [developments] for another week or so before we would suggest  changing I would report, though, that in a conference call with our Bank‘s executive committee  this morning the discount rate was discussed and there was some inclination to snug it up a bit    Thank you, Kyle We have Tom Gainor on for Mark  Willes   M R   GAINOR Mr Chairman, we would favor no change We’d like to see two or  three more weeks to test whether the April figures are significant    Thank you, Tom John Williams for John Balks   M R   WILLIAMS We would agree with Frank Morris We’d be strongly opposed  at this time to any [increase] in the federal funds rate We think that April is not the month that we  want to respond to, particularly if the data are on the high side--April being not a typical month and  also a very unreliable month So until we get further confirmation of this upsurge in the aggregates,  we think it would be very premature to move We would recommend waiting until the May data  come in    Well, thank you all very much It shows you that I was  right at the last meeting when I said it would take a month before we get to be unanimous We  haven’t reached [unanimity] yet It’s a very interesting situation Without my vote we have five of     4/21/79 9   the voting members who would prefer moving up to 10-1/4 percent and four who would like to  stand pat Of the nonvoting members we have six who would like to stand pat and one who would  edge [the funds rate] up It’s an amazing dispersion and leaves us with a circumstance that is not  very appealing After listening, and recognizing all of the risks and difficulties, on balance I think I  would tend to encourage the Desk to follow the directive that we have and therefore to tighten up a  bit I would like to suggest, because with this dispersion I don’t think an official vote does us all  much good, that we merely view this consultation as a consultation involving advice and [guidance]  on how the Desk should act I hope that will be agreeable to everyone because this is a close one to  call I think everyone had a persuasive argument on both sides [but] the differences in terms of  what really will be done are fairly narrow And that being so, my tendency would be to follow the  directive as we’ve written it, which the Desk would interpret as meaning they should be moving  [the funds rate] up to 10-114 percent Let me just run through [my list] quickly to see if anyone  objects to that procedure or that conclusion Bob Black    Phil Coldwell    Bob Mayo    Chuck Partee    Nancy Teeters    Paul Volcker    Henry Wallich    Of course Roger Guffey   MRGUFFEY Fine     4/21/19 10    Larry Roos    Ernie Baughman    Willis Winn   MRWwN Yes   CHAIMAN MILLER Frank Morris    Dave Eastbum   M R   EASTBURN I guess it’s all right    Kyle Fossum   M R   FOSSUM Fine with us    Tom Gainor    John Williams   M R   WILLIAMS Okay    Thank you all You’ve been patient and very, very helpful  I appreciate it and I hope we’ll get our [phone] system working a little better It was so perfect  before We’ll put our technicians to work so we can try to get our equipment functioning better I  really think this opportunity to consult is valuable, so I hope we can do it from time to time Thank  you We’ll close now   END OF SESSION    	790427confcall    "
1039,1979-05-22," Good morning, ladies and gentlemen  Welcome to our FOMC meeting Initially I would like to inform YOU--I  think everyone knows this--of the passing of Angus Powell last  Saturday He Certainly was a dedicated [Reserve Bank] Chairman and  was courageous during his years of illness And we certainly shall  miss him   Second, I would like to call to your attention something that  happened in the [intermeeting period] that is of concern to me and I  hope is of concern to you My experience so far at the Federal  Reserve has been rather impressive in terms of the security with which  our deliberations are handled, but on May 1 there was an article in  the Washinaton POSt where two different reporters independently had  received information about FOMC proceedings which they quoted as from  Federal Reserve sources T believe they are reliable reporters and I  believe they could be expected to be accurate in that respect The  fact that either through inadvertence or sloppiness or deliberate  disclosure any activities of the FOMC were reported to the press is of  considerable concern to me   One of the reporters is James Rowe who now works for the  Washinaton POSt in New York, though he was in Washington for a long  time His source may not have been from the New York Bank--I'm not  saying that--but he got his information while serving in New York  The other reporter is John Berry, who is here in Washington The  first reported that there was [an intermeeting] vote That  information was inaccurate, so whoever the Federal Reserve source was  it apparently was not someone who is directly involved in the FOMC or  if so that person was disguising his or her comments But it would  appear more likely that these sources are people on our staff  someplace who have picked up information from conversations or reports  and have translated that somehow in responding to reporters   [Let me cite some examples from the articles] ""Informed  sources said that today the Board apparently was concerned with world  financial markets"" That wasn't even discussed in the telephone  consultation, as I recall So that's incorrect They reported that  there was a vote, which is [also] incorrect ""Sources said the Fed's  policymaking Open Market Committee held a special telephone meeting  last Friday"" Well, that's true; it was a consultation ""The Federal  Open Market Committee was closely divided on the question during the  telephone meeting"" ""Fed sources said the agency does not believe the  $41 billion jump tin M11 is cause for alarm"" Other examples  include ""One source noted;"" ""however, sources explain that the  action  ; ""which sources said;"" etcetera I think this means  that all of us have an obligation to somehow tighten up on our  discipline about this sort of thing It would be very upsetting if we  were to get into a posture of trying to imitate other irresponsible  agencies of government that do not have any way to maintain  confidential information   [ A s  for how this could happen], there seem to be several  possibilities One is just sloppiness in terms of with whom  conversations are held and under what circumstances--too often     5 / 2 2 /  I 9  -2 -    speaking freely in front of those who are not and should not be privy  to FOMC [materials or deliberations] Another is that there seems to  be a tremendous American sensitivity to [a perceived1 responsibility  to answer any reporter And that's just false No reporter has a  right to place a call and get you or any of your people on the line  he can be ignored Here any reporter who calls my office is referred  to Joe Coyne If it is a legitimate question and it would be  appropriate to respond, we arrange to do it Also, we have found that  there are con artists There are people who call secretaries--and we  have had instances of this occurring recently--where consequent  information gets out by the caller using a false name and by creating  with the secretary the impression that he has some knowledge [about  what is going on at the Federal Reserve] By doing that, suddenly  information may get spilled out, because the secretary thinks, ""Well,  if you know that, you might as well know the rest of it""   I just hope that you share my concern and will be willing to  look at how, either through education or better discipline, we can  avoid [a recurrence of] this sort of thing   Next, I want to report that when I was visiting the Federal  Reserve Bank of Cleveland recently, Willis Winn had the effrontery to  present me with a gift The thing that impressed me about it, if you  look at it [closelyl, is that I decided Willis had a message So the  message is that when he speaks today, I will turn this [hourglass]  over and there will be no sand to run, so he will immediately be cut  off from speaking And for those of you who behave, I will give you  your 3 minutes with the other one But this one is for you, Willis!   M R   MAYO In proper interbank rivalry, Mr Chairman, I am  deeply hurt that you didn't bring the T-shirt that we gave you    Oh, yes, I must bring in the T-shirt But  I haven't got it because immediately when I brought it home my wife  confiscated it And she said she wanted one from every Federal  Reserve Bank so she could have 1 through 12, or A through L or  whatever it is Is it L or K? What's San Francisco? It's L I  thought I was right the first time So I must follow that up    That's a reversal of policy We have been  r u i n g  the Fed for a long time offering things to nonmembers for  $2 00  and to members for $1000    Well, let's move on to our meeting Our  first action is to approve the minutes of the meeting of April 17   These have been circulated Are there any changes or corrections?  Hearing none, we will record those as approved Second is a report on     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  - 3 -    foreign currency operations since the last meeting, and Gretchen  Greene is here today to give us that report    Thank you, Gretchen Any questions? Yes,  Dave    Dave    Chuck    Phil    [Our earlier purchases amounted to] $185  million [equivalent], as I recall Of course, [their dollar value]  changes with the value of the yen, doesn’t it? So I’m not sure [what  it is] from day to day   Our next order of business is to ratify the transactions in  foreign currency operations since the last meeting I suppose a  historic note on paying off all of our swap debt is in order You  have received the [written] report, I believe Are there any comments  or questions? If there’s no dissent, we will ratify the transactions  Thank you very much, Gretchen Let’s move to the report on domestic  open market operations from Peter Sternlight     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -5-   M R   STERNLIGHT [Statement--see Appendix]    Thank you very much, Peter Questions or  comments? Henry    Well, Peter, thank you very much Excuse  me, Phil, [did you have a question]?    Thank you Our next action is to ratify  the transactions on the domestic side since the previous meeting You  have the reports Are there any comments or questions? If there is  no dissent, we will record the transactions as approved   I asked Murray Altmann at the last meeting to give me a  rundown on how we've been doing with our individual forecasts Did  you distribute this to everyone? Well, I must arrange for you to get  this [tabulation], which has your forecasts from March of last year  when we looked at the period from quarter four '77 to quarter four  '78 It turned out that the actual increase in real GNP was 43  percent The staff had 44 percent So, Jim, I must say that's  fairly close However, only 5 of those governors and presidents who  were then participating had c431 percent within their ranges Now  on prices, the actual increase was 88 percent The staff had 6  6   percent, not so close Nobody had a figure as high as 88 percent  The highest were our perennial optimists, Henry Wallich and Willis  Winn, who had 8 percent as the top of their ranges But they were the  only ones with an 8 even showing    This was the fourth quarter of 1978 over  the fourth quarter of 1977 We were meeting in March of [19781 and  [since] that time we haven't done any update Unemployment at the end  of the period, in the 4th quarter of 1978, was 58 percent The staff     5/22/79 -7-   had forecast 59 percent And five of the participants had 5  8   percent within their ranges Now, in June [of 19781, we looked at the  [first] quarter of '78 to the [first] quarter of '79 The growth in  real GNP was 31 percent and not a single person came in that low, nor  did the staff Everybody was higher The staff had 38 percent No  one was as low as 31 percent Prices rose by 91 percent No one  even came close The staff had 73 percent And the unemployment  figure was 59 percent and, of course, the staff was at 59 percent,  having figured that precisely!    There were four of us who had that also  In the future when you consider the staff forecasts and criticize  them, remember they're not too bad compared to those made by the rest  of us So we turn to you now, Jim, for your new forecast and how you  see things    No, we didn't want the staff [of the  Research Division] to do this; Murray did it so we'd have an objective  [observer] The other members of the staff didn't even know it was  being done    Thank you, Jim Are there any questions  before we go on? Yes, Larry    Phil Coldwell    Sent by whom?    Well, we need higher prices for food!    John Balles    John, you mean a bounceback to 22 percent?     5/22/79 -9-    A hop?    Jim, the information on durable goods  orders will be released at 230 today Do you have those data yet?    They will show a significant decline in  orders in April    I don’t have the details Overall it is  quite a significant decline Bob Mayo    Frank    Do you want me to tell you your record?    Henry    Chuck    Nancy    It's the July 1 factor    That will fill many columns of newspapers  in July Willis Winn    Thank you all for your questions and  comments Let‘s turn now to Steve for his observations Then we’ll  do our go-around    Thank you, Steve I would suggest we begin  to go around the table I think last time we started with Larry  [Roos], didn't we? We'll switch over this time and start with Roger  [Guffeyl and come around the other way I think the procedure we've  been using recently has been helpful and I would suggest that we  follow it again That is, let's limit comments on the economy to any  variance from what has been projected by the staff Then each of us  should give a general indication of the policy posture that should be  followed without specifying the exact numbers Just say generally  whether it implies steady as we go, a tightening or easing up, or any  other thing So let's start with Roger and go around    Thank you, Roger Bob    Thank you, Bob Mark    And give us the wisdom to know the  difference    Thank you, Mark John   M R   BALLES Well, when I asked the question of Jim Kichline  about what the case is for a bounceback in the second quarter, I  probably tipped my own hand as to my increasing skepticism I'm  afraid that what I see is pretty much what Bob Mayo sees in terms of a  probable cyclical peak in this quarter As a matter of fact, our  forecast for some time has been showing a short, shallow recession  beginning in the second half of this year and going into the first  quarter of 1980 But that's obviously just as judgmental as yours,  Jim, and I don't know that it's any better than yours Nevertheless,  it is different The recent news that has come in for the second  quarter when we were expecting what I mistakenly called a bounceback  and was corrected by the Chairman--it's more of a little hop, if  anything--gives me some real concern This is the time in the  business cycle when we could get some very unpleasant surprises We  certainly got one in the first quarter and I would be prepared to see  one in the second quarter, I'm afraid     5/22/79 -18-   As for what to make of this troublesome development whereby  bank credit has been growing more rapidly than the aggregates, our  staff has recently updated their analysis in that area I must say,  after looking at it, that I don't really think the strong growth of  bank credit proves very much If we look back at earlier cycles, we  find that bank credit tends to be more or less coincident with the  cycle That was certainly  true in the ' 7 3 - ' 7 4  recession where the deceleration of monetary  growth preceded the peak in that business cycle and the formal  recession by quite a few months  bank credit would accelerate at this time in the cycle Corporate  liquidity is down, as Steve has correctly pointed out, and  corporations wish to avoid locking themselves into high long-term  rates Hence, they turn to their banks for credit accommodation and  try to wait out the period of high rates and plan to do some funding  when long-term interest rates are coming down So on balance I'm  really not impressed at all by the fact that bank credit has been  growing faster than the monetary aggregates   It peaks very shortly before a downturn   There are all sorts of reasons why   During April we fought the ""battle of the bulge,"" as I call  it, on M1 It is said to have gone up at a 11 percent annual rate  [But] as the staff knows well, in view of the history of earlier  Aprils, in our monetary theories it's tremendously difficult to  compute seasonal factors for the month of April I sympathize with  the staff on this But 17 percent could later turn out to be 8-1/2  percent or something like that If we look at Aprils of preceding  years, seasonal factor corrections have been made following the  benchmark revisions and have involved some pretty [big] downward  revisions Whether that will occur for this April remains to be seen  But it's probably the most unreliable month in the year in terms of  getting a good fix on what is really happening Since the May figures  as now projected by the staff--correct me if I'm wrong, Steve--show a  1 percent rate of growth for M1 and a 54 percent rate for M2 I  wonder if it isn't time to unwind the snugging up of the funds rate  that we did in April We were leaning against what at that time  appeared in the best judgment of the staff to be a bulge in the money  supply In view of the figures that we already have for April and  those projected for May I wonder if we should inch the federal funds  rate downward a bit In short, based on my perceptions of spreading  weaknesses in the economy and on the long cumulative impact of  monetary growth well below the target range, even considering the  April figures--and with May coming in on the weak side and the June  projections weak--in my opinion this is no time to be snugging up any  further If anything, I would lean toward reversing the April action  on the funds rate That's all, Mr Chairman    Thank you, John Ernie    Thank you very much, Ernie Frank     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -20 -     Thank you, Frank Phil    Thank you, Phil Henry    Thank you, Henry Paul     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -22-     When is our next meeting?   SPEAKER(?) July [ill    Paul, there’s some sentiment that we should  act like Congress and go home for six months and everything would get  better!    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Bob    Thank you, Bob Willis    Thank you, Willis Dave    Thank you, Dave Monroe    Thank you very much, Bones Larry    With life expectancies what they are today,  Larry, who knows? Thank you all very much With that degree of  wisdom--I cannot say unanimity--perhaps we should take a break and  think about it We can come back in 15 or 20 minutes and make a  decision Is that all right with everybody? We will recess now   [Coffee break]    Are we all back? Anyone who is not here  please speak up! Are any other chairs vacant?  The durable orders figures are now available; they will be released at  2  3 0  pm so we should keep them confidential until then I haven't  seen the details but you now have them, Jim, so why don't you just  give us the rundown   We are missing Phil    This is April over March?    March was revised, incidentally    Thank you, Jim To proceed with our  discussion of current monetary policy and the domestic policy  directive, I have asked Steve to take his unpopular theory, which  didn't exactly gain wide support and enthusiastic applause, and reduce  it to something specific so at least we can start off this discussion  with something before us    Steve, thank you I think it might be  helpful for the Committee to turn to page 10 of the Bluebook There  you have, in effect, a display of the alternative B ranges Jot down  in pencil that the alternative B range for the federal funds rate is  10 to 10-1/2 percent All the other data for alternative B are there  You will recall that Steve is suggesting 0 to 5-1/2 percent [for the  M1 range] but alternative B as printed is 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent; and  the dotted line shows that 3-1/2 percent is the rate of growth we  would need in M1 from April for six months to get us to the midpoint  of our long-term range Likewise, for M2 the alternative B range  shown is 4 to 8 percent and Steve is suggesting 4 to 9 percent  Again, the dotted line--going out to 8 percent in the future--is the  rate at which M2 would have to grow for six months to be at the  midpoint of our long-term range Why don't we start with our Vice  Chairman Paul, what would be your suggestion?    Thank you, Paul Did you say you would  agree with the money market directive?    Now let’s start alphabetically John  Balles    You mean an old money market directive  instead of the managed money market directive we’ve been using    Do you want us to skip you for a moment?   M R   BALLES May I?    Sure Bob Black   M R   BLACK I'll be glad to help him out, Mr Chairman! It  seems likely to me that any further tightening could certainly  aggravate any recession that might be developing At the same time, I  don't think we ought to abdicate to the forces of inflation So I  think Steve has done remarkably well in choosing the proper ranges  Though mine were slightly different, I can buy his ranges completely    That is helpful I didn't think I'd see  that    Phil   M R   COLDWELL Mr Chairman, the ranges Steve suggested are  just about one half point off my suggestion I thought we ought to go  from 0 to 5 percent on M1 On M2 I had 4 to 8 percent rather than the  4 to 9 percent; I could accept 8-1/2 percent It seems to me that the  10 to 10-1/2 percent range on federal funds is a bit narrow, but given  the way we are consulting I guess it doesn't matter if we're going to  move it up [as necessary]    Why don't we just do away with the Desk and  have a daily conference?    Thank you, Phil Bones    And otherwise the same? The fed funds  range is okay as proposed?    Thank you very much, Bones Bob Mayo    Thank you, Bob Chuck    Thank you, Chuck Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Henry    Thank you, Henry Ernie   M R   BAUGHMAN Mr Chairman, I would prefer alternative B as  specified in the Bluebook and with an aggregates directive    Thank you, Ernie Dave   M R   EASTBURN I would agree with Steve's proposal    Thank you Roger    Thank you, Roger Frank    Every month is that way!    Larry    Thank you Mark    Okay Willis    John Balles    It's another one of those months! Looking  at fed funds, six voting members have indicated a preference for  leaving the fed funds rate at 10-114 percent Of those, four want to  have the range at 10 to 10-112 Two members want to move the rate  immediately down to 10 percent and one wants to move it immediately up  to 10-1/2 percent Those who want to move down to 10 percent also  want a range of 9-112 to 10-112 percent And Governor Wallich wants  to move the range up to 10-114 to 10-314 percent   As far as [preferences on] the ranges go, there's a mix  [For Ml] zero is the bottom on five of them There are ones and minus  ones I don't know if we can synthesize this or not It looks easier  to do the fed funds range than the aggregates ranges     5/22/19 -33-    Well, nobody suggested 6 percent    Bob Mayo, according to my list, had 0 to 5  percent Did I get that right?    Well, 4-1/2 to 5 percent Let's try to  specify [the ranges] for a moment People have different [preferences  but] let's still try 0 to 5 percent That seems to be the most  predominant one The next most predominant one seems to be 4 to 8-1/2  or 9 percent [for M21 On the fed funds range, the midpoint seems to  be predominantly 10-1/4 percent And one could make a case that if we  combine those who want lower with those who want higher [limitsl, we  might maintain the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent range and have an  asymmetrical midpoint I'm not sure that fits anybody's definition  but we might try that in terms of a tentative look    In other words, we could leave the 9-3/4  percent [lower limit] and merely say that we'd have a call if it got  down- -    We'd have an understanding to that effect  Well, it looks as if we'll probably have a telephone conversation  anyway With that caveat, let's see who would buy that Aggregates  ranges of 0 to 5 and 4 to 9 percent, and 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 for the funds  rate, with the 10-1/4 percent rate maintained for the time being and a  conference call if it gets to 10 percent and is going down what  would be the sentiment on that?    Why don't you just call the others; don't  call me    Do the same thing with 8-1/2 percent    Well, John, to make it acceptable to you  what changes would need to be made?    Okay Chuck what change would you need to  be satisfied?    All right, we'll test that Henry, you're    Well, let's just see what the vote would be  if it were an aggregates directive instead, with 0 to 5, 4 to 8-1/2,  and 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent    We'd have to get rid of that    Without consulting   M R   PARTEE With a monetary aggregates directive, if the  aggregates are weak, we're going to go below 10 percent    If the aggregates are strong, we would  tighten sooner; and if they are weak, we would ease sooner without  consulting until the funds rate gets to 10 percent and then we'd  consult    Well, that's just the sentiment--     5/22/79 - 3 6 -     If you want to tighten, that's not  reliable !    John?    Still ""no"" Bob Black?    Anyway, Bob, your sentiment would be--    Phil    Bones    We're losing ground, Chuck We gained your  vote and lost three Stop the count let's forget it    Not clever enough Have you another  suggestion?    Well, we have a majority, I gather, of six  to three I wish we could narrow that spread Is there anybody here  from the State Department who knows how to put Israel and Egypt  together?    Couldn't we promise Henry that at the   We're not doing very well   proper time we will tighten and promise Chuck that at the appropriate  time we will ease?   M R   MAYO That's good Let's leave it there    And get the vote on that    Leave it up to the Chairman! Well, I think  we better conclude this so we can go to lunch We now have before us  a proposal, which we are going to vote on officially Maybe somebody  will be kind and at the last moment switch The range for M1 would be  0 to 5 percent and the range for M2 would be 4 to 8-1/2 percent The  fed funds rate would initially be at 10-1/4 percent and would move in  a range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent but not below 10 percent without  consultation And the movement within the range would be based upon a  money market directive I shall vote for that    Put down a maybe! Thank you very much, I  think I suppose we will be calling up for a new directive in the  interim period    Yes, I'm sure we will be Now we'll move  to consideration of the Manager's recommendations with respect to  foreign currency operations I'm very sorry that we have no swaps to  renew this month, Alan!     5/22/19 -38-    Well, I'm sorry    Any comments or questions?    Well, we have [agenda item] number 9 coming  right up for debate again    The alternate choice is to have a strong  dollar and, therefore, cut our inflationary pressures in this country  That would be rather unfortunate because it would show that we're  interested in fighting inflation!    Well, shall we move to item 9 ?  We have [on  the agenda] a discussion of the System's holdings of foreign currency  balances We have a memo, which I assume has been circulated to  everyone It's a very short memo Steve and Alan will you [introduce  the subject]?    There’s no misunderstanding on the 41  billion    The 2 billion is news to me    No, we’re going to come to that in a  second    Well, Chuck, there are policy issues And  there is also a question of buying [marks] without any place to invest  them, which isn‘t very attractive So we need a little cooperation  because having the Treasury holding sterile balances of marks is not  attractive    They can deny [us the use of] these  investment facilities    Yes, but that creates all kinds of  [complications] We‘ve already agreed not to [do] that, so it’s more  complicated There is no problem on the 41 billion, which just  brings the Treasury back to where it was on November 1 The policy  memo presented sets forth the recommendation of our task group that we  authorize the Federal Reserve System to hold up to $2 billion in  foreign currencies concentrated in the principal currencies of DM,  yen, and Swiss francs, with no more than $1 billion in any one  currency and only relatively modest holdings of any other currencies  that might be useful in transactions Now, as for the Germans, as far  as I know we have no understanding or commitment to accumulate  balances at the moment for the Federal Reserve    But we haven't crossed that bridge in terms  of [understandings with1 us The Japanese government, both their  ministry of finance and their central bank, have been urging that we  go into joint intervention with them to show a force in the  marketplace The Treasury has been urging this upon us We have been  consulting with the Japanese as to whether a package could be put  together that would be directed toward strengthening the yen, which  seems to have depreciated too much and may result in aggravating  surplus problems again later this year or next year We originally  had consulted to see what could be in such a package They have taken  some initiatives on their own to give guidance on capital outflows  They also have taken some liberalizing steps at the same time That  may [produce] countervailing forces but at least their consultations  with their banking system now would begin to [set a] program schedule  [relating to1 some of these outflows [that will] take a little  pressure off They still desire that we announce a program of joint  intervention with them--a program designed to counter the excessive  depreciation of the yen and assure an orderly market   The scale of such an intervention would be governed by [our  decisions regarding the recommendations in] this memo [Under this  proposal] the most we could accumulate in yen would be $1 billion,  which means that the most that we could accumulate beyond what we now  have is about $813 million The Treasury is prepared to intervene to  the tune of $200 million in aggregate It would seem to me that if we  were interested in doing this, it would have a desirable market  effect Then we should limit our intervention to 10 percent of the  aggregate So if we were doing $12 billion, there would be $12  billion of total intervention before we did $12 billion, and the  Japanese would do all the rest We would not be running each account  in that ratio but we'd be balancing out week to week to make sure that  that relative ratio was maintained Alan or Gretchen, do you have any  views on how effective this would be in the market or whether it would  be desirable?    Now, there are two questions before the  Committee I’m told by our Secretary that on the first one what we  need is an understanding that the policy set forth in this memo is  acceptable We have not before had formal votes and Mr Altmann’s  recommendation is that we not have a formal vote but have an  understanding that we will abide by this policy Is that correct?    We have an authorization for $8 billion;   The second issue is whether we should enter into an  understanding with the Bank of Japan on this joint program and  announce that we would be operating for our own account--the Treasury  and the Fed--in coordination with the Japanese We wouldn‘t put the  percent in such an announcement; we’d merely say we will operate  together    Surely As I said, we’re going to have two  issues--   M R   PARTEE Well, my point is perhaps a little different  from what you’re thinking I might be prepared to undertake a joint  operation with the Japanese  how much open position we can have in currencies, absent the special  arrangements such as that   But that‘s separate from the question of    Sure, we can decide not to have the--    Yes, Paul    That‘s the only reason to acquire them--  to counter the appreciatiation and work on both sides of the market    Both US intervention would be a maximum  of $12 billion If the Committee wants to do a billion dollars, the  Treasury is merely indicating [a willingness to do $200 million] Why  does the Treasury want to go in for such a small amount? Is it  because they already have a large--    They got them through the sale of SDRs and  through the IMF drawings So it isn't that they're declining to hold  yen balances; they really are showing good faith They already have  yen balances and that's why they would do a smaller amount at this  point Phil    Well, why don't we separate the issues?  First let's see what the sentiment of the Committee is regarding the  recommendation on the agenda I think the best thing is just to get a  vote on it    I mean a count on whether we agree on the  policy, not a vote   holdings] and with these limits [on individual currencies]?   Chuck, if you want to Suggest a  modification You may    I'm laughing because all during the year up  until November 1 we said it was up to the foreigners to straighten out  the dollar    Chuck, I didn't mean you had that  atttitude; I meant that as a nation we were taking that attitude     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -44-    Let's run down [the list] and ask the  members if they are for the policy and if so, if they have a  preference for the $1 billion or the $500 million limit per currency    The maximum is $2 billion in any case, but  the question is whether you want a maximum of $1 billion per currency  or $500 million    In the aggregate? Oh, I misunderstood you  well, then we'll have to ask again    Yes, we already have that In other words,  you would not want to expand it to $2 billion Then the question is  Do you like the proposal in the memo? Paul    Okay    Well, it's not necessary The Treasury is  with us on this; we're working with the Treasury    In other words, you are going with the  Black proposal Anybody for the White proposal?     5/22/19 -45-    We have 5 votes in favor and there are 10  members That makes it very neat, doesn't it? They're not really  votes but sentiments I have a swing ""vote"" but I really don't think  this sort of policy ought to be followed unless we're fairly uniform  Could we all agree on doing $1 billion with a $500 million limit at  least to keep this [going] and then we can review it from time to  time? I don't think this is the sort of policy we ought to pursue on  a split [opinion] Does everybody agree to that?    Yes, for the total limit and $500 million  per currency, except that which is approved outside of this [Hearing  no objection] let's turn now to Japan and take that as a discrete  item Apart from the authority we just granted, would it be your  sentiment to enter into the program with Japan? Go down the list  again    This would be a separate understanding    This would mean [only] as to Japanese yen  we would go to $1 billion and be outside the authority, but no other  yen would be held We wouldn't add the $1 billion here and the $500  million and have [$15 billion] This would be the sole authority for  the yen   policy just adopted   This would be for yen [only]; and no yen  would be held under the other policy    Including the present balances    The first policy we just approved would no  longer include yen We'll pull yen out of that and approve a  specific--    A maximum of $1 billion of balances [held  by] the Federal Reserve    It's $187 million, or about $200 million  now    In the program we described Paul    Ten times what this nation is doing--a  combination of the Treasury [and the Federal Reserve]   M R   COLDWELL That's your biggest exposure, Chuck    Nancy, I don't think we can peg it In the  present market conditions I think it would be desirable to get it in  the 200 to 2 1 0  area But that's subject to [conditions] changing I  wouldn't hold to that if we felt there were a really massive change  because there is no use fighting it if it's really massive    They're accumulating massive profits now  because they've sold their products on the 200 basis If they don't  get it down again, we're going to see price cutting in yen and we're  going to have another flood of Japanese imports  that problem all over again with surpluses   We're going to have  That's the problem    Okay, I'll approve it then also I think  we have a fairly strong sentiment to do that We'll circulate to the  governors a suggested statement that might be made with the Japanese  perhaps at the beginning of next week     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -48-    That is the end of our meeting unless there is other  business The date of our next meeting is July 11, which is a  Wednesday That's an odd one That was worked out because of the BIS  meeting well, thank you all We'll have our luncheon immediately,  and we're on time!

1058,1979-06-27," Thank you very much, Steve I don’t think Scott mentioned  the trade figures that were released today at what--230 this afternoon, Ted? Would you just give  everybody a--    In addition to those factors, we still have to hear from OPEC  I don’t believe they have announced their pricing yet    So we will hear about that fairly soon   Now, let me give you a personal reason why I thought this consultation was  particularly necessary and appropriate We have the usual [policy] dilemma between  international and domestic conditions We have a situation where our dollar policy of  maintaining a stable dollar and an orderly market is [being tested], and so far we have responded  to that solely with intervention Another way to respond to it would be by monetary action that  would open up the interest rate dlfferentials in favor of the dollar This could be done by a move  to tighten by raising the federal funds rate and symbolically by an increase in the discount rate   On the other hand, we have a domestic economy where I think as a result of the energy  situation--with the revolution in Iran and the interruption of oil supplies--it appears that a very  significant increase in inflation [is in prospect] for 1979 and 1980 And a corresponding  decrease in real economic activity in the United States, which we probably could not have  predicted last fall or earlier this year, [seems likely] With that weakness, and particularly the     6/21/19 3   inflationary aspects of [the current situation], the relation of money to nominal activity comes  into question So we have to consider what the appropriate course is for policy in order to  [achieve] the economic [outcome] that we would like to see   Obviously, thoughts have been [expressed about] whether we should try to defend the  dollar by taking monetary action and what the price and other consequences of that would be on  domestic activity That could send us into more serious difficulties Let me just go around and  ask each of you whether you have any suggestions or thoughts on this Do you feel that we  should stay on an even keel, [maintain] a daily and hourly watch, and keep in close touch or that  we should be doing something now? I’ll start down the list of members and then call on all the  other participants Paul Volcker, do you have any particular thoughts?    Thank you, Paul Phil Coldwell    Thank you, Bones Bob Mayo    Thank you, Bob Chuck Partee    Thank you, Chuck Roger Guffey    Thank you, Roger Frank Moms   M R   MORRIS Mr Chairman, I think we’re agreeing for different reasons The  evidence suggests to me that the economy peaked in March and that we’re now in the third  month of a recession, the depth of which will be influenced by the energy problem But I don’t  agree with Chuck Partee that it was caused by the energy problem I think the seeds of the  recession were sown before the energy issue reached its current prominence But quite clearly  the energy problem means that there is a potential for a more severe recession than anyone is  currently forecasting Therefore, I think the next move for monetary policy ought to be toward  ease, but given the kind of growth rates we’re seeing in the aggregates and the weakness of the  dollar in the foreign exchange markets obviously now is not the time But if my feeling about the  economy turns out to be correct, the strength in the aggregates will likely be a short-term  phenomenon As a growing perception of weakness in the economy develops, the dollar will  strengthen in the foreign exchange markets And when these two things happen, then I think we  should turn our attention to mitigating the seventy of the recession    Thank you very much, Frank Ernie Baughman   Thank you, Ernie  Larry Roos    Thank you, Larry Mark Willes    Thanks, Mark I don’t know what we’re going to do with a  short report! Walter MacDonald    Walter, did we get all your comments?   Thank you very much  George Rankin from Richmond   M R   RANKIN Mr Chairman, our concern is oriented more toward the inflationary  picture than the apparent increasing recessionary tendencies that we see It seems to us that the  markets both here and abroad will no doubt be watching carefully to see whether our recession  fears will wear down our determination to do something about inflation Our position here at the  Richmond Bank is that we should continue to give a high priority to the inflation problems; even  though the economy may be moving into a recession, we think it’s important to hold a tight rein  on the aggregates at this time And in view of the recent rapid growth in the aggregates we think  we should be prepared to demonstrate a readiness to resist any further short-term bulges by  allowing the funds rate to move up another notch We think that decision should to a large extent  depend on what the figures for the last two weeks of June look like Apparently we have a fairly  good projection but if the figures between now and the week ending with the 27” show any  increase in the aggregates, we would be inclined to recommend moving the fed funds rate up to     6/27/19 I   10-1/2 percent That’s all, sir    Thank you, George Dick Smoot, Philadelphia    Well, thank you All this has been extremely helpful I  gather that, with two possible exceptions, the overall consensus was that we stand pat but be  prepared [to move as we] continue to watch the situation carefully We should continue to stay  in close touch and I think we should do that in this coming period and not plan to take any  particular action until we all consult again We’ll decide whether or not we should have another  go-around on the telephone, depending on how the aggregates look and what happens in the  markets in the next week and then we’ll be in touch with you Would anyone else like to make a  further comment or make any further suggestion before we end this particular session?    Frank, let me interrupt for just a moment There is perhaps  one extraneous factor I know of on M1 when it jumped $69 billion in one week That I believe  was the week where social security checks went out [earlier than usual given] the payment date  over the weekend So we may have had up to perhaps $2 billion that was accounted for by  canying those deposits over a weekend and averaging them in the totals Even if we knock those  back down, we still have a big spike but not quite as big     6/21/79 8    Well, gentlemen, thank you very much I must say that the  telephone system worked well this time At least here we heard all of the discussion very, very  well indeed I would close by saying come prepared for an interesting FOMC session We not  only have to deal with these problems but with setting any mid-course correction for our longer-  term aggregate growth ranges this year and taking our first glimpse of 1980, which will keep us  busy for more than a half hour probably!   I am reminded that we did have one unfortunate case in the past where a reference to  our having a telephonic session seemed to make its way into the newspapers I hope we’ll all  recall that it’s better not to have reports that we have such meetings There will be  misinterpretations as to whether we took action or didn’t take action So I hope for your  cooperation there   All right Thank you very much and we’ll either be in touch by phone or see you on  the 11” of July Have a nice 4” of July Bye-bye   END OF SESSION    	790627confcall    "
1080,1979-07-11," Good morning, ladies and gentlemen I  believe we should start right away because we have a rather difficult  task ahead this morning--to resolve all the midcourse corrections and  short-term directives   Let me start out by welcoming Emmett Rice to, I think, his  first FOMC meeting You'll be the swing vote, you will be happy to  know It's nice to have you back in the Federal Reserve fold I  believe you spent some years with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  when it was--1 won't say in its prime but--at a high level of  achievement We're delighted to have you here    Before we start on the agenda, I have the  sad duty of having to call to your attention what I consider to be a  serious and recurring matter And that is that somehow the tradition  and what I consider commitment to keep the deliberations of the  Federal Open Market Committee confidential is being breached each  month Yesterday, we had The Wall Street Journal saying that it was  learned from sources that at our last meeting, in May, two members of  the Committee called for tightening the credit spigot The article  mentions ""sources"" And this is a different reporter [than last  time] And as I've said, my experience is that reporters don't cite  sources unless they've talked to someone in the organization This is  to me a recurrence of what we talked about last time and it is very,  very disturbing It's spreading to [discussion of] the attitudes of  international bankers Henry, we've just had a report that ""sources""  tell us what the central bankers in the BIS [meetings] talk about and  how they instruct the United States on monetary policy I consider  that inappropriate I wonder if we should bring that to the attention  of the Chairman [of the BISI    Well, the quote in the newspapers is that  sources from that meeting were telling us what our monetary policy  should be and were telling what was discussed in the [BISI meeting    I think we ought to get the clippings and  perhaps call it to the attention of Chairman Zjlstra and see if we  can't tighten up those procedures I just don't think it is  appropriate to go to the BIS and discuss in confidence our policies  and have people go outside and start saying confidentially off the  record--but for publication, just not for [attribution]--this is what  we discussed This article says that sources noted what was talked  about and the United States was urged to do a, b, and c I just don't  think that's proper This is just one; there were other articles in  other newspapers     7/11/19 -2-   I would again ask members of the FOMC to give their attention  to this What is wrong with our system? Why are we getting sources  quoted in the newspaper? In this case, [the leak] could be from the  people attending or it could be from people who have seen the  directive or the draft of the minutes because this is actually an  accurate statement But it indicates that people who are reporting to  [the press] have access to the FOMC meetings or its documents So  what do we do? Do we change the way we distribute the drafts [and]  the directives? Do we have to go through some educational process?  Do we have to restrict attendance? What do we have to do? I won’t  ask for your answer now, but I wish you would give this serious  consideration This seems to be a trend and if we continue to ignore  it, I think it will be read in the System as a new policy where  anybody can go out and give their personal appraisal [of policy  deliberations and decisions] A lot of egos will be appealed to by  the press and we will have an endless problem   Well, to turn to the meeting itself, we need first to approve  the minutes of the actions taken at the last meeting on May 22 I  think those have been circulated Are there any corrections or  additions? If there are none, we will record them as approved and we  will turn to Scott Pardee for a report on foreign currency operations  since the meeting of May 22    Thank you, Scott Any questions or  comments?    Phil    Larry    I suppose I should call attention to John  Balles' memo that was circulated [on] the question of to what degree  rate differentials affect us I guess you have all seen that Dave    Frank    They are looking at their portfolios, not  at the economy Well, we need to ratify the transactions since the  previous meeting Not only have you heard Scott's report but I  believe you have been furnished with a copy of a report on these  transactions Is there concurrence in the ratification? Any dissent?  Hearing none, that's approved   We probably will discuss international issues more before the  day is over but let's move on to the domestic open market operations  and ask for the report since the last meeting from Peter Sternlight    Thank you, Peter Any questions or  comments? Phil    Henry     7/11/79 -5-    Well, we also need here to ratify the  transactions since the last meeting You've had a report Are there  any questions or comments? Are there any dissents from approving  those transactions? Hearing none, we will record the ratification of  the domestic transactions since the previous meeting   Now we turn to our more delicate issue today and that's the  longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates, the new Humphrey-Hawkins  bill It gives us the opportunity to make mid-year corrections and to  [unintelligible]    MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see  Appendix 1    Before we turn to any comments on long-run  ranges, we might just pause for a moment to see if there are questions  about this presentation Henry    Larry    It's perfectly all right to take the fifth!    Chuck    Paul    Frank    John Balles    1‘11 just close the list We‘ll go through  the remaining questions and then turn to Steve You’ll all get a  chance, of course Mark    Phil Coldwell     7/11/79 -11-    [Fund] the nominal level of GNP    We‘ll find out next year Dave    Shallow, long saucer    Bob Mayo    Well, Bob was our clean-up hitter on this  round of questions I think it might be appropriate to turn to Steve  Axilrod to give his comments on longer-run ranges and then we’ll turn  to the whole Committee   M R   AXILROD Mr Chairman, we are passing out a table that I  hope will make my comments clear on this complicated problem facing  the Committee The decision before the FOMC on the long-run ranges is  clearly much more difficult than usual The impact on the ranges of  an actual, or impending recession has to be balanced against a higher  rate of inflation, with the increased rate above expectations caused  in large part by exogenous factors such as energy conditions that do  not respond readily, if at all, to monetary policy Additionally, the  demand for money, given GNP, seems no more certain than usual and  perhaps even less so as it will depend in part on Congressional and  judicial decisions yet to come that will affect interest-bearing  transactions accounts   [Moreover,] at this meeting, the Committee is asked to look  further ahead than it ever has before, giving its first public  indication of ranges for the monetary aggregates more than one year  ahead In this case, that means the ranges for 1980 as well as 1979  Growth rates of the money aggregates thus far in 1979, as noted in  paragraph 9 of the Bluebook, are within the ranges adopted in February  for the year, and near the low ends of the ranges, especially for M2  and M3 Thus, on the face of it there would not appear to be a  serious need for the Committee to consider adjustments in the ranges  for 1979 to allow for any initial mis-specification of them   However, there probably has been a mis-specification of the  current range for M1, as explained in the Bluebook, because the  retarding effect of ATS accounts on M1 growth appears to have been  overestimated Last February we estimated this effect as 3 percentage  points, which did in fact turn out to be the first-quarter impact     7/11/79 -13-   But growth in ATS accounts has subsequently slowed  retarded by only 1-1/2 percentage points in the second quarter from  this source And we estimate that the retarding effect for the year  1979 will average out to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percentage points This  technical factor would argue for an upward readjustment in the  measured M1 range for 1979 We can expect an even smaller retarding  effect from ATS accounts in 1980, but obviously uncertainties are vast  because of the clouded legislative and judicial outlook   M1 growth was   With regard to economic factors affecting the aggregates, the  economy is weaker and this might argue for more stimulation On the  other hand, inflation is stronger, which tends to argue for more  restraint to curb the pace of price increases But since much of the  greater-than-expected price increase has been due to a one-time energy  price shock, there is also an argument for being at least partly  accommodative by providing somewhat more money during a transition  period In any event, the staff expects some acceleration in growth  of the aggregates in the second half of 1979, given the GNP  projections, partly because of greater demand relative to income as  the recent downward shift in money demand abates, and partly because  of a slight easing in interest rates   Taking these various factors into account--and also giving  weight to the view that the ranges for this year should be narrowed  because the results for half of the 1979 policy period are already  known and therefore the outcome for the year as a whole is more  certain--1 would suggest that the Committee consider the following  ranges for the monetary aggregates for 1979 3 to 5-1/2 percent for  M1; 5-1/2 to 8 percent for M2; and 6-1/2 to 9 percent for M3 These  proposed ranges are shown in the middle column of the upper panel of  the table before you And they're shown in the second, third, and  fourth lines of the upper panel The top line, in order to make the  economic implications clearer, shows the consistent measure of M1  adjusted to include the amount of deposits that were transferred into  ATS accounts As you can see from that line, the proposal for M1  represents a policy that is no easier after adjustment for ATS  transfers than does the current range That is, they're both centered  on 6 percent, assuming of course that our estimate for the ATS effect  is correct For M2 and M3 the proposed ranges are 1/2 point higher on  the bottom end than the current ones and therefore a little more  clearly allow for the greater growth of the aggregates that is  expected by the staff to occur in the second half of this year   Turning to ranges for 1980, arguments can be made both for  lowering and for raising the ranges relative to those for 1979 On  the one hand, the need to make progress over time in reducing the rate  of inflation and in breaking inflationary psychology argues for  adopting slower growth rates in 1980 than in 1979 On the other hand,  the continuation into next year of exogenous upward price pressures  related to the energy situation and the need to contain the apparent  weakening in real economic activity argue for raising the ranges for  1980 and then lowering them gradually in later years   On balance, taking account of these conflicting arguments,  the following monetary ranges for 1980 might be considered--and  they're shown in the last column of the upper panel M1, 3 to 6  percent; M2, 5 to 8 percent; and M3, 6 to 9 percent The bottom line  of that upper panel has a proposal for the bank credit range that is     7/11/79 -14-   simply a smooth version of the alternative B/B' projection of the  Bluebook The monetary ranges suggested for 1980 are wider than those  proposed for 1919 because of the greater uncertainties in projecting  18 months ahead The ranges also encompass some further technical  upward adjustment of the measured Ml range to allow for the gradual  re-emergence of more normal demands for money following the  introduction of ATS accounts late last year Finally, these ranges  retain an upper limit high enough to allow for the probability that  the aggregates next year may in practice grow somewhat more rapidly  than this year, given the inflation built into the economy and our  assumption of some growth in economic activity   The bottom panel of the table compares midpoints of these  proposals with the growth of the aggregates in recent years to provide  the Committee with some perspective on the ranges As can be seen,  the odds are pretty good, given what has already transpired this year,  that growth of the aggregates in 1979 will slow for the second  consecutive year--looking at either measured M1 or M1 adjusted to  include ATS transfers The growth rate was at something of a recent  peak in ' 1 7 ,  was lower in '78 and will very likely be lower in 'I9  [than in] '78 This is true for all of the aggregates shown Except  for measured M1, the midpoints of the proposed ranges for 1980 would  imply a further slowing and thus might have some beneficial  announcement effect However, there is some reasonable probability,  as just noted, that actual growth would be in the upper halves of the  proposed 1980 ranges Even so, the proposal for 1980 implies a policy  of restraint on money growth relative to demands and, therefore,  rising interest rates [over] the course of the year Thank you    Thank you, Steve A statistical question?  All right    For '73 and '74? Let's all write these  numbers down    One comment I should have made on the  supplemental table that Jim called to your attention comparing the  [forecasts of the] staff and the Administration I know you realize  all the figures here are confidential but these are particularly  sensitive because they will not be released by the Administration  until Friday And the Administration would be very upset if any  [disclosure] of these took place before that time They are quite  sensitive, and I just wanted you to know that     7/11/79 -15-   Now, before we break, I would suggest that we try to do a go-  around on your views My suggestion is that you give us any thoughts  you have on the economy if significantly different from the staff‘s  We don’t need detail but I’d like to get the flavor [of your  thinking] And then [indicate] what policy implications you see and  also what would be your recommendation for the longer-term ranges--a  mid-course correction for 1979 or for the 1979 ranges to be  maintained--and what you see for 1980 I think we will have to take  each of those up separately later but I’d at least like to get down in  black and white how each of you sees it   As an opening observation, I feel that what has happened  since earlier this year--the unexpected degree of oil price increases  by OPEC and others has been quite a blow to our anti-inflation  efforts We’ve probably been set back by a year or two in the program  to wind down inflation And that makes our problem particularly  difficult because what was already a need for a multi-year sustained  effort becomes an even longer effort, and we cannot yet predict what  policy responses the Administration will make in the energy area or  otherwise But whatever they [do], there’s a lag time of policy  getting implemented into action and it seems to me that we‘re going to  have a much longer course to go We are going to be on trial and have  a test in this country for a longer period of time on whether we have  the will and the capacity to wind this [inflation] down I rather  think that there is a more sober sense of the urgency and the peril  [involved]--a more sober sense that we‘re all going to have to give up  something There is going to have to be some loss of real income in  the short term if we‘re ever going to get real income going up again  in the long term But that remains to be seen   My ouiji board tells me, based on what we did at the last few  meetings, that we probably should be starting with Henry going  clockwise this time I think the last time we started with Roger and  went this way and the last time [we started on] the other side So we  will start with Henry and go around this way    Do you have any specifications that you--    What would you do for 1980 then, Henry?    NO, we will do another [review] in January    So you would keep the same ones we now have  for '79 and [carry them forward for] ' 8 0 ?     Thank you very much Phil    Well, you see, he cancelled his speech  because he wanted to hear what the FOMC would do! Everyone was  wondering what the reason was    Thank you, Phil Frank    Steve's proposals for both years?     7/11/79 -18-    Thank you, Frank Ernie    Three job changes and you’re in pretty good  shape, aren’t you?   M R   BAUGHMAN It’s even reached the point now where firms  are considering setting up shops in residential areas so these people  won’t have to travel more than 5 minutes to work as compared to 20  minutes   As to the general economic outlook, [my views] don’t differ  substantially from what the staff has projected I recognize the  possibility, of course, that their projection can be off and I would  share the view that Jim Kichline mentioned that it could be off in  either direction I think there‘s a possibility that looking back 6  to 9 months from now we’ll be talking in terms of a rolling adjustment  as compared with just slipping into a recession I wouldn’t give it a  high probability, but I think it’s a possibility we should keep in the  back of our minds   As to monetary policy--what it has been, what it may be now,  and what it should be--my thought process was pretty well outlined by  Henry Wallich It seems to me that we have not seen the usual     7/11/79 -19-   indications of credit stringency and monetary tightness that we get in  a full employment economy And consequently, I think the numbers that  we are looking at are not capturing what's really been happening  [judged by1 the effect of the money stock Bankers continue to talk  almost universally in terms of no credit restraint They have money  to lend and, of course, the figures on bank credit are showing the  results of this It seems to me that there are two major factors in  the picture One, the continued prohibition of outright interest on  demand deposits and continued low ceilings on savings deposits; and  second the ongoing strength in inflation, which has stimulated people  to find ways of circumventing the effects of these restraints to a  degree we have not previously known This leads me to [favor] on the  [ranges] for '79 Henry Wallich's suggestion to stick with what we have  and for 1980 to go with alternative C in the Bluebook    Thank you, Ernie John    Well, it's nice to live in Dallas    Thank you, John Mark    Thank you, Mark Perhaps I should pause to  make a couple of comments One is that if we make any change in the  ranges for '79, it would be a restatement for the whole year, fourth  quarter to fourth quarter We are not rebasing; I think everyone  understands that And my intention in dealing with ' 8 0  in our report  to the Congress--1 hope it's the staff's intention--is to do so in the  text and not present a graph because then we would have to find a base  point And that we don't want to do, if you follow me No chart, in  other words We'll say we are going to have this range for '79 and  here is the chart for '79 But for 1980, then, we are going to have a  range of so-and-so and it's just going to be in the text We will  not, therefore, pick the point from which we have that growth I  think that will give us a little less trouble when we set the ranges  firmly in January or February when we do it for the year Then we  present it as our real target for the year and now we are just giving  a preliminary indication So I think that will be helpful Bob Mayo    You're not going to prove it either    I still have some confusion For the M1  measure you said 3 to 6 percent    That's what I had in mind    For '79, it's 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent now    For '79    But 3 to 6 and not 3 to 5-1/2 percent    Thank you, Bob Roger    Thank you, Roger Larry    I didn't realize I had said that    I thought I said it would put us back by  adding to inflation; we start from a higher base   M R   ROOS Well, all right Specifically, I believe that  inflation is still our most serious problem If we are able to signal  to the world that we are determined to do something about inflation, I  think that will have a very real and salutary effect on our dollar  exchange problem I think it will stimulate much needed capital  investment in this country So, I think our number one long-term  objective must be to wind down inflation on a gradual basis I find  the alternative C scenarios preferable, both in terms of the policy  for the remainder of this year and for 1980, assuming we can--and I  believe we can if we want to--in a very real manner affect money  growth I don't think we [ought] merely to respond to how money grows  due to something that people outside of this room do If we hold  money growth--and perhaps this involves a widening of the fed funds  range, which I know is heresy--close to the midpoint of the  alternative C ranges, I think we will have struck a real blow for  freedom I think we can do it and that would be my preference, sir    Bones    Thank you very much Dave    Thank you, Dave Willis    Thank you, Willis Bob Black    Thank you, Bob Emmett    Current ranges?    Thank you Nancy    Thank you, Nancy Chuck    Thank you, Chuck Paul    May    In ' 8 0 ?     Well, today we are going to have to come up  with some precise answers Before we break, let me just make sure we  have the right numbers down here Let me read what Murray has down  for each of you I am going to do ' 7 9  only For John Balles he has  M1, 3-3/4 to 5-114; M2, 5-3/4 to 7-1 /4 ;  and M3, 6 - 1 / 2  to 9   Is that  correct?    Okay, 6 to 9   That's why I want to [check]  these Bob Black was 3 to 6, 5 to 8, and 6 to 9      For Phil Coldwell I have 3 to 5 and 5 to 7  and I didn't get M3    All right Bones is 3 to 5-1 /2 ,  5 -1 /2  to  8, and 6-1/2 to 9   Bob Mayo is 3 to 6 on M1, and we don't have M2 OL  M3    Chuck is 3 to 6, 5 to 8 ,  6 to 9   Emmett is  3 to 6, 5 to 8 ,  6 to 9   Nancy is 3 to 5 - 1 / 2 ,  5-1/2 to 8 ,  6-1 /2  to 9      Sure That's why I wanted to get these  down So that's 3 to 6 ,  5 to 8 ,  and 6 to 9      And Paul Volcker is 1-1 /2  to 4-1 /2 ,  5 t o  8 ,   and 6 to 9 Henry is 1 - 1 / 2  to 4-1/2   5 to 8 ,  and 6 to 9    I am going to go through the others  Ernie, 1-1 /2  to 4-1/2 ,  5 to 8 ,  and 6 to 9   Dave, 3 t o  5-1 /2 ,  5-1/2 to  8 ,  and 6-1/2 to 9   Roger Guffey, 3 to 5-1/2 ,  5 -1 /2  to 8 ,  and 6-1/2  to  9   Frank Morris, 3 to 5-1 /2 ,  5 -1 /2  to 8 ,  and 6 - l / 2  to 9   That's a  pretty good team; they are all together there Larry, 2-1/2 to 5 - 1 / 2 ,   4 -1 /2  to 7 - 1 / 2 ,  and 5-1/2  to 8-1/2 Correct me if I'm wrong Mark,  1-1/2 to 4-1/2, 5 to 8 ,  and 6 to 9   Willis, 3 to 5-1 /2 ,  5-1/2 to 8 ,   and 6-1/2 to 9   Do I have them all right? Let's break for twenty  minutes and come back at noon   [Coffee break]    Let's pick up from what we did just before  the break We looked at M2 and M3 for which there are no adjustments  because of this ATS matter It would appear that among voting members  there's a rather overwhelming sentiment for staying where we are for     7/11/79 -30-   '79 In the case of M2 only three of you indicated any variation from  staying where we are now at 5 to 8 percent John Balles suggested  5-3/4 to 7-1/4, Phil Coldwell suggested 5 to 7, and Bones Kimbrel  suggested 5-1/2 to 8, all of which are still not terribly far off from  the 5 to 8 On M3, we had one abstention and only one person who  indicated anything other than maintaining the 6 to 9--Bones, you  suggested moving up the bottom to 6 - 1 / 2    want to proceed on this, but just looking at it, there's an  overwhelming [preference] to stay where we are on M2 and M3   I don't know how you all    Let me take a stab at reconciling them and  see what you think I'm coming to M1 last because, as you know, it  has this question of an adjustment that has to do with changes in the  estimates of the effects of ATS accounts There again if we just go  by the numbers, it looks as if all but two of the voting members  indicated that they would make the technical adjustment for the change  in ATS Paul Volcker and Henry Wallich suggested we make no such  adjustment; everyone else suggested we make an adjustment and there  are two very minor variations on what that adjustment should be My  suggestion as to a way to handle this is as follows The intention of  an adjustment is not to change the course of the ranges for M1 in a  substantive, bottom line, sense But in these kinds of announcements  we deal not only with the analysts who understand that, but with those  who want to [use] every excuse to effect their own personal  preferences and would read this kind of adjustment as some change in  policy And when I hear it discussed around here, I see how many  people have a hard time coming to grips with explaining that  adjustment even to other professionals, so I wonder how it's going to  sound publicly   So, it seems to me that an alternate way to do it would be to  stick with our present range on M1 and say in our report to the  Congress that this range was set on the basis of a 3 percent ATS  effect [but] it now appears that it will be less In guiding monetary  policy we're going to be looking at it on the same basis we were  always looking at it, but the result is that the actual measured  number may be high in the range or outside the range depending on how  ATS comes out We don't have to predict [that effect]; we don't have  to give them a number; we can just say that with the ATS adjustment we  are going to stay where we were in substance    Well, that could be I don’t know Every  period of time has its problems and I agree with you that no time will  be good to explain these complicated things My second assumption is  that, with the pending legislation and the pending redefinition of the  aggregates, it would best at this point to say that for 1980, given  the uncertainties, our current posture is to be within the same  general brackets of growth [as this] year, adjusted for any changes in  definitions or accounts And we don’t give numbers Then when we  come to February, if we agree to redefine the aggregates, we would  have a whole set of numbers that are different anyway We wouldn’t  have a set of numbers that changes twice We would only have one new  set that is based on something that we can look at then Now we are  liable to say that we are going to have [a certain range for] M1 next  year and adjusted it’s going to be a little different and then we will  redefine M1 and then we will have another set of figures I think it  adds to the confusion   Now this is just a suggestion; I am not wedded to it We  are trying to think through what the risk is of this being misread  M2 and M3 won’t be misread if everybody seems to feel that we should  stay pat But if M1 is misread, what‘s the risk? I think the main  risk is that it comes at a time when there is uncertainty and  unsettlement in the foreign exchange markets and I think there are  people looking for excuses to believe that the United States is  changing its policy  [is] something we want to keep close to our chest, as far as allowing  that to be used against us to create a rate for the dollar I  wouldn’t be very happy to have that happen right now I don‘t know if  any of you who deal with foreign exchange markets have any views on  that We haven‘t asked you, but--   And whether we are going to change our policy    Pardon me?    I don‘t think foreign exchange traders are  analysts I don’t think they care about facts They care if they can  use the device to maneuver a market in order to make a profit Ted,  do you have any view on it?    Henry    But I would do this only on the basis that  we follow the majority will here And I'd indicate in our report to  Congress that we are going to guide our policy based on the original  viewpoint that 1-1/2 to 4 [ - 1 / 2 1  percent was 4-112 to I - 1 / 2  percent on  an adjusted basis, and it stays that way Mark    Dave    Yes, that's the other side of it    It may be something else by the end of the  year That's one of the problems    That's what bothers me We could end up  with something we did [not expect] and be fouled up again    Sure, that's the kind of--     7/11/19 ~ 3 3 -     Yes, we have to be prepared to explain it    Yes, adjusted for deviations from the  estimate as to the ATS effect It's adjusted for deviations because  we've already adjusted it tbyl 3 percent    You're asking, Steve, for the Committee to  show internal consistency and that's a big demand!    I think what I'm saying is that that's true  if we look at ATS only But some members may want to adjust their  policy thinking to other things that have happened But on ATS only,  I think you're probably right We probably made a mistake For  internal purposes we probably should have put your estimate in for the  effect of ATS every month Pardon?    We probably should have used--what is it,  4-112 to 7-112 percent--from the beginning, making an adjustment each  time     Yes, added in ATS just for internal  purposes Maybe we should still do it--or do it as a supplemental  chart Steve will say that we don't have a measured way to do that,  but if you make an estimate that the effect is X amount, you have to  add in a number that would do that    I’m trying to accomplish both [objectives]  I‘m trying to accomplish the adjustment without scaring people and  leave us some running room so that if the adjustment turns out to be  different than we now think, we don’t have a second go-around    Yes    No, for ’80 I was proposing that we  indicate that our current thinking is to continue the same ranges,  adjusted for the impact of ATS So it isn‘t 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 Nancy it  could be that 4 to I or 4-1/2 to I-1/2 on an adjusted basis    I could be that vague now, but I wouldn’t  be that vague in February I’m sort of hedging my bets because I  assume that by the end of the year we will have completed our project  We‘ll have some redefinitions and we’ll have a new series, which will  be tracked back in time And that series will come into--    Well, where’s the Act? Who has [the  language I ?    It specifies that we are to indicate our  ranges and I don’t think it requests that we--    I think we can do it by saying we intend to  stay on the same track, with an adjustment for ATS I don’t know how  that appeals to the Committee If you’d like to have a discussion of  that, I’d be happy to do it Is there sentiment along with Bob‘s that  this is perhaps the best way out of a box?     1/11/79 -35-    I think I can because in the verbal answers  I can say Look, when we were putting [the objectives] down last year  we were thinking of M1 in the old way of 4-1 /2  to I - 1 / 2  percent And  whatever the ATS effect turns out to be at the end of the year--  whether it's 3 or 1 or 7--[that] is really the adjustment  [unintelligible] I think I can kind of fudge that one in answering  the Committee One thing to avoid is to get at what the 1 - 1 / 2  to 4-   1 / 2  would be and keep referring to the whole thing as based upon 4 - l / 2   to I - 1 / 2  percent on the old series for M1    Sure I think for internal purposes we  ought to prepare each month a chart on the old series basis so that we  don't get confused The world may get confused, I suppose    Yes Any other coments? Roger    No, what we do is this If we were  actually shooting for the midpoint of our ranges and we had a 1-1/2  percentage point ATS effect, then 3 percent on the current range  equals 4-1/2 percent, and we'd be at the top    It's hard to explain to ourselves! That's  why we're going to explain if we change in the numbers It may be  easy    Pure rates    Well, one thing is that the written report  will [unintelligiblel Yes, the Dow Jones will take the written  report and put it on the wire What I say will be lost in the shuffle  so that--   M R   PARTEE Well, except that you are reporting to an  oversight committee and they may well understand what you're saying    Sure I have no disagreement with that  These ranges were set with the impact of ATS estimated at 3 percent  [The Congressional Committee] will have to take account of the fact  that there may be a deviation from that particular estimate and that  to the extent there is a deviation the ranges will be inappropriate  Therefore, Mr Chairman, you should look at M2 as much better to  track    Then we'll go back and have another  argument Henry Wallich has been trying to get in a word    No, but you--     7/11/79 -37    What is the pleasure of the Committee?  Let's just take a quick poll    Just for '79 to start with, and then we'll  turn to ' 8 0   The proposition is to report that we have decided to  stand pat on ' 7 9 ,  but with a clear explanation that there is an  inaccuracy in the M1 range That is, we will make clear that the M1  range has been adjusted for estimates of ATS and will have to be  adjusted to the extent that there is a deviation from that original  calculation What's the sentiment on that? It's my proposal and I  guess I would go along with it I'm not sure    It's our mutual job    Okay I think that is strong enough that  we should just probably stick with that   How about 1980? What is your pleasure for that? Again,  looking at the rundown here, it looks as if we have about the same  lineup Practically everybody who specified [numerical rangesl was at  5 to 8 and 6 to 9 percent, or very close to it, for M2 and M3 And  the same thing for M1, with a 3 to 6 percent range My thought [with  respect to the 1980 ranges] was to indicate that there are a number of  uncertainties, not only in the economy--whether it may be at a turning  point and the effects that have not worked through yet--but also with  regard to the Administration's policies and pending legislation So,     7/11/79 -38 -    at this point in time, it would appear reasonable to continue to seek  growth of the aggregates in 1980 within the ranges that have applied  for 1979, adjusted in the case of M1 for deviations [relating to our  estimate of] the effects of ATS    That's our present plan And I'd say that  because of the number of uncertainties, the Committee could expect  revisions to this when we re-present [our ranges] in February    Well, I'm open to suggestions Can you  give us a--    I would say in response that the record  shows that we have had two years in a row of reduction in growth of  the aggregates And, within the ranges that have been specified, the  prospect for a further year of reduction would still be available if  economic conditions make it possible Therefore, we are able to  pursue our long-term aim within the ranges that have been indicated by  this Committee That's how I would probably answer Again, I think  the record is more powerful than promises The record is that two  years in a row now we've had significant reductions in the growth  rates of these aggregates On M1 adjusted, we've gone from 79     7/11/79 -39   percent to 74 percent to an estimated 6 percent for this year and  that's probably more impressive to the Committee than [any] promises  we can make    Yes, M2 [has gone down] from 98 to 84 to  probably 6-3/4 percent    It's fast, yes    That's why we could moderate [the decline]  a little next year and still keep it in the right--    But we're going to have a new definition of  PI1 and it's going to affect this Well, again, it's a very hard thing  for us to do If we get very specific, we run the risk that Steve  just pointed out Our credibility would be hurt [morel if we put out  some very specific n d e r s  and can't come near them than if we put out  some generalized statement of policy intent, which we know is about  the best we can do at this point really    Certainly    It really is If [growth] came to the low  side of the band, we can satisfy all of one group and if it came to  the top we can satisfy all of another group So all of you can be  satisfied     1/11/79 -40 -     It's [going to be] a low-keyed report as I  see it Not ""we are out there to do so and so,"" but we need some time  to observe how the real economy behaves and to complete our study of  the components of the money aggregates, how they [should be defined],  and what their proper alignment is    Steve, it seems to me that what we were  planning--we haven't seen that chapter [of the report1 yet, but I  think you and I talked about this--was to have a long-range chart on  each aggregate to show what we have done to bring each one down as  well as a shorter-term focus We need to focus on the year because it  gets lost But in a long-term chart we are intending to show that we  have been winding this [monetary growth] down as promised    I think we ought to cover the whole decade  Isn't that what we're going to do on these?    Well, yes We want to go back so we catch  the earlier cycle too and show how the money growth came up and then  we have been bending it downward And the ranges that we're  suggesting, if we say we are going to continue the same ranges, allow  us to continue that trend I don't want to get locked into promising  that I think Chuck's right I don't want to get locked into  promising anything I just want to say that all things equal, and  with our ambition to fight inflation being what it is, we can live  within those ranges to accomplish what's appropriate What is your  pleasure?    Do we need a vote on [the ranges for 19801?  Perhaps yes    Okay    May we consider those votes now? Henry  would you like to go unanimous with the first [vote on the 1919  ranges]? There's always a chance    Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of a  little mind and everyone knows that you're a big mind!    I think we can do the wording [later] And  if we feel we should circulate it to the Committee, we can do that I  don't think we should take the time now to do it We need to turn  now, I think, to the next issue Perhaps it would be worthwhile to  circulate the wording early, even before we put out the whole--    But this [part of the1 directive is  concerned with the long-term ranges it has no operational effect So  we could have time to consult with the Committee On the short-term  directive [regarding operations] until the next meeting, yes, it must  be precise   NOW let's turn to the next item on the agenda, which is the  question of short-term ranges And I believe the first thing is to  turn to the staff's recommendations Steve    Well, why don't we just go around the table  the same way quickly and get your individual recommendations We will  start again with Henry on this    You want us to skip you and come back to  you at the end?    Yes, Phil    Let me just put out a thought It seems to  me that an international disturbance is a serious [concern] It could  require that we take some action I don't know what that action would  be To try to [address that] in the short-term directive is almost  impossible It seems to me that we should get on the phone and we     1/11/79 -43-   should make a decision in a meeting So maybe we ought not be trying  to shape this directive to deal with an international crisis but have  a commitment to ourselves that if there is such a crisis, we will call  a meeting promptly and deal with it To anticipate what it will be,  why it occurred, what will start it, what the response should be, and  what else is going on, is very, very hard Anyway, that's just a  thought Frank    Thank you, Frank Ernie    Thank you John    Thank you very much, John Mark    Thank you Bob    Thank you, Bob Roger    Larry?    Thank you, Larry Bones?    Thank you very much Dave?    Willis has alternative 11, also Bob    Okay, alternative I1 with money market  Emmett    Thank you Nancy    When we want to upset them    All right Chuck    In which [alternative]?    Okay   M R   PARTEE A reduction in the funds rate next week    Now we got it Next week--in one week or I  days You want the President to get a speech off first    Paul    Okay, thank you Phil did we get your  specifications on M1 and MZ?     7/11/79 -47-    Alternative 111, okay Let’s get those in  there Now, let me ask two questions first [Unintelligible] even  with the specifications of leaving the funds rate at 10-1/4 percent  One is that we didn’t get a complete indication--though I believe we  covered everyone--of preferences for a money market or an aggregates  directive Is it critical to the ranges that we resolve that first?  John   ~fl BALLES 1 forgot to mention, Mr Chairman, a monetary  aggregates directive [is my preference]    Aggregates Okay Bob Black, you said a  money market directive, I believe    It is supposed to be that way We haven’t  operated that way much, recently Phil, you wanted which one?    Money market And Bones you wanted an  aggregates?    I’m sorry, we just got it down wrong See,  that’s why we need to check these Bob Mayo is for money market    And Chuck    Emmett    Nancy    And Paul said money market Henry    Well, that’s very interesting So it looks  like everybody is for a money market directive except John Balles--or  me, and I haven’t said what I’m for    I don't know that I'll add too much to this  conversation I do think that one of the things that will affect our  actual short-term policy, as distinguished from what we direct today,  is the outcome of the President's announced program If it is a  powerful program that causes a positive reaction in markets, it may  give us more running room to look at this differently On the other  hand, if it's a weak program and perceived to be so, we may have  enormous pressures on us in another direction I think we are likely  to be in consultation next week one way or the other My preference  would be for all of us to bear in mind that we shouldn't get too  locked into what we say until we hear what comes out of that and then  we should probably re-assess our thinking because we just can't  predict what we will think   Having said that, [according to my count] a lot of you are  for alternative I1 with a few variations There doesn't seem to be  much disagreement on maintaining the present level of the fed funds  rate at 10-1/4 percent Of the voting members, Chuck, I think you are  the only one who suggested--Frank did as a nonvoting member--a near-  term move down on the [funds rate]    Okay, then that gives us everybody standing  still here There's an overwhelming preference for a money market  directive This gives us on M1 a preponderance of preference for the  2-1/2 to 6-l/2 percent range On M2 there is a preponderance of 6-1/2  to 10-1/2 percent and on the range for fed funds a preponderance of--  it really looks like alternative I1 is it   Before we vote on that, I would like to take seriously John  Balles' suggestion that in the directive we give more weight to M2  And I would like an expression of sentiment from the voting members on  whether you would be so inclined or whether you would prefer to  continue with the equal weight    Increased M2    Now it's back to where there is no rate  advantage    Nevertheless, with that caveat and all the  other things [involved], what is your preference? Let’s just go down  [the list] Paul, would you want to change the weight?    We heard from John Bob Black    Phil    Bones    Okay Bob Mayo    Chuck    Emmett    Nancy    And Henry    Okay, it looks as if the preference is to  stay with equal weight Now having done that, let us see what our  vote would be on alternative I1 as is with the fed funds rate at  10-1/4 percent and a money market directive    Yes, 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent, the range we  now have Correct    No, a straw vote Let’s get things going     7/11/79 - 5 0 -     You would like to lower the bottom side of  that?    Okay John    That's on account of Paul    We will have a meeting, yes    Okay, that means at the moment we have  everybody voting for this except Paul, who could gulp and  [unintelligible] you can do it without a gulp    You've noticed how we have gulped all year  long If Paul will go with it, I will go with it That will make a  demand on us I think that's pretty good That's fantastic I knew  we would be unanimous this month! Remember, 1 told you that on the  phone Now do you believe me? Please don't change your votes now   There is one other issue and that is the recommendation with  respect to foreign currency operations Do we have [any renewals]?    We don't have any renewals We have the  Mexican swap line situation on which you received a memo We have  made no promises except to get [the Committee's] sentiment If you've  read the memo, the consideration is do we signal to the Mexican  central bank that we'd be willing to expand the swap line to $700  million from the present $350 million and then work out the details?  That's on the basis that this seems to be something they would like--  to improve their general relations with the United States They claim  they don't need the swap line and don't intend to use it, but they  would like to signal a cooperative spirit and the capacity to be  prepared in the future if they should need it Again, I don't have  any particularly strong sentiment There is some thought on our staff  that usually the swap lines are changed at the time of their renewals  in December The memo indicates that that hasn't been the record  The record seems to show dates in August and various other [times]  So I'm not sure that we can base our decision on whether the right  time to do it is at year-end    Could it be foreign policy that--    The request to us did not come from the  State Department   M R   WALLICH No, this came from the Mexicans    Directly from the--    Phil     7 / 1 1 / 7 9  -52-    Any other sentiments?    We, the Federal Reserve had?    I’m not understanding Phil, you have  confused me You said you didn’t see a reason not to do it becaue it  didn’t cost us anything And now you’re saying you are opposed to it   M R   COLDWELL No What I said, Mr Chairman, was that I  agree it doesn’t cost us anything But I think it has to be  demonstrated that there’s an overriding political gain to be achieved  by this I would oppose it otherwise    Scott, did you have anything that you  wanted to ask?    We haven't come out yet    Maybe I misunderstood or maybe it has been  misstated I did not view this as a political issue I viewed this  as [a means of] improving relations with the United States on the  initiative of the [Mexican central] bank I have never heard from the  State Department or anyone else on the subject [Bank of Mexico  officials] approached me directly They came in to see me and said we  need to build our relations with your country and make them stronger  We are a central bank, we'd like to [request an increase in our swap  line] That was the proposition And the advantage was not that they  wanted to use the money, but they wanted to demonstrate that we are  working closely together I don't know As I say, I don't have any  particularly strong feelings on this    Pardon me? Oh, you want to go down and  negotiate in Acapulco you say? Oh, shucks Well, I'll take this  under advisement They don't need to know immediately Maybe if I  get any thoughts from the counsel you have given, we'll come back with     7/11/79 -55-   a particular suggestion--either that we have a timetable or a  different approach or something   Now we must do something very important, which is to confirm  that we are going to meet again on August 14 here and by phone in the  interim should the need arise Is there any other business? Thank  you very much Lunch w i l l  be served   END OF MEETING    	790711meeting 	790711staffstatements 	790711chartshow    "
1104,1979-07-17," Let me outline why I have asked that we have this consultation At our last FOMC meeting the discussion included some thoughts [about] what the President might propose in his energy speech, and we tried to anticipate what monetary posture we might be prepared to arm ourselves with At that meeting it was, I think, our mutual view that we shouldn't try to guess what the President would say in his energy speech but should wait to hear it and then consult if appropriate Our purpose would be to evaluate the outcome, its effect on markets, and how [the energy program] relates to our general monetary and economic strategies and see where we go from there  I will give you a quick personal reaction The President's speech is still being evaluated; the fleshing out of his concrete proposals will have to take place before there is finally a sense of how this will work and whether it will make the kind of progress that we all hope In the meantime there has been a mixed reaction in both domestic and, particularly, international markets The international markets I'm going to have a report on in a moment I would just note that when the President spoke, the markets in the Far East were open Upon the completion of his speech there was a slight uptick, I believe, and then generally a bit of softening but nothing momentous But in the intervening days the market generally has been eroding downward and considerable resources have been required in [foreign exchange] intervention Under those circumstances rather than wait for some event that might be more difficult than we've had so far I just thought we would be well advised to (1) have a briefing and (2) get a reaction from people and viewpoints so that we are prepared and up to date Now we've lost Boston We may just have to forget this whole thing and try it again later I think we ought to not pay the bill for this [teleconferencing] system until it works every time There's just no point of having this Boston is not on? Well, let's all hang up again and we will try it once more Anybody left on the line?  [Secretary's note The phone connection was re-established and the roll was called again]   Again, I thought it would be wise if we would all consult To start off I think we have in New York--I hope--Gretchen on the line to give us a rundown on what is happening in the foreign exchange markets   Gretchen, what is your feel of the market? Who is in the market? What is its direction? Are we seeing official accounts, corporate accounts, and trading accounts shifting out of dollars? What is your evaluation?   Phil   The question was whether the Bundesbank in the week since the speech has shown any different attitude, the implication being that perhaps they were somewhat reluctant in supporting the dollar prior to the speech--from mid-June to last week Have they become more active in helping to support the dollar or not?   Well, let me just pick up from what has been said to give you an idea of what my concern is and what I would like to feel out the Committee about One could take the view that this is a natural reaction following the weakening of the dollar, for whatever reasons, from mid- June until the present and that as people understand and see the follow-up action by the President there will be a renewed sense of confidence in the dollar And with active intervention but not with massive intervention the dollar will stabilize and we will not see it dip below the November 1 levels and we will work our way out of this  The other possibility is that we're seeing the tip of the iceberg [from] both the US and foreign authorities Plus there's the question about the impact of the substantive moves the President is initiating Plus there is beginning to build up the usual groundswell of action, which leads professionals to be followed by others into these accounts and it ends up with a more precipitous move on the dollar, which gets away from us If it gets away from us and if central banks have already in a month spent $6-3/4 billion, of which $31 billion of the $68 billion, I guess, is for the US accounts, we'll probably spend over a billion dollars this week Are we in for a period that we can [manage to] hold it? If we do not, what worries me, of course, is that we will trip the confidence lever again We not only do that but a lower value of the dollar also has actual impacts on our economy through the higher cost of imports and the same inflationary impact we saw before And that only exacerbates our problem and puts us back on the track that was troubling us last year So, what to do?  One [alternative] is to make a judgment regarding which general direction is correct If the former [view] is correct, I think our option would be just to stay in here and keep our intervention [going], be persuasive with the Germans to be helpful, and weather the storm If the latter is likely to be the case, then one option is for the Federal Reserve to take monetary action that would indicate our determination to defend the dollar and to try to turn around the psychology of the situation The disadvantage of that, of course, is that we already have a weak economy Nothing has happened new in the economy that we know of that would change the outlook from what we were looking at a week ago Therefore, would our action--if we did it--to help the dollar and to offset the inflation [effects] set off some other chain of events that would worsen our recession? Would it lead to counter actions in the form of tax reductions or other things that would merely take away what we had just accomplished? Or would it be possible to take the action, risking that with a stabilized dollar and renewed confidence we'd be able to back off of the monetary action in a couple of months and go back to the path that we thought most likely [to be successful]? Those are the kinds of the issues that I see I haven't come to a conclusion; I just wanted to suggest that we kick them around Why don't we start here with some of the governors and then we'll go right down the list and ask for everybody's view Phil   Chuck   Thank you Nancy   Thank you, Nancy Emmett, you may want to pull that mike forward We are having a little trouble with the sound system   Thank you, Emmett Let's go right down the list [by District] Boston, Frank    7/17/79 5   Thank you, Frank We will go to New York and while we are there let's have both Paul Volcker and Henry Wallich give their comments   Thank you, Henry We will go to Philadelphia Am I correct that Dick Smoot is on the line?   Thank you, Dick Cleveland, Willis Winn   Thank you, Willis Richmond, is Bob Black on?   Thank you, Bob Atlanta, I believe we have Bob Forrestal   Thank you, Bob Bob Mayo in Chicago    7/17/79   Thank you, Bob St Louis I don't know if you are hearable, Larry We are not picking up a signal from St Louis here at the Board I don't know what we can do other than suggest that we contact Larry later and get his thoughts We are not going to take a vote or anything anyway; we are just trying to get counsel Larry, if you can hear me, that's what I would suggest I'll just go on to Minneapolis where I hope Mark Willes can hear me   Okay, Tom   Thank you, Tom Kansas City, I think Roger Guffey is on   Thank you, Roger We'll go to Dallas and I believe Ernie Baughman is on   Thank you, Ernie San Francisco, John Williams   Thank you, John I think we have now completed the go-around From this I would say the sentiment of concern is pretty clear but [the preference is for] no action at this point I gather from almost everybody that we should be watching this very closely and I assume that it would be appropriate to have similar conferences each day or as often as necessary as long as the situation is uncertain But we will try not to have them unless there is some real change in direction or some indication of movement Are there any comments or questions? I just want to say I appreciate having this opportunity to hear from everyone It helps greatly to get your views Any other comments?   I don't think we intended to take a vote This was just a consultation   Oh, the intermeeting limit, I'm sorry Phil Coldwell was suggesting that we get FOMC permission to raise the intermeeting limit [on changes in the System's foreign currency position] to $2 billion Is that necessary [today]?   When we were in trouble, last October I think it was, we suspended the limit for a while Let's consider that I'm not sure; do we need a vote on that at this moment?   It might be easier if we could send a telegram because I think it's hard--unless there's an overwhelming sentiment among the voting members to suspend the limit Let's just see quickly   I'm just asking what the sentiment is among the voting members on suspending the intermeeting limit on [changes in] foreign currency [holdings] because of current conditions, as we did last summer   Yes Well, Bob Black   Okay, we've heard enough sentiment Let's do this by telegram if we have to We don't need a split vote on that sort of thing Unless there are other comments--and I'll pause for a moment--[we can close] Hearing none, I thank you all very much We will be in touch Goodbye  END OF SESSION   "
1124,1979-07-19," Thank you very much, Steve Gretchen, are you on? Could we have your report on the foreign exchange market, please?   We hear you fine here in San Francisco   Thank you very much, Gretchen Well, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me--since the growth of the aggregates now appears to be over our upper limits--that we have a    7/19/79  condition where, in the absence of overriding instructions, the Desk would follow the directive and move the fed funds rate up I would like to outline some possibilities for consideration and then go around and get your reactions One possibility is to [issue] no new instructions The Desk would therefore interpret the directive, as Steve was suggesting, as meaning that the fed funds rate should be moved up to 10-1/2 percent  Let me say it this way instead The first alternative is to give overriding instructions to keep the fed funds rate where it is The second alternative is to let it go up [in accordance] with the directive The third alternative would be to let the fed funds go up with the directive to 10-1/2 percent and very quickly move the discount rate to, say, 10 or 10-1/4 percent to close the widening gap between the discount rate and the fed funds rate This would involve some tightening and some signal, which would not be tremendously dramatic Another possibility is that we could believe that we not only have aggregates problems but international or foreign exchange market problems and perhaps we ought to take a more forceful action-- move both the fed funds rate and the discount rate up further  I am not at the moment sure what the [Committee's] sentiment is My [inclination] is that the minimum we should do is to follow the directive under these conditions And should we do that, it seems that a discount rate increase is likely because a 1 percent gap [between the two rates] is very large and undoubtedly will be misinterpreted unless we do something to [reduce that] margin So with those general comments, what I'd like to do is run through the list and see how you all feel about it I'll start down the list I have here; it may not be in accordance with roll call [order] but I'll do my best Paul Volcker   Paul, I think your comment is well taken If we are going to take any monetary action, it might be [useful] to touch base with the Secretary of the Treasury and get it coordinated Well, we will go back [to my list] Bob Black   Thank you Phil Coldwell   Phil, would you be seeking a discount rate [action by] the Board tomorrow?   Thank you Emmett Rice   Thank you, Emmett Nancy Teeters   Okay, Nancy Henry Wallich   Thank you, Henry Larry Roos   Thank you, Larry Willis Winn   Thank you, Willis Ernie Baughman   Thank you, Ernie Dave Eastburn   Dave, we are not hearing you very well Before you comment, I hope you will [discuss your own preferences] and not feel bound by the choices I talked about   Thank you, Dave Frank Morris   Thank you, Frank I believe we have from Kansas City Henry Czerwinski Henry, are you there?   Thank you, Henry Bob Forrestall in Atlanta   Thank you, Bob Tom Gainor in Minneapolis   I thank you, Tom John Williams here in San Francisco   Unless I counted wrong, I believe I've covered all participants--Governors and either Presidents or First Vice Presidents Has anyone been omitted? My list seems to be complete  SPEAKER(?) You didn't hear from Chicago, Mr Chairman   Oh, fine What would Chicago like to say?   All right, I think that does it I'm sorry I missed Chicago In going back and recapping, it seems to me that from the FOMC point of view the reaction was overwhelmingly to follow the directive and go up to 10-1/2 percent on fed funds The sentiment for perhaps going a little [beyond that] didn't seem to be supported throughout the Committee So, for FOMC purposes, assume that this is a consultation and in the absence of alternative instructions we will    7/19/79  follow the directive and go to 10-1/2 percent Let's put it this way Does anyone on the FOMC voting group dissent from that?   I think the directive carries it to 10-1/2 percent, which is barely over what it is [now] I don't think we'll keep consulting I don't mean to hedge it but a weak 10-1/2 or a strong 10-1/2--   On the matter of the discount rate, of course, it is the prerogative of the Board of Governors to act on the recommendation of one or more [Reserve Banks] But I wanted to get the sentiment of the FOMC because I think it bears on how we fall In terms of the total System response on this telephone call, there seems to be overwhelming support for moving to at least 10 percent on an alignment basis or on the basis of [the monetary aggregates] or on the basis of the international [situation] or for all three reasons  However, I am not sure that sentiment showed up among the Governors [as a group] Phil didn't express [his view] and Henry did Nancy and Emmett said no change in the discount rate I'm not sure where the Governors are coming out We have to leave that in their laps to decide in view of the discussions of the whole group and what is going to [occur] once we have a 10-1/2 percent fed funds rate They will decide what is then appropriate If, however, the Governors begin to believe that an alignment is desirable, I think Phil's point is well taken that we should try to make that a System-wide response and give all the Banks as much chance as possible to be in on it  I don't know what is [the best way to proceed] I'd merely suggest that the Governors talk about this among themselves and perhaps I could call in the morning and see if there is anything that I should be doing I'll leave it to the Governors now, if they'd like to give me any advice Phil, do you have any suggestions?   Let's see We have five Board members [available today]; I'm here and four of you are there Chuck is not participating at the moment I guess he was not available Henry, I don't disagree with you I think it's going to be very strange if we have a 1 percentage point spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate; it will be misinterpreted Nonetheless, it    7/19/79  depends upon what the Governors as a body want to do So, Phil, how do you feel?   I think that would be a very good idea   I am trying to sense whether you'd rather do it now or in the morning, but I gather if the directors are willing-- Why don't we all get off this call and why don't you call me back in San Francisco and we'll just pick up from here   I think the answer is that we should have a conference of the Governors now If we decide that we need to close the spread, then we need to get back to you tonight, I think   That way we will act with some concert Is there anything else anyone would like to cover at this point?   Well, I'm open to suggestions on that Of course, the next time we'll have a look at [new data on] the aggregates will be a week from now Are you suggesting, Phil, that the range be changed now or changed [next week]?   If it becomes necessary for international purposes, then I think we ought to poll the FOMC It seems like somewhat of a blank check to say ""go over 10-1/2 percent"" without any feeling based on the international situation I'm not sure how the Desk could respond to that And I'm not sure the Chairman should give instructions when he doesn't have the consensus of the Committee   Would you put any ceiling on it at all?   Well, I'll run down [the list] and see if there's any sentiment for that Paul?   Bob Black?   Phil Coldwell?   Emmett Rice?   Nancy Teeters?   Henry Wallich?   Larry Roos   Willis Winn   I believe we have only nine voting members this afternoon and I think I've called on all the voting members We're missing an alternate for somebody; I don't know who it is Kansas City?  SPEAKER(?) And Chuck Partee   Anyway, I was given a telex showing that 9 voting members, including myself, [would be on this call]   Okay, we are missing the alternate That means that the vote would be 1,2,3,4,5,6--not counting me--for an increase in the range and 2 against; Emmett and Nancy would not do so That means that there is a majority to increase it and I'd be willing to go along with that I think we are going to have to consult before we move it much Emmett and Nancy, could you go along with it so we would have a unanimous vote?   All right Well, this isn't really a vote to go to 10-3/4 percent; this is raising the range so that based on further developments it could go there Nancy?   I think that's right, Peter And, as I say, I'm not sure that this is necessary We won't have any new data until next week and we'll be in the [midst of the Treasury] financing Plus I think we more or less have to consult about these things Nonetheless, the motion has been made Unless it is withdrawn, it looks as if there is a majority for it I am not sure of any procedure other than to say, well, that's the will of the Committee You have heard the comments Phil, are you still satisfied that we should set this range even though we are [unintelligible]? Have you had a problem?   Well, [if we were to] change the range, I don't see that the Desk would do anything differently in the next 7 days regardless of what happens to the discount rate The aggregates are barely above their upper limits and that doesn't call for greater movement [in the funds rate], absent some other directive So I'm a little confused by this process But it is a democratic process, so we'll do what the majority thinks is right   Well, let me say this, Phil I appreciate the reason and I appreciate the strong support here But my tendency is not to go off on these things without first having a quick phone call so we can get everyone involved I would hate to see us publish an interim action right now with dissenting votes It seems to me that this is a time when we need to unify ourselves For that reason I am a little reluctant to see us take an action if we are not going to use it, when we have two non-affirmative votes to be reported the next time [the Policy Record is published] It does not contribute to our overall course of action, so as long as there are dissenters who won't withdraw [their dissents], I would ask that the supporters withdraw at the moment Let's just leave it that we will be in touch with everybody if this action is necessary And tomorrow we will start again   Okay, then we will not take any formal action today We merely had a consultation and then proceeded with implementing the [current] directive Peter Sternlight, I assume you will be [implementing this] tomorrow?   Do you need any further instructions or guidance, Peter?   All right If there are no other comments or suggestions, then I'll ask Murray to close off this session and then I'll wait for your return call   I think the decision was made that we'll all hang up now and the Governors will stay in the Board Room Murray will call me back in San Francisco and we will have a Board of Governors session   Oh, I'm sorry, the Presidents--   It won't take more than 15 minutes   Very good point, Steve Any further comments? The suggestion is that if the Presidents would continue to be available for the next half hour at their own offices, we will be able to get back to them and tell them the sentiment among the Governors Any other comments or other questions?   Well, there are those who say I'm crazy but--   Thank you   Now you would like us to hang up   We are hanging up  END OF SESSION   "
