6838,2001-06-26," Dan has described the data that we use in our  analysis of the supply side of the economy  I will outline our methods for  estimating the rate of growth of structural productivity and potential output   Referring to the top of chart 4, the starting point for our analysis is the simple  observation that the growth of labor productivity is procyclical  Labor  productivity typically rises rapidly during the recovery phase of the business  cycle, slows down in the expansion phase, and declines during recessions  For many purposes in economic analysis, it is essential to abstract from these  short-run swings and focus instead on the underlying rate of increase in  productivity For example, firms may base their pricing decisions on  “normal” unit costs that correct for short-run cyclical variation in  productivity, or households may base their consumption on their perceptions  of their permanent income, which arguably reflect their views of the long-run  growth in their real incomes and hence the trend in productivity             Thus, for our medium- to long-run analysis, we define structural  productivity growth as the component of productivity growth that can be  sustained over a complete business cycle  It has also been called “trend”  productivity growth or “cyclically adjusted” productivity growth by other  researchers Its determinants are the same as those Dan described except that  estimates are made of the structural contributions of each of its components-­ with one important exception  We do not distinguish between actual and  structural growth in capital services  Although business investment clearly  fluctuates over the business cycle, in our view the actual path for investment-­    6/26-27/01 11   and hence the actual growth in individual industry capital stocks and services­ -best captures the resources available to produce goods and services at any  point in time  We also do not adjust for changes in the workweek of capital  in our measure of the growth of capital services  Such an adjustment could  be made for manufacturing industries, but it would be much more  problematic in the trade and service sectors            Given these assumptions, the critical part of our analysis is the estimation  of structural MFP Initial estimates of structural MFP growth are generated  using several econometric models  These estimates are refined using other  information about technological developments and supply shocks (such as  increases in energy prices) that influence the choice of production  technologies The black line in the middle panel of the chart shows actual  MFP growth If all of the recent pickup were judged to be permanent, this  series might be viewed as an upper bound on structural MFP growth  The  staff’s estimate of structural MFP growth is shown in red  Beginning in  1991, it moves up in discrete steps to a 12 percent growth rate in the post­ 1998 period           We put together the pieces of structural productivity growth in the table  in the lower panel As you can see on line 1, structural productivity grew  slowly over the 1973 to 1995 period but accelerated markedly after 1995,  reaching 32 percent last year by our estimates  A significant part of this step- up can be attributed to the boom in investment spending over that period that  substantially raised the contribution from capital deepening (line 2)  But the  rise in structural MFP (shown on line 4) also is an important part of the story          Your next chart presents our estimates of potential output growth over  history and our projections through 2002  By our definition, potential output  is the level of real GDP that could be produced with existing plant and  equipment when the unemployment rate is equal to the NAIRU  Potential  output growth is estimated as the sum of potential labor hours and structural  labor productivity As shown on lines 2 through 6, the primary determinant  of potential labor hours is growth in the civilian population  However, it also  incorporates shifts over time in labor force participation, the employment  rate, and the average workweek  For example, the increase in labor force  participation over the 1973 to 1995 period is estimated to have boosted  potential output growth by almost ½ percentage point per year, but this was  partially offset by a lessening in the average number of hours worked each  week (line 6) Movements in the NAIRU also affect our estimates of  potential output growth through the potential employment rate shown on line  5; a decline in the NAIRU increases the quantity of labor employed at full  employment, raising the potential employment rate  By our estimates, the  decline in the NAIRU over the 1995 to 2000 period contributed an extra 01  percentage point per year, on average, to the growth of potential output over  that period          6/26-27/01 12          Our forecast for potential output growth is shown on the right-hand side  of the table We project potential real GDP to increase 34 percent in 2001  and 2002--much more slowly than in recent years--owing to less rapid growth  in structural labor productivity (line 7) and potential labor hours (line 2)  The  anticipated slowdown in the growth of potential labor hours reflects the  updrift in the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU (line 12), which pushes down the  potential employment rate (line 5) in both years           The contribution from capital deepening to structural productivity  growth (shown on line 8) also is expected to drop back, given our Greenbook  forecast of a decline in business investment this year and only modest growth  in 2002 As you will recall, we began linking our estimates of capital  deepening to the projected Greenbook path for investment last summer  We  felt that such a direct link would help to ensure consistency between our  estimates of the supply side of the economy and our outlook for investment   At the time, Dave Stockton predicted that this would make our forecast for  potential output growth much more variable than in the past--certainly one of  Dave’s best forecasts of the past year!  [Laughter] But, given the wide  fluctuations in capital spending since early 2000, we believe this approach  has helped us to better monitor and better understand supply-side  developments and their implications for our forecasts of economic activity  and inflation          In contrast to the smaller contribution from capital deepening, we expect  structural MFP (line 10) to continue to grow at the 1-1/4 percent pace that we  estimate has prevailed since 1998  Despite the economic weakness this year,  businesses reportedly are proceeding with plans to use information  technologies to streamline the ways they deal with their customers and  suppliers A recent survey of planned research and development expenditures  also suggests that MFP growth will remain strong  As shown in the lower left  panel, the Battelle Institute reports that R&D expenditures will increase  another 3-1/4 percent in real terms in 2001, after growth of  5-3/4 percent  per year from 1995 to 2000 This finding is consistent with statements from  many high-tech firms that, despite cutbacks in other parts of their budgets,  spending for R&D is key to their long-run financial success and will not be  scaled back         The lower right panel of the chart illustrates one possible stress test of  our estimates of structural productivity growth and potential output Okun’s  law Okun’s law has proven to be one of the most reliable methods for  forecasting the unemployment rate  Using our estimates of the NAIRU and  potential output, we estimate a version of Okun’s law (specified in levels)  through 1994 and then perform a dynamic, out-of-sample simulation from  1995 through the first quarter of 2001  If our estimates of potential output  growth are too high, we would expect Okun’s law to over-predict the     6/26-27/01 13   unemployment rate; conversely, if we are too pessimistic about potential, the  model will underpredict  As you can see, with our estimate of potential  output growth, Okun’s law tracks the movements in the unemployment rate  fairly closely over this period This gives us some confidence that our  estimates are not too far off the mark   Jeff Fuhrer will now continue the presentation   Mr Chairman, may I respond?   I have a couple of comments  I personally like Jeff’s last   chart And rather than viewing this as a vice of the staff’s approach, we think it is a virtue  I’d   point to the Okun’s law chart, which is my last exhibit, Chart 5  When we’ve used this approach   over the last year or so, we really haven’t been off too far in our forecasts of the unemployment   rate Indeed, if we use a gross domestic income concept in Okun’s law, estimated in a very   similar way to the way we’ve done potential output on the product side, Okun’s law fits about the   same as shown in this chart  We haven’t done that recently, but when we’ve done it in the past,   the two methods haven’t diverged greatly  They may diverge at turning points, as you suggest    That’s something we haven’t looked at but we can do so  At any rate, we think this method has   served us in pretty good stead over the last year in helping us to understand what really has been   going on in the economy and in keeping our inflation and output forecasts on track with those   developments   Well, it is an iterative process  [Laughter]     6/26-27/01 24   But that number is not just knowledge  It’s knowledge plus   errors and cyclical behavior, too   There are two parts to that  The first is the investment part,   and we think we've done that correctly  That’s because for a concept of potential output or   structural productivity, we do not want the capital stock that might have been in place had we     6/26-27/01 40   never had a business cycle over the postwar period  That would be such a departure from reality   that it really would not help us to deal with the concepts involved  The adjustment for the   workweek of capital is an issue that we want to study  We recognize that in principle it would be   better if we could adjust for it, but it's very difficult to do so  We have a capacity utilization rate   that presumably could be used as a proxy for the manufacturing sector  But outside of   manufacturing, it is difficult to know how hours worked per week are changing  Utilization of   capital in a lawyer's office, for example, is very, very difficult to come to grips with  We could   take a crack at it, and we will pursue that idea  But I personally am not optimistic that that is   necessarily going to be a critical refinement to our measures of capital services that will   significantly change the patterns that we see in the final results   Were there such an innovation, my supposition is that we   would get a major increase in the rate of return on capital  We would see that reflected in greater   profitability, a larger flow of capital income, and that would be reflected in the capital deepening   numbers that would then boost structural productivity  And over time that would spread to other   countries as we exported those products and as we relocated factories abroad because of relative   wage differentials   Y2K is a very complex phenomenon to analyze  It is   particularly complicated for the capital services measure because there are two parts to that     6/26-27/01 44   measure  On the one hand, there's the capital stock itself and there are also weights--rental prices   or efficiency weights--that get attached to those various items  Indeed, one would expect to see   the phenomenon you talked about with respect to the capital stock, as firms replaced older   equipment that probably was not as efficient as the new equipment that replaced it  On the other   hand, the flow of capital income that all of this is benchmarked to through the rental price, in the   way the BLS calculates it, was reduced--I would assert  --by Y2K and the remediation efforts   associated with it  People spent lots and lots of time and money and probably reduced profits   relative to where they would have been had there been no Y2K effect  And in the process that   pulled down the rental price in the weights, which can either fully offset or more than offset the   positive benefits obtained from replacing old equipment with new equipment  So I don't think it's   a foregone conclusion, just because old equipment was replaced with new equipment, that in this   setting it necessarily was an enhancement to productivity  When we total up all the pieces, I   think the Y2K effect probably was a negative, although that is extremely difficult to show   empirically   We came up with a number of $50 billion for what it cost   corporations to remedy their Y2K concerns in terms of labor and consultants  That number didn't   include the capital  So that would have been taken out of their flow of capital income and would   have been reducing profits and holding down that rental price measure  We don't have a full   accounting for all these factors  I don't think it's clear that Y2K necessarily boosted capital   deepening as measured in this system     6/26-27/01 45   The way BLS constructs these numbers, they are part of the   capital stock from the product side obviously, but there is also a flow of capital income from the   income side  To the extent that those pollution abatement expenditures produced no profits but   actually reduced profits, then that would have been a compensating factor in the BLS numbers  It   would already be in these data, so you would not have to make a separate adjustment for it   That’s a complex question  I’ll tackle a piece of it  The   equipment got into output when it was produced; it gets into the capital stock, as measured by the   BLS, when a company purchases it  To the extent that it ever yields a profit, that gets into the   income flows from the corporate sector that we will see this year and in all subsequent years    Had it paid off the way people thought it would, it would have produced a flow of capital   services greater than what you’re actually going to see in the data when they’re finally published   because basically it’ll be in the capital stock  But if it’s written off, it is yielding zero capital   services or it may even be causing losses to the firm, which would be pulling down--    Yes, economic obsolescence   Right   Yes   Yes  "
7207,2003-01-28,"  One of the defining characteristics of the economy over   the past two years has been the lack of any net employment gains despite a recovery  in economic activity  As shown in the top left panel of chart 5, nonfarm payrolls in  the fourth quarter of last year (the T+4 observation) were lower than at the time of the  apparent business cycle trough in the fourth quarter of 2001  Indeed, payrolls have  followed pretty closely the pattern of 1990-91—the so-called jobless recovery  As  shown in the top right panel, the obvious flip side of this record is that labor  productivity has been quite strong in the current episode, with output per hour rising  an estimated 3¾ percent over the four quarters of last year     These developments have once again led us to raise our estimates of structural   multifactor productivity growth  As shown in the middle left panel, we now estimate   January 28-29, 2003 73 of 195    that structural MFP increased 18 percent last year  In our view, a good part of this  acceleration reflected corporate actions to restructure operations and eliminate  inefficiencies  Such actions boosted the level of structural MFP and hence had only a  transitory influence on the growth rate; we anticipate some further gains of this sort in  2003  But we also have inched up our estimate of the permanent component of  structural MFP growth to 1½ percent  Technology has continued to improve in recent  years, aided by rising real expenditures on research and development (shown in the  middle right panel)  Although the growth of real R&D spending is down from the  pace early in the decade, lagged effects of past increases arguably should still be  boosting structural MFP growth  As you can see in the table at the bottom, these  adjustments, together with a few refinements to our projection of capital deepening,  raised the growth rate of structural productivity to 2¼ percent in 2002 and 2003 and  to almost 2½ percent in 2004; these revisions carried through to our forecast of  potential output growth as well      Chart 6 presents the implications of these assumptions for the expected   performance of the labor market  As we have noted before, we believe that the gains  in labor productivity over the past year have stretched work forces beyond levels that  are sustainable in the long run and that hiring will pick up as the prospects for sales  and profits improve  Although we expect nonfarm payrolls to be about flat over the  next few months, hiring averages about 100,000 per month in the first half of this  year, 225,000 per month in the second half, and about 300,000 per month in 2004   As a result, actual labor productivity grows 1¾ percent, on average, over the next two  years—about ½ percentage point below its structural pace  We expect this near-term  weakness in the labor market to result in a rise in unemployment, and we are  forecasting the unemployment rate to peak at 62 percent in the first half of this year   The unemployment rate then is projected to drop back to 54 percent by the end of the  projection period as economic activity accelerates  As indicated in the middle left  panel, this projection closely follows the predictions of the staff model of Okun’s law  when allowance is made for the TEUC program, which we estimate raises the  unemployment rate by 02 percentage point     Of course, we could be wrong about our structural productivity assumptions, and   in the Greenbook we explored two alternative structural productivity scenarios  It is  possible that the gains in productivity last year were entirely cyclical and that there  has been no recent acceleration in structural productivity growth (the blue line in the  middle right panel)  As shown in the table, if this “slower” MFP hypothesis were  correct, real GDP growth would run below the baseline forecast, and the inflation rate  would turn out higher  Alternatively, if all of the acceleration in structural MFP last  year represented a permanent change in MFP growth (the red line), we would be  understating the long-run potential growth rate of the economy  Under the  assumption of “faster” MFP growth, real GDP growth expands at a faster pace than in  the baseline forecast, and inflation is lower     Our compensation projection is the subject of chart 7  Although our main   measures of hourly compensation have painted somewhat different pictures of   January 28-29, 2003 74 of 195    compensation growth in recent years—mainly reflecting the movement of stock  option realizations that are included only in P&C compensation per hour—we expect  both measures to trend downward over the forecast period  This downtrend is most  evident in the wages and salaries component of the employment cost index (the  middle left panel) where the combination of falling inflation expectations (the bottom  left panel) and slack in labor markets—as measured by the unemployment gap shown  at the bottom right—continue to temper workers’ wage demands  In contrast, we  expect the rising costs of employer-provided benefits (shown in the middle right  panel) to offset some of the deceleration in wages  Rising contributions for health  insurance premiums and a step-up in employer payments to defined benefit pension  plans—as the result of the decline in the stock market in the past two years—are the  principal reasons for the acceleration     Similarly, as shown in chart 8, consumer price inflation is projected to slow in   2003 and 2004  The PCE chain price index (shown in the top left panel) is forecast to  rise at a 1¼ percent pace over the next two years, down about ½ percentage point  from the pace last year  After peaking in the current quarter, crude oil prices are  expected to decline over the projection period, resulting in falling prices for consumer  energy products (the blue bars in the right panel)  In contrast, food prices (the red  bars) are expected to rise moderately in the next two years  Core PCE inflation (the  red line in the middle panel) is forecast to move lower over the next two years  As  you can see in the two bottom panels, a continued wide margin of slack in product  markets puts downward pressure on prices, and this is only partially offset by the  expected updrift in non-oil import prices     Chart 9 reviews the analysis that was sent to the Committee last November on the   macroeconomic consequences of a potential war with Iraq  As you will recall, we  went to great lengths to emphasize that what we don’t know about the economic  effects of such a conflict far exceeds the little that we do know  Our analysis was and  is intended to serve as a framework for thinking about this issue, and it should  definitely not be construed as a forecast of the conduct of the war or its quantitative  effects  We examined two potential military scenarios  a successful one-month  conflict that entailed an incremental budgetary cost of $20 billion and a successful  six-month war that bore a $50 billion incremental price tag  In our analysis, we did  not make any special allowance for exogenous confidence effects, swings in risk  premiums, or the consequences of retaliatory terrorist attacks  Clearly, such  responses could be the key elements in the macroeconomic response to a war with  Iraq, but lacking a convincing means of quantifying such events, we decided not to  include them       The FRB/US model was used to simulate four war and oil price combinations   under the assumption that monetary policy follows a Taylor rule  In the “quick  victory” scenario, the war lasts one month, no oil production is lost, and as shown by  the red line in the middle panel, oil prices drop $4 per barrel below baseline  immediately after the conflict   Oil prices continue to fall gradually over time as  additional oil production comes on line, eventually reaching a level of $17 per barrel   January 28-29, 2003 75 of 195    by 2010  As you can see in the bottom panel, such a scenario gives a boost to  economic growth in the near term and reduces the inflation rate  In the “six-month  war” scenario, Iraqi oil exports cease, and oil prices rise $10 per barrel above baseline  (shown as the black line in the middle panel) in the first half of this year; prices then  drop back below the baseline path when the war is successfully concluded  There are  two offsetting effects on real GDP growth this year  The increase in defense  spending tends to push up output, while higher oil prices have a depressing effect   Thereafter, the stimulative consequences of lower oil prices dominate  In the third  scenario, a six-month war causes a shutdown of oil production in Iraq and Kuwait and  induces several radical states to impose a temporary oil embargo  With the more  significant loss of supply, oil prices rise $30 per barrel above baseline in the first half  of this year (the blue line in the middle panel) before dropping back later in 2003   Under these assumptions, real GDP declines ¼ percentage point below the baseline  path this year, and inflation rises sharply  Lower oil prices and interest rates  eventually push real GDP growth above baseline in 2004 and 2005  In the final  scenario, a six-month war is accompanied by the loss of 4 million barrels per day  from the world oil market for a period of three years, raising oil prices $20 per barrel  above baseline (the green line in the middle panel)  Rising non-OPEC production  eventually causes oil prices to fall but only to a long-run price of $25 per barrel       No, these are nominal terms  In this scenario, real GDP   falls this year and next, whereas inflation is higher in both years  Real GDP regains  some of the shortfall relative to baseline in 2005, largely in response to easier  monetary policy  These model simulations suggest two tentative conclusions about  the macroeconomic consequences of a potential war with Iraq  First, to the extent  that any war is short, successful, and results in a lasting increase in world oil  production, the direct economic consequences are, on net, positive for the United  States  Second, if the war produces adverse geopolitical developments that result in a  persistent reduction in the supply of oil sold on world markets, the direct economic  consequences are negative  Karen Johnson will now continue with our presentation      The capital composition?    I believe that’s in there    I’m not sure I have it with me    The trend component was the part that we thought would   persist; the transitory part reflected the level effects that we saw going on  So if a business   restructures—makes some one-time efficiency gains that we think are going to last in terms of   the level of its productivity—we call that the transitory effect  We saw that type of restructuring   effect a lot last year as opposed to an ongoing introduction of new technologies that would   revolutionize the way businesses operate—as we saw in the late 1990s  So we were trying to   distinguish one effect from the other    We don’t have a ton of direct evidence  Basically that R&D   graph was an attempt to get at the idea that technology has continued to advance in recent years   but perhaps not as rapidly as the rate of advance in the late ’90s  If one digs a little deeper into   the statistics, it is apparent that the growth in R&D over the last couple of years has been   financed mainly by the federal government—not by private companies  By way of comparison,   in 1999 and 2000 those numbers for private companies were in the 6 percent growth rate range    So as we’ve watched these developments and judgmentally done the parsing here, the reason   we’ve gravitated more toward the transitory as opposed to a major ratcheting up in the longer-  term growth rate was the fact that those trends don’t look quite as favorable as before  In   addition, if we throw in the embodiment hypothesis, clearly the lack of an investment boom   comparable to what we had in the late 1990s should be taking something off structural   productivity growth  That doesn’t necessarily reduce the level, but it doesn’t produce the added   impetus that it was providing  So our attempt here has been to be cautious in saying how much   is permanent  The 15 percent multifactor productivity growth is still quite strong  It’s just not   as strong as what we saw last year  In part we think there were a lot of adjustments going on—  some related to the aftermath of September 11 that were unique to 2002 and others that are more   likely to be one-time or occasional events than to be repeated consistently over our forecast   period  That’s the thought process that we’ve gone through   January 28-29, 2003 89 of 195     There are obvious cases like that in biotechnology also  What   strikes us is that today these tend to be more evolutionary in the structure of technology than   revolutionary the way they were perhaps in the 1990s, when a whole new industry and way of   doing business came into being    I’m not saying that there isn’t further to go  That will happen    But over our forecast period, given the other conditioning assumptions, this is what we view as   the most likely scenario    No  "
7486,2004-01-27,"  Your next exhibit discusses key trends in the labor   market  As Larry noted in his first chart, until very recently, payroll employment has  been notably weak in this expansion  As shown by the blue line in the top left panel,  gains in payroll employment have run well below the typical postwar cyclical  experience and have now diverged even from those in the jobless recovery of the  early 1990s  Of course, the flip side of the lack of employment growth has been the  spectacular increases in labor productivity in recent years  In putting together our  forecast, we have again reassessed our outlook for the supply side of the economy in  light of these latest developments       With the comprehensive revision to the national income and product accounts not   changing the underlying picture of productivity growth in the past few years, and with  the gains in payroll employment remaining on the anemic side, we have raised our  estimates of structural productivity  As indicated in the top right panel, we now  estimate that structural multifactor productivity increased almost 3 percent last year,  as businesses met increases in demand by better management of their existing capital  and labor resources  We don’t think increases in structural MFP of last year’s  magnitude are likely to persist, but we have boosted our projections for the growth of  structural MFP this year and next  Even with these revisions, the estimated level of  actual productivity (shown in the middle left panel) lies above its structural trend   We expect actual productivity to run about parallel to the trend early in 2004,  resulting in continued modest gains in payrolls (the middle right)  But with  businesses becoming more optimistic about sales prospects, we anticipate that hiring  will pick up, bringing the level of actual productivity back into line with the estimated  structural trend in 2005  Returning to the top left panel, you can see by comparing  the slopes of the three lines that, once hiring picks up in earnest, employment grows  at about the same rate as in preceding business cycles     Despite the lack of gains in the payroll survey of employment, household   employment has increased, and the unemployment rate (the black line in the bottom  left panel) has fallen  I should note that, although it has outpaced the payroll survey  measure, growth in household employment in this expansion also has been weak  relative to its normal cyclical pattern  Moreover, with the labor market perceived to   January 27-28, 2004 102 of 238    have little vitality, the labor force participation rate (the red line) has moved lower, on  net, over the past four years  As is illustrated in the bottom right panel, this pattern  seems consistent with past cyclical movements in participation about its estimated  trend, and we are anticipating some upward movement in participation in the not-too- distant future in response to the past and prospective firming in economic activity   However, such an increase in the participation rate still remains a forecast, and we  clearly cannot rule out the possibility that further declines in participation will result  in a more rapid decline in the unemployment rate than we are projecting in the  January Greenbook forecast     Your next exhibit presents our current projections of potential GDP  As can be   seen by comparing lines 1 and 3, we did not raise our estimates of potential by as  much as our estimates of structural productivity  This reflects three key  considerations  First, post-revision rates of wage and price inflation seemed  consistent with our earlier estimates of resource gaps  Second, our model of Okun’s  law, shown in the middle panel, remained solidly on track after the comprehensive  revision  Third, based on the persistent differences in the growth of hours worked in  the household and payroll surveys, we reduced the so-called technical factor (shown  on line 6) that accounts for the differences in the trend growth of hours in the  household and payroll surveys  As can be seen in the bottom panel, the resultant  forecast of the GDP gap is little different from the December Greenbook  And we  continue to project the elimination of slack in both product and labor markets by the  end of next year     Your next exhibit presents recent data on inflation  After an energy-related bulge   at the beginning of 2003, consumer prices—as measured by either the CPI or the PCE  price index—slowed significantly, on net, over the remainder of the year  There also  was a broad-based slowing in measures of core consumer price inflation (the top right  panel) to a pace of about 1 percent  In contrast, as shown in the middle left panel,  food prices accelerated over the course of last year  The pickup was related to  stronger foreign and domestic demand for beef as well as to some delays in the  supply response to higher prices  The middle right panel illustrates how this excess  demand bid up the prices of live cattle until the discovery of mad cow disease in the  United States in late December (shown as the vertical line in the panel)  After a few  days of significant declines, spot cattle prices stabilized at their levels of last summer  and then ticked back up a bit  Futures prices suggest some downward pressure on  spot prices in the first half of this year  As far as labor costs are concerned, we will  get the ECI for the fourth quarter on Thursday  Wage inflation, as measured by  average hourly earnings in the bottom left, fell to a 2 percent pace in December,  reflecting the slack in labor markets and relative stability in expected inflation, shown  on the bottom right     Your next exhibit outlines our outlook for inflation  Overall PCE inflation is   expected to slow to a 1 percent pace, on average, over the projection period  The  decline from last year’s pace reflects smaller increases in food prices and renewed  declines in energy prices  Core PCE prices also are projected to rise at about a   January 27-28, 2004 103 of 238    1 percent pace—a tad higher than last year  Although non-oil import prices are  expected to give a slight boost to inflation this year, continued strong growth in  structural productivity, stable inflation expectations, and some remaining slack in  resource utilization are expected to keep core inflation contained  The middle right  panel presents the outlook for ECI compensation per hour, which is projected to  increase about 3¾ percent per year in 2004 and 2005—a bit below the pace in 2003   We expect the contribution from wages and salaries to fall slightly as the influence of  labor market slack is almost offset by somewhat greater pass-through of productivity  gains into wages  Pressure from rising health insurance costs and a cyclical increase  in bonuses is responsible for the rise in the contribution of benefit costs over the  projection period  The bottom two panels update our FRB/US-based estimates of the  probability of deflation  As you will recall, we have presented two definitions of  deflation in the past  We defined “effective” deflation to be PCE price inflation of  ½ percent or less  “Pernicious” deflation adds the additional requirement that the  unemployment rate exceeds 6 percent  As shown on the bottom right, although both  probabilities have fallen significantly since your June 2003 meeting, they still remain  nontrivial risks to the staff forecast     Finally, at the risk of inflicting further psychological trauma on the Chairman, the   last exhibit presents your forecasts for 2004  [Laughter]  The central tendency of  your projections for real GDP is 4½ to 5 percent, which you forecast will result in a  decline in the unemployment rate to between 5¼ and 5½ percent  You project  consumer price inflation to be little changed this year at a pace of 1 to 1¼ percent   That concludes our report  My colleagues and I would be happy to answer any  questions you might have      As we looked at the consumer price data for November and   December, we were surprised at the large decline in core prices in November  In examining the   detail, the declines were in some components for which we did not expect continued large price   reductions  One of the categories in which we saw huge price declines in the fourth quarter was   used cars, which was probably related to the price incentives on new cars  Those declines were   big enough to matter for the actual total price indexes  We looked at that, and we didn’t expect   prices for used cars to bounce back up, but then again we didn’t think they would continue to go   down at a double-digit pace either  As we went through other categories, it seemed to us that in   the last couple of months the prices for some particular categories were affected a lot by special   circumstances  We saw that early in the year, too, when prices in certain categories moved up   and then down or moved down and then back up again, and the three-month change in core   inflation moved around a lot relative to the twelve-month change  I think we showed a chart in   the pre-FOMC briefings several times last year depicting that pattern  The two series are   converging and are fairly close together—the latest three-month change is a little below the   twelve-month change—so we do think that prices are a little low now and will probably move up   a bit in coming months  We aren’t talking about a big bounceback; these are still monthly   changes of around 01percent on core CPI  That is just enough relative to what happened in   November and December to have this measure tick up a bit relative to the fourth quarter    We think that the payroll survey is probably giving the more   accurate description of what is really going on in the labor market  One of the things that people   have looked at in the household survey is whether the estimates of population on which that   survey is fundamentally based are correct  If they have overestimated population, as they did   earlier in the decade, then that will inflate household payroll gains relative to payroll gains  We   think there is some preliminary evidence that that might be the case for the early years of 2001   and 2002  We’ve seen divergences between these two surveys in the past, and they tend to   correct over time  The BLS tends to put greater weight on its measure of the payroll survey, and   we have historically also  So we believe that is an accurate description of the state of the labor   market today     That is possible; the December report seemed an aberration to   us  It didn’t seem consistent with all of the other data we were getting at the time, and we may   see a revision in the next report  The claims data are measuring people going onto the   unemployment rolls, and we’ve clearly seen fewer layoffs occurring in both that series and the   challenger series—or in any of the other layoff series that we look at  We have not yet seen in   earnest a pickup in hiring—the flow of workers back into jobs  The dearth of hiring is a pattern   that we still are seeing through the third and fourth quarters in the labor market  There has been   some good news—layoffs are down—but hiring isn’t really up yet the way we would like to see   it   January 27-28, 2004 117 of 238      No  Larry’s chart has our productivity number at about 3¼    As we look at the historical relationship between growth and   employment, we think hiring will kick in at some point here, and when it does we may be   understating payroll gains  We have revised down our payroll employment forecast in recent   rounds  As I look at the blue line in the top left chart, the rise does seem a little shallower than   the norm  But that may be a second order effect in the eye of the beholder; I could imagine a   period of gains in payroll employment for a while in excess of what we’ve written down here   January 27-28, 2004 118 of 238     We’ve seen it before in past business cycles  "
7691,2005-02-01," Your next chart presents the outlook for the labor  market  With real GDP projected to grow at slightly above its potential pace, we  expect nonfarm payrolls (the upper left panel) to expand at an average pace of about  200,000 per month through 2006  As you can see, that pace is a bit above the rate of                          February 1-2, 2005 72 of 177  job creation last year Businesses reportedly have become convinced that the  economic expansion is on a solid footing, and we are anticipating that they will be  hiring more aggressively    That said, we do not think firms are abandoning their focus on boosting  efficiency As shown in the upper right panel, we expect structural labor  productivity to continue to rise at a brisk pace over the forecast period, albeit below  that experienced from 2001 to 2003  Given our investment forecast, we expect a  rising contribution from capital deepening (the blue shaded area), while the rate of  multifactor productivity [MFP] growth slows from the extraordinary pace witnessed  in recent years We think a good part of the 2001-2003 acceleration reflected one­ time changes in the level of productivity, as firms implemented managerial and  organizational changes, rather than a speed-up in the underlying rate of technological  progress Such organizational changes are expected to diminish in importance as the  upswing proceeds, and we are forecasting structural MFP growth to move back  towards its longer-run average   With this slightly slower rate of structural productivity growth and the pickup  in hiring, we are projecting the level of actual labor productivity (the black line in the  middle left panel) to move back into line with the level of structural productivity by  the end of next year   We also are anticipating that the more favorable labor market conditions will  begin to attract workers back into the labor force As shown in the middle right  panel, the labor force participation rate is projected to move up over the projection  period after the large declines of recent years However, the progress here is only  modest, and the participation rate remains below its estimated trend     The combination of above-trend economic growth and rising participation  rates is sufficient in our forecast to keep the unemployment rate (shown in the lower  left panel) on a gradual downtrend, reaching 5 percent—our estimate of the  NAIRU—by the end of next year The ratio of employment to population—a  measure of slack that combines movements in both the unemployment rate and the  labor force participation rate—increases slightly over the projection period   Your next chart presents the outlook for the growth in labor compensation   As indicated in the data insert in the top panel, the fourth-quarter readings on both  the ECI [Employment Cost Index] and P&C compensation per hour [from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Productivity and Cost release] came in a good bit below  our expectations Although we have heard anecdotes of shortages of some types of  skilled workers, sufficient slack evidently remains in the labor market to put  downward pressure on the growth of compensation in the aggregate  Given these  new data, we would be inclined to shave a couple of tenths off of our compensation  forecast We expect the growth in compensation to remain at about its 2004 rate (the  lines in the upper panel) One-year-ahead inflation expectations (shown in the                       February 1-2, 2005 73 of 177  middle left) have drifted upward slightly in response to the increases in energy  prices, and we expect this to be reflected in wage demands this year  In addition, the  lagged effects of the acceleration in structural labor productivity also should result in  somewhat larger gains in compensation  Moreover, the depressing effect of labor  market slack (shown in the middle right panel) is projected to diminish over the  projection period These forces are manifest in our projection of a somewhat faster  rate of increase in the growth of wages (shown on the lower left), but this is offset by  slower growth in benefits This slowdown reflects smaller increases in employer  contributions to retirement and saving plans, after these payments surged in 2004   Your next chart reviews recent price developments  As shown in the upper  left panel, the 12-month change in consumer prices moved up sharply last year,  mainly in response to higher energy prices (shown in the upper right panel)  As you  know, higher world crude oil prices and supply-driven fluctuations in domestic  refining margins were responsible for the swings  Increases in food prices (the  middle left panel) were relatively stable As indicated in the middle right panel, the  rate of increase in core consumer prices moved up to about a 1½ percent rate in early  2004 and held at about that pace for the remainder of the year  As indicated in the  table on the lower left, all of this acceleration occurred in goods prices, where, in  addition to a large, idiosyncratic swing in used cars, price increases were broad- based In our view, the underlying acceleration in goods prices reflects the run-up in  intermediate materials prices shown on the right, the pass-through to the retail level  of higher energy costs, and the weaker foreign exchange value of the dollar   Your next chart presents the outlook for inflation The rate of increase in  total PCE prices (shown on the upper left) is expected to slow to a 1¼ percent pace  in 2005 and 2006 Energy prices (shown on the upper right) are expected to retrace  part of last year’s run-up over the projection period, while the rate of increase in food  prices (not shown) slows by about ¾ percentage point  Core inflation (shown on the  middle left) is projected to remain at a 1½ percent rate  This projected stability of  core inflation reflects several offsetting factors  The slower pace of structural labor  productivity is expected to result in somewhat faster growth in trend unit labor costs,  and the declining margin of slack in labor and product markets is projected to exert  less downward pressure on wages and prices Offsetting these influences, the rate of  increase in core, nonfuel import prices (shown on the middle right) is forecasted to  fall back to zero in 2006, and the indirect effects of lower energy prices are expected  to put downward pressure on retail prices   The bottom two panels explore risks to the inflation forecast  In the higher- inflation scenario, we interpret recent anecdotal reports of worker shortages as  evidence that the NAIRU is 5½ percent rather than 5 percent In addition, we  assume that last year’s slowdown in the growth of employers’ contributions for  health insurance to 7 percent was transitory and that these payment rise 10 percent in  2005 and 2006 We also assume greater pricing power on the part of firms, which  are able to pass these cost shocks through to consumer prices—holding the price                            February 1-2, 2005 74 of 177  markup (shown on the lower left) at its present level  Under these circumstances,  core PCE inflation (shown as the red line in the lower right panel) rises to almost 2½  percent in 2006   In the lower-inflation alternative, we assume that the rate of increase in  structural multifactor productivity growth does not slow as in the baseline forecast  but holds at a 2¼ percent rate over the 2004-2006 period In implementing this  simulation, we have assumed that financial markets have already incorporated this  expectation, and thus there is no additional effect on asset prices With the faster rate  of structural MFP growth boosting aggregate supply, core PCE inflation slows to 1  percent in 2006 Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation   The final chart presents your economic projections  for 2005 and 2006 As shown in the upper panel, the central tendency of your  forecasts for real GDP this year is 3¾ to 4 percent The unemployment rate is  projected to be 5¼ percent, while the central tendency for core PCE inflation is 1½ to  1¾ percent As indicated in the lower panel, you expect real GDP growth to slow to  3½ percent in 2006 and the unemployment rate to fall to between 5 percent and 5¼  percent For core inflation in 2006, the central tendency remains at 1½ to 1¾  percent Mr Chairman, that completes our presentation  "

7887,2006-01-31,"  Your next two exhibits detail the supply-side   assumptions of the staff forecast, starting with the projection of structural labor  productivity  In our analysis, structural labor productivity growth is defined as the  increment to labor productivity that can be sustained over time  It is a medium- to  long-run concept that attempts to eliminate the bulk of the cyclical influences on  productivity growth  As shown on the top right, structural labor productivity growth  can, in turn, be decomposed into the contributions from capital deepening, labor  quality, and structural multifactor productivity growth       As indicated in the middle left panel, the recovery that has occurred in the level of   business capital spending over the past four years translates into a pickup in the   January 31, 2006 19 of 106    growth of capital services, although not to the pace that prevailed during the boom  years of 1995 to 2000  The contribution of capital deepening to structural  productivity growth—that is, the product of the growth in capital services per hour  and the capital share of output—picks up gradually over the next two years  Note in  the middle right panel that the bulk of this contribution comes from investments in  information technology—as has been the case for all of this decade      In contrast, the pace of growth in structural multifactor productivity—shown in   the bottom left—has greatly exceeded the pace over the 1995 to 2000 period  This is  just the manifestation at the aggregate level of the driving forces shown in Dave’s  scatter plot  However, we have allowed for slightly slower growth in 2006 and 2007  than in the preceding years as the marginal gains from additional organizational  improvements and embodied technical change begin to wane  In addition, as noted in  the right, we’ve seen some leveling-off in expenditures on research and development  lately, which may well manifest itself in a somewhat slower pace of technological  change in the years ahead     Your next exhibit presents our estimates of potential output growth  As shown on   line 1, we expect potential real GDP to expand at a 3¼ percent pace over the next two  years  As you can see on line 2, total potential hours worked—or trend labor input— is expected to slow somewhat  Although population growth is expected to be well  maintained, the trends in both labor force participation and the average workweek are  offsetting factors  As we’ve noted before, the downtrend in the labor force  participation rate (shown in the middle left) mainly reflects the changing  demographic composition of the workforce  The estimated trend in the workweek (in  the middle right panel) shifted down in 2001—reflecting the introduction of NAICS  in the payroll survey—and is expected to fall at about the same pace in 2006 and  2007 as it has since 2001     The implications of these supply-side assumptions for the labor market are shown   in the bottom two panels  Although nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase briskly  in the near term, we expect gains to slow progressively over the next two years,  reflecting the moderation in the pace of economic growth and the slower growth in  the potential labor force that I just described  Indeed, we expect trend payroll growth  to average only 100,000 per month over the next two years  As shown on the bottom  right, the unemployment rate holds fairly steady this year and next  Given the pace of  economic growth last year, our model of Okun’s law was surprised by the extent of  the decline in the unemployment rate—the gap between the red and black lines  We  are expecting this error to be worked off over the course of this year, and in 2007 the  unemployment rate moves in sync with the Okun’s law simulation      Your next exhibit presents the outlook for the growth in labor compensation  In   the January Greenbook, we projected hourly compensation, as measured by both the  ECI and P&C compensation per hour, to accelerate over the next two years  We  think that continued strong growth in structural labor productivity will elevate wage  demands, while labor market slack will be a relatively neutral influence on   January 31, 2006 20 of 106    compensation growth  Inflation expectations to date have remained anchored, but we  have allowed for some pass-through into wages of the higher price inflation in 2004  and 2005       This morning’s reading on the ECI showed that hourly compensation in private   industry increased 3 percent in the 12 months ending in December—the same as the  judgmental projection in the January Greenbook  However, as you can see in the  bottom left, our econometric equation for the ECI has overpredicted the actual growth  in compensation since the middle of 2004, possibly suggesting that our estimated  NAIRU of 5 percent is too high  In looking at the range of econometric wage and  price models that we follow, the evidence on a change in the NAIRU is mixed  We  have noted a tendency for some models to overpredict inflation lately  But as shown  in the bottom right, the random nature (and the smaller absolute size) of the errors  from one of our better reduced-form price equations does not yet suggest the need to  lower our estimate of the NAIRU  I will return to the implications of this assumption  later in my remarks      Your next exhibit presents the outlook for inflation  Recent readings on headline   inflation (shown in the top left) have remained at the high end of the elevated range  that has prevailed since 2004  Those readings reflect mainly the direct effects of  higher energy prices, which have increased at an average pace of 20 percent per year  over the past two years  In contrast, we have seen some moderation in the pace of  core consumer price inflation, with the twelve-month change in both the core PCE  and the core CPI indexes slowing to about 2 percent       Looking ahead, we have had to cope with somewhat greater pressures on inflation   in this Greenbook  These pressures stem mainly from the upward revisions to our  projections of crude oil prices and core nonfuel import prices that Dave discussed   As a result of these changes, the moderation in PCE energy prices is somewhat less  than in past Greenbooks, and we anticipate greater spillovers on the prices of other  industrial materials (shown in the middle right)  On net, we expect core PCE prices  (line 4 in the bottom left panel) to increase 2¼ percent this year before decelerating to  1¾ percent in 2007 as the influence of these cost shocks recedes     The bottom right panel shows two alternative simulations that address key risks to   the inflation outlook  The adverse shocks simulation assumes that the economy is hit  with additional increases in the prices of oil, non-oil imports, and industrial materials  that match those that prevailed in 2004  Under the assumption that the funds rate  remains on its baseline path, core PCE inflation moves up to about 2½ percent in  2006 and 2007 (the red line)  In contrast, as I noted earlier, our estimate of the  NAIRU may be too high, and a second simulation examines the implications of a  4¼ percent NAIRU—essentially one standard deviation below our current estimate   Under this assumption, core PCE price inflation falls to 1½ percent by the end of next  year  Even though these two simulations embody some fairly large differences in  assumptions from the Greenbook baseline, both simulations remain well inside a   January 31, 2006 21 of 106    70 percent confidence interval about our forecast  Nathan will now continue with our  presentation      Well, the 2001 effect was the incorporation of the NAICS   classifications into the payroll survey  So it was just a methodological change that was realized    It’s discontinuous  If you look at the two slopes, they’re about the   same before and after, but there is discontinuity in 2001    Not to my knowledge     Yes  "
