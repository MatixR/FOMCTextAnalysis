 Thank you, Seth I will update the Committee on the  possibility of creating reserve collateral accounts as a means to achieve better control  of the federal funds rate using interest on reserves  As you know, the effective  federal funds rate has generally been lower than the interest rate paid on excess  reserves since October 2008, and the size of this divergence has fluctuated over time  Competition among banks might be expected to narrow that divergence because  buying funds and placing them on deposit at their Federal Reserve Bank is both  relatively inexpensive and completely risk free  One explanation for the divergence  is that imperfections in the fed funds market short-circuit the competitive process by  which the fed funds rate would be bid up  Some banks are paying, for example, 15  basis points to borrow and then earn 25 basis points at the Fed, but other banks are  not bidding up the rate to 16 basis points or higher  Reserve collateral accounts are  intended to facilitate competition that would bid up the rate and generate a tighter link  between the interest rate paid on excess reserves and the market rate  Creating this  tighter link now would help dispel doubts about the Fed’s ability to use interest on  excess reserves to raise the fed funds rate when the time comes   Why isn’t competition bidding up rates more efficiently?  One possible reason is  that counterparty credit risk impedes rate-based competition  Fed funds trades are  uncollateralized loans Consequently, a firm must carefully select its counterparties  and limit the amount lent to each of them  These restrictions limit competition for  funds If a firm could be freed from concern about its counterparty’s credit quality, it  could search among a wider set of firms for higher bids and for larger trade sizes   Reserve collateral accounts, or RCAs, would create the possibility of collateralized  fed funds trades, which would allow many more banks to bid for funds in the market                         August 11–12, 2009 34 of 165  How do RCAs facilitate collateralized fed funds trades?  To begin, note that an  analysis of data from Fedwire suggests that, in July 2009, approximately half of the  daily average of $125 billion of fed funds trades consisted of GSEs lending to banks,  with the other half consisting of bank-to-bank trades  So suppose that two firms, a  GSE and a bank, agree to use RCAs to conduct collateralized fed funds trades  The  bank would request that its Federal Reserve Bank create an RCA, separate from the  bank’s master account  The account would have a unique feature  The bank could  not wire funds out of its own RCA The funds in the account would, however, earn  interest on reserves for the bank paid at the rate on excess reserves  Under the terms  of their collateralized fed funds trade, the GSE would wire funds into the bank’s  RCA, and the next day, the GSE would pull the funds out of the bank’s RCA back  into its own account, using the operational capabilities of the Fed’s National  Settlement Service  So the account can be thought of as a locked box into which  funds are placed and to which the GSE is given the key  The funds are put into the  box by the GSE at night, they earn interest for the bank, and the GSE retrieves the  funds the next day Separately, the GSE and the bank agree on what interest rate the  GSE would earn from the deal     This arrangement would be governed by agreements among the Federal Reserve  Bank, the GSE, and the bank, in which the Fed would acknowledge that the GSE has  a lien on the funds in the RCA That acknowledgement would allow the GSE to  perfect a security interest in the account  As a result, if the bank with which it was  doing the deals failed, the GSE would still get back its principal, as the funds in the  account would be collateral for repayment  With the infrastructure of RCAs in place,  we could expect the GSEs and other firms, perhaps including banks, to establish  RCAs with banks if they can earn higher rates by doing so  Parties to RCA  agreements would be free to borrow or lend on an uncollateralized basis; this  possibility should help in aligning short-term rates through arbitrage activity   Another possible impediment to competition for funds in the current environment  might come from banks’ balance sheet concerns  Some banks might fear that their  buffer of capital to assets above minimum levels is too low for them to bid  aggressively for funds Establishing an RCA would be most attractive to those banks  with the least balance sheet concerns, because they would be willing to pay the  highest rates In this way, RCAs would allow market prices to be determined by the  banks that are best positioned to purchase funds, which would further reduce the  divergence of market rates from the interest rate paid on excess reserves   Our next step would be to approach a number of the GSEs and some banks to  gauge their views as to the feasibility of RCAs and their attractiveness  If a sufficient  appetite for these arrangements appears to exist, Federal Reserve staff would then  plan to establish a Systemwide steering group to form a precise timeline for all the  implementation steps and to determine if any remaining unforeseen impediments to  the creation of RCAs exist I now turn to Bill Nelson, who will update the Committee  on issues in the TALF program                   August 11–12, 2009 35 of 165   Great list of questions  With regard to the workings of the fed   funds market, I think that, as I mentioned, there is about $125 billion traded per day in the fed   funds market  About half of that is bank to bank, and I don’t think we know how disruptive that   would be if there were reverse RPs or whether that would continue I have looked at the   distribution of banks’ balances after you remove the fed funds trades they do per day, and there   are still many banks that operate with negative balances per day and, therefore, have to enter the   fed funds market This is obviously a choice that they are making today  Even with an expanded   balance sheet of $1½ trillion, let’s say, the payments that cross our systems each day amount to   about $3 trillion to $4 trillion So there will still be a need for banks to trade fed funds  I don’t   think that that market would necessarily either disappear or be severely adversely affected   Would these be redundant if we used reverse RPs with the GSEs?  I think largely they   would be redundant, if we use reverse RPs with the GSEs  However, these would be available to   banks as well as to other entities So as Chris explained, if we just remove the balances from the   GSEs, there is still a question of where the funds rate would settle  I believe that the RCAs, by   virtue of their applicability to any participant in the market, would set a harder floor on the fed        August 11–12, 2009 39 of 165  funds market  I think the question is whether we think RPs are more operationally complex,   more hands-on intervening in the market, versus the RCAs, which might be thought of as   allowing the market participants to trade among themselves and find the rate   Then, the question is, Would the market bifurcate into two pieces?  That is a clear   possibility We would have the collateralized market, which would be the floor rate essentially,   and the uncollateralized market, which would continue as it is today  So it would add a new part   to the market  Whether or not that would be seen to be desirable I don’t know  If I may say, as   the Chairman was saying that we have a belt-and-suspenders approach, the RCAs are an idea to   tighten the belt [Laughter]    You are looking at me, but I will turn to Chris as well  I think   that, with regard to the balances of the GSEs, what is important is that all of these payments on              August 11–12, 2009 40 of 165  mortgages funnel into the GSEs So my first answer to your question is that I don’t think that   part would change for the GSEs regardless of their overall regulatory environment    Brokered    I don’t have the figures in front of me  It is in the dozens, and   they lend very similar amounts  We have looked at some of the activity  It is very regular   activity They don’t seem to lend to that many for a period of time  They apparently have lines   of credit with several, but they choose to lend fairly repeatedly to individual participants        August 11–12, 2009 47 of 165    I am saying that we are far from perfect competition  That is a   market with search frictions and dominated by counterparty credit risk  And it is likely that these   impede pure rate-based competition that we would see if we alleviated the need to engage in   counterparty credit risk—a screening They could widen the net of potential counterparties to   hundreds and thousands if they were alleviated from counterparty credit risk if these   collateralized fed funds trades were available to them  The issue is, How can we get competition   so that in the interest rate on reserves that the Fed is paying to banks is a floor for society more   generally?    What Seth is explaining is very similar to the California energy   market, where only one among dozens of generators would have to go out of service in order for   maximum capacity to be used for all other generators        August 11–12, 2009 48 of 165   We gathered that information today with error, and I think we can   improve it if we work with the banks  It is with some delay, so the brokers are real time, which   is a benefit           August 11–12, 2009 49 of 165
