 I'd like to explore a couple of areas You made the point that 6 percent unemployment, more or less, is getting into the kind of full employment zone where you start to get inflation pressures It seems to me that as you look across the country, and even within regions, there is such a variability of unemployment rates that this average can be awfully misleading Take my District, for example We have a number of areas where the unemployment rate is around 3 percent We also have a few areas where the unemployment rate is 8 percent And I would guess that across the country, you would find unemployment ranges from 3 percent to, maybe, 10 or 12 percent Doesn't a lot depend on where the additional growth comes from? For example, we're going to see the growth coming in manufacturing Does that 6 percent mean what you would think it would mean, on average? It seems to me that is the kind analysis which, while it has an appeal, is greatly oversimplified, given the variability That is one area you might talk about   The other area I'd like to explore is the trade numbers You made the point that, in the forecast, we count on improvement in foreign demand to more than offset the weaker domestic demand And yet, if we're moving sideways in terms of real exports-- in a context of weak activity in Germany and real doubts in Japan--how does all that fit together? How do you get a boost from the foreign side when real net exports are moving sideways and you have weakness?   So you expect the improvement in real net exports to continue Is that--   But out beyond that?   No, I have none   Mr Chairman, I think that there is a case to be made for some tightening for all the reasons that have been stated the risk of inflation in the economy and also the history of probably waiting too long I am not ready to make that move at this point I have enough doubts, and I think there are enough uncertainties, about the outlook for inflation and other aspects of the economy The sentiment around this table has fluctuated a good bit in recent months, and I think we very well may be heading into a period where some tightening is appropriate; but I think it is premature at this point I would favor a directive that would maintain the $500 million of borrowing, something along the lines of alternative B However, I would give the directive an asymmetrical tilt indicating that if policy needs to be changed in the intermeeting period, that we would more likely lean in the direction of some snugging than some easing So, I would be for no change, alternative B, with some asymmetrical wording that would tilt it in the direction of some tightening, should a change be necessary   I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I guess I don't understand the point that you are making   I agree with that, Mr Chairman I don't think we ought to downplay it We may be feeling more comfortable about the dollar just now, but it wouldn't take very much for us to find ourselves in a very uncomfortable position And six weeks from now it will be more attention-getting if we change the emphasis than if we leave it alone   That makes a lot of sense   Keep it the same   I would like to follow up on Bob Forrestal's question Basically, the US strategy for turning the trade deficit around is to shrink the value of the dollar and to get our trading partners to grow faster than we are growing We have done fairly well on the dollar, but we haven't done so well on growth abroad It's an appealing strategy, but it strikes me as being somewhat novel if you look at the history of these kinds of adjustments What has happened most often is that the country that has the deficit ends up with a recession In other words, you reduce domestic demand below what is happening abroad and you also get downward adjustments on the currency And I would think that the longer it takes for us to make a turnaround in the trade deficit--as we get month after month of these disappointing trade figures--that it would put additional downward pressure on the dollar And it might also begin to raise expectations that, well, as nice as it sounds to try this rather novel strategy, in the end, the US is going to have to go through kind of a wringer, as most other countries do My real question is How much of a novel experiment are we really running in light of what is happening in other countries and what has happened over history? I am having a hard time thinking of a country that hasn't turned around this kind of a trade deficit without a fair amount of suppression of domestic demand And the question is not aimed at [criticism]; I like the approach that we are on But it does strike me as somewhat novel on the broader stage of history I would just like to see if that is right or if we have had lots of company with this experiment   Are these sizable countries?   I don't have a question I would just like to comment on the outlook   Let me just comment on the Philadelphia region It continues to perform well above the national experience New Jersey, Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania continue to have very low unemployment rates As a matter of fact, I think that if there's a drag on growth in these areas, it is that there's a labor shortage and business firms simply can't keep up with production needs Even the traditional manufacturing areas in our District are showing improvement, and unemployment is coming down in those areas as well Both residential and nonresidential construction are very strong; retail sales are healthy, except for autos; loan growth is running about twice the national average; and real estate lending is growing about three times the national average So, we have a rather bullish region that is being constrained mostly I think not by a lack of aggregate demand, but labor The concern that I have picked up in the last couple of months, mostly in the business community, is a concern about inflation And I think it's being triggered by these labor shortages that people report, particularly at the entry level If you look at the help wanted ads in the newspapers, and just the help wanted signs generally, they are at pretty high levels While wage increases have been reasonably moderate, I think a lot of people in the business community are concerned that this is just the kind of situation that triggers a wage-price kind of spiral  On the national scene, I think the Greenbook numbers look reasonably good In terms of the risks--and I am being influenced by where I sit and the people that I talk to--it seems to me that whatever risks there were of having too weak an economy, or even a recession out through 1988, have shrunk considerably I see the risks now on the side of triggering some kind of a wage-price increase There is one point, however, in the outlook that I think bears mentioning, and that is that both the fundamentals and the trade situation indicate a continuing downward movement in the value of the dollar Indeed, this is reflected in the Greenbook forecast We are in this "inflation/dollar" box, as you aptly put it a moment ago But I think that fundamentals have a way of winning out, even over central bank policy So, as we deal with these bouts of a falling dollar and falling bond prices, we have to bear in mind that this is really what we expect We expect the dollar to go down And I think we have to be careful that, as we deal with these episodes, we don't lose track of the fundamentals That leads to the question that you posed, which is a very good question I don't have an answer, but I have a suspicion that more of this increase in long rates is real than it is  -15-    9/22/87  inflation I say that because, if you look realistically at the fact that the US is going to have to import lots of capital over the next several years, as we have the last several years, I think that calls for a certain premium over foreign interest rates What we may be seeing here is some adjustment to what it takes to attract the kinds of funds that we need   I support your proposition   You have only begun, I might say   I have a question that may be broader than for Mr Cross A week ago, we were talking about walking a thin line between the dollar and the domestic economy and I get the feeling that that thin line has broadened out some since a week ago How wide is it and do we have a policy or don't we have a policy? Is it the Treasury that's making US policy or are we just kind of letting the market take us where we go or do we have some sense of where we want to go with the dollar? There have been a lot of changes in seven days   Do you have any insight as to why Karl Otto Poehl was so blunt last night? In one sense, they had a lot to lose with a weaker dollar, and the sense I got out of his remarks was, if the dollar weakens, so be it This strikes me as--   Well, there haven't been any actual changes that I can see in my District It's more that the worry level has risen What I sense is that the psychology is more important than the wealth effect; if we have another shock in the market I think we would have a real tumble in psychology; if we continue to mend without another shock I think the effects may be minimal This psychology is apparent in some of the conversations that we have had with regional retailers    11/3/87  Their merchandise for the Christmas season is already on hand, so they are stuck with it one way or another While no one we've talked to has observed any decline in sales yet that they can attribute to the financial markets, their view is that if Christmas sales do run below plan, then they are going to run their inventories much lower than they ordinarily would, and that would affect their spring ordering So, I think they just don't know They are thinking beyond the Christmas season if that turns out poorly The same attitude is apparent in manufacturing as well, where I think most manufacturers feel that the orders that they have on their books are there and they are going to fill them What they are concerned about is six months out But, overall, my sense is that the risks have changed in the economy Whether they have changed a lot or a little remains to be seen; but they have changed in the direction that real growth will be lower than we thought If we are wrong, then we'll probably be wrong in the sense that we'll have still lower growth And I think the risks have shifted, too, on the inflation side; to some extent, concerns that we had about inflation six weeks or so ago are alleviated I admire the bravery of Mike Prell and the staff for forecasting precise numbers and I think their numbers are reasonable-- not because they are necessarily right, but because I can't improve on them They seem to be broadly reasonable Just one other point I do keep hearing some very favorable news on the export side At my last full board of directors' meeting and other meetings around the District, people spoke almost with one chorus the news coming in from their salespeople is that they are able to compete in the export market, both by selling abroad as well as by competing with the imports that have been coming in   Well, Mr Chairman, you're very persuasive in terms of keeping things where they are, but I have a somewhat different interpretation of where we are It seems to me that we are somewhere between alternatives "A" and "B"; we may be closer to "B" than to "A", but I think that we are in the "A" - "B" range for policy, with a federal funds target of something under 7 percent,  -30-    11/3/87  perhaps 6-7/8 percent or just a touch higher It strikes me, therefore, that if we go with "B" that we will, in effect, be tightening somewhat even though it's a subtle tightening And I sense that if we deviate at all from where we are, that it might be better to ease just a touch So I come down being in the alternative "A" column It's true that we have a lot of uncertainty and we don't know what's going to happen But I do think there have been enough changes, at least in terms of shifts in the direction of the risks, that it is important for us to help anchor the lower rates that we have achieved the last couple of weeks And it seems to me that something closer to "A" than "B" helps to do that, because those lower rates that we have had are important for offsetting the effects that we are going to get from the stock market I think that it ought to be clear that the Federal Reserve is trying to do that; and I think that alternative "A" does that less ambiguously than alternative "B" Clearly, there is a risk in the dollar but, as I judge the situation, we're not talking about very much of a change in rates and it seems to me that the environment is such that we could probably absorb that risk at the moment I would prefer Variant I of the language because I think it says more clearly what we are doing, and I think it's important that the directive that we put out says what we're doing Even though the language is different, and we have words like "being flexible" and so on, that's exactly the situation that we are in So it seems to me that's what we ought to go with If we go with alternative "A", then I think some symmetrical language is appropriate, with "somewhats" and "mights" on both sides Now, we are effectively operating on a federal funds strategy When we were on a federal funds strategy in the 1970s, we tended to have Open Market Committee meetings every three or four weeks As we moved more into a reserve-based strategy, we were able to lengthen out the meeting intervals to every six weeks or so So it seems to me that wherever we set the funds rate today, we are going to have to look at it very frequently And I would think that we ought to plan at least one telephone meeting two or three weeks hence, simply because if you're going to operate on a federal funds target, by necessity you have to have more meetings   Well, rather than say alternative "A", "B", or "C", let me say that I would prefer to have the funds rate centered on 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent rather than around 7 percent Now whether that's "A"--   But we are talking here about alternative "B" delivered--   Right, but as I read the Bluebook, under alternative "B" we're talking of a funds rate centering more around 7 percent   That's what "B" says, yes   Well, I'd like to round it to 6-3/4 percent, if that's current policy I'm for current policy; if that's "A", I'm for "A"   Well, I am not very concerned about the borrowing figure I want a 6-3/4 percent funds rate   If that takes $300 million in borrowing, I'm for $300 million; if it takes $400 million, I'm for $400 milion    11/3/87   That's right, so I don't think--   I want to do the funds rate; that's what I want to do   I think that's right   You can, although pegging--or whatever word one uses--the funds rate is much more addictive than the borrowing because there is much less--   But even in the decision-making process of the Committee, there is much less emotional attachment to a given borrowing level than there is to the funds rate, so it gives you a little more flexibility in the process You're right, theoretically, that you can do it either way But the way the decisions are made and carried out and perceived, you end up with more flexibility to change policy through this borrowing procedure than through the funds rate-- not in theory but in practice    12/15-16/87   I think a useful way to look at this question of whether you want to go back is, as Martha pointed out, to look at where you want to get to There probably is general agreement, and I share that view, that we ought to get back to a borrowing objective It's a question of when and how My sense is that the longer we wait, the more difficult it's going to be It may be a long time before we get back to normal times While there clearly are still unusual pressures, I think the longer we wait the more difficult it will be to get back And we have more at stake here than just the technical side of how we operate Clearly, there are technical difficulties because it's hard to measure the demand and the relationships But beyond that, there is this credibility issue in the marketplace; and my sense is that the longer we stay with this procedure, the more the credibility issue is going to come to the fore Also, I think it's just good to have some specific kinds of goals, internally So, I think we ought to begin the shift back and do something along the lines of alternative (3), which still gives a fair amount of emphasis to the funds rate but sets us on a path back toward where we want to be That is where I come out on this for now   One of the reasons we haven't had a faster turnaround in our current account deficit is that the fall in the value of the dollar has not even come close to being matched in terms of increasing import prices It seems to me that exporters to the United States can have shrinking profit margins and try to hang on to market share, but with the kinds of shrinkages in margins that are at least implicit in this kind of drop in the dollar-import price relationship, I think a lot of these exporters to the US have to be hurting pretty badly I don't know how one measures that--whether there's any anecdotal evidence or any evidence whatsoever But do we have any sense that we might be seeing more of this dollar shrinkage showing up or coming through more in higher import prices?  -38-    12/15-16/87   It has a clear effect on how we finance our external deficit  -42-    12/15-16/87   As far as the overall Greenbook forecast, I think it's reasonable In our own District, we continue to see strong employment gains And in those areas where we've seen some slowing in the growth--Delaware, for example--I think it is more because of supply constraints than demand constraints We've been seeing the same thing that Si Keehn has the manufacturing sector is picking up handsomely and I think that's largely attributable to improved exports Growth in construction, while slowing, still is at a fairly healthy level, particularly in the nonresidential area On retail sales, we've been picking up; as I've heard around the table, they are doing really rather well Our retailers say that they are holding up to pre-stock market crash expectations and it is very hard to see the effect of the stock market on retail sales So, in a nutshell, the regional economy continues to do well  I would like to piggyback very briefly on this adjustment process issue that Jerry brought up because it seems to me that we have to view the economy and the outlook a good bit differently with this overhang of the adjustment process than we ordinarily would In the past, we've gone through periods where inflation was a problem and we've had to make some adjustments We've gone through periods where aggregate demand was too weak We've had recessions and we've had to  -59-    12/15-16/87  make adjustments I think this is the first time that any of us has gone through an international adjustment process of this magnitude with the US because I don't think we've been in this kind of a situation We'd have to go back to before the World War I period We may get this shift from consuming more than we produce to producing more than we consume; we may be lucky and get that magnitude just right We may get the changes in exports and imports so that we can keep aggregate demand going along at what most of us would consider an acceptable growth rate But we may not be so lucky; we probably won't be There are a lot of scenarios here, but my sense is that we are going to have to be prepared to accept slower growth than we would otherwise think of as being desirable in the interests of this international adjustment process Some of this slower growth may be forced on us by market discipline of the kind we were talking about earlier We may have to begin to settle our foreign liabilities in other currencies rather than the dollar But, I think there will come a time--probably sooner rather than later--when monetary policy decisions are going to have to be increasingly influenced by this adjustment process We can lean toward helping the adjustment process or we can lean against it; but I think we are going to have to think more in terms of what we can do to lean in the direction of helping it It just may mean that we will have to accept growth rate increases that are less than we ordinarily would in order to do that But I think it is better for us to get ourselves in that kind of thought process rather than have the market disciplines coming down on us very hard, which they will if we don't   I'm for alternative "B" with normal borrowing of around $300 million, which would give us a federal funds rate presumably of 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent I would prefer a symmetrical directive and --   Yes, symmetrical And I like option (3) in terms of implementation As to whether one begins the process before year-end or starts after that, I think that's a judgment call One  -73-    12/15-16/87  can't make that call at this point and I think we're going to have to let Peter and the Chairman decide that   Well, I think all of us agree on what the basic policy challenge is and that is to balance the short-run risks of weakness with the long-run risks of inflation and the need to keep the external adjustment process moving forward Given the looseness in the aggregates and the way we have treated those aggregates the last several years, substantively, I don't think it makes a lot of difference whether we have alternative I, II, or III, as far as trying to play this balancing game It seems to me that which of these you choose has to do more with the message that you want to send out than the economic or policy substance of what these alternatives mean I  -37-    2/9-10/88  think the message is important; and I would like to send out a balanced message I would like for the country to know that we are concerned about the current weakness but I also want to underscore these longer-term concerns And I think alternative II sends out that balanced message If we tended to loosen a little, as we have done in the short run the last couple of weeks, and then we send out a message that we are tightening as in alternative III, I think that's a confusing message I think that when you're sending out messages, you want to keep the messages as simple as possible At the same time, if we reverted to alternative I, I think that sends out the wrong message too So, I would think that in the testimony you want to strike this balance, and to me, alternative II sends out that message  Now the other issue, having to do with the width of the range, I think also is a substantive versus message kind of issue If we were to be totally intellectually honest, I think we'd have a very wide range, or we might not even have these [ranges for the] aggregates But we have them, and we have generally stuck to a 3 percentage point range We have tried to widen them in the past and that tends to send a message that we don't have any discipline up here or that we are somehow losing that discipline I don't think that's the kind of message we want to send, and so I would--again, not that 5 to 8 percent is substantively better than 4 to 8 percent--just think in terms of a message and keep it at 3 points  As far as the issue of rebasing, I think we have to be careful that we don't rebase on an ad hoc basis If you go back to 1985 and 1986, we overshot the targets and we didn't rebase in those years Now if we rebase this time when we undershot, I think it sends a message that we rebase when it suits us in terms of easing money and we don't rebase when it means tighter money Interestingly, if you take a longer-term perspective on M2, if we had rebased for the last two years, we would be just about where we are now In other words, the undershoot of last year just about compensates for the overshoot of the prior year So, I would not rebase in 1988 for those reasons   My congratulations to you, Mr Chairman You have performed a miracle   Mr Chairman, I think I may be on the wrong [speaker's] list I don't have any questions, but whenever you want some comments, I'll be happy to be on that list So I'll pass on the questions   I have several comments on the regional economy as well as the national economy As far as the regional economy goes, the Mid-Atlantic area is still operating at very high levels of economic activity But, if one could measure GNP at the regional level I think one would see a slowdown in growth Interestingly enough, it's more because of supply constraints than it is because of  -12-    2/9-10/88  demand constraints Labor markets are very tight I hear comments, particularly in manufacturing, about slower delivery times for materials People tell me that the steel industry is not as friendly as it once was they don't answer their phone as readily; the shipments from steel companies are slower; and in some cases, they aren't filling orders completely So it does seem to me that there's some slowing, but not for demand reasons, more for supply reasons I do not sense any excessive concern about inventory buildup  But having said that about the current situation, I have noticed in the last half a month or so, some definite deterioration in the outlook--again, noticeably in manufacturing It's hard to say why, when they're essentially complaining that they can't get enough input I've tried to probe on this--admittedly not with a truly representative sample, but with some people--and it's a kind of a logic that says things are so good now they have to get worse I guess that's human nature People tell me that they have seen this kind of situation before where they can't get parts, and demand is strong, and price increases seem to come through, and that that usually is a leading indicator for some downturn But things seem to be going very well currently  I suppose on the national economy, I agree with the staff forecast Actually, I think they've done a really rather commendable job, given the kind of environment that we are in If I had any differences they'd be a tenth of a point here or there, not worth focusing on I would like, however, to get at several larger issues in the forecast I think that the staff has made a reasonable case for reacceleration of economic growth in the second half, and I can buy that There clearly are risks on either side But there wasn't a lot of talk about inflation The emphasis, or the main question now, in current discussions is whether we are going to have a recession or whether we aren't going to have a recession It seems to me that one could make a case, and a reasonable case at that, that we also have a threat of some accelerating inflation And one could talk about that in the same context as a recession or no recession  For example, we are getting more price hikes I hear this with more frequency now--again particularly from manufacturers, but also from retail people--that their suppliers are simply passing on higher prices with increasing frequency, at least compared to recent years We know that we have higher import prices, and that has an impact on domestic competition, particularly in my area But I think it's also true in the national statistics Labor markets are very tight; and one just gets the sense that we may not be too far from some kind of acceleration in wages I buy off on the inflation forecast, but I think as we go forward it will pay to give some attention to the inflation question and not just overly focus on this recession/no recession question  And my final comment is that I think that we are in a period now which is different from most of our experience In the past we tended to worry about whether the economy would grow faster or more slowly or whether inflation would pick up or not pick up We have an additional element in this international adjustment process; and we have to give, I think, considerable weight in our policy discussions to that going forward It just simply has to go forward I think that this gets me into the discussion for tomorrow, so I'll stop But  -13-    2/9-10/88  it does seem to me that this is a different element than we have had in the past   My question has been answered, or at least an answer was attempted   Right   I favor alternative B with a $250 million borrowing, which I interpret as being essentially where we are now, after the recent easing I would have a symmetrical directive I also agree wholeheartedly with Manley on his views about the discount rate It seems to me that whatever marginal adjustments we make in monetary policy ought to be done through open market operations and that we ought to avoid a change in the discount rate for the reasons  -59-    2/9-10/88  that he stated rather well However, my alternative B and $250 million borrowing are predicated on the current discount rate If the circumstances should arise over the coming weeks that there might be a change in the discount rate, then I think one would have to revisit open market operations I don't think that we ought necessarily to let a discount rate change automatically change open market operations It seems to me that while they obviously work together, they are separate decisions; and a change in one shouldn't automatically lead to a change in the other   I think if we change one, we ought to change both   Yes  SPEAKER(?) That's fine   And this is on the assumption of a 6 percent discount rate?   I would suggest, what about 6 to 7 percent? Okay?   6 to 7 percent for both M2 and M3  -69-    2/9-10/88  SPEAKER(?) Okay   I agree with that; it ought to be right up in the front sentence   No, you would say "to maintain the slightly easier"--   But you would say that you would maintain the slightly easier degree of pressures sought in recent days   That captures it   Put "the slightly easier degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent days"   That says we are maintaining what we have done in the last couple of weeks, which I think would capture what we have agreed to   All right, slightly reduced pressure   Of recent days   I think what we're seeing here is the calling of a spade a spade The more you conduct policy focusing on the federal funds rate, the more frequent Committee meetings you need And in the days when we were literally focusing on the federal funds rate there were Open Market Committee meetings every three weeks or so The more we moved away from the federal funds rate to reserves--   We've spread it [the intermeeting interval] out   I think the reason is that you don't have any flexibility to take account of changes that could come in You can't just absolutely fix interest rates for six weeks at a time  -71-    2/9-10/88   You could set a range, and then if you set a range, somebody has to have the authority to go back and forth I think we generally have given the Chairman a great deal of flexibility within the range that was set One can quarrel with that procedure, but it seems to me that the Chairman acted completely within the framework of the directive that we passed last time--a directive that gave him the flexibility to move up and down given certain sets of conditions You may or may not like his decision, or you may or may not have done it the way he did it; you may want to rein him in, or you may want to give him more flexibility But I think that we have to blame ourselves--not the Chairman for using the flexibility that we gave him   I think so too   You at least would pass a lie detector   Relatively moderate   It seems to me that the larger issue, aside from things like the Japanese fiscal year, relates to times when we see these exchange relationships coming unglued Are we dealing with something that we can put a little more glue in there through intervention and move forward, or is it something more basic--like changes in economic growth or inflation or domestic economic policies or that the adjustment process isn't moving as fast as it should I would think that, while it is an impossible question to answer, you have to ask it nonetheless when you are talking about what the appropriate response is going to be If we think that it just needs some more glue, then we can achieve some good through intervention; if    3/29/88  we think that it is more basic than that, then by intervening we sort of throw good money after bad It may mean that we have to seek a new exchange rate alignment, or it may take a more fundamental change in US domestic policy As I say, it is a question that there is no obvious or easy answer to; but it seems to me that we have to ask it rather than continue intervening willy-nilly and hoping that will solve the problem I'm not against the intervention--it just seems to me that we have to think the thing through a little more carefully than to just say "Well, let's intervene and see what happens"   I think that's a good point I guess mine goes even beyond that It may mean that there isn't much that we can do if there is a fundamental misalignment here Or if we're going to do something, it may take this more forceful intervention coupled with a noticeable change in monetary policy I'm getting ahead of the discussion but I think that--   It does in this sense, Manley--I think this continuum idea is useful   If you think of reserves and the money supply as being a "10" [on a continuum], and you think of the federal funds rate as being a "1", say, the more problems you have with the monetary aggregates through reserve targeting, the more you want to move toward the federal funds rate And the borrowing is a point along that continuum between total reserves and the federal funds rate It's not that borrowing per se is important; it's the degree of compromise you make between the federal funds rate and the reserves procedure And the borrowings thing is skewed in the direction of the federal funds rate   Well, I think just about everything has been said in this conversation It's a question of emphasizing points The first point is that we can debate this theoretically, conceptually, now and forever, and it's very frustrating because it involves compromise We are trying to take two different approaches and compromise them and that's not very satisfying It seems to me the choice, then, comes down to what works My own preference would be to get back to where we were before October 19th, which is what I think we have been doing I don't think we're quite back there, but we're almost there  I have a couple of reasons for that preference One is that it does seem to have worked reasonably well But the point was made earlier that no matter what procedure we have, it's always easy to ease; that's not a problem We've never had any trouble there The real day comes when we need to tighten I'm sure everybody around this table now is much stronger and much more forthright, has more courage and guts than anybody else in the history of the Fed, but I think there are some lessons from history And the experience has shown that the more you focus on the federal funds rate, the more difficult it is at the time when you need to tighten, to do it So, I think we need to keep a bit of fuzziness there I would, on very practical grounds, stay about where we are  On the other issues I agree with the point that the Chairman needs some discretion I have not in any way been upset by the way that discretion has been used Maybe I would have used it a little differently, but I think on the whole it has been done rather well And I don't think we ought to hem the Chairman in with numerical kinds of constraints There is a way, however, that perhaps communication can be sometimes improved I don't mean to suggest that this needs to be done every time the Chairman uses discretion, but we can have telephone conferences These conferences do not have to be official meetings; they do not have to be decision-making meetings They can simply be held to exchange views--a kind of meeting that really never gets on the record if there aren't any decisions made So, it might be possible, in the right kinds of situations, simply to have these telephone hookups   If no decisions are made   Yes, I think over the longer run Norm Bernard is right; we had more that weren't recorded than were If decisions are made, votes are taken, obviously it has to be recorded If not, there's some discretion I agree as well that we don't need any more FOMC meetings, as delightful as these gatherings are   My District continues to be characterized by high levels of activity The most common comment that one hears is that labor markets are very tight it's hard to attract unskilled workers; turnover rates tend to be rising; local help-wanted indices are high compared to the nation When you talk to manufacturers, and some retailers, and even bankers, there is a dichotomy between what they say and what seems to be going on underneath If you sit around a luncheon table and have an informal discussion, you would think that we were heading into a depression and things were terrible, in terms of the general conversation But then when you ask them what they are doing, what their orders are, what their plans are, whether they are hiring people, whether they are expanding, you get a wholly different picture I find this dichotomy in their minds about what's going on to be fascinating  On the national economy, it seems to me we are in a period of evolving risks in November-December, the risks were on the side of not enough growth; the last time we met, I think the risks were about evenly balanced; and at this meeting, I think the risks have shifted more toward the inflation side That's all I have, Mr Chairman   I think we have to balance the notion of where we have to go, which I think is some tightening, without being disruptive to the markets The best balancing, from my point of view, would be to raise borrowing $100 million now When I say now, I don't mean tomorrow; I would think that we would have to give the Desk some discretion to work it in over the next week or 10 days I would have an asymmetrical directive that would stack the deck some in the direction of tightening, but still wait to see incoming information I guess that puts me at kind of "B", "C+", with an asymmetric directive   Mr Chairman, I guess it all depends on how one listens to things, but I had the sense that there was a majority of people who wanted some tightening, say, in the next couple of weeks And it would seem to me one way to do that would be to say in the implementation of policy etc, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions in the immediate weeks ahead  -13-    5/17/88   But it's not immediate; it's spread over the next couple of weeks   Oh   But I think if you counted the people who wanted a tightening immediately, plus those who are willing to have some flexibility over the next week or two, you would have a majority And, therefore, if you are a little vague about whether you do it right away or within the next--   Well, I didn't keep that accurate a score   I see   All right   Oh, it is captured; it just makes it a little stronger It puts it right up front that you intend to tighten within two weeks  -15-    5/17/88   I think most of the useful things that can be said about this really quite excellent paper have been said My bottom line is that I'd like to find a rule that would keep us on track in terms of good policy I don't know what that rule is I don't think the base is it, largely for the same reasons that I think M1 is not it That doesn't mean we shouldn't keep working at it But I don't have enough confidence in this to give up much discretion at all in terms of policy So, whatever we would like, I think it simply isn't a reality; so I think we have to continue much as we have been   I have a couple of questions What kinds of consultations and cooperation, or lack of cooperation, currently exist among major central banks of the world on these recent interventions? And a related question is what are we trying to accomplish with what we're doing or what we're not doing?   We went through some trouble several years ago to wean the markets from the notion that an eighth of a [percentage] point variation in the funds rate made a significant difference Along came October and we essentially went to a funds rate target and an eighth of a point did make a difference Through changes in language in the directive we've tried to move away from that, yet it seems to me that the last couple of weeks have indicated that an eighth of a point does make a lot of difference in our own thinking and the thinking of the market  My comment is not directed at the substance of policy; I think the snugging that was done was appropriate for policy reasons But it does seem to me that we ought to be working against the notion that an eighth of a point makes a lot of difference, because I think that if we have to make adjustments in policy--when the Treasury balances don't work out right or for a whole number of other reasons-- that could cause us to box ourselves in It seems to me that over the longer term, we ought to get to the point where the markets can see some movement up and down in the funds rate and not overly emphasize the substance of that in terms of policy I don't think our actions in the last couple of weeks helped us in moving in that direction I guess my question, if there is a question, is did it make any difference that we took out the sentence in the directive last time, and watered it down the time before, that we were going to allow a little more movement in the funds rate in the implementation of policy?   It's a Wednesday, too   On the District and the question you raised about wages, the concern about higher wage costs is certainly there in an anecdotal sense I've tried to pin it down as best I can I think to a large extent it's a state of mind, but when I ask for specifics, these are the kinds of things that I'm told It appears that the greatest pressure is at the starting salaries at lower levels For example, someone who runs a very large supermarket chain in our District told me that he had to raise his starting salaries about 25 percent--now that turns out to be about $1 or $125 an hour But then, when you work that up to the people who have 6 months to a year and a year and a half of experience, you get a kind of stair-step increase Another place where you hear of this is at services institutions For example, at financial institutions, whereas a year or so ago they were talking about wage budgets with increases in the 5 to 6 percent range, we hear more right at 6 percent, and now I'm hearing talk of 6-1/2 percent Another thing we hear is that this 5 percent number on the CPI seems to be one of special concern While there aren't as many COLA clauses in union contracts now as there were several years ago, where they are in contracts, 5 percent on the CPI seems to be a trigger point Since we've been getting pretty close to that in recent months, I think there's concern that the COLA may be triggered Now, that will have an impact Generally, most of the concern about [wages is coming from the] non-union side I think this is not surprising in our District because, if there's one unifying theme among almost everybody you talk to throughout the District, it's very, very tight labor markets Otherwise in the District, we have reports of very strong manufacturing and some moderation in retail sales--the same kind of things that you find in some other Districts  At the national level, Jerry Corrigan said a lot of what I wanted to say in terms of [unintelligible] [On the inflation side we] see this accelerating trend For example, the consumer price index the last 3 months was 49 percent versus 39 percent the previous year The producer price index in the last 3 months was 62 percent, and in the previous year, 22 percent If you look at the intermediate [level], crude goods in the producer price index rose at a rate of 8-1/2 percent in the last 3 months and 5 percent over the previous 12 months And industrial raw materials are really at about their highest level during the expansion since the '79-'80 peak So, I think that it's not just that we're fearful of an economy running up against supply constraints and inflation in the future I think that we are seeing some very tangible signs that we're on this accelerating trend And it's much less costly to try to keep inflation from accelerating than it is to unwind it later on  In the chart show yesterday, as I heard it, essentially the basic message was that what we have to do is slow real growth from something like 3 percent plus down to 2 percent or a little more And I agree with that in general The idea that that can be done with a 1 percent rise in interest rates over the next year--I hope that's right But I suspect there would [not] be a very large kick from that small of an increase in interest rates   Ditto!  -39-    6/29-30/88   Mr Chairman, I think what Jerry and the others are getting at is valid, but I'd like to suggest a slightly different wrinkle as to how to achieve it, which I think gets around a potential  -45-    6/29-30/88  difficulty I would rather say that the uncertainty has increased and that it has become increasingly difficult to make judgments; that we will make our best estimate in July, but the [congressional] committees ought to understand that we may be changing or revising in February more than in the past I think there is an advantage in saying it that way because it tends to be more in the spirit of the statute Some years ago--I've forgotten exactly when it was--we didn't send up in July ranges for the following year, and Senator Proxmire said we weren't following [the statute] by what we were doing This way, if you say that in the future we are just going to continue the current ranges into the next year, I think someone could say to you that what you're really doing, in effect, is revising the statute If you go the other way and say we'll give it our best effort, but you ought to realize it is highly preliminary and almost routinely you might expect changes in February, then you do it more in the spirit of the statute, and I think it accomplishes the same thing   I have two issues that I am trying to balance here One is how I foresee the risks in the economy and inflation, and the other is that we snugged just a week ago Taking those two issues into account, I would prefer that we maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions I would have an asymmetric directive on the side of tightening Under alternative B, I would round down those halves so that instead of 5-1/2 percent for M2 I would make it 5 percent, and instead of 3-1/2 percent for M1, I would make it 3 percent I think your advice about having a telephone call is well taken On the business of being worried about whether the funds rate is 7-1/2 or 7-3/8 or 7-5/8 percent, again, I think we ought not peg that so tightly I have no problem with borrowed reserves at $550 to $600 million or something like that But I don't think we should worry that much about whether the federal funds rate goes up an eighth or down an eighth I think it'll be good to get back to our pre-October 1987 posture on that   I wonder if a better way to do it would be to think of a borrowing target of $550 to $600 million and whether it's $600 million or $550 million depends on where the funds rate is And then use the language to maintain about the existing degree of pressure  -63-    6/29-30/88   That's where you are anyway; let's don't--   You want the funds rate at 7-1/2 percent--that's what people are saying   Very slight   Slight's great   The District economy continues to operate at very high levels, with increasingly tight labor markets The only part of the District where I'm hearing complaints about the pressures on wages is from the Jersey shore; and that's largely, I think, from the Second District's garbage floating down there   As I say, there's nothing new As far as the nation--I think it has been said a variety of ways--but the bottom line is that we are in a territory of accelerating inflation and we have to resist that growth The only questions are timing and magnitude As far as the components of risk, I agree that the risks are on the upside on capital spending But we may get more restraint on consumption this time around than we have in the past, largely I think because of the increase in variable interest rates on consumer- type loans, both home equity loans and also variable-rate mortgages If people have to spend an extra $50 or $100 a month on mortgage payments, that gets right into consumption fairly quickly I think the shorter lags on consumption really are what we want because, as you look at the profile of the expansion, we are getting personal consumption growing 2-1/2 percent and what we really would like to do is get it down in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range to be able to bring about the shift toward the external sectors So I think that we really do need to watch this consumption We may find that we'll get quicker restraint from monetary policy tightening than we have in the past   Caught me drinking   On the issue of whether we have this hybrid, or borrowings or a federal funds target, there is no right answer here And at different times one will be better than the other But there are some lessons I think to be learned by both the successes and the mistakes of the past You laid it out, Don, as kind of three choices a federal funds, borrowing, or hybrid But really the choices are over a much broader kind of a continuum If you think, for example, at one end of that continuum you have a pure reserve targeting and at the other you have a pure federal funds targeting, and you think of reserves as a 10 and federal funds as a 1, this borrowing approach that we have been using the last few years is probably a 3 It's pretty close to federal funds rate targeting It is a compromise toward taking account of the federal funds rate If we compromise it further along the lines that we've been doing, we really move very, very close to a federal funds rate target And there are advantages, and there are disadvantages  But I think that if we look back over our history, if you have an approach that--as we had with the borrowing figure--has a wiggle factor, it does allow the market to tell you something It does allow the market to tell you that there is a greater demand for reserves It also avoids the trap of pegging a federal funds rate Now, I know that there is no one around this table who would ever, ever get caught up in the problems of pegging the federal funds rate However, that risk is there for lesser mortals and I think one has to keep that in mind The other thing is that it's easy around this table to ease There's no trouble for a central bank to ease; that's very easy The hard part is what we've been doing the last few months, to tighten We need all the help that we can get when we find ourselves in that situation And I think that the give that the borrowing approach allows in that procedure has been very helpful in the snugging up that we've been doing since March And I think the more we move over to a federal funds rate, the more difficult it would be to follow that kind of snugging up It's true that the market has led us sometimes; sometimes it was good, sometimes bad We ought to be making decisions, not the markets Nonetheless, when you get to the practical side of it, I think this technique was helpful for us to get out in front of the inflation curve earlier than I ever recall doing it And I think this procedure helped  The other thing is--and I think this is an issue that one can talk about--that this procedure does give the Chairman a little more leeway than a federal funds target And I think that, when we meet every six to eight weeks, it is important for the Chairman to have some leeway in this Maybe everybody around the table will not agree every time he uses that discretion But the way the markets operate, the way they're fast changing, and timing issues and all that, I for one think that it's important for the Chairman to have a little leeway So that's where I come out Even though there are disadvantages to reserve targeting or borrowing or whatever, I would  -33-    8/16/88  not like us to move any more in the direction of the federal funds extreme I would prefer to be pretty close to the borrowing rather than this hybrid that we've backed into the last six weeks   I think, Manley, he could I think he could in theory I think in practice that this borrowing procedure gives him a little more flexibility and gives us a little more ability to move sooner than we might otherwise I can't prove that's the case   Right That's my point   If the Chairman calls up and says I've upped the borrowing $50 or $100 million that's one thing If he calls up and he says I've upped the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point, there's a difference   Right   I think if you're completely logical, Manley, you come out where you do I just don't think human beings and human nature are completely logical   [I favor] alternative "B" with an asymmetrical directive I would keep the ordering on the language the same  -42-    8/16/88  However, I think a legitimate point has been raised about M2 and I think we probably ought to take a look at it at the next meeting to see if the case for it has improved If it has, then I think at that point it would make more sense to put it higher up on the list But I think it would be premature at this point   Promote it to three   Mike, you've made I think a rather persuasive case both in your written comments and your oral comments this morning that we will need some additional restraint to hold aggregate demand to the level that's more consistent with reducing inflationary pressures I wonder if I could get you to put yourself on the other side of that question I wonder if you could help a slow mind this morning and articulate the case that maybe we won't need the kind of restraint that you're talking about to get the job done In other words, I wonder if you could admit to where the cracks might be in your argument and the things that might happen that would say that while we might need a touch more restraint, maybe we've done much of the job that we need to do   Thank you   The region continues as it has been It's operating at high levels, although there is some moderation; labor markets are very tight; and, wage rates are higher than the nation as a whole  As far as the national economy, I subscribe to the view that the economy is moderating, but that more moderation is needed and additional restraint is probably also needed While the risks are on the side of too much demand, I think we need at this point to keep a very open mind and shouldn't rush to judgment on it for the reasons that were articulated nicely by Mike Prell I'd like to watch the economy closely and be prepared to tighten if necessary But I wouldn't rush into it at the moment, just because I have enough doubts to think that a little patience is in order   Second the Chairman's suggestion   Call the roll   I don't think this is a very important issue, so what I'm about to say should be kept in that context I don't think it makes much difference one way or the other I think the reasons that have just been expressed are logical and have some merit But the argument on the other side is that permanent members constitute two-thirds of the FOMC I've always thought of the FOMC as a continuing body The press tends to make an issue, whenever we have this rotation, that the Committee is going to change or is not going    11/1/88  to change, but it seems to me it really has not Our deliberations have tended to be collegial, and there has been something permanent about the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve If you have a change from the Philadelphia District to the Richmond District on the FOMC, that in itself should not lead to expectations that there might be a significant change in policy There is more stability to the Federal Reserve than that, and even though not all of us vote, we do all participate in these decisions While the vote is clearly important and of legal significance, it has always seemed to me that the collegial spirit of the discussion has been more important, and 99999 percent of the meetings that I've ever been a part of [have been of this nature] I think this kind of change tends to emphasize the individual members of the Committee over the Committee as a whole, and the System as a whole, and the collegial spirit While I don't think this is a very big issue, on the whole I would prefer not to make a change   It's true, too!   Looking at me?   Well, I have a higher level of discomfort for the change If it comes down to 18 people around the table who want to do it, I'm not going to stand in the way But if I were going to do it, I would not make it effective at the end of this year I would do it down the road, to get away from the point that Martha makes There is, unfortunately, this business in the press about presidents versus governors--which is a lot of nonsense, but it's there In that context--that's not my main reason--but I think that it is supportive to my concern If I were going to do it, I would make it effective a year from now, or something, just to get away from any immediate concern about policy   The other thing is, if we made it effective this year, we'd have to go back to all of our Boards of Directors and get them to change those resolutions of elections because I think it says in there that the terms run from March 1st to February 28th, or whatever it is It might be better to do it on a pro forma basis rather than go back and change the terms that are already in existence   Well, I think there is an element of Santa Claus in the outlook, but I don't think that's something that we ought to snicker at Some of it is luck, but some of it is our own doing We did anticipate an economy that was overheating We took a series of gradual steps over a period of months And I think that we ought not to be all that unhappy that it's bringing forth the results that we set out to achieve So, while I think we have to be watchful and maybe a little skeptical, I don't think that just because something is falling our way that we ought to say that it isn't a realistic outlook I'm reasonably pleased with the outlook My own sense is that the risks are still on the side of inflation, but I think that there's nothing in the immediate scene that would require us to take any significant action So I'm prepared to say hello to Santa Claus a little early   I agree with your recommendation   Could you elaborate on your comments about the German mark--the view that the mark is too weak?   I know The Chairman thinks it's too weak, but it's at the top of the snake, is it not?   Well, I think we need to step back from just the narrow issue of this procedure or that procedure and ask the broader question about policy itself And I think in the last several years that policy has generally been good If you compare what has happened in the last several years and went back over the last 20 years or so, I think in general we have done most of what should have been done in this particular cycle And I think that that is borne out by the life of the cycle and the fairly good control we've had over inflation Now, the issue is, has this procedure been helpful to us in achieving that goal? Have we achieved good policy in spite of this procedure? My own sense is that this procedure has been helpful in guiding us toward better policy No procedure is perfect And I think we've found that, whatever procedure we've used, there are always times when you have to override it And Manley Johnson's point is correct that at some point we have to override it so much that maybe we ought to look around But on the whole, looking at the broad picture, I think that this procedure has served us well and has made for better policy   Well, there's a little more than just the willingness of people to do it It goes to Wayne's point, and that is that a movement in the funds rate has much more than an announcement effect And our current procedure does allow some flexibility absent an announcement effect   The regional economy continues to operate generally at a high level and the current indicators are positive There are some pockets with some problems, but generally labor markets remain tight Manufacturing continues to grow The retailers seem to be feeling better now than they did several months ago Loan growth is running well above the national average There is some slowing in the nonresidential area, and I think there are early indications of some slowing in residential construction There is some sense that next year at least the growth in the economy will not be as fast It's hard to sort out whether this is supply constraints or lack of  -39-    12/13-14/88  demand I suspect it's a combination of both But the outlook is still for a high level of activity  As far as the national economy goes I think it does need some reining in There are risks on the inflation side But reaching that conclusion is not a one-way street There is a whole set of risks that everybody around this table is familiar with--mostly in the financial area, thrifts, LDCs, LBOs, etc, etc So, while we clearly need to rein the economy in, about the last thing we need is a recession and there is no sure way of reining in an economy without a recession But even acknowledging all these risks, I don't think that you buy very much by ignoring the inflation side I think these risks will tend to get larger if we don't deal with inflation So, I come down on the side of reining in but doing it with some caution   I think your prescription is right on target I think it appropriately balances what we need to balance I think that open market operations are much preferable over the discount rate; a discount rate hike would be too much at this point So, I agree with you I'd like to just comment on this business of the discount rate and the spread between it and the funds rate That has been a classic reason given for adjusting the discount rate But I think, given the technique that we use to operate open market operations with this borrowing, that we simply have to live with ever widening spreads unless we want to raise the discount rate at the same time we want to ease open market operations I think that sends conflicting signals To the extent that the widening spread does raise expectations of an increase in the discount rate, I think we ought to do away with that And it might be well, Mr Chairman, at an appropriate time either in a speech or at testimony simply to indicate that the spread no longer means what it once did in terms of considerations of whether we change the discount rate or not In my point of view, the reason you change the discount rate in today's world is that you want an announcement effect either domestically or internationally And whether the spread is 100 basis points or 500 basis points doesn't seem to me to be terribly relevant   I agree with that   Stand up, Tommy   Well, you can't be that precise You've got all that year-end churning, and if the year-end churning takes you up to a high level, you might not want to jerk the rate back down   Right   Well, I think on substantive grounds it probably doesn't make a lot of difference whether it's alternative "I" or alternative "II" or something in between where we would lower the top end or narrow the range However, for posturing purposes, I favor alternative "I" largely because I think it already has made a statement Manley made that point and I also think alternative "I" makes a statement It gives us room to move down next year, which I think is important for longer-term targeting It just provides additional flexibility On the issue of whether we ought to have fewer or more aggregates, we can have too many and have too few I think we're better off not to limit ourselves to one We've been doing this now for 13 or 14 years and over that period if we've found out anything it is that what looks good in one period doesn't look so good in another As long as we can pick and choose internally it's easier, I think, to deal with that than to try to go out and explain why we add one or why we drop one I think the last 13 or 14 years underscore the wisdom of having a bit of a buffet to choose from   What about "[The Committee] reaffirmed its decision of last July to lower"?   The middle Atlantic states continue to be characterized by a high level of economic activity Labor markets are getting tighter Even in Pennsylvania the rate of unemployment is well under the national rate for the first time in a long, long time; New Jersey and Delaware have been there now for several years Wage increases tend to be higher than in the nation as a whole, particularly I think at the lower end The most noticeable area of softening is in the real estate area  As far as the nation is concerned, I think the economy is growing too rapidly It has more of a head of steam than I thought a couple of months ago and perhaps hoped a couple of months ago As a result, the vulnerabilities to inflation seem higher to me now than they did just a meeting or so ago I think this kind of a situation does require a response from us, but that's the topic of tomorrow As for our forecast, we're within the central tendency although at the upper side of that   Well, the issue is clearly one of weighing the risks of too much versus too little tightening Reasonable people can differ on that and that's what we're seeing around the table I don't think any of us can be overly sure, whatever we do, that it is the right thing to do Therefore, I think it is very relevant to ask the question What are the implications of whatever we do today if we're wrong? It is possible that we could do the wrong thing today And it comes down to this Is it more costly to unwind too much tightening or is it more costly to make up for too little tightening? I think that this Committee has been in existence long enough and that there's a pretty clear historical record, even though this group is much wiser than our forefathers and mothers, that [the answer] is very, very clear It is more costly to make up for too little tightening It is relatively easy to lower interest rates If you lower interest rates you don't cause a lot of unhappiness Given the uncertainty, and on top of that my assessment of the risks, I would move toward alternative C fairly promptly I think it's a mistake to let interest rates fall at this point Temporizing makes sense for institutional harmony for now and I think that's worth something But I must say that it makes me very uneasy about the future because I think temporizing can be quite costly   Sam, what is the sentiment in Germany and Japan about intervention? Are they cooperative, are they reluctantly cooperative, or are they more than cooperative? What's the feeling?   This is more of a question than a comment I view this as follows If we are going to play this game we need the ammunition and this is just a way of storing the ammunition If we're going to go from $12 billion to $15 billion, is an increase of $3 billion enough? Would it make sense to go to $18 billion or another number? I ask that because I'm not sensitive enough to know what will be read into increasing the limit from $12 to $15 billion So, if we're going to raise the limit might we not just raise it enough to last a while? Or do you think that $3 billion will last a while and that it doesn't make any difference whether we raise it once or twice or whatever?   I can't vote I'm sorry; you hooked up with wrong guy Try next year   There has been some definite slowing in the Philadelphia District I think the economy there is slower than it is in the nation Until the last few months that slower rate was mostly due to supply constraints--tight labor markets and that sort of thing But in the last several months I think there has been a slowing on the demand side as well Housing is clearly weak; retail sales and manufacturing are flat Capital spending is slower in the second quarter than it was in the first, although it's mixed by industry Housing-related petroleum, gas, and electric utilities are still not going very far on new projects whereas chemicals and pharmaceuticals continue to have some expansion projects The steel industry--at least that part in my District--seems to be feeling a little better than a couple of months ago I think they feel better now that some of the labor negotiations are behind them And they feel that they'll get this voluntary restraint package on steel renewed in Congress, so they released some projects that they were holding On the whole, I think capital spending is definitely slower now than it was three months ago As for the future in the District, I think the outlook is for flat to slow growth with unemployment rates still on the low side  As far as the nation, I think what's happening is about as good as we could hope for We ought to be reasonably pleased with what we're seeing on the growth profile My sense is that the risks between recession and inflation have shifted Until fairly recently, I was thinking that the risks were clearly on the side of more inflation I think the risks are more even than they were The most likely outcome is a period of slow growth with inflation higher than we would like but not accelerating significantly But if we're wrong, I think we have about as much chance of being wrong on the inflation side as on the too-slow-growth side   I find your suggestion, Mr Chairman, eminently sensible It reflects what's going on in the economy And I think the timing on moving to a symmetrical directive is just right I think our success to date has been that we have stayed ahead of the risk curve When the risks were heavily on the side of inflation we moved in a series of small steps And I think staying ahead of the risk curve at this point does mean taking that small step to symmetry; it's quite consistent with what we've done over the past year   You're really broad minded!   But Jerry, that brought the Chairman back very quickly!   Well, I don't think this is the time for a real extended philosophical discussion But simply to say that our objective is price stability greatly oversimplifies what a central bank is all about It seems to me that what the central bank is all about is sustainable prosperity Over the longer pull, probably the most important contribution that we can make to that is price stability But that to me is a means to an end, not an end in itself So, in terms of sending out signals, I think that our signal ought to be one that says we are trying to have a sustainable prosperity To go down willy-nilly in a mechanical way just for the sake of sending out a signal that we're committed to long-run price stability covers over a lot of the uncertainty that we see If I were in your position, Mr Chairman, in trying to sell some aggregate measurements I think I would want to stress the uncertainty--that we are committed to bringing inflation down but we also don't want to have a recession; we're committed to a soft landing And in that kind of environment, it seems to me that tentatively adopting the 1989 ranges for 1990 would make sense From a technical point of view, I would think that as we go through 1990 we're going to be in the alternative I to alternative II range I don't see that alternative III is terribly realistic By simply adopting the 1989 ranges at this point we tend to straddle alternative I and alternative II; and we can then make what modifications we want in February to make them more realistic to the economy at that point   I'd say that in the Mid-Atlantic part of the Third District there's a clear change in the tone of the economy Almost all sectors are flat to down residential and nonresidential construction are off significantly; manufacturing is flat; retail sales, while up a touch in dollar terms, are clearly down in volume terms; and for the first time since the expansion began employment, as measured by payrolls, is down a little Having said that, labor markets still remain tight and the unemployment rate is still below that of the nation Nonetheless, this is the first time we've seen payrolls down I would say that attitudes in the business community can be characterized as cautiously optimistic, but I do sense a fragility there I think that the expansion has gone on for so long that people have gotten in the habit of thinking it will continue Maybe they believe that that is the most likely outcome But I think we could see a fairly prompt deterioration in those sentiments, at least as expressed by business people in my District  Looking at the national economy we can't help but be influenced by the people who surround us, and I think the outlook nationally is still most likely to be a soft landing But the chances of a bumpier landing have increased As far as the Greenbook forecast goes, I think that the downside risk is greater than the upside risk There is just very widespread softness in the economic indicators While there is no evidence of a cumulative downturn, when you see widespread softness you begin to ask questions about whether it might be self reinforcing So, I would say that, yes, the Greenbook outlook is a reasonable one; but my own sense is that the risks on the down side have increased noticeably over the last six weeks   No, I have not sensed that   Maybe a little in retailing outside autos, but not much   Well, I sense the beginnings of a little hesitation in some planned expansions or equipment purchases Plans are still going forward but you get just a bit of a feeling that people are beginning to wonder for the first time in a long time whether it is the right decision   Bethlehem is--   You made the point that the markets have built into current rates a quarter point drop in the funds rate rather promptly A quarter point from what base? Where do you--  -43-    7/5-6/89   Be careful, Wayne   I think your suggestion for a 25 basis point drop in the funds rate is exactly what ought to happen I would, however, take some issue with the [proposed] symmetry I would prefer an asymmetrical directive for two reasons first, I think the risk has shifted and there is more downside risk than there is upside risk in the economy and an asymmetrical directive would underscore that; and secondly, given the string of data that we have had in recent weeks that have been on the bearish side, it's difficult for me to imagine that we would tighten in the next six weeks It would have to be a very dramatic turnaround in the data, and I think the probabilities of that happening are very, very small On the other hand, what is most likely is that we will see a continuation of the bearish data and it wouldn't take nearly as convincing a string of information in that direction to warrant a further decline in rates And when I consider the reasons why we usually have had asymmetrical directives, it seems to me that those two reasons have been high on the list   I would characterize the Middle Atlantic states as being flat to down a touch Retail sales are running about even with a year ago; manufacturing is down some The most serious problems developing are in real estate And there, I think New Jersey has the biggest problems; they are showing up in the loan portfolios of banks I think that we have just begun that cycle--[which will] run for a period in the Middle Atlantic region--where we're going to see increasing real estate loan difficulties On the positive side, in the Delaware banks, which are very large in consumer credit through credit cards, I think the portfolios are better than they were a year ago The banks there have been quite responsive to regulators' cautions and they do look better Despite the slower growth rate in the region and the nation, labor markets remain very tight-- particularly at the lower end Our Bank, for example, has made much greater use of temporary help this summer and we are almost grateful that we've been able to get them That, I think, has as much to do with demand as a shrinking labor force, particularly in the 18-24 year old area And I think that's going to continue well out into the '90s  As far as the national economy, I think we are doing about as well as we could hope to do We are achieving the subpar growth with a reasonable risk of recession It seems to me that that risk, if anything, is a touch less than it was the last time we met The imbalances that normally lead to recession are not there On the inflation side, I think that what we have done is to contain the growth of inflation If you look at the basic rate, I don't think we have rolled it back Maybe that's all we can hope to achieve with this subpar growth strategy Whether we can actually reduce the rate remains to be seen I think our challenge today is to gather up enough strength that we'll leave well enough alone   Alternative B; I prefer symmetry, but could live with asymmetry   I'd like to pursue this conversation along a somewhat different line If I were in the market and saw this kind of intervention--and the dollar has come down--one of the reasons I might think it would come down is that if governments are going to spend this kind of money, they must have a second act And the second act might be some understanding as to some basic policy changes So, my first question is In these discussions about intervention, is there some kind of understanding that the intervention will be followed up with more fundamental changes in economic policy, whether on the monetary side or the fiscal side?   I think the market would think so, because most people probably would agree that intervention, except in rare situations, has a rather temporary influence unless it is followed up with something more fundamental   Well, that leads into my next question; I think you touched on it Is the United States leading the charge on this or is it more a consortium of finance ministers who are leading the charge and central bankers are acting as their agents? Or is there a lot of enthusiasm on the part of central banks? I'm just trying to understand   In your judgment, what will it take to get a message to our Treasury and the Japanese that-- I guess what I'm saying is How long is it going to take for them to tire of this?   I think we have talked about most of the issues Clearly, you are in an awkward position Just as one person around the table, I think the worst thing this Committee could do is to leave you hanging, given the awkwardness of where you are Despite where we are on the fundamental policy issues and the difference with the Treasury, my question is Given the situation that we are in, how can we be the most helpful to you as a Committee in this very awkward predicament that you find yourself in?   It probably will be in The Wall Street Journal next Monday, given the minutes to be released this Friday afternoon   I would think that Manley and Wayne better take a walk   That's what we--  [Laughter]   I'm not asking   Well, if we have to reply to this letter over the next month, and if we're going to have a two-day meeting in December anyway, this idea of price stability isn't going to go stale between now and Christmas   So, I think we ought to let it flow into our natural schedule   I agree   On the other hand, if you think you're going to get this like a free lunch, that's not realistic either  -47-    10/3/89   I'd rather Congress be debating this about monetary policy than a whole lot of others things they could be debating   Right, I agree with that   But I think it's also a good opportunity, even though fiscal policy is in a state of paralysis, to remind people about what good things could happen if it weren't   It probably is   That's probably right   The truth is we don't know We can have our biases but we don't know   And what you have is an array from the most optimistic and least costly all the way over to something that would be fairly costly   Right But, with the exception of Lee here, probably few people would be willing to precipitate a recession to pull it off But, if one occurred, we'd be willing to take advantage of it   Well, I think the bearishness in New England is contagious; it's moving down the Atlantic coast There clearly has been a shift in sentiment in my District away from one of optimism toward more concern about the economy That is particularly true in the real estate business Residential construction is very soft and, looking out over the next several years, it's likely not to strengthen  -27-    10/3/89  a great deal Just looking at the underlying demographics, I wouldn't be surprised, for example, if a good year for housing starts might be two-thirds of what we have been used to in recent years There is some pessimism in the manufacturing area, partly because of what has been happening to the dollar The retailers are very cautious on inventories inventories aren't going anywhere; they are essentially flat People in capital spending still have fairly good back orders and I think are feeling good Nonresidential construction is quite weak in New Jersey and Delaware Pennsylvania tends to lag those states and we're going through an office building boom which I think will leave us in a glut position I think we clearly are in a slowing position With the national economy perhaps growing 2 to 2-1/2 percent this year, I would guess measured GNP in our District would be about flat The unemployment rate, which has been well under the national average and still is under the national average, is nonetheless rising It's still tight at the entry level and that, too, I think will carry forward given the demographics But it is beginning to loosen up further up the ladder  As far as the national economy goes, I think there is this dichotomy between what I'm seeing in my District and the national economy It seems to me that the Greenbook is about right One point, however, is that the change in the composition of demand, as shown in the Greenbook, does seem to have some implications for risks Essentially, what we have is a move away from exports and a move away from capital spending in that we're counting on consumption and, to some extent, housing I have some doubts about housing picking up and that leaves consumption So it seems to me that we could end up with significantly less growth and perhaps even more growth But my sense here is that the change in the nature of the composition probably leads us to a slightly greater risk on the down side going out into 1990, given the mix of output that we have had over the last year   Alternative B, and I think asymmetrical is fine I could also live with symmetrical I should say that while this makes good economic sense, I think it is going to be somewhat confusing to observers of this whole process in that we have been intervening to drive down the dollar and, if the Germans raise interest rates, there will be an expectation that this is a coordinated effort And if we don't follow through--I agree we should not follow through, that's not my argument--I think it will raise a number of questions and will sire a number of speculations about where the Fed is in all of this That's more politics and public relations, but it is nonetheless part of the world   In an overall sense, I think we ought to be generally pleased We're trying to steer the economy through a narrow channel and we're doing that However, I must say that when you are in that narrow channel it looks even narrower than it did before you got there What I'm sensing is that the risks are more on the side that the economy is going to grow too slowly rather than faster And I think the Greenbook numbers are too bullish; I think we will see slower growth over the next six months I'm not running into the same emotion that Bob [Forrestal] is running into But the sentiment clearly runs between one of concern to bearishness Real estate people are very bearish; construction--in the residential area--is down and we're going to run into some bankruptcies there We are headed toward some over capacity in terms of nonresidential construction and I think it's going to take us several years to work through that Manufacturing is softer in the Third District than it is in the nation as a whole The retailers feel reasonably good about Christmas, but I don't think their expectations are all that high So  -15-    11/14/89  I [wouldn't describe] the retail area as much more than flat I make these comments in the overall context that this is what we set out to achieve in terms of steering the economy But nonetheless, I have more concern that we're going to overdo it on the soft side rather than underdo it And that will have some effect on my policy prescription in the next part of this meeting   I agree with alternative B and the asymmetrical directive It comes down to risks--and I think the risks are on the down side--and how much you're willing to take a chance on the economy going down to get some gains on inflation I think we have to view inflation in this current sensitive context in a longer-term view So, I support where you come out, Mr Chairman   I realize it's getting late   Well, most of the questions and points that I wanted to make have already been made One thing that I get out of this is that we get into inflation and we tend to get out of inflation not so much in a straight line route but over a period of time over different cycles Someone made the point earlier that inflation has built up over the 15-year period because it would peak out in a subsequent cycle at a higher rate than the previous inflationary peak and it wouldn't drop as low And I wonder if that is not instructive in terms of how one gets out of it As much as I would like to say, for example, that we want to set out on a course that brings inflation down over the next five years and then we're going to hold it there, I must say that my reading of history and my sense of what makes a country like this go doesn't encourage me that that's a very likely outcome What does seem to me realistic--and it is [the course] that we really have been following in the '80s, if not by design, certainly by our actions--is that to get the inflation [progress] we want over a period of time we have to bring down the peaks of inflation and to bring down the troughs of inflation from cycle-to-cycle What is different about the '80s is that we have kept inflation from accelerating all that much in this cycle Now, sooner or later, we will have a recession I don't think anybody around the table wants a recession or is seeking one, but sooner or later we will have one If in that recession we took advantage of the anti-inflation [unintelligible] and we got inflation down from 4-1/2 percent to 3 percent, and then in the next expansion we were able to keep inflation from accelerating, sooner or later there will be another recession out there And so, if we could bring inflation down from cycle-to-cycle just as we let it build up from cycle-to-cycle that would be considerable progress over what we've done in other periods in history It seems to me it's [a policy] that is doable in terms of public and political acceptability   Well, the theoretically right answers to your questions are that we ought to have zero inflation with a precise timetable I think those theoretical answers are wrong in practice because we need too much luck beyond our own powers to achieve that I think we have to be careful here that we don't let perfection become the enemy of improvement I would be quite happy to see us pursue a goal of disinflation over time and not necessarily in a straight line And if we ever get to the point where we get that state of mind that we had in the late '50s and early '60s, then I think we could have another conversation around this table to figure our where we're going I doubt if anyone of us will be here, however, to have that discussion because I think it's fairly far out there I think we ought not be precise on the timetable because I'm with John to state a goal and miss it undermines our credibility I think what people look at is the progress made; and if over time we can make progress on inflation, that's about all that people realistically expect out of us I'd be happy to leave it at that   Well, to be very blunt about this, I don't think there is a public or political mandate to go to zero inflation if it means pushing up unemployment and risking a recession And I think we would do ourselves and the public a disservice if we somehow pretended that achieving this is going to come at a relatively small cost because I think it would get short circuited fairly quickly I don't think there is any amount of education and persuasion that we can do, barring a hyper-inflation kind of experience like the Germans had, that will ever educate the public to bear even the kinds of costs that we're talking about here I think there is support out there for resisting accelerating inflation Realistically, our educational efforts and our statements ought to be aimed at shoring up that support Now, that means in the process that we have to make, as we have historically, stronger statements against inflation than other parts of society and government; I think that's what a central bank is for But I think we kid ourselves if we take that rhetoric--every  -46-    12/18-19/89  chairman of the Federal Reserve has had stronger rhetoric against inflation than, in effect, we have been practically able to deliver I think that's the way life is in a democracy; to try to go for pure and ideal solutions is just not the way democracy works Democracy involves a lot of compromising and we're compromising here And I think the best compromise we can cut is to resist accelerating inflation   How would you like to summarize it, Mr Chairman?   Well, if we're thinking about changing that program--and there may very well be good reasons to do it--I would not do it so abruptly that we have banks expecting that they would have  -62-    12/18-19/89  those funds during the spring months and then we pull it I think we have to give them some warning when they've had this for several years Even though it gives us some problems at the Desk, we need to be mindful of what we do to them as well   Mike, I wonder if you might comment a little more about what's going on in terms of the trade-offs in your forecast in inflation and growth Essentially, for the next two years you have subpar growth of under 2 percent and the unemployment rate rising to over 6 percent You have a somewhat heroic assumption that there will be no further easing in monetary policy over that period Yet the inflation trend line is not very good We get some relief in inflation next year but then in 1991 we get inflation going back up Now, I'm not one to push the precision of these numbers, but essentially we don't have much progress over this time horizon, given the subpar growth It's less than encouraging and I would appreciate your commenting on it    12/18-19/89   My area of the country is essentially flat with a lot of variation across industries and geographical areas If you want to get depressed, I can take you to places in New Jersey to talk to builders, real estate people, and automobile dealers; it's fairly depressing If you want to feel good I can take you to places in Pennsylvania where the general business climate seems to be quite good There are a few straws in the wind that perhaps things in manufacturing are flattening out We too have been going through a period in recent months where manufacturing clearly has been trending down One picks up some evidence that orders may be picking up, although the backlogs still seem to be going down fairly quickly I wouldn't read too much into that, but I think it is a straw in the wind  On the national economy, I think the Greenbook forecast is a reasonable one I think there is still some downside risk; the downside risk is greater than the upside risk The inflation outlook for 1990 [in the Greenbook] strikes me as being about right   And Delaware   I think it is a close call today There are the downside risks and the financial fragility risks that argue for some additional insurance However, I come down on the side of continuing the existing directive with no change now and asymmetrical in a downward direction I come out that way essentially because we have what we set out to achieve--a slower economy--and we ought to try now to realize some of the anti-inflationary benefits that come from that and set the stage for further anti-inflationary benefits down the road I think the wisest statement that's been made this morning is the one by Governor Angell when he said that it's a very wasteful experience to have a couple of slow quarters and then accelerate out of it And I think we're in danger of doing that We have a fairly rapid growth in M2; it's rapid as far out as we're projecting it into 1990 I think the risks are that we're going to come out in the spring faster than we would like and be in a position then of having to clamp down at the worst time, politically and economically And we will have wasted what we've done So, I think we ought to take some of the risks that go with this downside risk If we have to ease, let's ease; but let's wait until there's a strong case to do it   Mr Chairman, I have no problem with what Governor Angell suggested I do caution you, however, that if you want to make this an official vote, that official vote is going to be in the record I just wonder if this is the sort of thing that we want to have a record of dissents   I wonder if you might just want to have a straw vote   Well, I agree with those who support alternative II, and I also think it is helpful to have this longer-term view of what these strategies mean But as important as that is, we still have to live through 1990 And I think the questions that we have to ask are How much risk of a recession in 1990 are we willing to bear in order to keep inflation from accelerating? And how much flexibility do we need in 1990 in these long-run ranges to deal with the threat of recession, should it get more serious? I think alternative II also encompasses the right balance for 1990 as well as for the longer-run outlook Alternative III simply doesn't give us much flexibility in that regard and alternative I takes us in the wrong direction on inflation So, both for the immediate year, 1990, as well as for these longer-run considerations, alternative II makes sense   Mr Chairman, I recognize the parliamentary procedure that you were using with these amendments but, in light of what Governor Angell just said, I wonder if we do want this kind of precision of votes recorded in the minutes I would much prefer to have an overall vote that says whether we accept alternative II as amended and consider these largely straw votes and then let people vote up or down on something more substantive than these kinds of fractions   Well, I just wonder if we're getting carried away here with this procedure   My interpretation, Mr Chairman, of what we did is that we took a straw vote and instead of doing it by raising hands we used our voices And I view those two as largely equivalent   Mr Chairman, do you view this as a general intellectual discussion or do you view it as more than that--as something leading up to an action of some kind?   Well, as far as the national economy goes, I would agree essentially with the Greenbook We come out roughly the same in terms of inflation and real growth  As for the region, the Mid-Atlantic states are about the same as the nation as a whole--somewhere in between New England and the Midwest--with New Jersey having a few characteristics of New England, but not anywhere to the same degree of severity, and with Pennsylvania and Delaware being closer to the Midwest Attitudes vary depending on where in the District and in what industry the people you talk to are; but if there is a majority attitude, I think it can be characterized as somewhat more concern about economic prospects than, say, 6 months or a year ago But there is a general expectation that the slowing  -14-    2/6-7/90  that we're going through and the economic problems that we have are really a brief interlude, just a pause It's almost as if the expansion of 7 years that we've had is so ingrained that people just think it's going to carry through into the future Looking beyond the numbers and these current attitudes, I must say, as I listened to the chart show and leafed through these charts, I got the sense that this is a forecast waiting for something to happen Essentially, what we're doing in the real sector is keeping the inflation rate about steady with subpar growth That's not terribly satisfying; maybe it's the best we can do Then, there's the whole business of financial fragility For those of us sitting around the table what is especially frustrating is that our room to maneuver is really very, very small In that context I think this kind of muddling through is probably about the best we can do, but it's not terribly satisfying intellectually or otherwise   Central and northern   Really end on an upbeat note!   I have a question What would a 1-1/2 percentage point increase of the interest rate mean for the real economy, Mike?   In other words, it probably would bring on a recession, to be blunt about it   I agree with your analysis, Mr Chairman I think we ought to stay where we are I would state the case for staying where we are somewhat more strongly, I think, than you did I think it would be counterproductive for us to change policy at this point The forward-looking indicators do suggest that the economy is bottoming out and we've prided ourselves in staying ahead of the curve over the last year or so And I think this is a good time to pay attention to those forward-looking indicators On the financial fragility, I think lower rates would not help the credit rationing What will help the credit rationing is when confidence begins to grow again about the economy and the risk of recession fades into the background I'd also put more emphasis on the international side To lower rates now would be counterproductive in terms of international flows and I think it would be counterproductive in terms of long-term rates So, I feel quite strongly that we ought to stay where we are and for that reason I would like a symmetrical directive To try to move away from a "no change" policy is a very major decision and it ought to require a full discussion of the Committee before we do it   When is the last time that the Fed did not share in intervention with the Treasury?   I have a question Peter, I thought that your Annual Report on Operations for 1989 had considerable food for    3/27/90  thought, and there were two points in that report that leaped out at me One was your concluding comment, which I suspect you wrote with your own hand, in which you talk about how essentially we have moved back to federal funds targeting, even though we don't call it that, and an almost wistful philosophizing about how there ought to be a way to move away from that I'd appreciate any comments that you might have on that The other point that leaped out at me was the collateralization of currency You made the really rather astounding point that for the first time since 1957 the System portfolio actually was reduced and that our leeway on collateral is really rather thin I think that would be worth talking about But beyond that, I think that is a sensitive political issue Some years ago--I forget whether it was in '82 or '83--there was considerable Congressional interest in the use of foreign exchange as collateral for the US dollar We made some pledges, as I recall I think Chuck Partee and some other people testified on that If you link that issue with what was just talked about a moment ago--in effect, the first split with the Treasury in a long time, and the issue as to who is the senior and who is the junior partner, which was a very sensitive one Congressionally in the '73-'74-'75 period--it just strikes me that we may have a major issue developing These two volatile issues were sensitive separately and I would think that when you put them together it could be a major issue I don't want to step into the topic [on our agenda] later, but it does seem to me that we're opening ourselves up to bringing back some of those issues that we have fought in the past If they come back together, we could have a big fight on our hands   Okay Then I will go back to my first question about the comments [in your Annual Report]   Well, I just can't let this pass First of all, I think you are to be complimented for putting together in one place a review of this complex issue Even if not much change occurs, I think the study is worthwhile and it is a well-done record I've never approached this [issue] from a particularly ideological point of view  -46-    3/27/90  I've always tended to be fairly pragmatic in terms of the politics as well as the economics about whether we ought to [intervene] or not However, I must say that over the past year just the sheer amount of the transactions has struck me as being well beyond what is a reasonable number I feel that we have just sort of slipped into this for good reason or bad reason The number is something like $20 billion It goes well beyond a narrow, or even a moderate, interpretation of disorderly markets; it goes well into trying to manipulate exchange rates And it's difficult to see what we have gotten out of it I personally don't think we can continue for another year with that kind of volume It might be helpful as the Committee looks at this to try to draw a distinction between intervention to counter disorderly markets--as ambiguous as that is-- and intervention aimed at manipulating the level of exchange rates I, for example, would think that intervening to counter disorderly markets is a fairly routine, even technical, kind of thing over which the Desk, the Chairman, and the Foreign Currency Subcommittee ought to have fairly wide discretion But when we get into the issue of whether we're going to intervene to manipulate the level of exchange rates and we commit the magnitude of dollars that we have, it seems to me that that kind of decision ought to be laid on the table as explicitly as when we change domestic policy rather than just come to the point where we ratify transactions So, what I get out of this is that we ought to try to draw this distinction If we're talking about anything that comes close to what we've been through, we ought to have a procedure in the Committee where that policy decision is aired and discussed and we either ought to go on record as favoring it or not favoring it   I'm not prepared to make a decision for all time and in all circumstances that says what is or isn't It seems to me that the case for this narrow definition of intervention to counter disorderly markets is well within the bounds of what a central bank ought to do I think it's fairly routine business [for a central bank] On the broader issue, I think one would have to look at the circumstances in which we were trying to do it It's more than economics involved here When we start to commit billions and billions of dollars, as we have this past year, for the clear purpose of trying to manipulate exchange rates, I think that is a decision that ought to be made consciously Maybe we would do it and maybe we wouldn't I would just have to wait and discuss whether I would be for it or not for it depending on the circumstances And I wouldn't make any [prior] judgment   I think in some circumstances it might make sense for us to do it And those circumstances may go beyond economics I'm just not prepared to close the door on its potential effectiveness for a broad range of reasons We ought to face up to that head on when the time comes   Well, first of all, $20 billion is a lot of money to spend even for a central bank Second, I think that there are some political accountability issues here, one of which we're going to run into on this currency [collateral] business, I would think, some time this year We at least ought to have thought through what we're doing and why we're doing it before we commit to that kind of money   Well, just to comment on your overall proposal I think it's a reasonable proposal, given the realities of the world  -71-    3/27/90  that we live in It may not be as easy for everybody around the table to digest as they would like, but I think it's reasonable and I'm supportive of it   Yes, there's a lot of good to say about it,   Well, I think all of this business with the collateral is really rather fortuitous because we agreed that if there were a confrontation between the Treasury and the Fed that the Treasury would win In fact, we promised the Congress in the '70s that we would be supporting it  -80-    3/27/90   [We] also promised the Congress that before we use foreign exchange as collateral, we'll let them know And at the right moment we'll let them know and it seems to me that we will air the whole issue We've kept our word on both and now we can air it and it's aired in a way that's not confrontational If we get turned down, that's not all bad   My concern about that, Wayne, would be that the Treasury won't do that   They won't do that and, in effect, that gets us to the same point And we don't have to try to get them to do something they're not going to do anyway   It does not require a vote, but it's the most important part   Second   With all due respect, I think we've milked this one for a while I think we have [addressed] those other questions implicitly We talked about what the implications are for domestic policy; you've already agreed to keep us informed about G-7 meetings; and there's the other one--   My question has already been answered, or at least commented on   I think our District is moving at odds with the nation, because various sectors are weakening and weakening relative to the nation as a whole Manufacturing is quite weak and taking on some of the characteristics of previous recessionary periods for manufacturing Housing is down and I don't see much happening there Nonresidential construction is still growing but I think that's more of a pipeline effect of finishing the projects that already have been started Out beyond that I think one sees a fair amount of excess capacity Financial services, which have been leading the Mid- Atlantic region for some years, are characterized by layoffs Retail sales are flat Job growth is essentially nil and unemployment is rising; it now is about where the nation is as a whole and I would guess 5 or 6 of our various cities and towns are seeing unemployment rates of around 7 percent or exceeding 7 percent  I think there is some basis to this bank lending phenomenon that we were talking about; it's more than smoke I have talked with just about every major bank in our District in recent weeks and particularly in those that are examined by the Comptroller there is a  -21-    3/27/90  definite scaling back Part of it is that people who are running the banks as well as the lending officers do not have that long a track record Most of their top-level experience is in times of expansion and they're not quite sure how to react [now] The other part is that the Comptroller's examiners really haven't done a very good job of examining banks lately They are coming on like gangbusters I have heard more than once the comment "They're scaring the heck out of us" Some of that I think is useful and constructive, but the risk of overreaction is there I ask myself where some of these small and medium-sized businesses are going to go for their money We have had about 40 or so new banks start up and many of them are state banks I suspect that in their eagerness we will see some of those loans shift over there and they probably will not do as good a job in distinguishing between the good and the bad  So, I think the District is out of phase with the nation Inflation has begun to moderate and come down As I look at the nation, clearly the inflation outlook has worsened; it's disappointing We're not getting what we want; there's no question about that When I look at the risk of recession, I would have to say that, yes, the risk is down I think Mike did a nice job of summarizing the various national sectors in the Greenbook But even taking his own analysis, except for personal consumption, one does not see much of a forward thrust You don't see it in housing; you don't see it in [non]residential construction; you don't see it in exports The only area in which you see fairly modest growth is consumption While that is the biggest chunk of the economy by far, I would like to see a little more support than that one sector for me to say that we're out of the woods as far as the economy moving ahead So, I think we find ourselves in a bad box The inflation situation is worsening; and while I for one think the odds of a recession are down, I'm not willing to say we're out of the woods I think we need some caution in making that assumption as far as policy goes   To move now on policy would be premature on domestic grounds and counterproductive on international grounds, I think So I prefer a continuation of current policy On the issue of symmetrical or asymmetrical, I prefer symmetrical It turns on the question of what kind of burden of proof we want in order to make a policy change I think a policy change over the next several weeks would be a major move, and there ought to be some burden of proof to make such a move; and that leads me in the direction of symmetrical   The change in sentiment in the market was an extraordinary swing in mood Yet I found that in the previous couple of months or so the national statistics that we were getting didn't seem to coincide with what I was hearing from the business community The current numbers seem to me to be more consistent with what I hear from the business community My question is Is the marketplace so dependent on these published statistics or is it also relying some on the kinds of ad hoc information that it gets from the business community generally? What a difference one number made! It just struck me as extraordinary   I have a couple of questions On page 4 in the Greenbook, you have laid out the monetary policy assumptions about bringing inflation down over the next couple of years We have an environment in which there is not very much support--certainly no national support--for this kind of firming in monetary policy, as best I can tell But even besides that, going all the way out to the end of 1991 we have a 6-1/4 percent unemployment rate and then that slack continues into 1992 You don't indicate what the unemployment rate is in 1992 I presume it goes up another half point or three-quarters of a point?   But even after we have done all of that [firming], we have not done much more than keep inflation from accelerating, at least in terms of the numbers that you have There is some deceleration, but inflation is still largely in the 4 to 5 percent area that we have been talking about Now, presumably, if you carry this [forecast] out to '93, '94, and '95, you begin to get some results But to me that calls into question the whole logic behind this approach that we can gradually squeeze inflation out, as desirable as that goal is Somehow this paragraph brought home (1) the difficulty of it, and (2) how unreasonable it may be even to think that we can pursue something like this in the kind of world that we live in I don't know if that's a question or a comment, but I guess I'd like you to disagree with me    5/15/90  My second question has to do with this credit crunch phenomenon We've all looked into it; we've put together these anecdotal reports, and every report suggests that there's less of a credit crunch than is talked about popularly in the general press I'm just wondering if you have any insights as to why we have this dichotomy between what is said loosely and what we find when we try to zero in on the extent of it It doesn't seem to be the same problem that is often reported   In the District, commercial real estate varies a good bit, but on the whole I think it's a major drag on the economy in some areas I think the risks in the District are on the down side In retail sales we're seeing some small increases, and capital goods continue to be a positive Manufacturing generally is still slumping, but there's some sense that that slump may be bottoming out Overall, I'd say we have modest growth  On the national economy, I come out about where Tom Melzer just did I think our "steady-as-you-go" policy has served us well We've resisted being jerked around My own sense is that the risks to the economy continue to be about even There is a risk that inflation may accelerate, but I think there is a risk that the economy may not be as strong as it is currently I sense that the business community still feels that we will avoid a recession, but I must say that I think it would not take a lot of monetary tightening to change that My sense is that we ought to push the "steady-as-you-go" policy another couple of months   I favor "B" symmetrical I think the risks are about even I'm not willing to concede at this point that the next move is up It may very well be, but I think we're in an uncertain enough situation that I'd like to stay symmetrical and make a judgment as the information comes in and as we learn more about the kind of situation that we're in   For 1990, I would keep M2 and debt the same, but I would make a technical adjustment on M3 The rationale for keeping M2 and debt the same is that we are fundamentally on target, that there are uncertainties, but the ranges that we have, with a 4-point spread, are wide enough to accommodate that I think that conveys a message that we are fundamentally happy with the basic thrust of policy M3 I would adjust technically, largely for the argument that was just given We have a target for M3 that we almost surely cannot hit because we mis-estimated what it ought to be at the beginning of the year We mis-estimated these deposit flows and I think we ought simply to face up to it and make that adjustment So, I would go with a 0 to 4 percent range for M3 in 1990  For 1991, I think it is important to continue on this longer- run track of lowering the aggregates, conveying the notion that we are serious about working inflation down I would lower the ranges for M2 and debt by 1/2 percentage point so that we would end up with 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for debt I would keep M3 the same, 0 to 4 percent, on grounds that we made a technical adjustment now and we ought to wait and see whether that's accurate If we have to adjust it again, we have to adjust it again   Mr Chairman, when is your testimony? Do you know?   The 18th Is the Senate first or the House?   In the Philadelphia District, my sense is that both business sentiment and economic activity have deteriorated since the last meeting and that the outlook is more bearish now than even a month ago Real estate is the weakest spot, with increasing reports of builders in trouble The number of bankrupt properties is rising One of our major firms that is closely tied to capital spending    7/2-3/90  reports that new capital spending authorizations have moderated appreciably during the second quarter The only major exception is for environmentally related projects Spending commitments are off for steel, chemicals especially, pharmaceuticals, electric power generation, and oil and gas And the prospect for continued weakness in capital spending authorizations is there Retailers report essentially flat sales, and I would say that merchants are more cautious about the outlook than a couple of months ago Manufacturing generally appears to have flattened out but at fairly low levels And except for autos, I think most of the manufacturers in the District do not expect further slippage from these low levels In general, bankers are increasingly gloomy; they are worried about loan quality, profit margins, and the next examination Lending for real estate projects has been curtailed sharply and lending to small business-- often collateralized with real estate assets--is under much more scrutiny My sense is that against the background of a generally slowing economy and a general tightening of credit standards, most companies are falling short in terms of their targets and plans for sales and profits I think all of those are ingredients for a period when business confidence is quite vulnerable and is susceptible to some significant deterioration in the months ahead  Now, translating that into the national economic outlook, I continue to think that the modest growth forecast, as outlined in the Greenbook, is most likely But in my judgment, there has been a significant increase in the amount of downside risk to the economy in the last few weeks So, while I would say that modest growth is the most likely outcome, I'm much more concerned now about it coming to pass than I was in May   "B" asymmetric I'll skip the subtleties   Let me compliment you on your report I think you and Ted did an excellent job on what is a difficult situation to get a hold of Our whole approach has been one of gradually opening up some excess capacity and hoping that that will dampen prices To date, at best we've kept prices from accelerating But if we disaggregate prices, we find more progress in the goods sector than we do in the services sector; and the goods side of the economy is more responsive to monetary policy That raises a very fundamental question as to how much excess capacity one really has to open up in the economy to generate the kind of anti-inflation progress [we hope for] on the services side I'm wondering, now that we are, say, a year and a half or so into this strategy, if the staff has given any thought to whether the whole thing is just more complicated than this fairly simple notion of opening up some aggregate excess capacity-- that it may not be all that simple and that the fundamental strategy may have some flaws to it   Well, there's a fair amount of history in this country and other countries [suggesting] that a recession will bring noticeable relief on inflation But there is not a lot of evidence that suggests that this gradual approach of opening up slack but not having a recession will result in very much   Right   Well, since we met in July there has been some further softening in an already soft Philadelphia District economy The sluggishness is widespread, including manufacturing, retailing, construction, and capital goods Some areas of the District that have experienced labor shortages for the last several years now report the number of job applications rising And in banking, I sense that our loan problems, which heretofore have been concentrated largely in New Jersey, are now floating across the Delaware, much as George Washington did some years ago And I think we're going to see some of those loan problems in Pennsylvania as well The chemical and plastic firms are the two that I have talked to most, and both of those industries already report substantial cost increases from the Middle East problems I also noted that attitudes have turned very, very cautious For the first time in a number of years I'm hearing more talk about recession in the outlook and, although I think that is still a minority view, it's a growing minority view  On the national outlook, my sense is that we probably will see some negative real GNP by the fourth quarter Before the Middle East shock, we had increasing downside risks stemming from weakening demand in most sectors and tighter credit conditions And with the Middle East problems, I think we'll have still worse downside risks My hunch is that the Greenbook is underestimating the negative impact on consumption I think that consumer confidence has been on thin ice  -19-    8/21/90  for a while and with the cumulative impact of economic concerns that were building, and as this Middle East situation drags on, I think we will see more of a negative impact there And that's going to affect business confidence as well I think the key issues for us are How much slack is enough and how much downside risk are we willing to tolerate to provide a reasonable prospect of keeping the impending bulge in oil-related prices from working its way into the core rate of inflation? And that's the next part of the meeting   Good idea  [Coffee break]   I think we shouldn't do it today   I think we have to have some confidence in our Chairman to use his discretion, particularly in periods like we're in now   Well, doing nothing so as to do no harm is one side of the coin The other side of that coin is paralysis I think it might freeze us into avoiding opportunities to make some positive contribution And I think we need to be aware of that paralysis risk as we go through the next several months I agree that at this point we cannot change policy, if for no other reason than what's going on in the financial markets, both the bond and foreign exchange markets But I feel that the real economy is going to need some help; it's going to need some help from us in the coming weeks and months and I think we ought not to shy away from providing that help So, I prefer an asymmetrical directive in the direction of ease but I think I would be more active with that asymmetrical directive than I sense you would be I would look for opportunities to ease in the intermeeting period when financial markets would be more favorably disposed to accept such an action I view this as a tactical maneuver rather than an abandonment of our basic strategy of restraint to bring down inflation My expectation is that whatever easing moves we make in the coming months will likely have to be reversed once the economy begins to strengthen  We hark back to the lessons that we learned in the 1970s, but I think we learned lessons on both sides In the first episode in 1974 we underestimated the amount of weakness in the economy that was in the background when we had that first oil shock, and we ended up with a very, very deep recession On the other hand, in the later one in 1979, we wanted to avoid the first mistake so we tended to err on the side of ease and we ended up with one big inflation that led to recession So, there are lessons on both sides And while I agree with you that this is not the time to move, let's not get an inferiority complex in this big world and get paralyzed into doing nothing when opportunity knocks at the door   Sam, could you elaborate some on your comments about the dollar being less of a safe haven, which certainly has been true in this latest Middle East crisis? Do you see that as something that has been evolving over time and the Middle East situation brought it to a head? Or do you see it as something that is more transitory? What are your thoughts on it?   I'm not sure, Martha, that it makes the case to release the minutes It makes the case simply to say what the fed funds target is, much the way we say what the discount rate is I think the minutes are so ambiguous that they don't tell you very much    10/2/90  But if we say the target is an 8 percent funds rate, people know what an 8 percent funds rate is just like they know what a 7 percent discount rate is   If there's a case in all of this, that's the case I don't see it on the minutes side   If we say, for example, what the funds rate is, then they will try to figure out what it is we look at when we are about to change the funds rate  SPEAKER(?) Yes   And if we release that, then they'll go back-- it's an impossible situation   The District economic indicators are generally weak and, as elsewhere, business and consumer confidence is low and I think deteriorating Employment is falling in the District; manufacturing is slumping; construction is off; retail sales fell in August and the first part of September; and bank lending is declining And at the anecdotal level, there is more concern on the part of the ordinary public and the business community about the soundness of banks It's hard to measure, but I think it's there and I think it's growing I'm also hearing anecdotal evidence about the slowing payments of accounts receivables Again, it's hard to measure, but they seem to have slowed a good bit One businessman told me at a meeting that he doesn't even hear "the check is in the mail" anymore; people just say that the money isn't coming, which I think is a major change  At the national level, I think the risks are on the down side My hunch is that we're facing a recession that will be more pronounced than contemplated in the Greenbook I think business and consumer confidence are likely to get worse and the stresses and the cracks in the financial system are likely to weigh more substantially on aggregate demand during the coming months than is built into the forecast  We talk about a cumulative downturn and we say we don't see the evidence for a cumulative downturn I think we're probably looking for the kind of evidence that was typical of recessions that we had when the economy was more dominated by manufacturing We tend to look at sales and orders and inventories and that sort of thing We have a different kind of economy and I think the cumulative  -26-    10/2/90  downturn may have a different kind of anatomy this time We had a demand side softening of the economy coming into the summer The economy had slowed a good bit Then on top of that we had the supply shock, which has caused it to slow more Now we have the financial fragilities And it seems to me that that's the cumulative set of forces that will take us into a recession rather than having business people misjudging sales, seeing their inventories build up, and then cutting back on their orders I think we're in a different kind of economy It's important for us to resist inflation in this kind of environment and to reduce inflation over time; but it's also important to buy some insurance against too deep a slump in economic activity where we would then find ourselves in a situation--if the economy starts to get away from us--in which we're forced to ease too rapidly in a very short period of time I think we've bought a lot of credibility in recent years by trying to stay ahead of the economic curve, and I think we should continue that approach to policy even in the face of the uncertainties that we're experiencing at the moment   You wait until Tuesday! [Laughter]   I support your proposition   Let's hurry up and vote   In the current market environment, do you sense that the exchange market would react differently to a change in the funds rate versus a change in the discount rate?   It never is   I think this discussion shows that we really don't want to face up to the major issues that confront us, because it strikes me as being clearly a minor issue on our agenda today It's also full of irony because if you look at the operational paragraph, it's the only reference to the federal funds rate yet we essentially peg the federal funds rate and we are [talking about] eliminating that reference I don't think it makes a lot of difference whether we keep it or not I would think that the most accurate sentence to put in would be what John LaWare just suggested because that does explicitly keep in [language regarding the Chairman's] discretion to call for Committee consultation and it does refer to what we've been using all along, and that is a fairly wide range of economic and financial variables But I'm prepared to support practically anything because I don't think it makes a lot of difference   I'd like to make one comment I wonder if there might be some merit in making this effective at some future date, such as the beginning of 1991, so that it takes away from it having any immediate significance   Yes, but here it is November and we're talking about doing it January 1st   I think almost everybody in the Philadelphia District is dressed up in a bear suit because it's hard to find any optimistic note The manufacturers still talk about downturns, which we have had for months There is a hint that maybe the rate of descent is slowing, but that's not much consolation for them Attitudes among retailers are just terrible; they're very pessimistic In fact, they're so pessimistic and are following such conservative Christmas inventory policies that even if in the Christmas spirit there were a rush to buy, I'm not sure they would have the kind of stocks that could really turn it into a good season for them The real estate market remains very soft and much of this is spilling over into the banking system I think we have some significant problems ahead of us there  On the national scene, I think in some sense what we're seeing is a typical pattern We've been debating around this table and around the country for several months about whether we're going to have a recession or not Now most people are convinced we are having a recession and the debate is about how bad it is going to be The Fed's job--and we've talked about it around this table--is to buy some insurance against a deep and long recession All that is fairly typical; what I think is different, however, is the condition of the financial system, because I think that makes the need to buy some insurance against a deep downturn more important than usual If major cracks develop in the financial system, we're going to end up in a pretty bad economic downturn So, what I see here are some real discontinuities Either we're going to get away with a mild recession and the financial system is going to hold up generally, or we're going to end up with a financial weakness and with a very deep and long recession It's hard to envision a lot in between If it weren't for the constraint of the dollar, I would be favoring today a more    11/13/90  substantial move toward easing than I think we prudently can do, given the dollar's condition But we're dealing here with a situation that I find increasingly scary because the risks of a really deep downturn, given the condition of the financial system, strike me as much larger than I recall [in my years of] sitting around this table   We have some company coming along from the Big Apple   I support your least-worst policy   Will we need to use foreign currency as backing during this period?   Will there be some announcement of this or will it just happen mechanically?   I would say that the sentiment is increasingly pessimistic or if it's not pessimistic, the level of concern is rising Retailers are still hoping for a season-saving finish They have a long weekend just before Christmas and there's still some hope; but there has been so much price discounting that even if sales do pick up, their profit margins are going to be poor Manufacturing has been weakening longer in our District than it has in the nation, so it's at a very low level But a number of manufacturers are building into their 1991 plans some pickup for the second half of next year There is extreme pessimism in construction for obvious reasons Bankers are worried to scared, depending on how close they are to retirement   The District's unemployment rate, which had been below the nation's, has caught up with the nation's and I suspect will rise above it And for the first time in a long time we now have areas in the District with unemployment rates of 7, 8, and even 9 percent The state and local fiscal situation is very serious, particularly in Philadelphia, but it is not limited to Philadelphia Now that the state elections are over, I think the state of Pennsylvania will have to face up to a large deficit New Jersey, which has had huge tax increases, still has a deficit And a number of municipalities that probably won't make The Wall Street Journal nonetheless are having very serious problems  On the national economy While the Greenbook forecast of a relatively mild, short-lived recession is plausible, my guess is that it's wrong and that we will have a longer lasting and a more serious recession Even if one is optimistic about how the Middle East situation will come out and about oil prices, I doubt very much whether consumer spending will bounce back with the same amount of  -14-    12/18/90  vigor by spring as envisioned in the Greenbook Consumers just feel chastened after a number of years of some fairly loose spending habits And I think they're going to remain cautious Even if the optimistic assumptions on oil and the Middle East are realized, we still are going to have high and probably rising unemployment The consumer still has these high debt burdens, and delinquencies are rising Also, the worries about bank safety, which are all over the talk shows and in the newspapers, just weigh on people and I think they are going to weigh on people even more So, my guess is that we're going to see a fairly bearish consumer for longer than envisioned in the Greenbook   If the discount rate were to go down by 1/2 point but the Committee only wanted the funds rate to go down 25 basis points, how difficult would it be to communicate that to the market, given the fact that we haven't done this much in the past and given the normal churning that goes on at year-end? It might take a while for this to occur and we may find ourselves in a situation of having to-- I guess the miscommunication risk is what I'm driving at   Don, what do you think it would take to get the prime rate to come down?   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I think the Federal Open Market Committee ought to vote for a 1/4 point reduction in the rate today with an asymmetrical directive, and I think you and your colleagues ought to do what you will tomorrow   Get it in writing   We're sending a rather powerful signal these days with our short-run policy movements, and I think it's important that we not confuse that signal I think staying where we are with alternative I is least likely to do that We already have lowered the ranges one notch and by not going back [up] we send a signal that we haven't given up on inflation To go to alternative II in the current environment of bringing interest rates down would send some mixed messages, which I don't think we want to send In terms of operating room, I think all of these ranges give us operating room And if we get a shift in the function, these ranges aren't going to be terribly relevant So, I come down for alternative I on both counts the signal effect and the operating room   Your testimony is when?   In the District, weakness is widespread I suspect we have several more months of downturn, with the beginning of the recovery more a second-half phenomenon than a second-quarter one Attitudes are really very, very cautious both among business people and individuals And we see bank assets continuing to slide, with a couple of banks close to the edge Real estate is probably several years away from recovery, especially on the commercial side  In the nation, I think the staff forecast, while well thought out, is on the rosy side We can't be very sure of any forecast at this point I think we just need to keep an open mind and stay alert to incoming information I'd rather err on the side of too much stimulus at this point rather than too little because I think the costs of misjudging and having a prolonged and deep recession are very [high] Having said that, I think we have to be prepared to offset it with some tightening at some point But we simply can't afford to  -24-    2/5-6/91  have a prolonged, deep recession, given what is going on in the financial system   I agree with your recommendation and your comments surrounding it   I think there are times when you don't want to kick sleeping dogs and this is probably one I know that Governor Angell feels very strongly about this issue but, frankly, I would hope that we could resolve this informally one way or the other We have a great deal of unanimity in the Committee now, and I think that's important given all the problems out there in the economy I think to have a separate vote on word ordering is not in the best interests of the big issues that we face I would urge that we--   Well, I would hope so   I think the people who did the paper did a pretty good job We should not be too technical in how we divide this up, and I think if we err, we ought to err on the side of more communication Just in the last few months we've seen [a case], at the last FOMC meeting, where the discount rate came down just before the meeting That clearly is going to rub some people the wrong way, although in the meeting before that the FOMC essentially precluded what the Board needed to do   And the Board had to change the discount rate that day or the day after--I've forgotten how it worked I think we're just going to find ourselves in these kinds of situations, and the way to minimize the unhappiness that shows up from time to time is to err on the side of talking rather than not talking   Of course, those words are more like what we would wish the case to be rather than what it is [Laughter]   If this warehousing arrangement with the Treasury were unwound, how much would that reduce total US balances?   Assuming for the moment that we want to be a major player in the foreign exchange market and have enough ammunition to play those type of wars, what [amount] of reserves do we need to have a credible balance? Setting aside the amount we have now, if you were starting out as a strategist, what amounts do you think we would have to hold to get respect from the market?   You don't have to be precise   $50 billion, $20 billion, $100 billion?   As a practical matter, I think we around this table are going to find that we have to intervene from time to time, and that means we need a war chest And it would be best if we could arrive at some rough amount that we feel comfortable with, intellectually or conceptually But we aren't getting very far in that direction, and perhaps we won't If your brain doesn't lead you somewhere, then you've got to go with your gut feeling My gut tells me that we ought to unwind this warehousing arrangement as best we can I think $48 billion is on the high side and my sense tells me that we ought to look for some opportunities to lower that number I don't know how far we ought to lower it but a lower number would make me feel more comfortable; I doubt if we need $48 billion So, in the absence of some conceptual framework, if Sam is looking for advice, I would say Talk to the Treasury and reduce the warehousing and take advantage of some opportunities to reduce the $48 billion in other ways   The District economy is still declining, but there are some straws in the wind that a recovery may be in the making There has been a shift in attitudes toward the positive side  -30-    3/26/91  Even in a state like New Jersey, which has some of the characteristics of New England, I think they are beginning to feel better And I had the same experience with my board as Bob Black did with his I really don't recall such a dramatic shift in attitudes on the part of nine people over a one-month span There are a few signs at banks that loan demand may be picking up Bankers are not as willing as they once were but there is willingness to lend; but these are more at the "nibble" level rather than anything very major Home buying has clearly picked up and the real estate people are--euphoric is too strong, but they are feeling very good That has not spilled over into automobiles, although there is more traffic at dealerships Nonetheless, when you look at the hard numbers, sales are still down The retailers, particularly department store people, say that sales haven't picked up except that right after the end of hostilities there was a pickup for a week or so; but they haven't seen it more recently Now, some of the specialty stores report that business has picked up Manufacturers, while they are hopeful about the second half of the year, say their numbers are still bearish; and the people who transport manufactured goods report business is still bad As for the commercial real estate market, I think we're not talking months but several years to get that turned around in the middle Atlantic states So, I would say, with the exception of what is going on in home sales, that the recovery is mostly hope and attitude at this point But that's an important change and is probably a harbinger of things to come  My judgment on the national economy is that the risks are in the process of shifting from a decidedly downward direction toward a more evenly balanced outlook for the economy And I think that we ought to pay attention to that shift as we move into the policy discussion later this morning   "B" symmetrical   Oh, sorry! I apologize   I yield to President Keehn!   In the District, the signals are mixed but on balance I think the overall District economy is still down like that for the nation As in the nation, commercial real estate and retail sales are generally negative There are some indications that manufacturing is beginning to bottom out The only clear area of upturn is in home sales Loan demand is still weak Bankers say that there isn't demand; the business people--or some of them, anyway--say that the bankers won't lend With regard to state and local  -12-    5/14/91  governments, Philadelphia is about to go broke; the states have deficits So, I think that situation is fairly general  I would say the attitudes vary from cautious optimism, with more emphasis on "cautious" than "optimism," to a lot of concern on the part of business people about when a recovery will occur and what kind will occur I find more people who are just about writing off 1991 as a bad year and they are beginning to look to 1992 I sense, and I don't think it's particularly unusual at this stage of the business cycle, a dichotomy now between those who analyze the economy and those who manage it I think most of those who analyze the economy see signs that the economy is beginning to pick up, whereas those people who have annual meetings to chair--whether they want to downsize the company another notch or they are going to meet the financial analysts--want to be reassured that there really is a recovery out there; they don't really yet feel it in their bones We're at a fairly critical period in that, if we don't begin to see some tangible evidence on a broader base that we are indeed going to get a recovery, we could see confidence really drop off and we might have a double-dip in terms of the downturn I do subscribe to the notion that the economy is going to pick up, but I think we're playing with some tender attitudes out there I would say that the risks are probably even to maybe marginally on the down side But I [agree with] those who are concerned about the outcome If we don't get a recovery or if it's postponed, I think there will be some real costs and it will be quite difficult to try to get the economy turned around  On the inflation side, my sense is that financial markets may be somewhat behind in appreciating what is going on in most of the economy We're making better progress on inflation than I would have expected a few months ago and that's positive I think the long bond market has some catching up to do there As for the Greenbook forecast, I think it's reasonable I would probably have more of a saucer shape kind of recovery--perhaps a little weaker--but it's hard to quarrel with the basic analysis there   Well, long-range target setting is a mix of substance and symbolism Given where we are as the only game in town and hopefully at the bottom of the business cycle with inflation coming down, I think the symbolism part is more important than the substance It is important that we have credibility on the inflation side in terms of reducing it, but I think it's also important to have credibility in the sense that the central bank ought to be viewed as pro recovery and pro healing of the financial system And I think keeping the ranges the same in this context is the right balance I think it gives us the overall kind of credibility that we need in order to be an effective policymaker On the more substantive side, the technical side, all of the options that we're talking about have us in the top end of the existing range I think we need that maneuverability and the operating room, given the uncertainties about what kind of recovery we're going to have We've talked a lot about velocity It may turn out to be the way the staff says; it may not turn out to be the way the staff says So, when I look both at    7/2-3/91  symbolism and substance, I come out fairly clearly on the side of keeping the ranges the same   Well, my story has largely been told I think the Philadelphia District is much in line with what is going on in most of the country We're in the process of bottoming out but there's no lift-off yet I would say attitudes in the business and banking community are hopeful but still cautious Business people don't read as much into a tenth or two increase from month-to-month as do analysts I think they tend to look more at their absolute level of output in business and they still see that business is low even though it's stabilizing One gets the sense that a little good news would go a long way toward substantially improving confidence I think the other side is true, too Bad news would have a magnified effect in the pessimistic direction But I think things have stabilized and attitudes are lagging some and will probably catch up I can ditto pretty much what Bob Forrestal said about credit conditions and banks I'm getting more calls than I would like from bankers who basically are saying "I told my board that at the end of the year I was taking a big write-off and I ought to have most of it behind us; now I'm coming back and going to have to put in for some more" I think the worst is over but there's still bad news coming out And that does feed into this vulnerability issue concerning the financial sector People are just being bombarded with it; to me it's the largest vulnerability that we have I think you would find that credit demand is still weak Business people will say there is a credit crunch while the bankers will say there is no credit crunch but they just need to make good loans I think that is still there  As far as the forecast goes, I think the staff is broadly correct in forecasting a modest upturn for all the reasons that have been given I would see perhaps less growth in the second half of this year and more next year, simply because there are these cautious attitudes out there Lots of business people are largely writing off '90 and '91 and looking more toward '92 But that's certainly a subtle difference, and I think the broad contours are correct   Don, what would be your interpretation of the meaning of M2 if it continued into July-August at the subdued rate of growth that we've seen in the last months?   "B" symmetric   What I sense around the table is that most of us are still keeping the faith about a modest recovery, but we have increased doubts about it and see more downside risk I certainly agree with that What one would like to see at this point is more convincing signs of a cumulative upturn--self-feeding kinds of factors in the economy Yet in every one of those critical junctures, I think caution and doubt are diluting their effect What we count on is the inventory kick and yet what we find there is a great deal of caution People are more into a "just-in-time" kind of inventory policy We're still getting liquidation; surely, at some point we will get accumulation but it just doesn't seem to have the potential thrust to the economy that one might expect At the next juncture, at the hiring juncture in this linkage, we see the same kind of caution Most of the jobs have been created in the services sector in recent years and we're already beginning to see much more caution and layoffs in that sector The next linkage is the consumer spending area; we see caution there A linkage further out is investment I must say in talking with the business community that I hear more and more talk that '92 is going to be an extension of '91, and there's more caution there So, what bothers me about this emerging recovery is that I just don't sense that these cumulative self-feeding forces are going to have the [usual] impact Add on the financial fragility and perhaps that's part of the explanation So, I share the view that while a modest recovery is still likely, the downside risks have increased significantly in recent weeks Also, whenever you see more downside risk I think you have to ask yourself what the consequences are And while I don't think a double-dip is likely, I think that a very slow recovery or something that approaches a double-dip really could have some major consequences on getting the economy going because basic confidence is in need of healing with these financial fragilities So, I think we're in a situation now where the risks are fairly significant and we have to deal with them   Well, I think what that survey is showing is the same thing that we're seeing in industrial production A lot of that seems to be auto-related and auto supply I find that we get those survey results--and they are very accurate if you look at them over the last 20 years--and yet if you talk to people who run the companies you would get a different story I find it difficult to reconcile that That survey shows more optimism than any other anecdotal information I'm picking up I can understand that early on in a recovery but that survey is in its fifth month now of showing some  -28-    8/20/91  increases, which is consistent with the national industrial production [data] But it doesn't fit the mood that one senses It doesn't translate into hiring, for example, and it's not translating into improved capital spending plans   Well, I haven't gone back and done that detailed a look We have called back a number of these companies to verify the numbers And, you know, it is a diffusion index; it doesn't actually measure the level of output It just is another example of this gap between people who are running firms, and-- I think Jerry may have said it right Things are not as bad as the business community thinks they are, but they're probably not as optimistic as their economists are forecasting things are going to be   Well, I think your recommendation makes sense I came to this meeting, before the Russian developments, thinking that we ought to ease now; but there is something to be said for waiting But I wouldn't be overly patient about using the asymmetry I have a slight preference for version II but not a huge one   It's all up hill from now on!   One question, Sam What are the real prospects for off-market sales of marks?   Well, I think the understatement in your comments is that this Committee and others in the System have some interest in all of this This is probably not the forum, but I have some strong interests, and perhaps other people do too, not only in the implications for the financial markets--and I think you've given us a hint by talking about swaps just what some of the implications and some of the contingencies are--but also, closer to home, just how vulnerable we are as an institution in all of this Again, this is probably not the place to talk about it, but I think it is important to talk about it in some forum   Mike, that was really an excellent opening statement about the economy and where we are I think it really summarized it quite well I have a question about the profile of the recovery The profile in the Greenbook is essentially a real growth rate of about 3 percent, give or take a few tenths in either direction, starting in the third quarter and going out through the forecast period Yet, I think the typical historical pattern has been that in the initial quarters--the first two or three quarters--we tend to get a more rapid growth rate and then it begins to slow I'm wondering in your analysis of past recoveries if you think that there is anything in the sort of jump-start dynamics earlier in a recovery that we have to have a faster growth to get it going and then it tends to slow and whether, if we only get 3 percent in the initial quarter, that's enough jump-start action to keep the recovery going in subsequent quarters   Except for manufacturing, there are few signs of growth in the middle Atlantic states There's continued weakness in the labor markets and joblessness--the number of people who are out of work--is still rising The word from the retailers in the District, and the statistics do back it up, is that retail sales are fairly flat, with not much expectation of a Christmas season that they will feel comfortable about The banks and the financial sector generally are still quite sluggish and the overhang of commercial real estate is still there and will be there for some time On the whole I sense that the District is somewhat weaker than the nation and attitudes are at best cautious  As far as the national economy goes, I hope the Greenbook is right I always feel better when I hear Mike The trouble is that when I get back home, it doesn't last long; it's a quick fix and I need more of it to overcome what I keep running into But I think the risks are on the down side both for growth and for inflation And then I ask myself the question that Dick raised earlier If we miscalculate, nine months or a year from now which miscalculation would we rather have? If this incipient recovery should slip away from us--though I don't happen to think it will--I think it would be very difficult for us to rev it up again I would prefer to try to slow down a faster recovery than to try to speed up one that isn't moving along So, I think the risks are on the down side and the costs of the downside risks are higher than coming out on the up side   Northern Jersey has more excess than south Jersey But Jerry's point is that probably in relative terms there's more excess space in the suburban areas than in the central cities   I sense that rental prices are still coming down but that sale prices in the Philadelphia area are in the process of flattening out   Commercial buildings   The new lease prices are still very weak   Well, Bob, you adjusted when you lost Ml   "B" asymmetric   I imagine we ought to have little ambiguity!   In these kinds of situations where you have something of a trade-off, I think you have to ask yourself a question If I had to defend the actions to the whole world, which side would I rather be on? And I would rather be on the side that said we had a scheduled meeting and we made a decision; there was speculation pro and con but we implemented that decision in the market so that everybody would find out about it at the same time I'd rather say that than that we delayed it for three days or five days or six days because we were afraid a few people would get hurt selling short In the whole context of what our role is as a public institution, we have to go with the side that meets our standards and with which we feel comfortable   As soon as the market opens?   Well, this is all getting a bit much, I must say, with all the gloom and pessimism around the table But I think it is quite reflective of what one hears in conversations almost wherever one goes--in business, socially, and otherwise And my District is no exception to that I think the economy has deteriorated over the last couple of months, and certainly sentiment has become sharply more bearish Manufacturing had been a relative bright spot in our area, but it has slowed rather dramatically and I think the sentiment is in the process of changing about 1992 I would guess that as our future surveys come in they will reflect that, judging from the conversations one has Retailers are about as pessimistic looking toward this Christmas season as they have been probably since the '81-'82 recession Our commercial real estate market is typical of what you have heard elsewhere in the country And loan demand is still declining at banks I do sense, however, that price pressures have diminished and I think that is an optimistic part of all this  As far as the national economy is concerned, I think the risks are decidedly on the down side We have an anemic outlook at best and I suspect that if I'm wrong it will be on the down side Clearly, we have something going on here that is more than a normal cyclical downturn; you can have your own list of favorites My sense is that we're going to see a longer period of weakness in the economy, but I think most of us are going to be surprised at how much progress we're making against inflation In this kind of situation where the resiliency of the economy is under stress, I think we're quite vulnerable to some kind of shock I don't know what the shock will be; if we knew, it wouldn't be an unpredictable shock But we're in a situation where some event could really turn this from a bad situation into something more serious  There are not very many good policy options out there, but the way I look at it the only available policy tools are in this room And I think that we simply have to ring the monetary "gong" to demonstrate that somebody somewhere is at least trying to do something  -15-    11/5/91  positive to try to arrest this sharply deteriorating sentiment I don't sense any real cost in doing that In the unlikely event that we ease too much, I think we can reverse course We tightened in 1980; we tightened in 1988; we can tighten in 1992 if we have to But now we need a loud and clear easing signal to try to undercut this deteriorating sentiment that we have out there, which is making us quite vulnerable   Mr Chairman, I just have a technical question before we proceed We do have this even keel [consideration] in [the face of a Treasury] financing but is it an open-and-shut case that this change could not be done tomorrow morning? After all, we have the shortest maturity being auctioned today, which isn't as affected by these fluctuations If we did it tomorrow, both the medium-term and the longer-term bidding would still be ahead of us And I am thinking, given the risks--and while we are an honest organization-- that that's a long time to go I'm just wondering what the pros and cons are   Yes   Okay   I favor this "A to B" 4-3/4 percent funds rate with an asymmetric directive for this body, and I think it ought to be accompanied by a discount rate reduction by the other body The logic is that we have a reasonable prospect of doing some good with this package and I think we have very little chance of doing harm And even if we find it is harmful, we can undo it So, in that situation, it seems to me we ought to do it   What is the status of the notion that the Treasury would rely less on long-term bonds?   Is this a variation of the Operation Twist idea?   In the Philadelphia District, I'd say [activity] is flat to down, with little prospect for an upturn on the horizon Manufacturing, which had been a relative bright spot earlier in the year, has turned down--and rather sharply--in December Some of that is auto-related but it's broader than that Construction, which had seen a modest improvement in housing, is down; there's a lot of gloom in the construction industry, with very little near-term prospect for improvement Retail sales are about even with last year; but the number of people that the retailers are hiring is down, so there's a negative effect on employment I still see a slippage in loan quality at banks It's particularly evident--though it may just be because I've spent more time on it in the last few weeks--in de novo banks, which seem to be running into some additional problems In terms of attitudes, I don't sense that there has been a deterioration in attitudes so much as a "hunkering down" kind of sentiment--a view that what we have may last a while  Turning to the nation, the Greenbook forecast is certainly reasonable, but I think the risks are still on the down side, perhaps more so than six weeks ago when we last met It's difficult to find a sector to lead a recovery And having gone through this so-called inventory cycle, I have less confidence in that the second time around than the first I think this hunkering down attitude just reflects less confidence that we will have a recovery There's also a second downside risk and that is that monetary policy will continue to have less of a stimulative effect than one might ordinarily think This could very well turn out to be one of those recessions--and we've had them before--in which we have to push the fed funds rate below the inflation rate in order to get the kind of forward momentum to the economy to bring the Greenbook forecast about In any event, with inflationary pressures subsiding--and they clearly are--I think this double-downside risk provides room for some additional monetary easing, and I would prefer it sooner rather than later   I would prefer alternative A I think there still is a positive role that monetary policy can play both in terms of healing some of these structural wounds as well as providing some cyclical uplift And given my reading of the downside risks and the cost of being wrong, I prefer to get on with it   Alternative I for all the cogent reasons given   My assessment of the District economy is that it's just bumping along the bottom I don't think there are any firm trends, up or down But I, too, have picked up in recent weeks perhaps just a tad of improvement in sentiment Some is from retailing, some from banking, and some from the housing area If you didn't want to see it, I don't think you'd see it; it's not a big deal, just a little here and there You would have to put your finger on the pulse; it's just a sense, and I think that's a positive sign  As far as the nation goes, I think the Greenbook is about right That forecast is the most likely outcome and I think it's well reasoned Nonetheless, it could be wrong and we could relive what we went through last year I just put my finger in the air and came up with my own assessment, which is that there's probably about a 60-65 percent chance that we will get an expansion along the lines the Greenbook sees But I think there's maybe a 25 or 30 percent chance that we won't and that we could see a repeat of last year, with the balance [of risks] being that we could get a stronger expansion So,  -18-    2/4-5/92  it's a profile that has the odds favoring an upswing but enough of a chance of a downturn that one can't dismiss it I do think this is a time when we need some patience; we need to be very pragmatic about applying patience We ought to wait a reasonable period and look for some indicators that the economy is picking up If we don't see those signs after some reasonable period, we have to keep an open mind about how to proceed But at this point I'd be willing to play the odds of a pickup   You were on the wrong side of the war!   I think this is a time for patience and watchful waiting On the question of symmetry or asymmetry, if I were voting, I could accept either I agree with your logic that the chances of tightening are essentially nil and that there is some chance for easing So, there is something to be said for asymmetry and I would support it   Developments in our District are broadly consistent with what is going on in the rest of the country There is noticeable improvement in the residential area, including the construction of new houses The retailers feel better and the sales data are there But when they look at their sales it's year-over- year, and last year sales were very weak So there's concern about how these retail sales will look a couple of months from now The manufacturing area has shown some strength In the nonresidential area, the District really has a long way to go before it digs its way out of the hole; I think that sector is just going to be a drag for some time to come Bankers report essentially flat loan demand outside the residential area, although more of them are reporting that the share of new financing is rising and the share of refinancings is falling I think that's consistent with the data we're getting on the residential side Employment growth is still flat to down, and I think it will be some months before we see any improvement there In terms of attitudes, I think "optimism" is too strong a word I would say "cautiously hopeful" describes business sentiment more [accurately] I think [business executives] see a turn, but they just are not optimistic yet In terms of consumers and rank and file citizens of the District, the mood is certainly not optimistic but more one of frustration than of pessimism How that will play out in consumer sales I'm not sure But there is this dichotomy, I think, between hopefulness in the business sector and a very deep-seated frustration on the part of most other people  As far as the nation goes, I think we do have a modest pickup in the making The issue, as we've talked about around the table, is whether it is sustainable I think the risks are less on the down side now than they were six weeks ago, but on net I still have more concern that this modest recovery will peter out rather than be significantly stronger than the Greenbook forecast But my forecast would be very close to that in the Greenbook I think a modest recovery is the most likely outcome   I'd say the District is mixed Manufacturing has been up for several months running but there is some slowing in the pace of advance In retailing, there just isn't much of a trend either up or down; it seems to be fairly stuck Residential [construction] is growing but not robustly  As to your commercial real estate question, I have the sense that the District is either at or approaching the bottom of the hole but that there is not much sign of a pickup The general [view] is that this is a three-to-five year problem to work our way out of before we get vacancy rates at the point that they will stimulate much  -19-    5/19/92  construction The bankers, I think, feel that the worst surprises are on the table; but the most optimistic feeling is that we may be at about the bottom  The bankers see some evidence of a pickup in loan demand, although not much in the hard numbers; it's more at the inquiry stage Attitudes, in contrast to this mixed view of the real sector, are more upbeat than the hard numbers would support underneath There just is a sense that things are going to move, and that's an improvement over a couple of months ago But I suspect that this sentiment is not firmly based and that one or two months of poor sales or shrinking orders would change the attitudes Nonetheless, I think the attitudes are better  For the national economy, I think we do have a moderate recovery; if anything, it's faster than expected And it's hard not to feel better about the sustainability issue and feel that we have a sustainable recovery The money supply issue strikes me as one of those things we can argue about day-in and day-out We have some good reasons not to worry about it, but it is a shadow that hangs over us I think the only way to settle it is not to worry about it as long as it's an outlier and the economy picks up But if we start to see some weakening in the real sector, then it's going to mean something It's almost an agnostic approach in terms of how we should deal with it  On the inflation side, my sense is, much as Si just expressed, that it's awfully hard to see upward pressures in prices The other side of that is that, particularly in large cities, the unemployment problem looks as if it's just stuck There is an attitude both from the business side as well as those people seeking jobs that there just isn't going to be much improvement How all that will play its way out through the warm summer months in these cities is something that one has to be uneasy about   I think your proposition is reasonable and I support it I must say that it's hard for me to imagine a set of circumstances that would be convincing to tighten policy in the next five or six weeks, given where the economy has been and where it is likely to go and all the uncertainties about the money supply Maybe [that view] reflects the fact that Philadelphia is in the northeast part of the country   On Chart 10, the household spending chart, what kind of job growth lies behind the personal income and consumption dynamics that you've laid out?   What do we have for the year to date roughly?   So, even though it's modest growth, we still have to have a notable increase in the rate of job growth?   The District economy continues to expand slowly with New Jersey the weakest of the three states Manufacturing has been the relative bright spot, although by no means robust Retailing has been flat to up slightly, reflecting in part the weather but also just the general weakness in the economy The sense I have in the housing area is that it has been slowing, but in the commercial real estate area there are people close to that market who feel that it has reached bottom Some of the deals are now attractive enough that some properties may begin to move, although there's no real hard evidence of that; that's just a sense The major weakness in the District has been in the job market We've had a weak labor market now for many months There is some hint of improvement perhaps in the manufacturing area, but overall there continue to be losses in jobs in the District At banks, consumer lending is up some but business lending is still soft and I don't hear any of the talk about bankers being aggressive, at least from the point of view of the business community All in all, I think the District continues to expand but probably more slowly than the nation as a whole  What strikes me about the national economy is that almost wherever one looks the various sectors are either weak to begin with or, after some improvement for several months, are in the process of slowing That again puts the spotlight on sustainability What we're counting on for the Greenbook forecast is that out of this slow and slowing situation we're going to get enough job growth and generate enough income that it will feed enough consumption to keep a modest expansion going during the second half of this year and then next year I have more doubts about this sustainability than I did several weeks ago If growth in the early part of this recovery had been at 5 or 6 percent or 4 to 5 percent or even 3-1/2 to 4 percent, I think this slowing in momentum that we're experiencing would be welcomed But the strongest quarter we've had is under 3 percent; and this is supposed to be the fastest part of the recovery, so there's not a lot of downside margin If there were brighter prospects from exports or something stronger outside the immediate job/income/consumption dynamics, I'd feel more confident about achieving this [projected] growth rate of 2-1/2 percent or so But there just isn't much margin and we appear to be going into a period of some slowing So, I think the downside risk is greater than it was a few weeks ago And while monetary policy should never depend on one particular indicator, it seems to me that the key area we need to look at with regard to the sustainability and dynamics [of this recovery] is job growth If we don't get even the modest kind of job growth that underlies this Greenbook forecast, the expansion is going to break down If we see some signs of this job growth [expectation] not being met, then I think this expansion has some real problems and we will have to take a serious look at what our options are in the monetary policy process  I think we can largely discount what is happening to M2, but what bothers me is that M2 was growing slowly and now has turned negative and it's in the context of total credit being very weak If the weakness in bank credit were being offset by credit from other financial intermediaries, it would be easier just to forget the whole  -16-    6/30-7/1/92  thing But that's not happening So, there are a lot of good reasons for discounting M2 but, putting it all together, one just has to have a nagging feeling that there is something here that is reflecting the underlying demand in the economy   Well, I think we're at or near a point where we're going to have to ease, and asymmetry is broadly consistent with that I'm sure all of us wish we had some stable beacon way off out there in the fog that we could latch onto and [unintelligible], but the fact is that there isn't that kind of beacon While we may not be very happy that we have to look at these current economic indicators, in fact that's all there is right now that we can look at And if the economy begins to weaken again, which I think already has started, it probably will need another shot of liquidity We ought not fight that; we ought to accept it and move with it and do the best we can I would not wait all that long I don't think we need a whole lot of evidence piled on top of what we have to reach the point for easing Also, if we get to that point, I wouldn't automatically think in terms of just a quarter point on the funds rate A quarter point may bring down the prime rate but it may not I don't think we need another present [such as the one] we gave the economy last December, but we could very well think in terms of 1/2 point on the discount rate and something comparable to that on the funds rate So, I think we're looking at an easing move, and I suspect we'll have one before we sit around this table again   Then, why don't we just say "The contemplated reserve conditions, although more uncertain than usual, are expected to be consistent" etc   I think "economic anemia" is how I would diagnose the Third District economy Retailing is listless; manufacturing growth seems to be slowing; bank lending is soft There is some activity in residential housing at the low end but not a lot in other areas Commercial real estate has several more years of adjustment ahead The District economy has settled into a slow-growth rut and the attitudes reflect that People seem to think things will improve at some point, but the economy is just in that slow-growth pattern  At the national level, it's very hard to find a sector that is going to act as an engine for a faster recovery It's certainly not in exports; it's not in investment; it's not in consumption; it's not in government I think we're just in a long, slow, corrective phase to the credit excesses and overbuilding of previous years Clearly, as all forecasters are aware, this corrective phase will give way to faster growth at some point, but I think we need a lot of humility in forecasting just when that is going to be My own gut feeling is that this corrective phase is going to last even longer than the Greenbook expects and that inflation correspondingly will be less than the Greenbook expects I think the role of monetary policy in this environment is quite limited; we can stretch out the corrective phase, but we can't eliminate the need for it If we get even slower growth than we have now or if growth appears to be heading negative, I think we would have little choice but to respond But our options are really not all that plentiful at the moment  -15-    8/18/92   "B" asymmetric   You ended on a note about staying alert to early signs of a run on the dollar But there really isn't much one can do in terms of contingency plans Essentially, we have interest rates to deal with that and we have foreign exchange operations to deal with that, and foreign exchange operations have shown that they're not effective in [countering] these kinds of massive movements in capital flows Domestic concerns would make an interest rate movement not a good course That exhausts my list What else is on that list that one can do if this kind of situation should materialize?   Mike, would you elaborate some on your comment about going from 3 percent to zero--and presumably we could [even] have a negative real [federal funds rate] It's an article of faith for anybody who has taken one or certainly two economics classes that lower interest rates are going to be a positive [for] growth, and I'm not quarreling with that orthodoxy But when one goes out and talks with people in the business community and consumers, one almost invariably runs into the view that lower rates are not the [solution] If I probe that, an answer I frequently get is "If I thought interest rates were going to stay down, then lower rates would help But if you lower interest rates now, I know you'll have to raise them a few months or a year down the road Just knowing that rates are going to be down for a short period doesn't help me because I'm going to have to finance whatever I'm going to buy with this [loan] for 5 or 8 or 10 years" I find increasingly that the view in the business community is at odds with what most of us have accepted as a good [economic] relationship I wonder if you could help me through some of that   Thanks   It also isn't true There are numerous examples of this Committee tightening within a month of an election, not just easing   Conditions in the Philadelphia District are mixed, but on the whole I think they've deteriorated some in recent weeks The major source of that deterioration has been in manufacturing Manufacturing was a source of some uplift to the District economy in the first part of the year, but in the last couple of months manufacturing activity has slowed and I think it has now become negative Despite continuing employment declines, which have been sharper than for the nation as a whole, particularly in New Jersey, retail sales have held up fairly well They are not great but they are probably running a little over a year ago In the construction area, I have nothing to add; nonresidential construction continues to decline and [sentiment] is very sour There is some improvement in residential construction  One of the additional changes, besides what is happening in manufacturing, is that while I would have summarized the condition of our banks until fairly recently as marginally bottoming out with some hints of improvement, I wouldn't be comfortable saying that now I think more of our banks are deteriorating than improving If we probe the bankers on that, we hear a number of reasons For one, they say that a number of small and medium-size businesses that had held on through this period of slow growth are running out of string and are just dying That is showing up in loan delinquencies and loan defaults Some of the banks are able to cover [the resulting losses] because of their spreads; and they've lowered their other costs But the deterioration is clearly showing up, and I think we're in for a period of some additional deterioration  -25-    10/6/92  Attitudes, I think, are worse than the underlying conditions The Mason-Dixon line makes a big difference! Our September meeting was about as pessimistic in terms of director attitudes as I have seen, reflecting this cumulation of slowness and not much prospect of getting better As with other Districts, inflation outside the health care industry and the regulated industries is largely a non-issue It is just hard to make price increases stick  As far as the national economy goes, its growth is basically stagnating I think we have about as much chance of getting some modest declines in growth as we have of modest increases There just are no sustainable drivers The employment-income-consumption dynamic is missing and it's very hard to see where we're going to get the thrust Despite that, I have found this current period more difficult in thinking through monetary policy I believe any of us sitting around the table, if we're at all objective, could come up with some good reasons to ease and some good reasons to stay where we are I come down on the side that some good would come from some additional easing So, I'm in the camp that thinks we ought to ease monetary policy--not that I think it will do great things but because I think at the margin it will be positive Also, it's important that the Fed as an institution be viewed as doing whatever we reasonably can to help the economy get out of the swamp Some additional easing in monetary policy would fall into the column of something we can do that is reasonable and I don't see a lot of downside risks in that   I think we all feel the ambivalence that you talked about; there clearly is uncertainty I find it difficult to believe that any of the new data that are going to come out in the next couple of weeks will make this any clearer Jerking the markets around--first they think we will ease and then they think we won't and then we try to come back and do it again--may have a cuteness to it or too much cuteness to it, but I think that undermines our credibility There are times when you step up to the batter's box and you try to get on base We've had a good discussion but I think this discussion is probably ahead of the data I would prefer to make the decision and do it--and not try to second guess this event or that event or this statistic or that statistic--by sticking to the fundamentals And I think the fundamentals call for lower rates   I think the distinction between the deliberative process and the timeliness is a useful distinction What we need to preserve is the deliberative process If we go to detailed minutes or videotapes or that sort of thing, we will basically destroy or greatly undermine the process that we have Timeliness, however, is an area on which I think we are on the weakest ground And there is a carryover affecting this issue of accountability For example, how many times has the Board of Governors been asked for detailed minutes of discount rate decisions? How many times have you had a request for a videotape of discount rate deliberations? That [doesn't happen] because you basically have a free discussion and you issue a statement and that's the end of it Those statements don't talk about the future; they simply talk about what decision has been made My sense is that if we could somehow speed up the process of releasing the information, we would convey a greater sense of openness and accountability; and doing so would enable us to make a stronger case for protecting the deliberative side of it Where I come out, bottom line, is that we really ought to fight and resist anything that cuts away or undermines the deliberative process But I for one am willing to talk about how we might improve the timeliness because I'd rather do that ourselves than have it forced upon us and in the process compromise the deliberative process   Suppose the Committee decided--it would be a rare, shocking event--to move the funds rate at a meeting Would we announce it that day or when would that be announced?   You go into the market at something like 1130 am, don't you?   So, it would work something like this When you go into the market, essentially simultaneously there would be an announcement made by the Fed that the Desk has now eased or tightened reserve conditions and we expect the federal funds rate to trade at a certain level That's the proposal?   I just wanted to make the point that I don't see this as an issue between federal funds rate targeting or aggregate targeting It seems to me we could have more timely release of both; I don't see that it's a tradeoff or that it in any way compromises the future decision that we might want to go to some aggregate [target]   Implicit in your comment is that we're going to have one Committee reply to Mr Gonzalez?   Economic activity in the mid-Atlantic states continues to be slow and uneven There is modest growth in retail sales and, while retailers are not overly optimistic, there is some hopeful sentiment about the holiday season Manufacturing appears to have picked up some during the past month after a couple months of downturn There is some growth in residential construction The nonresidential side is weak Loan data, when you cut through them, show some hint of better loan demand but the hard numbers grossly overstate the improvement Looking at our District loan growth, it shows an increase in C&I loans That's really because one bank in Delaware decided to book some loans in the District rather than someplace else If we factor that out, we really see a continuation of declining loan demand However, anecdotally one does get the feeling that loan officers feel a little better The real weakness is in the labor market For example, we've just done a survey of our manufacturers and, while it shows a pickup in activity, it continues to indicate that manufacturers are cutting their payrolls That seems to be true even in areas where we're seeing some improvement [in activity]  On the national side, I sense a better tone from the same data that other people read The issue is one of sustainability Is it for real or is it another false start? Basically, we don't know I think it's one of those times when we have to watch the data and keep an ear to the ground anecdotally   I mostly agree with where Governor Angell comes out on both these issues Looking back, there was a good case for easing [last] time but I think that time has passed for now To ease into a better tone of statistics would be counterproductive I think  -35-    11/17/92  the risks are more symmetrical than they have been for several months So, my preference for the short run is "B" symmetrical  On the long-term ranges, Wayne's logic was especially persuasive First of all, I really don't think we have a choice; we need to cut the range And we ought to be very careful to underscore the fact that this is a technical cut So, if we are going to do it, I would do a whole point rather than a half point It would give us some additional margin for error It's difficult enough to do and it's not going to cost much more to reduce it a whole point rather than a half point But I think it is important to emphasize the technical part  As to now versus February, I can't believe that a February climate would be better If you just want to look at it from a political point of view, we will have a new Administration with a new [fiscal] proposal, a new Congress, and lots of energy I think in that context it would be more difficult to do We've done a study, we have some good reasons, and we can explain our action in a letter In the letter I would emphasize the technical aspects; I would say we believe that this is a technical adjustment and that the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is consistent with growth without giving up on the inflation [goals] There is no foolproof way to do this; there are risks in doing it But I suspect that the political fallout would be less if we did it now rather than wait   Great confidence building!    12/22/92   That really clarifies it!   The District is generally better both in tone and activity but still is lagging the nation There's something about that Mason-Dixon line which seems to make things go faster below it and more slowly above it!   Right The shift in tone is more pronounced than in activity I agree with someone else's remark at the table that people are more optimistic relative to activity than they were before when in my view they were too pessimistic given the level of activity In terms of the sectors, manufacturing is up and retail sales are up--I don't think as much as in the Atlanta District, but our retailers are generally happy about the Christmas season We hear more comments about improvement in residential activity And bankers keep talking about improvement in loan demand--if not in loans booked at least those in the pipeline But having said that, there still are some clear areas of weakness Job growth is generally quite soft in the District The reports from heavy industry, notably steel, are quite weak I haven't really done this in any scientific way, but it seems to me that if we have a group of small and medium-sized business people and a group of big business people, the big business people don't share the same kind of better feelings that the smaller business people have The commercial real estate market is still quite flat I had a group of people from that industry in and I suggested it might take three years, perhaps five years, to get the District turned around, and I was told that that was considerably too optimistic They were talking well out into the decade  On the national scene, I think the key issue--and it has been underscored already--is whether we now have a self-feeding moderate recovery going I feel better that we do have one going at this point I would put the risks at about even on the up side and the down side The key continues to be employment growth If we get some moderate employment growth in the months ahead, then I think [the recovery] will be self-feeding If we do not--and I think that is potentially the weakest link--then we could still have some difficulty Also, the downward pressures on inflation rates continue It is difficult to make price increases stick The layoffs that are reported in the newspapers help keep wage increases down And I  -13-    12/22/92  suspect we may do better on the inflation front than the Greenbook suggests   "B" symmetric   Don, I respect your judgment in this a good bit and I think you've approached it in a reasonable way, given all the uncertainties I wonder, however, if you were debating with yourself and making the case that M2 might grow several percentage points higher than you estimate, how would you go about making that case?   Right   Thank you   I buy into your recommendation on this Given where we are, I think it's the least harmful way to deal with it I would stress the technical side I'd like to comment on the broader issues that have come up having to do with our explanation of the problems of M2 I think the velocity approach is a loser I don't think it has gotten us anywhere I view our strength as an institution as a real world strength that we understand markets, that we have a feel for these, and that we understand institutions So I would explain this in English rather than econometrics And I think it has to do with long-term and short-term rates and the diminishing role of banks in the financial flows of the economy That to me is the way to do it And I would hope that you can do that in your testimony and maybe even elaborate with an appendix I would be somewhat wary, however, of dropping M2 anytime soon even if we thought it seriously flawed A better approach is to continue to have M2 but to get people used to an M2-A or an M2-B and to have several of these that we can look at over time Then, as time goes on and people get used to these, M2-A and M2-B can become M2; but I think we have to get people used to the change If we make definitional changes too dramatically without these kinds of parallel alternatives, I think we will run into some real problems We can make this case better than we have made it and we can make it in a real world sense We can use something else that the eyes can look at and then down the road we can make the definitional change and the shift [to a new M2 measure] I believe it can be handled, and I think we ought to get on with it   How sensitive do you believe job growth is to GDP growth? Suppose we ended up with GDP growth closer to 4 percent than 3 percent How do you think that would translate into job growth?   Numbers   That's my question We see these structural adjustments by the larger firms However, in talking to people in smaller businesses one gets the impression that there really is a reluctance to add people, for obvious reasons, but that if their volume picked up they more or less would be forced into it   My sense is that the District continues to move forward, but I don't think I've graduated up to the term "moderate;" I'd keep it at "modest" I think we're still lagging the nation Manufacturing has been a relatively bright spot The retailers, including the auto dealers, have been pleasantly surprised by how well sales have been going I'm increasingly impressed, however, by how deep the hole is in commercial real estate construction The more I talk to people in that area, the more I think we may have a problem for much of the rest of the decade in terms of getting caught up there With regard to attitudes, it's not so much that there is an improvement in attitudes but a lack of complaining about what's bad So, underneath, I think there is--   That's improvement It's not an overt statement of improvement, but I do take heart in that In fact, as one talks to groups of people, they want to talk about things other than the economy and monetary policy They would rather complain about unemployment compensation, medical costs, and those sort of things I take that as a rather positive change in attitudes I am impressed, though, by the variation in economic activity around a relatively a small District; 75 miles in several directions can make quite a difference New Jersey, for example, continues to operate at low levels, and the expectations there are not high at all Pennsylvania seems to mirror the nation more and Delaware continues to do better I do sense that people have made the adjustment toward the notion that we're in for a number of years of slower growth and that the decade of the '80s is not likely to repeat itself  I don't sense any price pressures coming Someone made the comment that it's almost a macho thing [for firms] to say they are going to hold employment down; I think that attitude is very strong Lending, outside the consumer area, [particularly] business lending, continues to be fairly weak I still hear comments that there's some action in the pipeline but it's turning out to be a very long pipeline It's not coming out the end of the pipeline to the point where we actually see the loans on the books  Despite that somewhat less optimistic view at the District level, my sense is that we will do better in terms of growth at the national level [My view stems] not so much from pointing at this sector or that sector I just have a sense from talking to people with national businesses and looking at the national indicators that    2/2-3/93  this national recovery may be taking better hold So my sense is that if we err on GDP growth, it's going to be 3 percent plus rather than 3 percent minus I also have the feeling that if we are wrong on the inflation side, its performance may be better I think we have some disinflation momentum going here that we may be missing What lies beyond in '94 and '95 could be a different story, but I suspect that inflation in '93 will turn out to be better than the numbers in the Greenbook Having said all that, if I were a professional forecaster, I probably wouldn't be all that far from the Board staff's forecast But I'm not a professional forecaster; I can wing it a little, not that the staff wings it   "B" symmetric   Modest growth in the District continues While there is a lot of caution and we still lag the nation, there are signs of a somewhat better underlying tone Commercial and industrial loan demand is rising modestly, and I'm hearing more reports from bankers that small and mid-size businesses are using their credit lines more  -12-    3/23/93  than in recent months They tend to want to go ahead and get the projects under way whereas several months ago that was not the case Manufacturing, which had slowed earlier in the [quarter], may have picked up some later, judging from rail shipments and other anecdotal information Some executives in sheet steel think they should be able to make more price hikes stick given the strength in their order books And that's the first indication of that sort of thing I've heard in a long time Hiring is still sluggish, particularly in New Jersey, but one does hear more reports of firms adding workers They're adding them even if they're adding them cautiously In real estate, residential sales were up before the snow storm, as was the demand for industrial space The office market continues to be quite weak and likely will be for a long time I hear very little talk these days that the expansion will grind to a halt; and that's a different tone than was there several months ago But there still is a lot of caution about just how fast the expansion will proceed  Turning to the nation, the national profile as laid out in the Greenbook looks about right to me I continue to think that job growth is the key indicator as far as the durability of the expansion goes Job growth I think is both an indicator of business confidence and it's a necessary ingredient in building consumer confidence So while in theory we can have an expansion without job growth, I think in reality it's a critical ingredient The recent price numbers strike me more as an aberration than as signalling a new round of inflationary pressures I think the lack of robustness in the US economy plus really quite favorable unit labor costs and weaknesses in a number of other industrial countries argue for a continuation of subdued rather than increasing inflationary pressures   I think we have moderate, not robust, growth We still have structural drags on the economy in the financial system; we have slack in labor markets and subdued labor costs; and we're facing a restrictive fiscal policy While we need to be vigilant on inflation and avoid the mistakes of the past, we also need to look at the fundamentals when statistics are mixed And I think the fundamentals still point toward an outlook of moderate growth and slowly declining unemployment and a still fairly persuasive case that inflationary pressures are likely to be held in check When I add all these up, I come out with a constant monetary policy at this point, and I have a strong preference for keeping an even hand regarding what our next move might be   The alternative is fine with me   In the context of what the market views as good news and bad news and how it might move the market, how would the market react to a tightening of Fed policy in the near term?   Most of the business people I talk to feel deprived in terms of price increases They feel they are owed price hikes if only they could make them stick If you look at it from an individual business person's point of view, their sales growth for the most part has been slow, competition has been tough, they have cut costs and lowered their break-even point, and they still feel very squeezed So it's not surprising that they would jump at whatever opportunity they can to raise prices, whether it's a streak of good orders or a weaker dollar and foreign competition that isn't quite as tough or an attempt to get ahead of the regulatory or tax changes It's not surprising that that is happening and that that's the way they feel The question is whether it is broadly sustainable or cumulative, and I don't think any of us really knows But my hunch is that it's not, given the generally sluggish economy, the underlying competitive situation, plus what is going on in money and credit  -23-    5/18/93  Looking at the District economy, growth is very modest, very modest indeed Retail sales are going up negligibly Industrial production, while still advancing, seems to be advancing at a decreasing rate We have sluggish loan demand, or flat loan demand really, and slow job growth And, as has been mentioned almost by everybody, there is slipping confidence and building anxiety in national leadership and all the uncertainty about taxes Every day in the paper some other tax that might [be enacted] is mentioned, and that has really pulled the rug out from any kind of increases in spending There is just a strong desire to hold tight and steady and to put on hold everything that one can  My sense on the national economy is that, yes, we are going to get somewhat more inflation than we thought earlier this year And I think we're going to get somewhat less growth But my basic conclusion is that at this point it's more a matter of degree rather than a fundamental shift   The purpose of an asymmetric directive is to give the sense of the Committee to move in that direction And if we're going to meet frequently, then the notion of tilting it one way or the other seems to me to lose some of its merit   If it's too important a decision to move without making sure you have the Committee's agreement, then you can decide it then We don't need to bias it   The cost of an asymmetric directive, I think, is not insignificant If, for example, this turns out to be an inflation bubble--if it turns out not to be a problem and goes away--but the real sector because of all the uncertainty about tax policy and so forth turns out to be a good bit weaker than we [anticipate], we're going to look pretty trigger happy So I think there is a cost involved I don't know if it's going to come out that way but we have a very uncertain environment The situation can go either way both on the inflation front and on the real growth front I think we need to watch it very closely and we need to show that we have an open mind as to which direction policy is going to go If circumstances warrant a tighter policy, then let's tighten I think deeds, not words, speak to expectations I just don't see that asymmetry buys us very much There can be a plus to it, but there can be a negative to it And I don't think we need to take the chance We're going to meet frequently   What are the data gathering costs involved with having something like M2+ [unintelligible]   In these joint discussions with the Treasury, which side do you think had more enthusiasm for the intervention?   And was there some attempt within the Administration to try to reduce all those voices out there talking about the yen?   In general I support the notion of putting this in the realm of a technical adjustment But I would like to pursue a couple of aspects of that As I understand it, what you're going to say is--and these are my words, not yours--that the relationship between M2 and the economy has broken down We know that it has broken down in the direction of higher velocity; that is, we know something, but we don't know a lot Point one is that it seems to me one has to know more to make a change than to keep something the same, so it's a matter of judgment as to whether we know enough to make that change The second point is that you say that we're forecasting M2 but we're not targeting M2 So, how do you then answer the question You know enough to lower [the range for] it and you know enough to forecast it, but it is a monetary aggregate and, as a central bank, can't you influence it at all? And if you can influence it at all, why don't you try? So why doesn't this forecast have some element of target to it? I think what you're really saying is that we're just forecasting it; we're not trying to target it But it seems to me we're in a grey area here where we know enough to do what we're doing but we don't know enough to influence it  -54-    7/6-7/93   Well, it seems to me you're going to have to do more explaining and answer more questions--there's nothing wrong with that--if we make a change, especially for this year, than if we don't I agree it's a close call and you're the one who has to [testify] And it's a close enough call--   Well, it's your head, so where do you want it?   Well, this is much ado about little I came to the meeting with a slight preference for keeping the ranges unchanged on the grounds that we have to know more to change something than to leave it alone But it's only a slight preference and I can easily go with II or I However, if we're going to change one, it would be better to change both If we're going to draw attention to it and explain it on technical grounds, presumably we know more about the next six months than we know about next year, particularly since we think we're going to have more M2 growth next year than this year So, I would prefer either to stay the same or make the change for both years   Before you do, may I ask a question? I think that your analysis of the Wall Street Journal article is conceivable and believable But when I read on the screen and when CNBC says that we had a unanimous vote and then an hour and a half later it says no it was not unanimous but 10 to 2, I'd say they need to have more than IQ to get that   Right   Are you saying that you believe somebody like David Wessel can write that article and not talk to anybody in this room after the FOMC meeting or a week before?   I have a feeling that if everybody in this room followed the basic rule of not talking to a reporter one week before or after an FOMC meeting--or in the case of the Humphrey-Hawkins meetings until after the testimony--we'd make it pretty tough on people like David Wessel to write a story like that And I know we wouldn't have a CNBC problem   With regard to this analysis that you did on inflation and what you had at least in the written report of the briefing to the Board last Friday The speed effects as I interpret them really say we have to look not just at static comparisons of unemployment versus inflation but also the kinds of changes that are being made If you look back over the post-World War II period, there has been a tendency over those years for inflation, when it escalates, to escalate from cycle to cycle We've also had examples in the 1950s and again in the 1980s of disinflation from cycle to cycle so that on the upside of these cycles we end up with peaks in the later cycle being higher than the previous cycle The same [is true] for the floors; when inflation de-escalates, we make progress from cycle to cycle One question is whether that is just a variation of the so- called speed effect If there is something to this speed effect or the cycle-to-cycle kind of phenomenon, should it be so strange that as cycles mature there ought to be times during those cycles when we make more progress against inflation where things flatten out? If you look at it from cycle to cycle, what we want to do is to keep inflation from escalating so that in a subsequent cycle we can keep bringing the rate of inflation down My question is How much have you looked at this cycle-to-cycle phenomenon? It does strike me that it is part of this dynamic or speed approach to looking at inflation  -10-    7/6-7/93   The District economy continues to be mixed I'm not sure that overall it is deteriorating sharply, but its growth has been slower than the nation's all along And while the gap may be narrowing some, that's not so much because we're picking up but because the rest of the nation's economy seems to be coming to meet us We have seen the same quite noticeable deterioration in the manufacturing sector that Bob Forrestal pointed to and it is continuing into this month That's affecting employment plans and has cut significantly into the capital spending plans of the manufacturers in our region While manufacturing has been showing this noticeable weakening, the retailers seem to have been doing better--certainly the second quarter was better than the first quarter--although in recent weeks that seems to have flattened out some Nonetheless, I think the tone in retailing is better The residential construction people are feeling better Not only are sales of new homes moving but there also is new residential construction The nonresidential area continues to be a big drag and will be, I think, for a number of years  One of the areas that has been a mainstay of strength in the Third District, particularly the greater Philadelphia area, has been the health care industry And that is changing Where that has been a plus in employment gains, I think we are going to see that turn negative The hospitals, which had been adding people, have made a number of cutbacks; and some of our hospitals are laying off people In terms of defense, I think the best way to describe it is that the District economy expected to be hit by a cannon ball and it's just a shotgun blast and not a cannon ball, so it feels better because at least it's not as bad as expected Overall, employment has increased but not a great deal The financial institutions are out there trying to drum up business They report some uptick in lending activity, but it's still rather flat on the whole As for inflation, there just do not seem to be upward price pressures Wage rate increases, however, do continue higher than one might expect in this kind of market, at around 4 percent or so, I'd say, rather than decelerating  As far as the nation goes, our forecast is somewhat higher than the Greenbook's in this slow-to-moderate growth range that I think we all see Nonetheless, I think the uncertainties that are out there do put the risks on the down side There are these macro risks that we all talk about, the budget package In some ways I think the business community is more concerned about health care reform than the immediate tax increases But for the individual, at the more micro level, the uncertainty instead of abating, if anything, is increasing  -29-    7/6-7/93  I think people are as much if not more concerned about their own jobs, their own companies, their own futures; and they sense that the margin for error is not very great We are in one of those situations where the unexpected shock--all shocks by definition are unexpected because we don't know what they will be--[would be troublesome] I don't think we can take a very big one at this point  On the inflation side, I think we can continue to make some progress but we are at the point in the cycle where the gains on inflation are just not going to come as easily as they did earlier My own sense is that we have a way to go in terms of secular gains, and I think we could continue to get inflation down on a secular basis But we ought not to deceive ourselves The gains are going to be very tough as this cycle wears on   I think the case for a steady policy is a strong one, and you've laid it out On the issue of symmetry or asymmetry, if one looked just to the decision today without regard to what happened in the current [intermeeting] period, I think one could make an intellectual case for symmetry But having moved to asymmetry, I think the balance of the evidence says we ought to stay where we are with the asymmetry   The District economy continues to muddle along I could almost ditto my comments of a month or so ago The pattern is essentially the same sluggish manufacturing, soft retail sales, some improvement in residential construction, nonresidential in a deep hole, and slow employment growth This attitude of not adding workers if we don't have to is very strong Wage increases are probably in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range; that is what one hears from most companies in the area  On the national level, I think the moderate growth theme is the right one; 2-1/2 percent is the number if one wants to pinpoint it It's hard to see major risks that would cause a significant break-out on the up side Likewise, it's hard to see a break-out on the down side that would cause a cumulative downturn Nonetheless, we have had this pattern, as Bob Forrestal just pointed out, of starting out the year more optimistically and then scaling down our growth forecasts I think there is a business attitude that if you have a good quarter, you take it but you don't think it's going to continue at that pace; and if you have a bad quarter, you say well, maybe we ought to scale down the forecast While we're not talking about major risks on either side, I suspect that if we're wrong we may have somewhat more sluggish economic growth On inflation I think the numbers that we are seeing now do understate the underlying rate of inflation just as the numbers earlier in the year overstated it My sense is that we're not likely to see an acceleration of inflation from the underlying fundamentals just as I doubt that we'll see much of a deceleration I think we just are kind of stuck where we are with inflation So, it's pretty much a no change, unexciting, and not particularly satisfying outlook   I support "B" symmetric   The Philadelphia region has improved a little but it continues to grow modestly and still, I think, lags the nation Employment growth is sluggish and attitudes remain cautious, neither optimistic nor pessimistic Where there has been some improvement is in the manufacturing sector, which has been a major drag on the economy It's not that it's going up so much; it's that it has tended to stabilize after several months of decline Also, New Jersey, which has been one of the hardest hit states in the country, appears to be improving The weakest sector there was construction, and both residential and nonresidential are showing some signs of growth  -17-    9/23/93  although from very low levels Also, New Jersey had a good tourism summer and that has been a positive More generally, I'm picking up the same kinds of vibrations that Si is in the commercial real estate market That investment in real estate is beginning to look relatively attractive because other alternatives aren't so good It has been a long time since I've heard the term REIT in our board room but I'm now hearing it again, which isn't all good news We went through the REIT problems of 20 years or so ago But this noise we hear about some improvement in commercial real estate is not for this year or next year so much as later in the decade  District bankers report weak commercial loan demand However, when we pursue that a little more, they are beginning to wonder how they will finance a pickup in loan demand when it comes And that's a new kind of attitude They're worried about the runoff they've seen in deposits and whether they can get enough deposits back to fund what they think someday will be an upturn in loan demand  On the national economy, I think the fundamentals are about the same and will likely continue to be the same moderate growth, subdued inflationary pressures, employment growth insufficient to cause a significant drop in unemployment, and cautious attitudes I don't believe there's very much that monetary policy can do to alter that outlook even if we wanted to But I think the respite from criticism that we've had in recent months is likely to come to an end Impatience is going to be our greatest foe in the next few months And I suspect that we will increasingly have to defend a no change policy as the restlessness over this rather disappointing employment growth continues to build   It certainly does in Philadelphia   Larry, I think those observations are especially insightful I wonder if you wouldn't mind just dictating some of those and passing them out   Well, maybe it could come from that Also, some of that ought to be in your public remarks at the appropriate time I think those are things that need to be said   "B" symmetric   I'm not sure who will answer this I understand that if we move to a lightly edited transcript, going back, then the unedited transcript and the electronic recordings could be dispensed with under the Archivist's preliminary judgment Is that correct?   Going forward would that same policy then hold for a memorandum of discussion?   And what is the logic of the distinction between going forward and going back?   I see   I see Thank you   No, I don't have any comment   I have just a couple of general points We've talked a lot about the deliberative process this morning and how important it is for the quality of the decisionmaking process I think it's important to underscore that this deliberative process evolved over a long period of time; it was not made in a day or a meeting or one generation of Open Market Committee people And one can undermine that and weaken that process much more quickly than it took us to get it to the point where it is So, we all have to look not just at our short-run issues but also at this longer-run view of our effectiveness  The second general point is that the deliberative process is not unique to the Federal Reserve The Executive Branch and other independent agencies have to have an effective deliberative process for every major public policy decision I make this general statement, and I'm sure others are more factually aware of it, but I suspect that the kinds of things we are talking about today if they were applied to the rest of the public policy decisionmaking units in this city throughout the Executive Branch would give them a great deal of trouble also in carrying out the kinds of quality decisions that they have to make I think one can make the case that central banking is different, but we don't want to be different on the side that we have less of an environment to be deliberative than [others making] public policy And I think it would be helpful to us if we compared the practices elsewhere in Washington to our own; we may not be as much of an outlier as we think we are And the way that we are moving may in fact result in our short-changing our ability to deliberate compared to other agencies  Having said that, we have to deal with the [issues at] hand In general what you proposed, Mr Chairman, makes sense to me I think going back five years with a lightly edited transcript is the way to go I would not go back and ask everybody who has been a part of this to sign off That would be a time-consuming and probably not very effective process The document ought to say that the staff did it and used their best judgment; there may be errors in it, but here it is And we ought to move on releasing these as quickly as we can, given the resources  Going forward, again I think your general proposition makes sense Nevertheless, when I went back for the first time in a long time and actually reread parts of a Memorandum of Discussion and then compared it to the lightly edited transcript, there was not a great deal of difference My recollection of the Memoranda of Discussion was that they were somewhat shorter and somewhat more summarized, but after just going back and reading one it seems to me there isn't a lot of difference And while I can support the Memoranda of Discussion going forward, since a lot of our problem is one of perception--and we almost surely will have to defend this in a FOIA suit at some time in the future--I wonder if we ought to err marginally on the side of more openness So I could easily accept, and in fact have a marginal preference for, going with an edited transcript instead of the Memorandum of Discussion going forward But I don't feel that  -30-    11/16/93  strongly about it and I can certainly accept your proposition if that's the majority view of the Committee  One other point This is not the time to consider it, but going forward I think this Committee ought to keep a very open mind about the kinds of minutes that we now put out--whether they ought to be enhanced and how they could be enhanced I also think we ought to keep an open mind about the schedule on which we formally release our decisions   My first choice is light editing without annotation but with a note on the [cover] page that says this was done by the staff and it may or may not be accurate My second choice would be a raw transcript with some annotation   Five, first choice; three, second   Edited transcript first choice; MOD second choice   The deliberative process at work here!   We have names on the vote  SPEAKER(?) We don't have views on the vote, though   Thanksgiving Day We're all free [Laughter]   So move   Let me be briefer than usual in light of the hour Although the Philadelphia District continues to lag the nation, the improved trends that I noted at the last meeting continue largely for the same reasons that we're seeing nationally Manufacturing is stronger; the orders there are better Residential construction is  -75-    11/16/93  stronger And the retailers, who usually are never happy, seem less unhappy; and I think that's a positive sign for the District Attitudes are still cautious largely because of the employment situation--employment growth is flat to very modest--although I do sense that people seem to be more receptive to good news than they did a few months ago  On the national scene, we have a sawtooth pattern that has prevailed in this recovery now for several years When we see a blip upward, as we're seeing now--4 percent growth seems likely in the current quarter--there's a tendency to expect that that may continue, just as when things soften it tends to go down My sense is that we are still largely locked into a 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth pattern overall with this sawtooth trend line that we see, largely I think because of the slow employment growth And my sense is that what will keep the economy from growing much faster than that is that the [strength in] consumption, which has [supplied] a big upward push, is not sustainable [without] faster income growth, and I doubt that we'll see the faster income growth that would be necessary So, I think we do have a stronger second half but I don't expect that trend to continue; next year I think we'll be back into the 2-1/2 to 3 percent [growth] area On inflation I might just echo what has been said There just is no sense out there that there's an inflationary problem or that prices are rising; it's quite to the contrary I might also say that the subject of interest rates is a non-topic   "B" symmetric   On balance I support your recommendation   I've already commented   No [Unintelligible]   It made a great impression! [Laughter]   Well, if we plan to spend the weekend, Don, I'd appreciate knowing!  END OF MEETING       Well, the same upward momentum is apparent in the Middle Atlantic states as well We've been a region that has lagged the nation; I think that is still true, although clearly attitudes and aggregate demand are stronger We're seeing it in many parts of the District and we're seeing it across industries, most notably in manufacturing The same is true in retailing and in residential construction, although we still have problems in the nonresidential side Having said that, there is still a tentativeness that is present not only in the way business people are looking ahead --in some respects they are having trouble believing things are improving because it has been a tough period--but also in their actions We are not seeing the kinds of increases in employment that appear to be the case in other Districts And while I think this  -16-    12/21/93  improved attitude has more substance than what we saw a year ago, it is still going to need some more nourishing for it to take hold and produce this cumulative forward momentum that we need for a really strong economy In terms of pricing, I keep hearing over and over how difficult it is to raise prices and that the only way to protect margins is still on the cost side There's a lot of pressure on suppliers, and it's very difficult to make price increases stick  As for the implications for the national economy, I don't think we know the answer to the bottom line question How similar is this to a year ago and how much of a takeoff are we really seeing in the economy? I think one can make a fairly good case on either side of that My sense is that we will not see the kind of weakness that we saw a year ago I think there is more to this [improvement] going forward But it's just too early to tell, and we ought not be goaded into a tightening that some of our hawkish friends might urge on us Nor should we be timid; we need to be willing to tighten when the time comes I think this is not the time There's still enough uncertainty I would call this a period of watchful waiting; I'd be prepared to do what we need to do but not be precipitous about it   I think the days of this degree of accommodation are numbered It's likely to be sooner rather than later that we'll have to reduce the level of accommodation I do think, however, that we're in a period of wait-and-see And when we do move, I believe that this Committee should vote explicitly to make that decision because it's so important And for that reason I think we ought to have a symmetrical directive and face up to the issue squarely when the time comes and everybody will be on the record as saying "This is what we're going to do"   I don't have any questions on this   I'd declare victory on the M2 and M3 ranges, and I don't have any feelings about debt at this point And we're not ready for an extended forecast beyond the next year   Normally in an economic expansion, developments in the real sector are mirrored at least to some extent in the financial side And this report is relatively thin on the financial side Yet, we tend to explain rising interest rates in an expansion by rising demand for credit, loan demand, and that sort of thing Is the lack of very much on the financial side simply a continuation of all the dislocations and distortions that we find there, or is this going to be an expansion without very much of an increase in commercial loan demand, or what is the complication?   The tone in the District is positive, and I would say tentatively optimistic, going out for the balance of the year Except for commercial real estate, most sectors and areas of the District are growing, and the growth appears to be self-feeding, although the District is still growing more slowly than the nation as a whole One of the indicators I use is how vociferously business people complain I was visiting with a group of 20 or 25 business people in central Pennsylvania a couple of weeks ago and didn't hear any complaints It was hard to keep them focused on talking about the economy There is a sense that an increase in interest rates is almost a foregone conclusion, all of which I interpret to mean that things are going well and they just don't want to talk about it very much It's that Pennsylvania Dutch reticence, I think, on their part There still is a reluctance to hire, but hiring is going on nonetheless in many parts of the District I, too, have picked up a hint of perhaps a little more in the way of price increases-- particularly in prices paid by business firms It's not a lot, but there wasn't much of a hint a few months ago  As for the nation as a whole, I think the momentum of last year has spilled over I don't think the type of slowdown we saw a year ago is very likely The 3 percent growth rate or thereabouts seems about right My sense is that if there is any asymmetry in terms of the risks to the forecast, it is probably that the economy may grow faster rather than slower than that 3 percent I have no real quarrel with the rest of the staff's forecast   It's confidential now   I'm supportive of what you want to do I think this is one of those special times, and I think we have to be careful that we don't become captive to our own procedures when we are called upon to do something There is a precedent for our making these kinds of announcements for special occasions They don't happen very often, but I believe this is one of those times While clearly the precedent is there, and we'd all be naive to think that this doesn't tilt the scales in that direction, there is also a risk in not disclosing tomorrow If there were a premature leak or any confusion or misunderstanding about any action taken tomorrow, it seems to me that that would be far more costly than whatever the precedential risk is in going forward with this as you suggest I agree with you that it ought to be your statement as the Chairman rather than an announcement of the Committee I sympathize with your desire to make it short However, I think it is good to get the right focus on this, and I liked the way you ended your testimony on Monday about putting this in the context of being pro sustainable growth rather than fostering this notion that we are against growth I would urge you in the statement to hark back to your testimony on Monday; I have forgotten the precise wording in the last sentence or two in the last paragraph but I thought that captured the essence of what we're doing very well At the risk of this statement being a little longer than you may want, I'd just put in that last paragraph--or the last couple of sentences-- from your testimony   Right What if we put out part of the year?  SPEAKER(?) The first six months?   Why is it that life can never be simple?   "Chairman Greenspan said today"   If it doesn't work, the Committee could fire the Chairman!   Why don't you put it out at 1100 am or something like that? Is 1130 am when you conduct your operations?   If you did it by 11 am--   Jam and hamburgers? Hopefully not!  [Meeting recessed]  -40-    2/3-4/94  February 4, 1994--Morning Session   How are financial markets interpreting that?   As far as the economy goes, this is as good as it gets in terms of convincing evidence to move There always are uncertainties; there always are reasons why we shouldn't make a change But what I see is a self-feeding expansion and I think capacity and price pressures are not all that far away So, as far as the economy goes, I think we need to move On the credibility side, there's a time to talk, a time for speculation, and a time to act We've talked, we've had speculation, and I think now is the time to act  I came into this meeting somewhat undecided between a 1/2 and a 1/4 point rate increase I think there are some good reasons for a 1/2 point move It is more difficult to tighten than to ease, at least it has been historically So there is an advantage to getting the job done with fewer moves rather than more Historically, there is also the tendency to get behind the curve rather than stay ahead of it And I think a larger move does compensate for that risk On the other hand, I do think that a 1/2 point move may be just too strong at this point There is a risk that we could appear too eager I've seen this Committee operate in the 1970s; I've seen it operate in the 1980s and the 1990s; frankly, my confidence in our willingness and ability to move promptly, to move as needed, is high enough that I think that a 1/4 point move makes sense I also buy the notion that it is important for the market to anticipate further moves I think we need to be forthcoming when that is called for So, while history and the risks do weigh heavily on my mind, on balance I come out in favor of a 1/4 point move and I support the symmetrical directive I think we really need full Committee support on this action; and to reiterate my point of yesterday, I think we ought to make this announcement sometime before Joan Lovett would normally go into the market today   What are the consequences of not approving this request?   Well, there are these two issues One is the wisdom of swaps in general and how well they've been used Then there is the question of whether Mexico ought to be treated differently The $6 billion is in line with trade flows and various other economic ways of measuring these things So really it's the second issue of whether Mexico should be treated differently; I think we are not really talking about the wisdom of the overall swap arrangements today So then my specific question is--and I don't think you really answered the question, Ted--what are the consequences of treating Mexico differently? What are the consequences of nonapproval? I'm not clear in my own mind what those consequences are I don't come to these discussions on intervention and foreign exchange markets and swaps with any ideological baggage I just want to know what the practical implications are of our actions or lack of action   What are the consequences of something less than $6 billion?   All right   So this is really the price of admission to a bigger show?   Well, this was a very wise subcommittee and I want to concur with its recommendations [Laughter]   The tenor of the Third District's economy has changed during the last several months Economic growth now resembles the type of growth typical of an expansion rather than the lackluster performance that we have been experiencing in the mid-Atlantic region Manufacturing is clearly strong in the District, with much of the strength of the fourth quarter carrying over into the first quarter, and expectations seem very positive for the remainder of the year New orders are up; steel and auto production schedules are strong One major railroader told me that his company is running flat out and adding locomotives and crews as fast as possible And for the first time I heard from a sheet steel maker that they plan a significant increase in their inventories because they are concerned about the reliability of deliveries  Residential real estate sales remain strong and industrial properties are selling well Although commercial real estate remains soft in Philadelphia, it has become very strong in the suburbs, with a noticeable improvement in south Jersey I would say that strength is coming on sooner than most of us had thought One of the major real estate firms told me that they are hiring additional commercial real estate agents and not all that long ago they were laying them off and didn't expect to be hiring them back for some time And there is sufficient demand to warrant new commercial construction in the suburbs starting, I would say, within the next year or two  As for retail sales, autos and other big ticket items are selling well Where there is still a note of caution is with smaller retailers and smaller items They clearly have been hurt by weather Their feeling is that their sales will pick up, but there is a natural worry because their expenses have been continuing and they haven't been selling They feel pretty good, but they'll feel better when the customers start coming back in when the snow melts  Labor markets clearly have strengthened in the District I see more help wanted signs in retail stores than I've seen for a while But there are few, if any, signs of wage pressures developing On the price side, I have not seen any general price pressures  -20-    3/22/94  although most business people tell me that the demand is strengthening to the point now that they think there may be some opportunities for price increases in the next few months They always talk about how long it has been since they've had a price increase and their optimism for getting one to stick, I think, has increased One can sort of see it in their eyes!  As far as the national economy goes, there are always uncertainties in these kinds of forecasts There have been very few meetings where somebody has said, here it is, the economy is either going to go down or up and there isn't any doubt about it There are always risks I think our job is to assess those risks My sense is that the greater risk to sustainable growth is too much strength rather than too little demand I feel that way for several reasons The most important thing in any economic expansion is not pinpointing this item or that item, it's the cumulative momentum that carries us from one quarter to the next And I think that momentum is very well entrenched We also have a highly stimulative monetary policy Most of the drags to demand that we have been trying to get over in recent years are largely behind us And there seems to be an attitudinal change now which looks at sales and other data as a sign that things are going to get better rather than worse I think that psychology is an important part of this momentum   Well, I think the case for a less accommodative policy today is quite persuasive We did press hard on the monetary accelerator to get the economy moving, and now as the economy approaches cruising speed we have to ease off the accelerator to avoid having to slam on the brakes down the road The real issue--the major issue as you point out, Mr Chairman--is how much to move I prefer a 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate compared to 1/4 because I think we have some distance to go to get to a neutral policy, and it's better to cover that distance earlier rather than later Also, I think a 1/4 point increase is so small, given where the economy is, that it will set off almost immediate speculation about the next move So we will just repeat what we have gone through in recent weeks I think a more decisive 1/2 point increase can reduce uncertainty, especially if accompanied by an appropriate announcement  Now, there are always risks to decisive action One risk is that we might be overestimating the strength of the economy, and a less accommodative monetary policy might damp its growth too much Given the underlying strength that we see, that appears to me to be a small risk, and the best protection against that kind of risk is a willingness on our part to reverse course if need be I think the greater risk is that we may have gone too slowly in raising rates for  -45-    3/22/94  this stage of the economic recovery Historically, waiting too long to adjust rates has been a greater risk, and I think it's the one that we need to be especially sensitive to in this current environment I am sensitive to the financial risks that you point out, but I must say that in one form or another that has been the argument around the table for not moving in the past when we should have moved It also may be that this point is significantly different from other points historically, but my guess is that if we push on this economy, we will get inflation and we will end the growth So one can come up with lots of arguments, some subtle, some not I think the important thing is to stick to the basics and go to the heart of the matter We have an economy that is telling us that we need a less accommodative monetary policy, and in my view we ought to move in that direction decisively It's surprising , but when people do things decisively, they end up getting better results than if they try to outsmart themselves and consider all the angles in the curve So, I think we ought to go to the heart of the matter   There has been a fair amount of discussion about capacity--how much of it we have left before we have inflationary pressures--and about the growth potential of the economy Most of    5/17/94  these estimates, particularly the growth potential, can change with seemingly small changes in assumptions, like labor force participation rates, productivity increases, and that sort of thing I presume that you are thinking of a capacity growth rate of maybe 2-1/2 percent or maybe 2-1/2 to 3 percent Do you have a view as to whether we're likely to be on the high end of a range like that or on the low end, given the recent trends in labor participation and what appears to be fairly strong capital spending, especially equipment spending?   The District continues clearly to be a part of the Northeast--its growth trend is positive but somewhat slower than the nation Manufacturing continues to grow, but the pace of growth has flattened out some The bookings for the future also have gone up rather substantially but that too seems to be flattening out I suspect it may have to do with some capacity constraints A major railroader in our District reports what others have said in the railroad business they're operating flat out They can't get cars fast enough to ship the goods Residential construction has made a good-sized rebound, although I think some of that is clearly seasonal Once that part is out, I think we will have moderate growth Nonresidential construction is mixed Some areas are still dead and likely to be that way for some time Other areas are beginning to show some signs that there will be additional construction, probably more so next year than this year Retail sales clearly have picked up The automobile business is strong, and it's clearly a seller's market at this point except for a few lines Bankers, who heretofore have not seen a whole lot of growth in commercial lending, are now reporting modestly rising demand Business loans, both to finance inventory accumulation as well as capital equipment, and consumer and real estate lending continue to pick up In our labor markets the rate of unemployment for the District as a whole is about the same as for the nation, although it varies quite widely around a relatively small District However, the growth in new jobs has been on the sluggish side despite the improvement in the economy Consequently, wage pressures are well contained On the price side, there clearly  -20-    5/17/94  is a desire and a wish to raise some prices, but I'm still hearing mostly that it's very difficult to make those increases stick  As far as the national economy goes, I don't have a lot to add I think at this point in an expansion the risks tend to be for faster growth rather than slower growth Perhaps it's just my own District and the influence that that has, but my sense is that the odds pretty strongly favor moderate growth and that there is not a lot more upside risk to the economy than downside risk  On monetary policy, because the District is improving but not as fast as the nation, the increasing interest rates and our actions have been more justifiable on a national basis than a District basis I am running into what has just been echoed across the table Do what you have to do and get it out of the way so that we can get this uncertainty behind us   I support a 1/2 point increase, the symmetric directive, and I like the draft statement the way it is   How much discretion did you have here working with the Treasury in terms of the timing of the intervention?   And the immediate response of market participants was to sell dollars?   Thank you   I just wanted to make an additional point in this discussion about whether one believes the model or not If you believe that you can go from 3 percent to 4 percent inflation and permanently buy some increases in output and jobs, when you get to 4 percent you will also find the model will show that you can go from 4 to 5 percent and also buy some more output The same applies from 5 to 6 percent So you tend to get on that kind of slope, and it's much easier to draw the line at lower rates of inflation than it is at intermediate or higher rates I think we have 20 years of experience which indicate the validity of that   I would retain the M2 and M3 targets for 1994 and I would keep them the same for 1995 I think we ought to declare a victory on the ranges that we have for M2 and M3 We have them down now to where they are consistent with what we want to do longer term I don't think we are skillful enough at forecasting to factor in the shifts in demand for either M2 or M3, and so I think we are essentially where we ought to be for those aggregates going forward On debt, I came into the meeting without strong feelings I still don't have strong feelings, although I think at the margin there is something to be said for lowering the range for 1995 I'd leave it alone for 1994, but I think a lower debt range would be more consistent with our ranges for M2 and M3 over time I don't think it's equivalent to your reference to a "real" federal funds rate That took a life of its own because people interpreted that as the justification for tightening I doubt very much whether this Committee is going to tighten because we lower the debt range from 4-8 percent to 3-7 percent, so I just don't think it will come anywhere near taking on the same life But I don't feel strongly If there is a reason, and on balance I think there is some reason for doing it, I would change the range for 1995  As for releasing the projections for 1996, it is awfully hard to recall an instance in this Committee when we had a request for more information and our initial reaction was to do it We always have a long list of reasons; sometimes they are valid and I think sometimes  -53-    7/5-6/94  it's just habit We have the problem of goals versus projections; we have the bad news problem; we have the quality/quantity issue If we go out 18 months or if we go out 30 months, I don't think that in substance it's much different I think we elevate the importance of the 1996 projection more by not giving it than if we give it, so my inclination would be to give 1996 I would couch it in your usual articulate way and say essentially that it doesn't mean very much--you have a way of saying that very nicely [Laughter]   The Philadelphia District economy is growing at a moderate pace, although still less than the nation as a whole The expansion is generally broad-based, geographically and across sectors Some slowing, however, is occurring in the pace of growth Consumer spending is still leading the way, particularly in areas of home furnishings and autos Retailers remain guardedly optimistic about the outlook, but a number have trimmed their projections for the rest of the year Much the same can be said for manufacturing Orders and shipments are positive, but a number of manufacturers see less growth during the second half Realtors generally report that home sales remain good, especially for low- and mid-priced homes Some builders, however, report slowing in the pace of new construction Concern about rising mortgage rates has damped their enthusiasm somewhat Commercial real estate markets remain soft; the prospects are better in suburban areas for next year and beyond In Philadelphia, there is still a markdown of some less than top-grade space  Sentiment in the District overall is positive, but a little less so than when we met six weeks ago Most business people believe the pace of growth will be positive, but slower during the months ahead It's the "but slower" part that makes them a bit uneasy How much slower and the impact on the bottom line make them just a touch nervous Consumer sentiment is positive as the job market improves With few exceptions, however, wage pressures are well contained in the District High visibility layoffs still cast a cautioning note on people's feelings, though, about the job market  Price pressures appear to be contained There is more talk of rising input prices, but most people still feel it's quite difficult to pass on those increases, although I am certain businesses would if they could  Turning to the national economy, there is clear evidence from the consumer sector, labor markets, and the industrial sector that points toward a slowing from the rapid pace earlier in the year The Greenbook forecasts are reasonable estimates in my judgment of how things will turn out Nonetheless, we should be naturally skeptical of any forecast We are in a transition from a higher growth rate to a lower growth rate And we have to monitor incoming data closely as a reality check on the magnitude of this adjustment We could easily  -23-    7/5-6/94  underestimate or overestimate the extent and smoothness of the adjustment for a whole range of reasons Likewise, we are in an especially sensitive period on the inflation front We have come too far in the disinflationary process to reverse course at this point At the same time, we do need a lengthy period of sustainable growth These objectives are compatible, but the margin of error for policy is sufficiently narrow as to require a close reality check on incoming information about capacity constraints and demand pressures   Mr Chairman, there was a subcommittee that looked at this some months ago Others on that Committee might want to chime in, but as I recall there was a fairly strong consensus after a number of discussions that we ought to announce only when we change policy However, I think today is a very awkward day, and whatever we do today, we have to set the stage for a less awkward future And while I subscribe to the basic notion endorsed by the subcommittee that we ought to announce only changes, it might be well today to indicate what the Committee's policy is and to say the Committee's policy is to announce only policy changes and then to say the meeting is concluded and we will have no announcement I think that gets us through the situation of today but sets the stage for the future When the announcement time passes and there is no announcement, it means there is no change So, we have addressed the awkwardness of today and what we want to prevail as we go down the road   I favor staying where we are today both for international as well as domestic reasons I agree with your observations that we would have to have a very large bullet to be credible in terms of the dollar, and I don't think we ought to use that today; it's much wiser to keep our powder dry and wait for a more demanding day Hopefully, that won't come, but I think that is what we ought to do On the domestic economy, we are moving from a higher growth path to a lower growth path And I think we need to have a better sense of the magnitude of that adjustment and where we are likely to end up before we make an additional move  On the symmetry/asymmetry issue, the vaguer that concept the more comfortable I am with it The more we try to define it and get specific the more uncomfortable I become So, this notion of indicating a kind of disposition in a vague sense is fine I think, however, that all too frequently in the past asymmetry has allowed us to key monetary policy on a particular statistic We have had a run on employment numbers, for example, over various periods The markets would anticipate that first Friday of the month, and they would move because they were trying to guess how we would move That is not the kind of situation that we want to get ourselves into I think we should react to a total evaluation of how we see the economy rather than a particular number on a particular day So, as I hear definitions of symmetry and asymmetry that lead us more toward reacting to specific statistics, the less enthusiastic I am about it However, if I were voting today, I could vote for either symmetry or asymmetry   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy continues to grow modestly, although still less than the nation as a whole Retailing, bank lending, and manufacturing reflect this general assessment Employment growth in fact has strengthened some in the District The perception, however, is still one that jobs are hard to get, and high profile layoffs are a major contributor to this perception There is a fairly widespread feeling that the second half will be slower than the first There is also some anxiety about how much slower There is in addition some of the skepticism that Cathy has picked up about the durability of the expansion Our survey of manufacturing is picking up stronger price pressures, particularly in the metals area More generally, however, wage and price pressures remain largely contained with most firms still emphasizing cost containment to stay competitive  The national economy, while slowing, in my judgment is still growing solidly The growth in employment plus strength in equipment spending and a stronger outlook for exports are major pluses Negatives or question marks are in construction and inventories On balance, while slower-paced growth is likely, the risks do seem to be more on the up side than the down side Likewise for future inflation, the risks also seem to be more on the up side than the down side The capacity utilization relationships, I think, point toward a skewed upside risk for inflation, and also the signs in the pipeline-- commodity prices, prices paid, prices received--and the attitude in some industries that one can indeed pass along some cost increases, I think, are blinking caution at this point   But it's a bank down the street; they are not doing it; it's a bank down the street   I support the package   The Third District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, less strongly than the rest of the nation Total employment is growing, although slowly Retail sales are expanding with strength notably in durables, particularly in autos Residential construction on the whole is flat--down a little in some areas, up a little in others Manufacturing continues to do well; it is growing, but not quite as fast as earlier in the year Banks are reporting increasing loan volumes including increases in lending to small businesses There also are reports of a fairly general slippage in underwriting standards--always the bank down the street, not the bank you're talking to The outlook suggests that the pace of growth in the District will continue to moderate, although I must say I am hearing more concern about what rising interest rates might do to business prospects We clearly have gotten people's attention; higher rates are on their minds, and they are talking more about it Wage pressures remain subdued Except for input prices, inflationary pressures have not changed much in the District The competitive environment stressed over and over by business people seems to be making it difficult to pass on higher input prices  My reading of the national economy is that the expansion is slowing but that we are likely to get more growth than we expected for the next quarter or two rather than less The strength in retail sales coupled with that in business equipment and faster growth among our trading partners provide the underpinnings for continued growth in demand and job creation And with excess capacity dwindling, the  -15-    9/27/94  inflation risks are clearly in view The major uncertainty, however, is what lies beyond the next quarter or two when some of the slackening of pent-up demand and lagged effects of previous interest rate hikes will be felt more fully The skewing toward greater upside risk may well continue beyond this year or there may develop more of a balance between too much or too little demand going into next year For that reason, it strikes me that this is a time where we ought to have additional monitoring of economic developments as the preferred course   I agree with your recommendation   Move approval  SPEAKER(?) Second   The profile that you have for growth over the next 15 months or so I find somewhat puzzling The economy has a fair amount of momentum, and yet you have a rather significant falloff in the rate of growth out into next year with a yield curve that is still sloping upward I think that you would have to have more flattening of the yield curve to get this dramatic a slowdown That's one piece that is puzzling The other part of it, even if you are right, is reminiscent of the late 1980s If you take growth down to 1 to 1-1/2    11/15/94  percent, if it really does get that weak, you open yourself up to any kind of a shock I'm puzzled on both sides one, that we will get this amount of slowing with the kind of increase in rates that you talk about; and on the other side, if we actually do end up with this kind of slowing, then you can argue that we are vulnerable on the down side So I have two opposite concerns   Anecdotal reports suggest that the Philadelphia District is catching up to some extent with the rest of the nation Manufacturing in particular is showing strength and the outlook is positive Steel and auto products are notably brisk Retailers generally report a pickup in sales, especially in apparel and appliances, and the mood is upbeat about holiday sales Realtors say home sales are strong in the Philadelphia area but uneven in the rest of the District The supply of homes is high, however, and selling prices have been steady Commercial real estate activity varies a great deal around the District from weak in south Jersey to strong in some parts of central Pennsylvania There is a pickup in the Philadelphia area, especially in the Pennsylvania suburbs Lending activity is on an upswing around most of the District and lending terms are easing, but I don't think we ought to be surprised at that; that's typical Bad loans are made in good times, and there is a bandwagon effect that human nature just cannot resist despite changes in legislation, better supervision, and so forth There are no general signs of price pressures, although I hear more reports about tightness in skilled labor markets and the demand for professional- type jobs Some manufacturers seem more confident about selected price increases sticking, but most still talk about tough competition holding prices down All in all, the District economy is less of a laggard and the tone is better, although feelings of insecurity are just below the surface and sometimes on the surface, depending on who is doing the talking  At the national level, we are seeing what we have seen before Once the economy gets going, we tend to underestimate the strength of its forward momentum and the level of interest rates needed to achieve moderate growth with subdued inflation Now  -20-    11/15/94  fortunately, if we have fallen behind the curve, we are not all that far behind With timely actions going forward, we have a good chance of keeping inflationary pressures in check and the expansion on track   Earlier in the year when we knew that we had to begin to tighten, I think there was a case on real sector grounds that we probably should have moved by more than we did I think you argued rather persuasively, Mr Chairman, that we had a bubble in financial markets and that we had to deflate that rather slowly Otherwise we could take a big hit In hindsight, I think that was wise We may have a similar bubble now in the nonfinancial sector of the economy Sentiment and the outlook for the economy have improved Inventories, as you have noted, are a positive influence on the economy However, while we talked a lot today about financial markets and the foreign exchange markets, we talked very little about sentiment in the nonfinancial part of the economy We run a risk with the 75 basis points of making a pretty big hole in that nonfinancial bubble out there It is going to hit those in the nonfinancial part of the economy with a big bang; they are going to be quite surprised; they are going to think that either we know something that they don't know or that this move is going to bring about a significantly slower 1995 My own preference would be to go 1/2 If we had to go another 1/2 in December, I would go another 1/2 But just as we had to be careful about deflating the financial bubble earlier in the year, we have to be careful about deflating the nonfinancial bubble at this point   Just a couple of comments I might state somewhat differently than did the Vice Chairman the rationale for why we are doing what we are doing We are trying to make the best possible monetary policy decisions and that depends very crucially on the quality of the deliberative process At the same time, we also want to be as open as possible That balance of having a quality deliberative process and a degree of openness, I think, ought to be reexamined from time to time What was the right balance in one period may be different in another period I agree with the immediate change I think that there are some rather strong reasons for only announcing changes and not getting into the habit of announcing "no change" decisions, even though I can conceive of situations where that might be best In addition to the examples you gave, Mr Chairman, where there may be a reason to delay the implementation for a couple of days and it therefore would be very awkward to issue a no-change statement, there is also the complication that we sometimes have conference calls between meetings In my view we would not want to get into the habit of stating that policy was not changed at a meeting even though we might have considered the possibility of a change at an unscheduled meeting during the intermeeting period Another complication is the delegation that the Committee makes to the Chairman The Chairman has the flexibility to change policy between meetings While it may be splitting hairs, conceivably the Chairman could think about making a change and decide against it If we have a stated policy that we are going to announce both change and no change, it could get more complicated It is much cleaner to do it the way that we have been doing it  On the issuance of a statement, I think we ought to have a statement when we do make a change It ought to be short To me, the main reason is that somebody is going to explain our action, and I would rather our words be the basis for that explanation than somebody else's interpretation So, I think it is worth a sentence or two, but I feel rather strongly that it has to be up to the Chairman The Chairman can get all the advice he wants from the Committee, but it is his responsibility, and I think we ought to make that clear   I just have a question and this has to do with whether we allow the tapes to go off for certain subjects It is a question to Virgil What could we argue reasonably convincingly about redaction? For example, if we keep the tape on all the time, what is it that we could hold back for 30 years? What would be a legitimate kind of argument? Would the example the Chairman uses about how we comport ourselves with the rest of the world be a legitimate redaction?  -25-    1/31-2/1/95   What about how we organize ourselves for the rest of the world?   Returning to your example, Mr Chairman, I would agree that it was outrageous to request the tape for that telephone meeting we had in October 1993 In hindsight, however, it probably served us well that we had that tape because it was very useful in showing that there was no conspiracy, that there was no evil activity going on I think it cleared the air rather nicely even though we thought that it really was not a legitimate request   Could you repeat what Bill McDonough just said?   And redact?   I think, Alan, the general feeling of the subcommittee was that the concurring statements ought to be an available option, but there was a general feeling that such statements would not be used often Now, there is no real way to enforce that We count on the good judgment of every individual member of the Committee, but we count on the good judgment of every member of the Committee for a whole lot of things   I think this came up originally when we were thinking of ways to expand the minutes But subsequent to that, I believe, we discovered that the meetings were being recorded and we decided to release the transcripts Also, we made the decision to release our actions promptly to the public   Yes, it may be moot at this point This had a life that preceded our making those decisions I think the arguments that have just been made are very good, particularly in light of the fact that we really are being rather forthcoming When it was still the Mullins subcommittee, I think I was in favor of this But enough has changed since then that it seems to me it is not really a terribly important issue anymore  -31-    1/31-2/1/95   There is another reason and that is that these FOMC meetings are now hyped-up more by the press--before and after-- and I don't think we ought to contribute to that hype Even though our practice is not perfect and it is only a guideline, I personally have found it to be very useful just to say, look, there are two weeks that I am not going to talk to you people If you want to talk about some banking condition or something like that, that is a different story But as a general proposition, I just do not talk to the press for the two weeks around the Committee meeting As I said, I have found it to be personally very useful, and I think it collectively keeps us from this hyping up of Committee meetings   I will forego my question   But we have moved from loan guarantees to direct lending   Is any of it obligated in any way beyond what we are talking about with Mexico?   The Philadelphia region continues to expand, with some evidence that the pace of expansion is slowing Wage and price increases generally remain subdued, but with labor markets tightening, there is some concern, more than I have heard before, about building inflationary pressures Manufacturers report that industrial activity is still on an upward trend, but some slackening from the pace of the fourth quarter is occurring Gains are more common in metals and equipment, while steady-to-declining activity is more characteristic of nondurables Retailers in general were reasonably pleased about holiday sales They did not do as well as they had hoped, but well enough not to be complaining Sales in January were more subdued with lots of discounting, especially for apparel, which was the weakest area in December Existing nonresidential structures are still selling at prices below replacement cost in the Philadelphia area, so there is little need for new construction Residential construction is clearly feeling the impact of higher interest rates Loan volume is growing moderately, with middle market companies prominent among new borrowers There are still reports--I would say an increasing number of reports--that underwriting standards are slipping and complaints from bankers that loan pricing does not adequately compensate for risk With rising loan demand, there is more competition for deposits Labor markets in the District have tightened noticeably during the last couple of months Some employers expect upward wage and price pressures down the road Others believe that there is still much potential for further productivity gains and that such gains plus intense competition will continue to contain wage and price pressures  -84-    1/31-2/1/95  My reading of the national economy is that we are likely to see moderating growth as the year progresses, largely from less robust personal consumption, less inventory investment, weaker residential construction, and perhaps not as strong export growth as we previously thought Nonetheless, moderating growth is still a forecast with the usual amount of uncertainty surrounding the degree of moderation and the timing On the inflation side, the weight of historical evidence points toward some cyclical rise in the inflation rate It is probably true, however, that the economy is now less inflation prone than it was in the last decade or so Whether it is a little less prone or a lot less remains to be seen The answer is probably in between--not as optimistic as some would have us believe but better than our models suggest   I think this decision really comes down to assessing the risks and one's comfort level in dealing with those  -112-    1/31-2/1/95  risks Your analysis of the risks, Mr Chairman, on the domestic economy is about as good an assessment as one can get The risks still do favor, I think, the continuation of too much strength and, given where we are in the cycle, greater risk on the inflation side Given that, I think we would be doing the right thing and my comfort level would be increased by following your recommendation of going up 1/2 percentage point I would like to join others, however, and say that I think the way monetary policy has been conducted over the past year is one of the high points in this Committee's history, at least the part that I have been associated with It has been that way because we have been forward-looking, but we also have been willing to be decisive when we needed to be We need to continue to be forward- looking in this part of the cycle While I am sympathetic to the notion that there are more data coming, that is always going to be the case More often than not we get into trouble by waiting for one more piece of data We tend to make the right decision when we take the information that we have in hand, make the best judgment we can, and then go for it   Mike, when Hoosiers see something that is too good to be true, they know it probably is [Laughter]   There are some clear signs of moderating growth in the Philadelphia District Manufacturers in particular indicate a slackening pace that is apparent in new and unfilled orders as well as current shipments Retailers report a slowing pace of sales, especially in autos and other durables, although I think there is considerable uncertainty among retailers as to whether this is just a temporary slackening to be followed by a pickup or the beginning of a slower trend Residential sales and construction are in a lull and there likewise I think most realtors are not sure whether this is just a lull that will pass or the beginning of a long, dry spell Commercial real estate conditions are soft, but the cycle seems to have bottomed out in areas of the District that show more strength Looking across the District, even in those areas where economic activity is stronger than in others, there really is an absence of wage and price pressures They just remain subdued and are a nonproblem Increasingly in the District, the outlook for moderating growth is becoming the conventional wisdom, following the fast finish of last year, which temporarily raised spirits that 1995 might be a very strong year Since the Philadelphia District has been a laggard during this expansion, there is some feeling that the good times could have lasted longer--the same view that Cathy Minehan finds in New England  For the nation, I think we need more than the usual amount of humility about our assessment of the outlook To be sure, there are  -29-    3/28/95  increasing signs of slowing growth, but we could be surprised either on the up side or the down side Areas like inventories or net exports or consumption expenditures all strike me as having more potential than usual for surprises for reasons that have been discussed How much inventory accumulation is intended or unintended? Certainly, the net export outlook has a number of crosscurrents Since the lull in consumption expenditures has been mainly in the durables side, just how temporary is that or is it more permanent?  We are likely to have some increases in inflation in 1995 We need to try to distinguish between cyclical increases that are likely to moderate as the cycle matures and increases of a more underlying or core character In this context, a slowing of economic activity makes credible the case that we may see more of a cyclical increase than an underlying increase But here too, we need to keep a few upticks in inflation in the context of a cycle This comes back to the importance of gauging the strength of economic activity, and I think this is a time for monitoring   I support alternative B because this is a wait- and-see time, and I support an asymmetric directive for the reasons that were well articulated by Bill McDonough   Looking at the available statistics, the Third District economy clearly has slowed in recent months across a broad front, including manufacturing, retailing, and residential construction Looking beyond the statistics, however, I think what we are seeing is a downward adjustment in the rate of growth rather than a cumulative decline in economic activity Both business and consumer attitudes in the District still seem positive Rail transportation activity, often a good indicator of manufacturing activity, seems to be bottoming out except for autos The slowing of office leasing seems to be more from short supply than weak demand in the District, a positive sign for future building, and lower mortgage rates are a positive for housing activity  On the inflation front in the District, I think we need to look beyond the current statistics as well Although there is some uptick in the rate of inflation, I doubt that what we are seeing is a cumulative upturn in the rate of inflation, but rather a temporary cyclical upturn that is not sustainable in the current climate of moderating demand pressures, stiff competition for sales, and subdued wage and benefit increases  Turning to the national economy, my views are similar to what is happening in the District The national economy in my view is making a downward adjustment in the rate of growth rather than going through the early phase of a cumulative downturn And the economy is experiencing a temporary uptick in inflation rather than the beginning of a cumulative upturn Nonetheless, while I am still reasonably confident about the prospects for a soft landing, I think we need to be very sensitive to incoming information   I support "B" symmetric   In my view, Mr Chairman, that is both an accurate and a sensible statement There is a dog over in the corner and he is asleep and his name is Aggregates and we ought to let him sleep for another year or two   Overall, the Philadelphia District economy is flat to down, probably down in the second quarter going into the third Manufacturing has been the hardest hit, more so than in the nation as a whole There is a tentative sense among District manufacturers that the bottom may be near and that an upturn is in the offing during the fourth quarter and into 1996 Most say a healthy export business to Europe and Southeast Asia is cushioning the downturn in domestic demand Housing activity appears to be responding positively to lower mortgage rates, although the level of activity is still down from a year ago Retailers say sales are up but below expectations They are cautious about the rest of the year They say that a period of pent-up demand has passed and customers are again more susceptible to postponing purchases Retailers look to a continuation of discounting to keep sales growing Loan demand at banks is soft and most bankers say their customers are more cautious than several months ago The region has been hit with more major corporate downsizings, which make for headline news, and these downsizings greatly outdistance interest rates as a matter of general concern There are still a lot of help-wanted signs in the region, at retail shops as an example, but they are mostly for lower-paying jobs Wage and price pressures remain subdued My sense is that expectations in the District about whether the economy is headed for a recession or a rebound are in a sensitive stage Business people generally are cautiously predicting a bounceback, but these predictions are vulnerable to shocks or continued signs of weakness Expectations could change quickly Consumers seem more cautious than businesses, judging from comments from retailers  Turning to the nation, I think the most likely outcome is a resumption of growth, although the risks of a self-feeding downturn clearly have increased significantly for all the reasons that we have discussed There is little room at this point to absorb additional downside developments without causing a recession These downside developments are easily imaginable They may occur if we don't get a rebound in exports, say, because of less growth abroad as detailed by President McDonough Consumer or business confidence may deteriorate much further as recession talk increases, and one can add to that list We could conceivably get a much stronger rebound in the economy than expected for the opposite reasons, but this outcome seems to me to be much less likely at this point As for inflation, there has  -17-    7/5-6/95  been an uptick in cyclical inflationary pressures However, with wage pressures subdued and price competition intense against a background of timely monetary restraint earlier, we still appear to be on track for achieving price stability over time   I think a quarter-point drop in the funds rate is the right amount at the right time, along with an asymmetric directive The current level of monetary restraint has helped cause more of a correction and associated downside risks than we preferred A cautious move toward less restraint, therefore, would help shore up demand and lessen downside risks More importantly, it would demonstrate that the Fed is awake at the switch and wants to avoid a recession I think we would be seen as forward-looking both when the economy is overheating and when it is underachieving As the central bank our primary contribution to prosperity over time is price stability Within the longer-run context of moving toward price stability, however, there is some room and indeed an obligation to take into account shorter-run fluctuations in demand Now is one of those times to act promptly To wait is to risk having to ease more and faster later on, with a greater probability of boom/bust in 1996 or 1997 A quarter-point drop in the funds rate would be a prudent magnitude for financial markets as well It would in my judgment balance the need to try to avoid feeding another big run-up in asset values versus the risk of setting off a major correction   I support your proposal   Thank you, Mr Chairman Most of the recent anecdotal and statistical information suggests that economic growth is resuming in the Philadelphia District Manufacturing, which has been a major drag, appears to be bottoming out and the outlook is positive Retailers report the usual summer slowdown, but the underlying trend is favorable and retailers are upbeat about the fall Bankers continue to report that consumer lending is rising Auto dealers are maintaining positive sales trends, although extensive incentives are underpinning the sales rate Residential sales have picked up in response to falling mortgage rates as well as effective price reductions by builders There are some indications that the pricing of office buildings may be firming, although prices are low and vacancy rates are only steady at high levels The employment situation is mixed, with the jobless rate still high in parts of southern New Jersey and the old industrial and mining regions of Pennsylvania Other parts of Pennsylvania and Delaware have tighter labor markets Wage and price pressures remain contained  On the national level, the inventory adjustment appears to be proceeding reasonably well Final demand appears to be holding up and inflationary pressures appear to be subsiding There are always risks to any outlook as has been pointed out, and there can always be surprises At this point, however, the outlook is favorable for sustainable growth and further progress toward reducing inflation over time   I support your proposal   In many ways the Mack bill conforms to how we have carried out policy in recent years So, I see it as legislation that is catching up with the experience and the progress There are some advantages to the bill I think it is useful to formally make price stability the primary objective over the long run The proper way to look at it from my point of view is that price stability is a means to an end, not an end in itself The ultimate end of all economic policy is higher standards of living and growth and that sort of thing So, as we explain our role, and I think the Mack bill does this, we need to focus on price stability as the primary objective but as a means to a larger end I also like the flexibility that the Mack bill gives the FOMC in the pursuit of this longer-term objective It realistically allows us to take into account short-run factors like  -43-    9/26/95  fluctuations in demand, recessions, financial shocks, etc, but the short-run actions need to be anchored in this longer-run objective In other words, whatever we do in the short run ought to be consistent with this longer-run objective, and I think the Mack bill does give us that latitude It does open up the question of what the strategy is It is easier on paper to explain that we are going to move toward stable prices year after year until we get there In practice, I think we have to take into account the business cycle in getting there We got ourselves into this inflationary problem cycle to cycle We have gotten out of it marginally cycle to cycle, taking advantage of cyclical developments So, as we go forward, if this bill becomes legislation, we need to take into account the cycle-to- cycle progress even though it can be more difficult to explain So, as a general proposition, I would support the thrust of this proposed legislation   Ambiguity is necessary for flexibility  -51-    9/26/95   I must say that I didn't read it that way I read it that we had flexibility during the transition and that we had flexibility thereafter  SPEAKER(?) I agree   The ides of November [Laughter]  END OF MEETING  -52-       Recent data and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy in the Philadelphia District is growing, but not strongly; growth continues at less than the national pace Manufacturing has reversed course after a weak first half and is growing again Residential construction has stabilized after a period of weakness earlier in the year Nonresidential activity is up some around the District, driven by distribution and retailing facilities plus some hotel and entertainment-related construction Retail sales are up a little Banks report that loan demand generally is flat; where there is some increase, it tends to be on the consumer side rather than the commercial side Employment levels that had been declining earlier in the year have stabilized and are rising, particularly outside manufacturing--in the service areas  Turning to the national economy, of the three broad categories of slower, faster, or moderate growth outlined by Mike Prell, I am in the moderate category I think that we are likely to head into a period where sales and production will grow at a sustainable pace in 1996 I must say, however, that as I travel around the District--and I do a lot more listening than I do speaking --I sense that the better business confidence is probably broader than it is deep If one just listens, one gets more of the tone that it's to the slower side Now perhaps that's the District If one probes, then, yes, things are better; the third quarter is better than the second; the fourth probably will be still better, and 1996 looks okay But one does not get the same sense of optimism in the business community generally as when one listens to economists and professional forecasters Phrases like "it doesn't get much better than this," just don't ring true, I think, in the business community Maybe it's just human nature; maybe it's our part of the country; but there just isn't that underlying enthusiasm about the future that one would hope to see   I support "B" symmetric I think we indeed have to take into account the fiscal side, but I don't know what to take into account at this point So, we ought to wait on that Almost surely we will have to adjust policy at some point in coming months, but I don't sense any pressing need today So, I think your basic arguments are correct and I support them   The regional economy in the Philadelphia District is mixed It is performing in the range of steady to improving slightly Manufacturing continues to grow, although the pace appears to be waning Retailers are disappointed with sales and concerned about the outlook for holiday sales Even discount stores are now seeing smaller increases than earlier in the year Auto sales have eased with the end of incentive programs on '95 models and slow deliveries of '96 models Real estate activity has been running at a nearly level rate Office vacancy rates are coming down only slowly if at all, and residential sales are flat Commercial and industrial lending is moving up some, with a slowing of credit card lending Employment gains are anemic but still better than earlier in the year, and wage gains continue to be in the 3 to 4 percent range Attitudes appear to be more cautious than upbeat  -24-    11/15/95  Turning to the national economy, it just does not have the feel of a 4 to 5 percent growth rate The statistics appear to be telling us a relatively fast growth story, and the anecdotal information indicates a more moderate growth story I'm inclined to give more weight to the anecdotal evidence Consumer spending appears more consistent with the more moderate growth path, as does manufacturing I would view the 4 to 5 percent growth that we seem to have had as more of a statistical aberration than a basic underlying trend The outlook for inflation is probably in the 3 percent range for next year While I believe we are all committed over time to a stable price environment, I think we have to be realistic about this We are in a very mature phase of the business cycle and it would be a major accomplishment by historical standards just to keep inflation from rising at this point in the cycle I think there will be opportunities to have further disinflation, but my expectation is that we will have to wait for a more conducive phase of the business cycle for that to be achieved   I support the "no change" in "B" I think there is enough uncertainty in the economy, and it is on a moderate growth, low inflation kind of track My sense, and it's entirely judgmental, is that the federal funds rate is on the high side of where we will want it going forward and that we will need to adjust it downward within the next several months However, at this point, given the uncertainties about the outlook, I would be inclined not to prejudge policy in any way and, therefore, I would go for a symmetrical directive   It's in times like this that we wish we had measures of the money supply and reserves that would accurately reflect the stance of monetary policy I think if we did, it would clearly show that there has been a tightening of policy But we don't have those measures, and we are stuck with the federal funds rate There is a long history around this table of using and abusing a federal funds rate target I think what we are doing today is the right thing in terms of using the fed funds rate and making discretionary adjustments when it is necessary to avoid the pegging problem that we have had so often in the past So, I think what we are doing here is the right thing This is not the time to be tightening policy Your admonition about referring to the budget is well taken I must say, as others have said, that I have been increasingly uncomfortable in recent months about the perception that there is a tight link between what we do in the Fed and what happens on the fiscal policy front I think it's important that that link be broken I also agree with you that this ought to be a cautious move There is enough uncertainty about the economy I think the asset inflation problem, the bubble effect, is one that we ought to take into account Our announcement ought to be couched in terms of a reduction in inflationary expectations I agree that our action should be a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate with a symmetrical directive and no discount rate change  On the issue of opportunistic versus deliberative, I think it should always be clear in this discussion that whether one takes the opportunistic road or the deliberative road, the commitment to achieving price stability is absolutely firm I don't think there is any difference in the commitment between those who adhere to one process or another We need to be clear about that My own view is that the opportunistic approach is the preferred one mainly because it  -47-    12/19/95  works There is a practical history to it, and I think that there is a practical future to it While we are independent, what we do has to make sense to the country as a whole I think the opportunistic approach will get us to price stability, and I think it will be a more acceptable approach broadly   I prefer Alternative I I think the arguments that were valid last July are still valid We really don't have that much confidence in the relationship between money and the economy Because of that, we are largely dealing with symbolism here It is important that we use that symbolism to underscore our long-run commitment to price stability I think that's what the current ranges for the aggregates say, and I think that's the way we ought to keep it   I think credibility is earned by what we do, not what we say We lost credibility by letting inflation accelerate, and we have regained a lot of credibility by bringing inflation down Over the last 15 years, we have brought inflation down from double- digit levels We held inflation to an average of 4 percent during the long expansion of the 1980s We have held it to 3 percent or under during the fairly lengthy expansion of the 1990s The actions that we took in 1994, when we tightened in a preemptive way in trying to head off inflationary pressures before they emerged, were worth far more than anything that we might say I think we really fool ourselves if we think that we can put out statements that will enhance our credibility What counts is what people do, and there is a lag in market perceptions We now have inflationary expectations down as low as they have been since the late 1960s, and I think that is based on actions, not words We have put out words The Chairman has repeatedly said in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and in other speeches that we intend to preserve the gains that we have made on inflation and to extend them over time If Congress wants to pass the Mack Bill, so be it; that could be helpful But I don't think we ought to engage in legislation around this table What we can do and what the legislation gives us the power to do is to act That is what we ought to do and save the words for the legislature and for other avenues as we have done in the past   If we can't trust ourselves for 2 hours and 15 minutes, we have the wrong people in this room!   The economy in the Philadelphia District was slowing during the final months of 1995, and this slower trend has carried over into 1996, aggravated by unusually bad weather The retail sector has been soft Holiday sales were below expectations, and January sales have been hurt by severe weather Auto sales were fairly good in December but fell sharply in January Manufacturing shows declining demand Most manufacturers indicate that inventories are not at worrisome levels Realtors by and large say that most markets are improving slowly Vacancy rates for office buildings declined last year in many parts of the District The notable exception was southern New Jersey Rental rates rose in some areas and were steady in others Landlord concessions were less significant last year The demand for industrial space exceeds the supply The demand for retail space, however, is soft except for large supermarkets and other very large retail operations The residential market also appears to be better than it was earlier  The outlook for the regional economy in 1996 is cautiously optimistic, with more emphasis on "cautious" than "optimistic" Business people are hopeful, but they are more concerned about the outlook now than they were six weeks ago I sense more concern, more restlessness, more jitteriness, all of which would dissipate with a couple of good months or alternatively intensify with a couple more soft months Price and wage pressures remain subdued, with fierce competition and job insecurity acting as dampers The persistent downsizing, with layoffs at all levels regardless of performance, not only is undermining consumer confidence in the District but it is also undermining employee morale in affected companies In fact, there has been modest job growth in the region, but the widespread perception is one of job loss  -13-    1/30-31/96  Turning to the national economy, the most likely path for 1996 is moderate growth and contained inflation I sense somewhat more downside risk to growth, however, than upside I think the consumer sector is a clear risk, and the export sector is another source of uncertainty The inflation outlook strikes me as more symmetrical; I think that the occurrence of less inflation is about as likely as the development of more inflation Thank you, Mr Chairman   One of the major reasons why monetary policy has been successful in recent years is that it has had a forward-looking approach to it Forward-looking monetary policy means that we have to peer into the future, and I don't know anybody who can do that with 20/20 vision There is always some mist out there through which we need to look As I try to look out through that mist, my sense is that monetary policy is still on the restrictive side and that we are operating with our foot on the brake And while I don't think this is the time to adopt a stimulative monetary policy and move our foot to the accelerator, I do think it is time to lighten our foot some on the brake in the context of an economy that in my view exhibits some downside risks So, Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of a 25 basis point drop in the federal funds rate   Thank you, Mr Chairman What is remarkable about the economy in recent months is its resiliency Despite government shutdowns, severe weather, and strikes, the national economy is still on track for moderate growth and low inflation The economy is also experiencing what could turn out to be its greatest restructuring since the Industrial Revolution, with all the attendant insecurity that comes at the personal level from change of this magnitude That, I think, makes this resiliency all the more remarkable My sense is that the upside and downside risks are about evenly balanced for the period immediately ahead The inventory correction appears to be well along The consumer, while somewhat stretched in terms of debt, still appears to have ample purchasing power for sustainable spending growth And the strengthening in residential construction reflects positive consumer sentiment One major builder told me, for example, that some of his strongest sales are in areas heavily impacted by the layoffs at AT&T  On the wage/price front, I think we need to be watchful, but we also need to keep in context where we are We are more than five years into an economic expansion We have seen little if any acceleration in inflation I must say as I look back through the pipeline, there really are few signs of an acceleration of inflation at this point The positive aspect of this expansion is that after more than five years we have not had any acceleration of inflation My sense is that we are not at the point where that is likely; I think inflation will continue to be subdued for the period ahead  Turning to the region, the Philadelphia District economy continues to lag the nation Pennsylvania in particular is a major laggard New Jersey growth rates are more promising, and I think the outlook there is brighter Delaware continues to be the little jewel that it is in the regional economy What has impressed me most in recent weeks is the surge in new housing sales in the District For the better builders, this surge has been apparent for a couple of months Even in the dead of winter, the traffic into showrooms was very high, and people were more than looking; they were signing contracts Now, if you talk to the builders who are not the most competitive or the leading builders, they also are feeling the upturn in activity It is difficult to find a builder in the District who is not feeling that I think low mortgage rates and the perception that mortgage rates have bottomed out have been a stimulus But at least for the Philadelphia District, with existing home sales much slower than new home sales and population growth slow in the mid-Atlantic region, I think one has to be skeptical about the sustainability of the rapid increase in new home sales Nonetheless, for a District that has been rather sluggish for a long time, a spur in residential construction is welcome at this point   I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman   I think the discussion would be quite useful But starting it with a number doesn't strike me as the way to do it We ought to have a broader discussion on the issue of price stability, what we mean by it, and how we can get there I think that if we have the substantive discussion, then numbers will fall out But if we reverse the order, I think we will end up with a heavily philosophical discussion So, I support the notion of having a discussion and focusing on the substantive question, and I would leave the issue of numbers for a later date  -47-    5/21/96   Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the Philadelphia region is showing signs of improvement across a wide range of sectors including manufacturing, retailing, and construction Growth is uneven across the District, however, and overall the region lags the rest of the country I would still categorize the overall growth rate as probably modest Some areas in the District have low unemployment rates while others still have quite high levels of unemployment Wage pressures, while firming in a few areas, generally are not accelerating General price inflation also is still subdued, but some commodities like metals, fuels, agricultural commodities, and textiles show some firming tendencies  The national economy appears to me to be in reasonably good shape I think the downside risk of late last year and early this year has subsided While we see clear signs of firming in the national economy, I really do not see a high probability of a break- out on the up side The outlook for moderate growth is therefore well founded in my judgment Developments on the inflation front clearly need to be watched going forward The economy does seem to be somewhat less inflation-prone than in recent decades, witness the experience since 1994 where we have had an unemployment rate of 5-1/2 percent and the inflation rate has stayed more or less constant To what extent and for how long this favorable experience will last we don't know, so we have to be cautious about what we say concerning the future We are, however, better positioned now than we were in 1994 to deal with inflationary pressures, should they arise Then, we had a clearly stimulative monetary policy and a considerable distance to go just to get to a neutral policy stance Today, we certainly are closer to a restrictive policy stance, should we need to get there, so we have more time to engage in watchful waiting   Several issues have been talked about around the table, and in the end people have to make their own judgments With regard to the issue about the economy and the structure of the economy, most of the models, which I think the Greenbook reflects, clearly indicate that we should have had accelerating inflation over the last couple of years and are likely to have accelerating inflation going forward But the actual experience in the last couple of years has not been particularly consistent with forecasts based on those models So, our dilemma really is one of being open-minded to the possibility that there are some structural changes going on versus getting caught up in wishful thinking because tightening policy is always more difficult than easing It is easy to fall into the trap of finding excuses for not tightening, but my sense is that there is enough evidence over the last year or so to cause us to be more open- minded about the prospect that the economy may indeed be less prone to inflation I think there is something to that hypothesis, but we have to be very careful about getting carried away with it  On the stance of policy, if the federal funds rate were a couple of percentage points lower or even a percentage point lower, I would be more persuaded that now is the time to act But I don't know whether current policy is a little restrictive or a little stimulative My sense is that it is probably broadly neutral and therefore that we are fairly close to wherever we need to go Based on those reasons, not out of any overwhelming conviction that I am right but after trying to weigh the evidence and making judgments that are a matter of both logic and intuition, I come down on the side of no change at this meeting, alternative B  On the issue of symmetry or no symmetry, I could support either I don't have strong feelings On balance, I prefer symmetry mainly because I can't imagine that you, Mr Chairman, would make a decision to move toward tightening in this particular environment without a consultation with the Committee Therefore, I think the operational value of asymmetry in these circumstances is essentially worthless Looking ahead, since we do have a lag on releasing the minutes, I think asymmetry could convey the wrong impression of where we are when the minutes are made public six weeks from now I would prefer to keep our policy options very open, debate policy again in July, and make a judgment then without having the added issue of an  -35-    5/21/96  asymmetrical directive at this meeting exert any influence on that decision So, I come out with "B," symmetric   This has already been a long day I must say I have a lot of sympathy with the sentiments expressed by Bill McDonough I did not have the benefit of a Jesuit training, but I have had a lot of economics, as did a lot of people around the table, and that is both a blessing and curse As economists we like things to be clear and objective and logical The fact is that policymaking is ambiguous, judgmental, and practical The best we can do is to try to make some improvement from where we are and stay away from absolutes With regard to inflation, I think the best we can do is to  -59-    7/2-3/96  hold the line where we are and move inflation down a percentage point or so over time and see where we are at that point I think we can do that over the next several years the way we have gotten inflation down over the past few years--we take advantage of the business cycle; we take advantage of breaks when they come our way I do think, however, that we need to put this strategy in a framework of growth For us in the Fed to be perceived as enemies of growth is a loser The ultimate objective of monetary policy always needs to be framed in terms of maximum sustainable growth and moving inflation down is a means to that end If we keep it at that level, I think we can make some practical progress and have something that is salable to the general public If we try to do a lot more in this context, I think we will let perfection be the enemy of improvement   I think one can argue this issue either way It is not an issue that elicits strong feelings on my part one way or the other On balance, I would prefer to keep the ranges as they are My primary reason is that you are the spokesman for the Committee; you are the one who has to present the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony If you feel more comfortable with the approach you recommended, I am prepared to support it   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy is growing at a moderate pace, and virtually all sectors are sharing in the growth That is an improvement over conditions last year and early this year Still, the region lags the performance of the nation, and that is not likely to change in the foreseeable future Wage and price pressures appear to be contained Although labor markets have tightened some, there is no obvious acceleration in wage gains Raising prices also seems to be difficult because of competitive pressures  The national economy continues to perform at levels that should generate accelerating price pressures, judging from past experience Yet, there are few signs of accelerating movements in core prices Perhaps there will be more signs and perhaps there won't I think we need to be watchful Some moderation in the pace of real economic growth is likely during the second half of 1996 and into 1997 The increase in longer-term interest rates almost surely will damp interest-sensitive expenditures Consumption spending generally will likely grow more in line with disposable income and debt levels Growth in business fixed investment is already moderating Increases in government spending also should moderate Only inventory investment looks notably stronger for the second half So, all in all, the economy is not likely to break away on the up side Nonetheless, I think we need to be watchful here as well   The future usually bears some resemblance to the past, but the future is almost always different from the past I think we are in one of those situations now where we do not know how much different the future will be I believe most of us feel as we talk to people in our Districts that it may be more different, at least for a while, than we have become accustomed to That higher degree of uncertainty ought to make us more cautious about taking steps at this meeting, and I feel very comfortable about keeping policy the same  Looking ahead, clearly the case for tightening and the probability that we will have to tighten in the coming months would be fairly high under the old model That may indeed turn out to be the case On the other hand, it may not turn out to be the case because we may be able to remain on an unchanged policy course longer than we now anticipate under these conditions without accelerating inflation So, while I am prepared to support an asymmetric directive, it does not automatically mean in my mind that we are setting ourselves up for a tightening That may indeed be necessary, and I think we need to be watchful Should conditions arise where we have to tighten, I think we ought to do so and we ought to be decisive about it But I do not know when that tightening will need to occur, whether it will be next month, the month after, or six months down the line For today, I agree that we should make no change in policy, be very watchful, and keep an open mind as to what we ought to do at the next and subsequent meetings   I start out with some fairly basic views I think that we have to be involved in the world and that we have to provide leadership at times That means doing all the things necessary to build personal and institutional relationships to support our involvement Whether one views intervention in the foreign exchange markets as desirable or not, I will guarantee, absolutely guarantee, that there will come a time when intervention is going to be something that we need to do There may be very transitory reasons for the intervention and its effects may fade away over time, but there will be circumstances at some point where we will simply have to engage in intervention operations As a practical matter, we will then need to have the ammunition to participate While we may have foreign currency reserves now that permit us to do that, we will also need ways to back up those reserves to get the necessary liquidity Whether it is swaps or something else, we will have to be in a position to do those things that are necessary for us to sit at the table and be effective players The view that we can somehow pull ourselves out of the foreign exchange markets for all time, that we can somehow let the world go, is just completely at odds with the kind of financial structure that we have on a global basis and our role in it If we are going to play, we need to have the tools  -106-    7/2-3/96   I am not arguing about whether we need the swaps per se I am just saying that we need the means If we can improve on the swaps mechanism or find other ways, that is fine with me I do not think we ought to give them up until we are sure we have something else   The economy in the Philadelphia District appears to be on a modest uptrend that has tilted down from a somewhat faster pace earlier in the year Manufacturing is growing but at a somewhat slower pace Delivery times, while lengthening in the spring, have shortened more recently Retail sales growth, quite healthy in the spring, has eased during the summer months Nonresidential construction is flat and the pickup in residential construction appears to be decelerating Employment growth is improving slightly and some labor markets are tight while others still have slack Price and wage pressures on the whole still seem to be reasonably contained in the District  Turning to the nation, at the last meeting in early July we hoped that more information would help settle two questions--whether growth would moderate to a more sustainable pace and whether wage inflation indeed is beginning to accelerate On the sustainable growth question, I think the bottom line is that the weight of the data suggests a moderating growth trend but how much moderation is far from clear On the wage question, the larger first-quarter gain was repeated in the second Once again, however, sizable wage gains were offset by a small rise in benefit costs so that total compensation has  -18-    8/20/96  been rising at essentially the same rate in 1996 as in 1995 On the whole, price pressures remain remarkably subdued for this stage of an expansion Reasonable people can easily come to different conclusions about the outlook at this point My hunch is that we may see appreciable slowing in growth because of subdued personal consumption, more modest growth in business fixed investment, and some slackening in residential construction At the same time, upward wage pressures will not likely bubble up into upward price pressures as much as one might think because of continuing offsetting smaller benefit costs and strong competition for products and services Nonetheless, in this environment I think we need to continue to monitor demand and price pressures very closely   I understand the issue of trying to get some of these holdings off the Bundesbank's balance sheet What are our alternatives in terms of doing that? Is this proposal the only option? I can think of some theoretical alternatives, but I do not know whether they are worth much For example, we could diversify into some short-term nongovernment securities instead of extending the maturities of our German government securities holdings Or we could reduce our position in D-marks I am just wondering if you have thought about other alternatives and what the pros and cons might be   What does extending the maturity of our foreign currency investments do in terms of exposing us to greater loss? This comes to mind because we have this issue of our surplus, and that gets us into potential foreign currency losses among other things,   I think the case for moving toward a somewhat more liquid portfolio makes a lot of sense I don't know whether it ought to be 60 percent bills, or 2/3 bills, and the rest coupons, but I think Peter rather persuasively laid out the case that we need to move in that direction Perhaps the way to do it would be to move to, say, a 60/40 split and see if we like that If we feel that we need to move more than that once we get there, then we could move further How long do you think it would take to move to a 60/40 split portfolio?   I think we ought to move in that direction and then take another look at it We might not wait five years but might look toward getting a progress report two or three years from now to judge if the 60 percent makes sense I don't think there is an absolutely right number, but I think we know the direction in which we ought to be moving, and we ought to get started  -49-    9/24/96   The Philadelphia District economy is growing, but not booming, and attitudes are generally positive Some labor markets are tight while others still have significant slack There is some upward pressure on wages but downward pressure on benefit costs, especially health care costs There are some examples of upward price pressures related to steel and plastic inputs One also hears, of course, that prices are being raised indirectly For example, fitness equipment suppliers are raising the minimum order required for free delivery Some auto dealers are giving smaller discounts Overall, however, price pressures are still subdued in the District, with businesses reporting strong competitive pressures that continue to make it difficult to pass along price increases; they also report better productivity gains than in the published data  Turning to the nation, there is something for everyone, depending on what story one wants to tell, but not all is murky Clearly, there is a risk of accelerating inflation because of an overheating economy The risk, however, is more one of an upward creep in the rate of inflation than a breakout of inflation Actual inflation rates are still remarkably subdued, and most of the pipeline indicators are quiescent as well The case for a moderating pace of economic growth, while not completely convincing, is nonetheless substantial We do a fairly good job of forecasting the direction of growth We do less well forecasting the timing and magnitude of change But the expansion of consumption appears to be slowing and the rate of GDP growth likely will be substantially less during the second half of 1996 than in the first half There is a tension between data on the supply side of the economy and the demand side, which usually says something is going on in inventories Labor markets are taut but final demand, notably consumption, is moderating Although industrial production rose 1/2 percent in August, capacity utilization in manufacturing actually declined slightly, suggesting less risk of bottlenecks in production Also, the rate of unemployment consistent with stable and low inflation rates has varied over the last several decades; it is not constant Finally, monetary policy is broadly neutral We almost surely will not have far to go whenever an adjustment is decided upon In short, we still have time for watchful waiting, if we want to take advantage of it, without letting down our guard against escalating inflation  -14-    9/24/96   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Second   Economic activity in the Philadelphia District continues to expand, although the pace of growth has slackened some since the summer Manufacturing overall reflects this trend Some industries like rubber, plastics, chemicals, primary metals, and machinery are relatively stronger than textiles and furniture Retailers are having a better year to date than last year, though there has been some slowing so far this fall compared to the summer A number of retailers have told us that sales volumes hold up only when prices are cut Construction activity generally has edged down, with nonresidential construction well under the levels of a year ago and housing permits somewhat above Labor markets remain mixed, with some areas very tight and others reporting slack In general, employers report increased difficulty in finding qualified entry-level workers A major reason is that some minimal level of computer skills is required for many entry-level jobs, especially for clerical workers There is also a shortage of truck drivers and of skilled tradesmen in construction In the job categories where shortages exist, there are notable upward wage pressures Generally, however, wage increases are in the 3 to 4 percent range  On the national front, the economy is performing according to a script of more moderate, sustainable growth and subdued inflation The best-bet outlook is for more of the same, though something can always go wrong There are always uncertainties, and there is always room for improvement At the same time, the macro economy is performing rather well, and monetary tinkering at this point would be likely to do more harm than good   Central bankers worry a lot That is a requirement for the job But difficult as it is for us, I believe we ought to take good news when it comes Therefore, I think staying where we are with an asymmetric directive is more than desirable at this point   Peter, I have a couple of questions on your planned changes for Desk Operations As I understand this, you have operations for customer accounts and you have operations for System account Is my understanding correct that on System operations you are now going to announce the amount after the bids have been accepted? You already announce the size of customer transactions, but on that side do I understand correctly that you announce the amount of bids that you are looking for and not the amount accepted?   My question does not focus primarily on the customer side Are there any advantages or disadvantages when you are doing System operations to announcing the amount of bids that you are looking for?   That seems like a reasonable tradeoff If you are planning to go in earlier, and I presume this is just a way station to entering the market still earlier as more information becomes available, that opens up the possibility, or maybe the likelihood, that you can come into the market more than once during the day    12/17/96   Yes What are the kinds of things that you look for--you have talked about this some, but could you elaborate--in deciding whether to go into the market a second time? Do you look at reserves; do you look at the funds rate; do you look at both; or do you in a sense put your hands over the market to get its feel? What happens?   Thank you   I am reassured that President Broaddus is standing firm in his commitment to price stability I was getting worried about that!  The Philadelphia region continues on a modest growth trend, with most sectors reflecting this trend Attitudes are positive and the outlook is generally positive as well Labor markets are generally snug, although places like the southern-most part of New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania still have relatively high unemployment rates Getting "qualified workers" is becoming an increasingly familiar refrain among business people It is something that one hears almost regularly Average wage increases, however, still remain in the 3 to 4 percent area, although I think they probably are concentrated more in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range Almost everyone trying to sell something, from large businesses to street vendors, still reports stiff competition, which tempers the tendency to raise prices in this kind of environment  There is not much to be added on the national economy I think the key points are that the economy appears to have successfully made the adjustment downward from unsustainable growth rates earlier; it appears to be on a more sustainable track, and I think that is the  -19-    12/17/96  outlook On inflation, we are still operating in a cautionary zone Performance is better, actually remarkably better, than one might have expected on the basis of historical experience So, we are doing reasonably well there and are generally looking at a positive, even enviable, position to be in As has been pointed out, there are worries and potential problems, and we need to stay alert But we can also continue to be patient   I support your recommendation   I think it is a good idea I am sympathetic to it Just a couple of  things occurred to me, and I would be interested in either your reaction or Joe Coyne's reaction  One is that while The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times will likely get the story  reasonably straight, are not some other newspapers and television networks likely to get mixed  up and indicate that the minutes refer to the meeting that was just concluded one or two days  earlier rather than to the meeting held some six weeks earlier?   I think doing it on Thursday rather than Wednesday probably helps  that, too   I have a question, Mr Chairman The operating balances that the  commercial banking system holds at the Fed have been declining When in your judgment do  we start to get into a range where those reduced balances will materially affect your operations?   Just to add a footnote to the earlier discussion about being explicit  We really have a remarkably good track record over the last 15 years, and I think that track  record is based on a good combination of solid economics and pragmatism It is not just the  15-year record; we have a good 5-year record, a good 1-year record As we go forward, I think  we need to be very cautious about changing the mix of what has made us successful in the past  We may need to do that, but inflation has come down, we have not had many explicit debates  about what the number ought to be, and I think we have done it with deeds This is one of those  issues on which a full-scale debate could be good in an ideal sense But this is also one of those  topics that easily can be demagogued, and we can get thrown off for not very substantive  reasons So, I would be cautious about changing what has worked for us for a long period of  time and has brought us so much success In sum, I am generally sympathetic, Mr Chairman, to  your mix of good economics and pragmatism that has led us to this point It is encouraging to  me going forward, and I think we probably are going to achieve more success over the next few  years  On the specific issue at hand, I find Brian's exhibit 1 on the velocity of M2 very  encouraging with regard to the potential future usefulness of M2 in monetary policy But it is    2/4-5/97  really just that--encouraging about potential future usefulness We ought to continue to watch  M2, but whatever decision we need to make in the next few months about monetary policy  would be easier to make if it were not cluttered by M2, which is not all that secure a foundation  So, I support alternative I   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy is  growing moderately overall, with some strong areas and tight labor markets in central  Pennsylvania, some Philadelphia suburbs, and Delaware The rest of the District is improving  for the most part but more modestly Although there are examples of large wage increases, the  general situation is still one of moderate wage hikes and subdued price increases One sector  where significant strengthening may occur is in commercial construction in the Philadelphia  area Current market values for commercial buildings have been well under replacement cost  values for six or seven years Current market values are now approaching replacement cost  values in the faster growing suburbs of Philadelphia Build-to-suit construction is picking up,  and there is talk of the emergence of some speculative building There is still caution from  lenders and that is a constraint REITs have been back for a while and reportedly are pushing up  the values of some buildings Given the time lags that are involved in purchasing land, zoning,    2/4-5/97  permits, et cetera, the real strength in construction probably will not be in evidence until 1998 or  1999  Turning to the nation, we clearly have a robust economy The rapid pace of the fourth  quarter is not likely to carry over in the near term because of slackening net exports  Nonetheless, there is an underlying momentum that is likely to keep growth at least on a  moderate path  On inflation, the basic question is whether we believe the models, which are based on  past experience, or whether we believe that the most recent experience of remarkably good price  behavior will continue in the future We can speculate, but we do not know the answer to that  question, and that is why "wait and see," despite its risks, is still a reasonable course for now   I buy into your basic approach I think the odds are that we will have  to tighten It is not an absolutely foregone conclusion Some open-mindedness is appropriate,  but I think your general framework is right On the communications issue, all of us around the  table have had a fair amount of training in economics and we use economists' shorthand That  shorthand has meaning among ourselves and among our academic peers But I must say that  some of the shorthand that gets used in public does not do us very much good We ought never  get ourselves in the position of saying that we are tightening because there is too much growth or  the unemployment rate is too low Whenever we tighten, it ought to be explained in a  framework of pro-sustainable growth and pro-job growth This NAIRU concept, while it means  a lot to economists, is a very unfortunate way of communicating because 9999 percent of the  people just do not understand it and it comes across as meaning that we are against growth and  against more jobs While we as economists understand the NAIRU concept and its usefulness,  we really have to recast our whole approach in terms of communicating that we are pro-growth,  and it can be done Our case is much more salable if we put price stability in that context I  would urge you in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and I would urge all of us in the  aftermath of that, to move strongly in that direction in our public comments because I think it is  the most effective way that we can educate the public and further their understanding of the  value of price stability   The Philadelphia District economy is operating at a high level  Intense competition, however, seems to be keeping the lid on wages and prices  Manufacturing is doing well; retail sales are generally good Commercial real estate is  shifting from a buyer's market to a seller's market Vacancy rates are going down; rents and  property values are going up The incentive to build is picking up, and developers are  shopping for land Competition for bank lending is stiff, with the predictable squeezing of  margins and slippage of underwriting standards The slippage in lending standards is always  done by the bank down the street The problem of one large credit card issuer in the District  clearly has had a sobering effect on other issuers, but that occurred too late to avoid varying  degrees of hangover for most of them I think the issuer that received the press attention  probably is more prone to problems and not as well managed as some of the others in our  District  Turning to wages and prices, some selected wage hikes are occurring On the  whole, however, the wage/price climate in the District remains subdued One manufacturing    3/25/97  CEO I recently spoke with, and I think she is representative of manufacturers generally, said  emphatically that increases in productivity will continue to absorb wage hikes  Turning to the nation, the uncomfortable uncertainty that most of us have felt  around the table over the last six to nine months is partly explained, I think, by how people  look at the economy Most people we talked with see the economy from their own point of  view They see business rolling in, stiff competition, and productivity going up They also  see some labor shortages, but those are the kinds of problems they like to live with Now,  that view contrasts with the macro framework that I think lays out the prospects for problems  down the road It strikes me that there is a greater divergence between the person-in-the-  street view and this macro framework than I have seen in a long time There is not much  appreciation, I think, for that macro framework view We have to weigh the risks, and my  sense is that the national economy has considerable self-feeding momentum Although  inflation is remarkably quiescent for now, I think the risks have shifted fairly substantially  toward the upside of too much demand pressing against supply down the road With the  strong demand, I think the current federal funds rate almost surely means that we are  pumping too much liquidity into the economy It is the old pegging problem that we know so  well from the past While patience has been wise, I think some insurance against overheating  makes sense now in order to keep the economic expansion on track   I support a 25 basis point increase We ought to explain this  tightening action by indicating that we think we will increase the chances of prolonging the  expansion by moving now We central bankers ought to like job creation; we ought to like  growth; we ought to like prosperity, and I think we ought to explain our actions in the context  of favoring those things Indeed, if we have learned anything, it is that low inflation is  pro-growth rather than anti-growth With regard to the symmetry issue, I think the choice of  symmetry or asymmetry is based on a flexible theology It seems to play different roles at  different meetings, and I do not have strong feelings one way or the other But I think your  rationale is as good as any, Mr Chairman, so I would vote for symmetry   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy  generally continues to operate at high levels, although the rate of growth has moderated some  in recent weeks The more moderate growth is most notable in manufacturing and auto sales  Manufacturers generally expect a high level of activity for the balance of the year but  relatively small additional increases Auto dealers, too, report less than buoyant sales  Retailing more broadly is doing well, although there is so much competition that anecdotal  reports from individual retailers sometimes understate the broader picture Restaurant sales  in particular are doing well, which is a fairly good indicator of consumer attitudes  Construction activity is mixed The outlook for commercial building in suburban locations is  strong Buildings are now selling for more than reproduction costs, and there are the  beginnings of some speculative building On the other hand, some shakeout is likely in the  construction of retail outlets, such as supermarkets, which are overbuilt  There is more than ample liquidity available, and competition to make commercial  loans is fierce One executive in a highly leveraged company told me that some lenders are  willing to lend up to 30 percent more than a new acquisition is worth Some REIT activity  also looks shortsighted By contrast, however, there does appear to be more caution in the  consumer lending area, particularly in credit cards    5/20/97  Labor markets are tight in many areas of the District One sign of this is that  parents, although greatly relieved, are pleasantly surprised that someone is willing to hire  their offspring There is some upcreep in wages as labor markets tighten around the District  Many businesses, however, still say that they cannot raise prices and therefore must offset  higher wage costs somewhere else, usually through improved efficiencies  Turning to the nation, the uncertainties on the demand side of the economy are  greater now than when we last met There also are continuing uncertainties on the supply  side On the demand side, growth clearly is moderating more than was forecast at the last  meeting What we do not know is how long the slower pace will continue My hunch is that  there is still a fair amount of self-feeding momentum underlying the expansion When  people earn more and feel more secure in their jobs, they spend more and businesses invest  more  I think the risks for demand are still on the upside, but there is more uncertainty  than when we last met On the supply side, the uncertainties remain about as they have been,  although with a higher level of anxiety as the economy moves further into territory not  charted for nearly three decades Both labor force growth and, apparently, productivity gains  have increased capacity limits surprisingly far without generating broad-based price  increases The risk is that overheating will occur at some point, and we want to avoid that to  prolong growth At the same time, we do not want to act prematurely or unnecessarily On  balance, this strikes me as more of a time for heightened surveillance than for overt action   This decision comes down to balancing the need for more  insurance versus wait-and-see I am more persuaded by the wait-and-see argument There  is, as I look at it, more upside risk on the demand side in the future, but there is also upside  potential on the supply side, which we have consistently underestimated If there is one  unifying theme that we pick up when we travel around our District, it is that there are  developments out there that really are enhancing productivity and working their way through  on the supply side I think a proactive monetary policy has to take both the demand side and  the supply side into account We want to see problems in a proactive sense, but we also need  to see benefits in a proactive sense I think it is a reasonable bet to have that wait-and-see  attitude, particularly since current monetary policy is not loose It is probably somewhat    5/20/97  restrictive, and I don't think we are that far behind the curve even if we are making a mistake  and should be tightening today I am quite comfortable with the "B" asymmetric proposal   In the memo that presents some of the options for dealing with  declining required operating balances at the Reserve Banks, you and Don Kohn addressed the  topic of returning to lagged reserve requirements from the current contemporaneous reserve  requirements regime There was a reference in that document to the preparation of another  memorandum    7/1-2/97  Could you elaborate on that in terms of whether that paper will be a discussion memorandum or  a decision-oriented memorandum Where are you on that issue?   As you know, this is an issue that has been debated at length at  various times We have had both regimes We had contemporaneous reserves before the late  1960s, when we went to lagged reserve requirements As we got into the monetary aggregates  approach to policy, we shifted back to contemporaneous reserves I think this is more than a  technical issue It has implications for how monetary policy is implemented or the perception of  how it is implemented I hope that this will not be treated as just a technical issue It ought to be  talked about in the broader context of monetary policy rather than in terms of accounting  changes It is a worthwhile debate to have, and we ought to have it in that broader context   Just to add a brief observation on the most recent point that was  made, I would agree that the importance of zero inflation is an article of faith among central  bankers and that we still have a lot of work ahead of us to make that case in society as a whole  But that is not my main point  I, too, thought that the paper was quite helpful One of its main conclusions is that all  the broad measures of inflation that were examined tend to move together over the long run but    7/1-2/97  not necessarily in the short run Therein lies a dilemma for policymakers While we need to  keep a focus on the longer term when we make monetary policy, we still make it in the short run  and we have to have justifications that carry some short-run weight Even if we ended up  picking the "best" measure of inflation, there would be periods when it would lead us astray and  some other measure or measures would be more accurate Therefore, I think at least one avenue  that we should pursue as we go further with this is to study the potential advantage of a basket of  price measures that would enable us to monitor multiple price indices rather than hanging  everything on one The Committee faced a similar problem in the period leading up to  Humphrey-Hawkins when we were supposed to target money The question then was what is  money? We had M0, Ml, M2, M3, and I think at one time we had up to M8 At some point, one  goes too far My main point is that whatever may be the strengths and advantages of individual  measures over time, in any given period a single measure can lead us astray While it is a little  untidy to look at a basket of measures, I think it would be helpful as we go forward to consider  such a basket as at least one alternative way that we might proceed   You can have it first among equals   I say "ditto" to all the arguments for alternative I--keeping the  long-run ranges the same On the issue of the role of M2, I think we have to spend a fair amount  of time talking about this among ourselves It is not an easy discussion The first issue is  whether M2 will be an intermediate target or an indicator, and there are various levels within  that I think we probably ought to get started discussing that among ourselves  On the communications issues, we can do better I think we are doing somewhat  better, but we can do a lot better Our basic problem is that our job requires short-run discipline    7/1-2/97  for long-run good, and that is not an obvious virtue, given human nature I think the way to do it  is to focus on jobs and growth; that should be the approach I think that deserves all of our  attention, not just in speeches but in one-on-one conversations and in informal gatherings We  can make our case a lot better than we have   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy is  paralleling the national economy Our region experienced robust growth in the first quarter, as  did the nation, and moderating growth in the second quarter, also like the nation The regional  outlook is positive There are tight labor markets but few, if any, signs of accelerating inflation  A major focus of management across a broad range of companies is to contain costs to protect  profit margins and hold the line on prices The major emphasis is to avoid increasing worker  head counts as production expands Companies are investing in labor-saving equipment and  technologies For example, in areas like law and real estate, which we do not often think about    7/1-2/97  in terms of labor-saving efforts, professionals are getting more done in less time by taking  advantage of advances in information processing and telecommunications equipment  Outsourcing is also increasing The use of variable pay and signing bonuses is becoming ever  more present to meet current needs while helping to hold down permanent increases in employee  compensation There is a huge cultural shift going on throughout the District in the way  management approaches cost containment, and its vigor is still intact  Turning to the nation, we find ourselves in a very favorable situation, just to introduce  a little joy into these discussions [Laughter] Demand has moderated but it is still solid, and  developments on the supply side have been surprisingly positive Producer prices have fallen  for five straight months; the last time that happened was in 1952 Consumer prices are rising at a  slower pace this year than last The unemployment rate is as low as it has been in 24 years  Nonetheless, there are legitimate concerns about what might go wrong, particularly in terms of  overheating of the economy and upside inflation risks, and I share those concerns But I also see  and hear what is going on in the real economy in terms of productivity increases and price  containment As I weigh the two sides, I feel comfortable with the wait-and-see approach that  we have followed in recent months   Don, I think the exercise you did on the various policy rules is quite  useful, and you and your colleagues are to be complimented for helping guide us through this  using that approach As you quite properly point out, however, the Achilles heel of this is  uncertainty We do not know the underlying structure of the economy with a high degree of  certainty; at least there are different views about it There is also uncertainty, often in real time,    7/1-2/97  about whether we are dealing with a supply shock or a demand shock What happens  analytically to this approach if one relaxes the rather Herculean assumption of certainty and says  we really do not have a high level of understanding of the underlying structure and there is  uncertainty about whether there are demand or supply shocks? Is there an analytical way to deal  with that or do you just end up with something that is not very definitive?   In recent years we have moved in the direction of transparency and  clarity in terms of making public what we do We debated for years, for example, whether we  ought to announce our decisions promptly I think we are much better off because we now  announce them We were concerned about what would happen if we released the transcripts, and  I am not aware of any adverse results from our doing that I think the proposed rewording of the  directive is just a continuation of our movement toward being more transparent and clear One  can quibble about the words and we don't necessarily have to make the proposed changes today,  but as a general matter I think it would be helpful to continue to move in this direction There  are times when one may want constructive opaqueness, but I am in favor of the proposed  rewording because it points toward more openness and transparency   Our basic dilemma is that the real world is operating differently from  what our preconceived notions would suggest We do not know if this divergence between our  models and actual experience is temporary or permanent At a minimum, this situation suggests  caution and a wait-and-see attitude At this point, I think "B" asymmetric captures that posture  nicely and I support it   Thank you, Mr Chairman The pace of economic activity in the  Philadelphia District is picking up somewhat in the third quarter after moderating in the second  Labor markets are tight, with some upward pressure on wages Businesses, however, are still    8/19/97  finding ways to offset higher wage costs Inflationary pressures therefore remain muted  Manufacturers, retailers, and contractors are all showing moderate increases in business activity  Loan volumes are up slightly Firms generally are doing very well in maintaining their cost  structure All in all, my impression is that the District economy is growing steadily without  noticeable excesses This steady growth environment is particularly helpful in alleviating some of  the long-standing social problems that one finds in a large northeastern city like Philadelphia  Turning to the national economy, there does appear to be some pickup in final sales  during the current quarter The amount of inventory accumulation is uncertain and quarter-to-  quarter growth rates are therefore uncertain as well More basically, the economy appears to be  growing moderately, with tight resource usage Conventional economic models point to upward  price pressures, as they have for some time They may be right or they may be wrong, but in the  meantime actual signs of an inflationary buildup are shadowy at best There still is a strong case  for us to wait and watch   I was just going to say, Mr Chairman, that you have made wonderful  progress here this morning, and I do not think we ought to jeopardize it We ought to support it as  a group and consider it time well spent   If I could, I would   I will make an honorary motion   And the Chairman   I agree with your "B" asymmetric proposal   The economy in the Philadelphia District currently is performing much  as it has in recent months It features steady growth at a moderate pace, tight labor markets, and  little or no upward pressure on prices In commercial real estate, vacancy rates are low and rents  are rising More capacity is in train, however, and rents are expected to be under less pressure as    9/30/97  more space is completed As yet, there is surprisingly little speculative building going on in the  Third District Although wage increases seem to be holding at around 4 percent, there are more  reports of additional perks, signing bonuses, and other incentives to attract and retain skilled  people With business activity generally favorable, attitudes are positive but tough competition  seems to be providing a restraining influence on the development of a boom mentality  Turning to the nation, we are in a reasonably comfortable position for now Actual  performance at the macro level continues to be surprisingly good, and the risks to that favorable  performance are largely unchanged from recent months Like some of the rest of us, I did  appreciate the confessions of a tortured staff Perhaps the time has come for all of us to torture  ourselves less Most people like to be right rather than wrong; most would rather have the outcome  turn out to be better than worse The problem here is that things have turned out to be better, but  most of us have been wrong [Laughter] Depending on one's mindset, each of us will respond  either by saying, "The old model is still true; just give it time; it will reassert itself," or by saying,  "There is a new model at work and the world is indeed different" My guess is that the truth is  probably somewhere in the middle We just do not know where in the middle at this point But I  think the time has come for us to be less defensive, and the way we do that is to adopt the stance of  being open minded and alert and let the truth, whatever it is, fall out wherever it might In the  meantime, we make the best judgments we can If we are right, we are right; and if we are wrong,  we are wrong But I do not think we ought to torture ourselves any longer   I agree with your recommendation, and I have an open mind about what  will occur in November and December   In the interest of brevity, I will touch on only a few highlights The  economy in the Philadelphia District is operating at a high level with tight labor markets, but the  pace of demand has moderated some, notably in retailing and manufacturing There are several  other areas, however, that suggest that new attitudes are developing Business demand for new  office space is very strong, and landlords clearly are in the driver's seat Commercial loan  demand is also very strong, but the competition to make loans is intense As a result, bank  margins are thin and the terms are very liberal Lenders, if reminded, remember the lessons of  the late 1980s and early 1990s, but that influence on their current decisions is weakening REITs  have a lot of money Armed with a lot of cash, they are bidding up the prices of almost any  property that has some value They still seem, at least in the Third District, to be more interested  in buying than building, although I think that will change as prices exceed reproduction costs In  the credit card area, although there is justifiably a lot of concern, delinquencies have stabilized,  albeit at a higher level than a year ago Anecdotally, the credit card issuers have been trying to  do something about the quality of their new issues But I don't think what we're seeing suggests  that they are successful because the new issues seem to have about the same quality as the older  vintages  In our market, wages had been going up in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range I think the  typical increase is now settling in at a fairly solid 4 percent growth rate and labor markets are  tight Nonetheless, the familiar story is still there about the inability to raise prices, and I think  that is holding overwhelmingly I do not sense an increase in inflationary psychology  Turning to the nation briefly, the situation is that demand was supposed to moderate  but it has not, just as the inflation rate was supposed to accelerate but it has not When we throw    11/12/97 74  in the market turmoil that we have had, I think recent developments point at least to deferring a  decision today Nonetheless, given all the uncertainties as we look forward and weighing all the  pros and cons, it does seem to me that the risks of overheating have increased somewhat In  particular, one is beginning to see some attitudes that could very well become excessive on the  bullish side Thank you, Mr Chairman   I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Philadelphia District  is operating at a high level, with most sectors doing well Labor markets, as elsewhere, are very  tight, but inflation remains subdued despite some upward pressures on compensation We talk  about the tight labor markets, but business people are doing a lot more than talking about it  They are being rather creative in terms of attracting people who ordinarily would not be  available to work For example, along some of the main arteries in the Philadelphia region, we  see large signs advertising job opportunities at ABC company or XYZ company Local theaters  advertise jobs in their film clips Instead of just getting previews of the next film, the moviegoer  gets a film clip about working for specific companies Flyers about available jobs are being  distributed at senior citizens' meetings and in grocery stores I am told that serious consideration  has been given in some schools to sending flyers home with school children to invite their  parents or other caretakers to call a number or come to a particular place to discuss available    12/16/97 32  jobs The subways, buses, and taxis also are getting advertising from employers So, business is  responding to this labor scarcity and is exercising some flexibility in terms of enticing  unemployed people to accept jobs Clearly, there are limits to this process, but I think those  limits are being pushed back  In the consumer spending area, holiday retail sales seem to be doing reasonably well  overall However, one can get quite a mixed message depending on whom one talks to  Competition is fierce, and the patterns of retail sales are changing Sales through the TV  medium and catalogue sales are taking away some business from traditional retailers The large  malls with the more established stores seem to be doing well, whereas the big box retail stores  and strip malls tend to be having a tougher time We can get any story we want depending on  whom we talk to on any given day, but if we put it all together, I think we come away with a  sense that holiday sales are doing reasonably well  The commercial real estate market continues to tighten and office vacancy rates are  dropping Home builders and real estate agents report that demand for both new and existing  homes is quite healthy At this point, manufacturers report some moderation in demand and  output, but they do not point in particular to the Asian situation, although they may well do so  over the next several weeks  We in the Fed and other central banks focus on inflation and the goal of price stability  Being a good central banker, I always warn people of the risks of inflation and the virtues of  price stability When I finish that talk, the first question I get now concerns what I think about  deflation In my view, this deflation talk is not something one can just dismiss That's mainly  because it is coming from fairly sensible people, the same people who told us not to worry a    12/16/97 33  whole lot about inflation in 1996 and 1997 when we insisted that there was a big problem In  part, I believe these comments are reflecting the fierce competition that businesses face, and they  also reflect the fact that most businesses find deflation harmful I think they would rather have a  little inflation than a little deflation Nonetheless, while we do not have to buy into it and we  want to be sure to keep it in perspective, this is something that we ought not to dismiss out of  hand as coming from people who are ill-informed  On the international side I want to compliment President McDonough on his analysis  It was a very insightful analysis of what is happening and I appreciate very much having it  As far as the national economy goes, we are in an enviable position in terms of  underlying demand in the economy, in terms of job creation, and in terms of benign inflation  There clearly are risks and we have talked about those risks for months I think we need to be  flexible both in our assessment of where the risks lie and what monetary policy might or might  not have to do over the next 12 months or so   I support your recommendation for "B" I think the case for staying  where we are is overwhelming today The issue of symmetry is a more marginal decision, and I  don't have strong feelings about it one way or the other In my view, the major case for  removing the asymmetry is that symmetry is probably a more accurate description of where  policy is Now and then, I think we ought to be accurate [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Philadelphia  region remains strong and labor markets are tight, but there are few indications that  inflation is accelerating Businesses in the District continue to find ways to deal with  tight labor markets One illustration is an auto manufacturing plant in the District that  was faced with a strong demand for a new sports utility vehicle Recognizing the  difficulty of finding 850 additional workers to add a third shift, the company spent some  $30 million to install new robotic equipment over the Christmas holidays, thereby  reducing the need for additional workers to 350 Indeed, the substitution of capital  equipment for production workers by manufacturers is widespread in the District    2/3-4/98  Construction workers are in strong demand not so much for adding bricks and mortar but  because producers of everything from pet food to railroad wheels are installing new  equipment as labor-saving devices  In the residential area, as some others have reported, District builders tell me that  the demand for new housing is very strong As an example of that, Super Bowl Sunday is  usually a very slow day for showing real estate, but this year the floor traffic was heavy  and sales were quite strong The price increases for new homes appear to be holding,  although prices for existing homes remain flat There seems to be a real change in tastes  If a seller has a regular sized bedroom and a regular sized bath, the house will not move  Buyers want bathrooms as big as traditional bedrooms  We are hearing reports from some manufacturers who export to Asia that some  orders are being cancelled and others postponed The Asian problem is also affecting  agriculture Poultry is a big industry in the Third District, particularly in Delaware and  the south central part of Pennsylvania With the bird flu scare in Asia and the strong  dollar, there is a slowing demand for poultry exports to Asia As a result, this poultry is  being sold on the domestic market and chicken prices are coming down  Turning to the nation, I think there are three key uncertainties that we need to deal  with The first is that the national data show a very powerful economy in 1997 coming  into 1998, fueled largely by strong consumption and investment growth Our evaluation  of the anecdotal information points to some slowing in demand stemming from the fallout  from the Asian situation But how much of a damping effect is uncertain, although I see  more growth than the Greenbook    2/3-4/98  The second uncertainty is that the disinflation process has had surprising staying  power Wage gains continue to be offset by productivity gains, so inflation is falling  while corporate profits remain high How much more staying power this disinflation  process has is also uncertain, although I suspect it has a while to run If businesses cannot  get more volume out of existing resources, they undertake additional rounds of  downsizing  The third uncertainty, which is more for discussion tomorrow so I will touch on it  only briefly, is that monetary policy is roughly neutral, but it may be tightening implicitly  with the nominal fed funds rate held constant and inflationary expectations falling  However, the money supply has been growing faster lately  What should we make of these uncertainties in the national economy? I think we  need a wide peripheral vision because I don't think we know where the real danger is  going to come from   I support alternative I largely for the reasons articulated by  Governor Meyer Regarding the point that Governor Rivlin raised about consistency, we  probably ought to postpone that debate for a long time because it will open up deep  theological arguments that do not tend to get us very far   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman Your logic is  indisputable   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Philadelphia District  is growing at the same rapid pace as last year Job growth has expanded to all sectors including  manufacturing, which had been a drag on the regional economy Labor markets are very tight  Compensation costs are rising, but apparently so is productivity growth There is little evidence  of rising inflation  As others have said, the anecdotal comments from the business community revolve  mostly around people issues The most frequently heard comment is that qualified workers are  scarce and they are becoming more expensive There is more job-hopping as compensation is  bid up One labor leader told me that the building trades are having trouble attracting qualified  workers because wages in manufacturing have now surpassed those in construction  For the first time in several years, I also am hearing comments about a shift in the  psychology of the workplace In the wake of corporate downsizing, there was job insecurity and  people tended to work longer and harder Now there is an emerging view among workers that  they cannot keep up the pace any longer It would appear that job insecurity is beginning to turn  the other way, and workers are looking for things like more vacations and more predictability in  their work schedules If they're not getting that from their current employer, they can get a job  somewhere else with a significant increase in pay In conjunction with the tightness in the labor  market and the increasing costs associated with it, I continue to hear stories about the pervasive  use of technology throughout the economy to increase productivity It is one story after another,  and one gets the sense that the end is nowhere in sight, that we are in one of those periods where  this process is likely to go on for some time  Turning to the national economy, it seems that we are still being dealt the same hand  that we have been dealt for a number of months We have ongoing strength in demand and very    3/31/98  tight labor markets that by past standards should be causing inflation to accelerate, but that  acceleration is not happening We also have the card that points to some prospective slowing in  the pace of demand, and that slowing is not materializing either We all hear anecdotally about  significant productivity growth, but it is not being captured fully in the statistics I also think we  have the same hand being dealt to us as far as policy goes That is a wait-and-see policy versus  some kind of preemptive action We will be talking about that later   I think we have an unsustainable situation Unless we are quite  fortunate and get some offset to inflationary demand pressures other than through policy action,  we indeed will have to face up to making a policy adjustment and probably more than once  On the issue of preparing the market, I think a policy speech by you at the appropriate  time is far superior to a two or three sentence press release There are a couple of reasons One,  I think that if you need to make such a policy statement, we have to be prepared to follow fairly  quickly with policy action We don't want to get ourselves into a "cry wolf" situation where we  talk and do not act So, I would prefer that you wait until it looks as though a policy action needs  to take place Your speech would prepare the markets at that time, and a policy action would  follow Ultimately, it is actions, not words, that count, and words will only matter if they are  followed by action Second, I would suggest that in addition to the usual macroeconomic  rationale for action, such a policy speech should stress that we like good times, that we like  people to have jobs, and that we are acting to sustain the good times The point was made earlier  that the lower echelons of the labor force are now beginning to participate in this prosperity, and  they would be the first to be unemployed if things went awry I think it is important that we also    3/31/98  make a point like that because it helps to give a balanced view of our policy It indicates that we  are not against growth and against lower echelon workers making progress and, indeed, that we  are moving to sustain such progress I would urge you to add that to the usual macro analysis   On the proposed changes to the securities lending program, you  indicate in the memo that you plan to use a noon auction What are your thoughts about lending in  times of stress? Would you have to supplement that noon auction later in the day? Why noon?  Why not 130 or 100 pm? How will you deal with problems of demand after noon?   The regional economy around Philadelphia continues to operate at a  fairly high level with mostly modest growth There are few signs of upward price pressures  Among the anecdotal tidbits that I have picked up around the District in recent weeks is that one in  four jobs is likely to go unfilled this summer in District shore areas There seems to be an increase  in the number of retail customers who cannot complete purchases because their credit cards are  "maxed out" There also are quite a few bankruptcies and delinquencies One Philadelphia firm,    5/19/98  for example, has sent 14 of its 250 employees to credit counseling school in recent months But  almost everywhere in the District, and this is the unifying theme, people are in an upbeat mood  At the national level, we find ourselves facing much the same economic situation that  we had in March Employment and output growth appear unsustainably strong, but there is little  evidence that inflationary pressures have begun to build We are wondering how soon or whether  growth in aggregate demand will slow or inflation build if the fed funds rate remains unchanged  Early data for the current quarter are inconclusive about any slowing in the expansion Higher  compensation costs and a slightly faster rise in the CPI in recent months are possible early warning  signs of accelerating inflation, but that evidence also is not conclusive The acceleration in M2 also  might be an early warning sign, but that too is questionable So, with data that remain unclear, we  basically are still in the business of balancing risks to determine what the appropriate course for  monetary policy ought to be The risks for the real sector are, in my judgment, still tilted toward  the upside as they were in March  The risks in the financial sector also are tilted in the direction of excess Some  examples are the narrowing of spreads, strong competition for lending that has led to an easing in  credit terms, a high level of consumer debt and personal bankruptcies, expansion of subprime  lending with questionable terms--for example, 125 percent loan-to-value ratios for home equity  lending--rising prices of homes and office buildings, rapid expansion of REIT activity, narrow risk  spreads between Treasuries and corporate bonds including junk bonds, and rapid growth of the junk  bond sector so far this year I would also mention the stock market, where P/E ratios seem out of  phase, and the strength of the merger movement, with merger offers that involve growing  premiums over current stock prices None of these signs is conclusive individually as an indicator  of major financial excess One can make that case, but I don't think it is that convincing a case    5/19/98  They do bear watching, however, because excesses in the financial sector can easily undermine the  pursuit of maximum sustainable growth and output  Where I come out is that our ready, alert position of recent weeks remains  appropriate, although we certainly have a number of things that we need to watch closely going  forward in the coming weeks   I think this is one of those decisions where we have come to the end  of the line as far as whether hard analysis will give us the answer; it will not This is a period  where we must use our judgment Our judgment over the past year or more has been to be patient  It is tempting to overdo something that has worked in the past, but my judgment is that we ought to  keep things where they are for now In the spirit of humility that has been expressed, I'm not sure I  am right, and I don't think anybody else can be that sure either But my judgment coincides with  your judgment, Mr Chairman, to stay where we are   While our attention has been focused mostly on Southeast Asia, the  situation in Russia is deteriorating and seems to be extremely vulnerable Could you or someone  comment on that? Do we have any relationship with Russia, formal or informal, that would get  us involved in their problem?   South Africa?   I am sympathetic to the position that you laid out initially, Mr  Chairman, and while there is some intellectual case for changing the debt range, I do not think it  is worth the effort at this point I therefore would be for keeping the ranges as they are   The economy of the Philadelphia District continues to operate at high  levels, but the rate of increase appears to be slowing The labor market in the District reflects  this situation with a low unemployment rate and slowing job growth, and there continues to be  little upward pressure on prices Home sales have been doing very well in recent months Land  prices have been rising, but builders have had trouble passing through these increases Buyers  are shopping a lot and they are pressing builders for lower prices When there have been price  increases, they generally have been modest National builders have made competition even  more fierce for local builders and, as a consequence, builders have had to be more efficient to  maintain reasonable margins Despite widespread indications of high levels of demand,  producers continue to have little ability to raise prices, and this phenomenon is still widespread  in the District whether in construction, retailing, or manufacturing  Turning to the national economy, the basic story in the Greenbook of moderating  growth and modest inflationary pressures in the context of a lot of uncertainty strikes me as  being reasonable The only part of that forecast that I have a good deal of confidence in is the  "lot of uncertainty" part I have the sense that what we see as the most likely outcome is less  likely than earlier and that both upside and downside risks have increased in recent weeks We  have little practical choice but to be patient and alert in this environment   If there ever was a time to hold steady, it is now We have a  precarious international situation that I think is as dangerous to world prosperity as we have had  in a long time We also have latitude to wait and see domestically Our backs are not to the wall  in that regard and, therefore, I think the case is very persuasive that we should stay where we are  with regard to monetary policy    6/30-7/1/98  As far as the tilt of the directive is concerned, I think continuing with the current tilt  toward tightening is appropriate going forward I say that mainly because I do not believe we  know enough about whether it would be constructive to make a change at this point   This is a topic that has been the basis for a lot of discussion from time  to time, and I think it is worthwhile to bring it back and discuss it again because circumstances    6/30-7/1/98  change, people's views change, and the Committee's membership changes I would like to  provide a few observations because this is not the first time I have been through this  I believe most of us around the table start with a bias toward giving the public more  information But I think there are two basic reasons why we should not end up disclosing the tilt  or regularly making statements when we do not change policy They come down in my view to  the quality of the information that we would be releasing and the quality of the deliberations that  we have around the table  I think it is beneficial to give the public a lot of information about monetary policy,  and we do give the public a lot But giving misinformation is harmful As an illustration, one  only needs to look at the ambiguity that surrounds the tilt Markets do not have a clear  understanding of what we mean by our "woulds" and "mights" For example, some analysts say  that the asymmetry toward tightening that the Committee adopted in March means members  agree that a rate hike is more likely than a rate cut Others say the asymmetry means members  agree that their next move will be to raise rates, though the timing is up in the air Yet another  group says the asymmetry was meant to prepare the markets to give the Committee room to act  at today's meeting or the May meeting I recall analysts explaining not too many years ago that  an asymmetric directive meant that the Committee had given the Chairman leeway to change  rates between FOMC meetings, while symmetry meant the Committee had decided to tie the  Chairman's hands This ambiguity is not terribly important when the tilt is old news, but I  believe ambiguity about the meaning of asymmetry in a current directive plants the seeds of  considerable confusion  Then the issue is whether we could clear up this ambiguity The problem is that it is  hard to clarify the ambiguity for the public when we are not clear about the meaning of    6/30-7/1/98  asymmetry among ourselves The reason is that it has meant different things to different  Committee members in different circumstances In that kind of situation, the task of crafting an  explanation that does not mislead is at best a challenging one and the likely outcome is that the  effort will end up being an exercise in frustration or one that will produce boilerplate  The second reason for not increasing the amount of disclosure is its effect on the  quality of the deliberations Quicker and more complete disclosure already has changed the  nature of the Committee's deliberations I am for the disclosure that we do, but we should not  mislead ourselves about how it has changed the nature of these proceedings I recall  participating in routine, vigorous, and freewheeling debates in this room before we decided to  release transcripts Now, most of us read prepared remarks about our Districts and the national  economy and even our comments on near-term policy sometimes are crafted in advance  Prepared statements were the rare exception rather than the rule until we started to release  transcripts  So the issue is how early release of the tilt will change the nature of our deliberations  I think it will Announcing the tilt of the current directive ultimately will lead us to avoid  asymmetry altogether I think that will eliminate a consensus-building tool that has benefited our  decisionmaking process and has helped avoid the hardening of positions Announcing the tilt of  the current directive when we have not decided to change policy immediately inevitably will  invite more speculation and even lobbying of individuals about the timing of our next move I  suspect that over time a majority of the Committee will develop a preference for symmetric  directives just to avoid these kinds of announcement effects  In most cases when the Committee has adopted an asymmetric directive, it has voted  for no immediate change in policy There have been a few times when the Committee has    6/30-7/1/98  adopted an asymmetric directive along with a 25 basis point change in the federal funds rate  But in most cases, perhaps all, the asymmetric directive helped build a larger majority for  consensus I think consensus is useful, particularly, as we discussed last night at the UK  embassy dinner, because what has evolved is a collective responsibility and accountability for  this Committee rather than the individual responsibility that has developed in England I had the  sense last night that they wished they were closer to us than where they are now  I think we send a louder, stronger message when we do change the funds rate if we have  this consensus-building, collective-accountability approach If we do not have the asymmetry  available as part of our directives, I think we will see more 8 to 4 votes and 7 to 5 votes Is that  bad? Maybe not But when I came away from the discussion last night, I sensed that we are  better off the way we do things here  The bottom line is that releasing the tilt in the current directive is not likely to give the  public much useful information about monetary policy, but it is likely to reduce the quality of  our deliberations and our ability to build a consensus  That leads to the issue of releasing a statement after all meetings in which we do not  change the existing policy stance but without identifying the tilt in the directive I believe such a  statement would fairly quickly lead to demands to identify the tilt We cannot avoid making the  tilt known for very long if we start to make regular announcements What would happen if we  did not announce the tilt is that outside observers would pore over every word in the  announcement in an effort to determine whether there is a tilt or not So, I think the two go  together  I personally believe that we have found about the right balance for now between the  public's right to know and the public's interest in having a high-quality decisionmaking process    6/30-7/1/98  for monetary policy No tradeoff is perfect, but I think that what we have works rather well most  of the time In the rare exceptions when we might want to provide some information about the  tilt and our policy direction or to prepare the markets for a near-term policy change, I think we  have ample vehicles to do that that are consistent with our collective accountability, notably the  voice of the Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, will try to be brief Not a lot has  changed in the Philadelphia District The region generally remains strong, although growth has  slowed This is showing up in manufacturing where the effects of Asia are apparent, particularly  with producers of building materials, chemicals, and machinery The same phenomenon of a high  level of sales but slowing growth is apparent in retailing Although the national news reports have  spotlighted the weakness in autos, sales of automotive products apart from GM products generally  have been strong in our area Construction is robust, both residential and commercial There  may be some slowing of construction activity in our District The reason is not so much because  of a lack of demand but I think because of some bottlenecks related to the shortage of machinery  and labor A number of people around the table have commented on the problems in agriculture,  and they certainly are severe, but I would like to add a footnote to that Apparently, "fat is back"  and the dairy farmers in my District are pleased about that People want some taste back in their    8/18/98  food Milk fat prices are up and milk now joins red wine, martinis, and eggs in making a  comeback I have heard complaints from dairy farmers for years, and it is nice now and then to  hear something positive from them Labor markets remain tight in our District, although wage  increases are generally moderate and the phenomenon of not being able to raise prices is still  heard among businesses around the District  As far as the nation goes, I think the biggest change since we last met is that the  problems in Asia and their spillover effects appear to be more severe or at least make me feel as  though the global economy is in a more precarious situation US inflation remains subdued, and  in my estimation the threat of a breakout on the upside has lessened So, whereas the risks in  recent months were thought to be more pronounced on the side of greater inflation, they now seem  to me to be more balanced   I support a "no change" policy, and I think the risks have shifted  sufficiently to justify a symmetric directive   I agree with the simpler language I, too, think that Tom has  improved it, and I would go with that While I realize that it's difficult to be against providing  more information, I continue to have some problems with immediate release of the tilt I am for  more information as a general matter, but I believe the practical outcome of prompt release of  our decision on the tilt would be less use of it Monetary policy does not take place in a vacuum  It takes place in a wider social and political environment In that environment, it is almost  always easier to lower interest rates than it is to raise them If we are planning to raise interest    9/29/98  rates, we may as well get a real bang for the buck and actually do it If we say we might raise  them and then fail to do so, we are going to get the inevitable announcement effect and the  associated criticism for doing it There will be a further "announcement" effect later when  nothing happens I think we will go through that exercise a few times and conclude that it really  is not worth doing Not acting in the direction of a tilt may also erode our credibility The tilt  may be useful for our internal deliberations, but we would be using it less and adopting  symmetric directives more frequently So, I have real doubts that this kind of disclosure would  actually contribute to clarity And I therefore have misgivings about moving in the direction  where the majority opinion appears to be going   The Philadelphia District economy, while still operating at high  levels, is showing some early warning signs of deterioration Business people have become  more uncertain and in some cases apprehensive This anxiety began in manufacturing and is  now spilling over to other businesses as well The outlook now is significantly more guarded  compared to several months ago However, measured deterioration and actual business  conditions today are still mostly concentrated in manufacturing Other sectors report more a  fraying around the edges Retailing and construction are still holding up Bankers report less  loan demand and still acute competition, and lending terms remain looser than one might expect  in this environment, especially among smaller and medium-size banks Inflation is a word that    9/29/98  is hardly used in the District Labor markets are still tight, although the squeeze on earnings and  less demand for exports are prompting a few layoffs and talk of more layoffs around the District  Turning to the nation, the risks clearly have shifted to the downside Global financial  stresses are closing in on the American economy and are likely to continue to do so for some  time With the Treasury yield curve now completely below the federal funds rate and the real  fed funds rate rising, there is a persuasive case for a decrease in the fed funds rate I believe,  however, that we have not fallen behind the curve and that we are still in a position to be  preemptive While it is important to move today, we also do not want to convey a sense of panic  or that things are getting away from us I think that what easing we do should be deliberate   A 25 basis point reduction captures my feeling I think it is the right  measure of response at this point As far as the tilt is concerned, I'm almost indifferent about it  I believe that we are going to be so driven by events that the tilt is likely to have no substantive  influence on what we do If we had a different disclosure policy and there were an  announcement effect, I think it would be worth spending more time on this question, but I am  happy to go along with your recommendation   I prefer Option 2 In my view, it captures what we have been talking  about around the table I would drop the sentence beginning with "Any potential changes" My  only reason for suggesting its deletion is that I think it is basically redundant, though it is  substantively harmless We need to have a Chairman who is fully effective A fully effective    11/17/98  Chairman needs to be able to change the federal funds rate between meetings If dropping or  adding this sentence in any way affects that, I am for whichever strengthens the Chairman's hand  to be fully effective   Business conditions in the Philadelphia region have been steady  overall, but there is a continuing weakness in manufacturing Looking ahead, business contacts  expect some slight improvement in economic activity going into next year, but there is a cautious  tone to this forecast In the interest of moving the meeting along, I will skip the District details  Clearly, the national economy is currently showing a lot of resiliency, given the  turmoil in financial markets Perhaps the economy will escape major damage and continue to  move forward at a healthy clip The most likely outlook, however, is for a slowing of growth for  the reasons already given, particularly the international ones In short, the risks are on the  downside With inflationary pressures subdued, we have the flexibility to take out some  additional insurance against excessive weakness in demand  Financial markets have improved from their earlier unstable condition, but they are not  yet back to normal We need to continue to facilitate a return to normalcy Financial markets  currently are like a sick person who feels better after taking antibiotics for a few days but still  needs to stay on medication to avoid a relapse and to aid a return to good health In short, in    11/17/98  both the real sector and the financial markets, we have downside risks that, in my judgment, need  to be counteracted   I support your recommendation In the interest of time, I associate  myself with the remarks of Governor Ferguson   I believe Don Kohn deserves to be complimented, but I don't think  I'd go as far as others have! [Laughter] I think it is a learning step It is a good compromise I  hope that we all keep open minds and indeed do learn from it At some appropriate time we can  then weigh the evidence and decide what we want to do It may indeed turn out to be a good  step; it may not be a good step But I think a learning step is a step in the right direction   The regional economy in the Philadelphia District is healthy,  although weakness in manufacturing persists Attitudes are positive and prospects for continued  expansion are good Retail sales appear to be matching expectations Consumers are shopping,  though, with an eye for bargains High-end brands that offer good values are moving while    12/22/98 31  high-end brands that simply offer prestige are sitting on the shelf Supermarkets have been  responding to value-concerned consumers as well by upgrading the quality of their store brands  while holding prices below those of nationally advertised brands As a result--and I think this is  an interesting statistic--the store-brand share of sales has risen recently to 25 percent from about  15 percent Auto dealers report the same value consciousness because they have to offer  discounts to move cars Pressures on profit margins are mentioned frequently by business  people Wage costs are up some, but raising prices is not competitively feasible  In commercial construction, there appears to be a reasonable balance of supply and  demand The rental market is strong and vacancy rates are low, but there are a few signs of  overbuilding The market is expected to stay on a solid footing, with vacancy rates stabilizing  around 10 percent and with no building boom All in all, the regional economy appears to be on  track for moderate growth during the coming months, with labor markets tight and inflation in  check  For the national economy, I think we have an unusually wide spectrum of plausible  outcomes I can envision an economy that expands well above the Greenbook forecast The  economy has shown a lot of resiliency There is an internal dynamic there that could provide the  wherewithal for a surprisingly strong growth rate next year I can also envision an economy that  comes in on the weak side There are vulnerabilities and we all know them; I don't need to tick  them off A combination of adverse factors could make for a very bearish performance The  Greenbook forecast is a reasonable guess among these wide-ranging alternatives Who knows, it  might actually come to pass, more or less That is a compliment! [Laughter]    12/22/98 32  The good news is that we are operating in a low inflation, high employment  environment that allows some maneuvering room for monetary policy should the unexpected  occur But in the current relative calm, we still need to stay awake and remain alert   I support "B" symmetric without any agonizing! [Laughter]   May I ask one question, Mr Chairman? I was one who, just for  language purposes, wanted to drop the sentence "Any potential changes in the federal funds  rate" Some expressed a concern that one of the subtleties of that wording related to your  authority to act on the Committee's behalf between meetings One view was that dropping that  sentence somehow might be interpreted or perceived as compromising your authority between  meetings My question to you is Do you believe that the deletion of that sentence in any way  creates a perception of compromising your authority?   Thank you   I am for option 3 I would drop "in coming months" for the same  reasons and with the same degree of conviction that Governor Kelley expressed I am practically  indifferent about the last sentence On balance, I would probably keep it in   I would like to hear Governor Kelley’s long and careful   reasoning!    I’d just like to comment on the broad issue rather than make   specific suggestions for change One of the criticisms traditionally leveled at the central   bank is that we are a peculiar institution in a democracy in that we are not accountable   and somehow are out there on our own While the Humphrey-Hawkins reporting has not   eliminated that criticism, it does seem to me that it goes a long way toward saying that   indeed we are accountable It gives us an opportunity to explain what we are doing and   to consult with the Congress So, I think Humphrey-Hawkins has turned out to be very     2/2-3/99 82   useful, not only for us as a central bank but also because it probably has enhanced   understanding to some extent on Capitol Hill   In terms of the broad issue, I think we ought to come down foursquare in support   of a continuation of the basic nature of the Humphrey-Hawkins report and the testimony   That said, there probably are some modifications that might be put on the table that could   improve it or bring it more into line with some of the things we actually do I’d like to   give some further thought to what those modifications might be specifically But on the   broad question of its reauthorization, I think we ought to be for continuing it    That’s a good point    Yes, I agree    I think Alice has spoken wisely; I think she’s right    I could just say that the District economy is doing well and that   the risks to the national economy are balanced, but I will bow to Committee tradition and   elaborate some   The regional economy in the Philadelphia District remains strong and, if anything,   has picked up a little strength recently Manufacturing has accelerated in recent weeks,   following several months of deterioration Retail sales have held up, with notable   strength in autos Home building has been on the rise Commercial construction is doing   well without the emergence of the kind of boom/bust signs that have characterized the   industry in past expansions Labor markets remain tight There are layoffs among some   of the larger firms, but smaller firms are hungry for employees Large signing bonuses   for some job specialties such as programmers are common, but general wage pressures   are not showing through in the form of higher prices     2/2-3/99 56   Looking ahead, most business people feel confident about the outlook for 1999,   but on the whole they expect a less robust year than in 1998 The risks to the national   outlook are still broadly balanced with perhaps a shade more upside than downside risk   because of the momentum from domestic demand coming into the new year   Nonetheless, the downside risks are there, mostly in the form of potential turmoil   emanating from international developments With inflation low and not likely to   accelerate quickly, we have the luxury of watching and waiting    This is really a question, even though it might sound like a   comment! [Laughter] If we try to choose between the world in Chart 3 and the world in   Chart 4, I think we have to be somewhat agnostic and have a fair amount of humility   But as long as we’re being humble and as long as we’re being somewhat agnostic, how   do we know there isn’t a Chart 5 that represents a different world?  How do we know that   the NAIRU couldn’t be 4 or 3½ percent?  If one goes back, for example, to the 1960s   there was a lot of talk that we could have price stability and unemployment rates of 3½   percent or certainly 4 percent I think the term used was “3 to 4 percent” I don’t know   whether that is realistic or not I believe if any of us had been asked two or three years   ago if we thought we could have a 4½ percent unemployment rate and inflation still   falling, we would have said that was a pretty nutty idea How do we know that the string   has run out? How do we know that we can’t have a still better world?  The question is     2/2-3/99 102   whether we have looked at that possibility analytically I ask because I think we do have   some historical experience where unemployment of 3 to 4 percent without rising inflation   was considered realistic    I support your “B” symmetric recommendation I believe   watching and waiting is the right approach at this point I think most of us feel that we   are sitting on a situation that is really very positive; or at least our experience over the last   several years has been favorable We may have some inner sense that it will not last or   that we are going to have to do something over the next few months Maybe we will or   maybe we won’t I have a completely open mind as to what the next move on policy   might be I do think that when reality tells us something different from the models that   we ought to take a new look at the models Your contribution this morning was helpful   in that regard   As far as NAIRU is concerned, my personal view is that it is a useful analytical   tool for economic research but that it has about zero value in terms of making policy   because it bounces around so much that it is very elusive I would not want our policy   decisions to get tied all that closely to it, especially when most of the NAIRU models   have been so far off in recent years   As far as your testimony goes, I think it would be appropriate to lay out the   possibility that we may have to tighten and for you to describe the kinds of circumstances   that might lead us to that On the other hand, that discussion ought to be balanced in the   sense that there may be a set of circumstances in which we do not have to tighten So,   the possibility of tightening ought to be raised, but the possibility that we might not have   to tighten also ought to be discussed    Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the   Philadelphia District remains strong and shows few signs of slowing Labor markets   continue to be tight, but competition remains fierce and there appear to be few   inflationary pressures The outlook is also positive whether one talks to manufacturers,   retailers, auto dealers, homebuilders, or commercial real estate people That said,   however, one does not get the feeling that we are crossing over from strong growth to   boom conditions There is an absence of inflationary pressures in the pipeline   Businesses are still operating on the basis that prices will not rise There is, to be sure,   some upward pressure on wages, but productivity gains and cost-cutting are acting as   effective offsets And even in real estate, one does not get the sense of the kind of boom   conditions that prevailed ten years ago, even in areas that are prone to such conditions   I think much the same can be said about the national economy We see strong   growth, few signs of a buildup of inflationary pressures, and the absence of boom   conditions As for the risks, the upside risk to the domestic economy is still there, as it   has been; and the downside risk from abroad is also still there, as it has been The risk of   financial contagion, while still there, appears to have subsided--a little anyway     3/30/99 34   While a case can be made for tinkering with the federal funds rate to cancel, in   effect, some of the insurance we took out last fall, I am much more persuaded that we   should leave well enough alone for now and continue to see what unfolds in this truly   remarkable economy And it is remarkable in the sense that it is about everything one   could wish for    I support “B” symmetric I don’t think there has been enough   of a change since the last FOMC meeting to warrant a change in our basic directive As   far as what we stand for, I don’t think our primary objective is zero inflation In my   view, our primary objective is maximum sustainable growth, and low inflation is simply   a means to that end Therefore, I think we need to see something in the pipeline, even   very preliminarily, that suggests that the economy is beginning to experience a buildup in   inflationary pressures that puts sustainable economic growth in jeopardy Or we need to   see something, even if it is very preliminary, that suggests that we have the beginning of   boom conditions Neither strong growth alone nor a low unemployment rate alone is a   reason to tighten monetary policy So, I favor steady as she goes Our next move may   indeed be a move to tighten But that in and of itself doesn’t justify a change from “B”   symmetric at this point    Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy of the   Philadelphia District remains on an upward trend Manufacturing is strengthening   Retailers report growth in sales Construction has been increasing Business lending has   picked up Labor markets remain tight in most areas Apart from oil and tobacco prices,   inflation is benign and pricing power remains largely nonexistent according to most   business contacts The outlook for the regional economy is positive   Turning to the national economy, the strength in domestic demand continues   unabated and prospects mostly are for more of the same There may be a moderating   trend out there, but it is elusive Financial markets, fixed-income markets in particular,   look increasingly normal following their seizing up last summer and fall Developments   abroad, although mixed and still worrisome in some areas, look better or at least not as   bad as feared a few months ago   Taken together, these developments--robust domestic demand, more normal   financial markets, and less bearishness abroad--indicate to me that the balance of risks   has more of an upside tilt than at our last meeting  At the same time, inflation remains   quite benign despite recent headlines Core CPI, absent tobacco, is very tame The   broader measures of inflation are mostly decelerating Compensation and productivity   are still in a virtuous cycle   So, while risks on the demand side of the economy have shifted somewhat to   the upside since our last meeting, developments on the supply side remain largely   favorable To me that means a somewhat heightened state of alert for policy is called for   How that heightened state should be expressed is better discussed later in the meeting    Your recommendation of announcing a tilt captures my sense   of what we ought to do today I think it strikes the right balance between showing that   we are indeed awake at the switch and at the same time showing the appropriate restraint   Even more importantly, I believe it positions us either to act on the tilt in the future,   should that be necessary, or not to act But I do think it sends the right signal, and I fully   support what you are proposing    I think your advice and recommendation are right on target I   think we ought to keep this off the table  We have enough difficulties explaining where   we are and what we are trying to do with monetary policy; it would serve no purpose to   confuse matters with this unimportant issue now So, I support your recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Philadelphia   region continues to grow steadily, with tight labor markets and low inflation The   outlook is for more of the same Residential construction is strong, with prices rising   especially for upscale housing Nonresidential construction is brisk but not booming   Manufacturers report further gains and retailers are generally doing well Hiring and   retaining skilled employees remain the major challenge Although there are special   incentives for particular skills, the norm for annual wage increases is still mostly in the   3½ to 4 percent range and increases for unionized employees tend to fall in that range as   well     6/29-30/99 44   Turning to the nation, we are at the point in this remarkable expansion when the   risk of accelerating inflation has to be taken seriously Raising the federal funds rate as   insurance against an overheating economy is largely a foregone conclusion at this   meeting   The more important issue now is how to position ourselves going forward   Credibly resisting inflation also means being a credible evaluator of the inflation threat   To use an analogy, we need to be able to tell the difference between a wolf and the family   dog Let’s be honest with ourselves Current and pipeline indicators of inflation look   more like the family dog than a wolf, and our forecasting models have for several years   cried wolf when there has been no wolf How well will a preemptive rationale for raising   the funds rate hold up with that kind of support?  Going forward we need to position   ourselves so that we can evaluate the inflation risks on an ongoing basis and adjust   monetary policy accordingly rather than box ourselves in unnecessarily    I think we do need to raise the funds rate 25 basis points today   It seems to me that we are largely boxed in by our rhetoric and we ought to do it and get   this episode behind us   There is a reasonable economic rationale for this, given the uncertainty that we’re   facing, and that is a “take-back” rationale from last fall, with financial markets and the   rest of the world doing better But I think we want to leave open the question of how   much of a take-back we need to do It may be 25, it may be 50, or it may be 75 Who   knows?  I think we ought to shift the focus back to the economy and back to the data that   come in If, for example, we become more confident about productivity increases, if we   have a continuation of the pattern of prices and wages that has prevailed over the past   several years, then 25 may be fine If, on the other hand, we become less confident of the   productivity increases and we begin to see some early warning signs that inflation is   picking up, then we are going to have to do more And we ought to do more in those   situations   As for the tilt, I think we ought to go back to a symmetric directive today We   need to calm things down We need to shift the public’s emphasis away from   psychoanalyzing this Committee and back to the economy; in my view a symmetric   directive would help do that Announcing the tilt, at least in this initial experiment,   turned out to be a cruder instrument than I think we had anticipated, largely because of   the interaction of rhetoric At this point we just don’t know enough to say how much, or   if, we have to raise rates further, and therefore we shouldn’t box ourselves in for the   future We ought to see how reality plays out and go from there    I think that’s good   SEVERAL Yes    Yes    Mr Chairman, before we leave this subject, I think we owe Peter, the   New York Bank, and the staff here our gratitude and an enormous “thank you” for their   efforts on all of this Life is going to get messy; these likely will be extraordinary times   But this kind of extraordinary thinking and extraordinary planning really shows that the   Federal Reserve can operate not just in ordinary times but in extraordinary times My   confidence level in our ability to deal with all of these potential problems has gone up as a   result of this conversation, in large part due to you, Peter, and your associates    Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District continues to move up Manufacturing has advanced modestly Retail   sales and tourist activity have been strong Construction has increased Employment is on   an upward trend Conditions in the financial sector are so-so, with loan demand reported   flat Agriculture, because of the drought, is hurting, and some of the smaller banks that   service mostly farm communities almost surely will suffer as well later in the year and   going into next year Anecdotally, I am beginning to pick up a subtle shift in tone about   pricing power I have the sense that more business people feel a stronger need to raise   prices to protect financial performance, and they feel they may be able to make price   increases stick In part, this feeling reflects a view, whether accurate or not, that both   consumers and businesses are less inclined to shop for the lowest price or the best deal than   they have been I don’t want to make more out of this point than warranted; it’s just a subtle   change I don’t think it is a major shift nor is it a view held by a majority of business   people, but I just have not sensed it up until fairly recently   The national economy is clearly stretched The outlook both for growth and inflation,   however, remains unclear There is a reasonable case for a decelerating trend in demand   growth going forward, largely based on less of a kick from equity gains But we could be   fooled again On the inflation side, productivity gains may continue to hold down   inflationary pressures--and I suspect they will--but that may not happen either     8/24/99 55   On balance, the risk to the economy of raising the funds rate a notch is less than not   raising it A more important issue today is how we position ourselves going forward and   how we manage our rhetoric during the coming days and weeks, topics for later in the   meeting    I agree with your recommendation to raise the funds rate 25 basis   points and I strongly agree that we need a symmetric directive and that we ought to stay   with that    I do, too     Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy for the Philadelphia   District continues to operate at high levels, with tight labor markets and benign inflation   Consumers are spending freely The market for homes is robust Recent increases in mortgage   rates have caused more homebuyers simply to shift to variable rate mortgages Commercial real   estate is also very active, with low vacancy rates for office buildings Some uptick in rents is   occurring, although given the amount of new building there is a consensus that the increases may   be short-lived Manufacturers report moderate growth, capacity appears adequate to handle the   increase in demand, and output prices are stable The labor market is especially tight for middle   and lower level workers and mixed for professional people For example, bank tellers are in short   supply but senior level banking people are available Accountants are in short supply but lawyers   are in ample supply [Laughter]    The stress in the health care industry is becoming widespread Hospitals   and medical schools are increasingly squeezed financially Physicians are more amenable to   unionization or dropping out of government insurance programs Patients are turning to politicians   more and more to seek relief from the “deny and delay” tactics of insurers The frustrations   associated with non-price rationing techniques are becoming more acute The Philadelphia area is   disproportionately dependent on the health care industry, and the fallout from health care stresses is   clearly negative for the regional economy     10/5/99 25   Turning to the national economy, incoming information points to a strong second half with   labor markets becoming even more stretched Yet inflation remains tame The longer this   favorable combination lasts, the more I consider faster productivity growth to be a more important   factor holding inflationary pressures down than the assortment of temporary factors Nonetheless,   there still is a large element of uncertainty about the outlook for productivity This kind of   uncertainty can be resolved only with time, tempered by policy actions motivated by an ongoing   assessment of where the balance of risks lies Against a background of continuing benign inflation,   two recent increases in the federal funds rate, and more edginess in financial markets, my   assessment is that the risks are sufficiently balanced to warrant a wait-and-see approach to policy   for now    I agree with the “B” option here Given the two moves we’ve taken and   balancing the supply side and the demand side uncertainties, I think “B” is right However, I   believe we could undo a lot of the good we’re going to do with a “B” decision by fooling around   with this asymmetry and symmetry issue at this meeting Our experience with announcing   asymmetrical directives has not worked very well It may work better in the future I’m hopeful   that Roger and his colleagues will come up with something that will make it work But a formal   asymmetric directive, when it is at best a confusing tool and at a time when we want to keep open   our options because of uncertainties about what’s going on in the economy, really is foolhardy I   feel very strongly that we ought not have a formal asymmetric directive because it will end up   doing more harm than good     10/5/99 60   I view the use of words as more promising, however, because words can help us lay out a   framework for our thinking about incoming information and policy We may very well want to   tighten in November, but we may not want to tighten So I don’t think we want to box ourselves in   by the language that we use, and an asymmetric directive runs a big risk of boxing us in Words, if   carefully chosen, can give the slant that we want without loading the dice And this is a time above   all when we want the markets to know that, yes, we may tighten, but we may not It is not a   foregone conclusion    Neither do I   SPEAKER(?) You don’t have to! [Laughter]    It’s hard to re-edit a statement 55 minutes before press time, but I think a   good way out of this is to drop the word “labor” in front of costs Labor costs are the biggest part   of costs, but I don’t think we need to single it out    That’s fine    Let’s quickly adjourn! [Laughter]    Why don’t we just toss these copies in the middle of the table and get fresh   ones?    Fix it up, Don!     Mr Chairman, if each of us sat down to write this statement, we   undoubtedly would come up with somewhat different language and somewhat different   emphases But, frankly, while we’d all do it a little differently, I think this is close enough that   we ought to accept it and move on to the next item on the agenda It’s not only the G-7 that has   trouble doing this If you’ve been around this Committee long enough, you know that we’ve   tried at times in our past to edit draft language as a Committee and I will tell you that the effort is   totally unproductive I believe our attitude should be that this largely has to be left to the   Chairman I do think we have to have something that is broadly acceptable, and in my view this   draft is in that broad area of acceptability and we ought to go with it    That’s the problem!    We shouldn’t have these drafts floating around I suppose we ought   to turn them back in    Thank you, Roger I think that you and your colleagues on this   Working Group have really done quite an extraordinary job to move us this far and you are to be   complimented My comments are intended within that overall framework   As for the two alternatives, I favor “I” The main reason is that the finger ought to be   a little further back from the trigger Risks sometimes materialize and sometimes they don’t   When we add the policy side to our assessment of the balance of risks, we’re really making a   two-step statement whereas a description of the balance of risks makes it a one-step statement   And it is easier to go from “I” to “II” if we want than to do the reverse So I come down for “I”   As for the proposed wording of paragraph 2 of the Authorization, as shown near the   top of page 4, I think the Chairman absolutely has to have the authority to move between   meetings in extraordinary circumstances I don’t think that’s debatable The world is not always   predictable and I think the Chairman simply has to have that authority It has been implicit in the   directive In fact, we got into this symmetry and asymmetry language partially for that reason-­  to try to fine-tune the extent of the authority that the Chairman has between meetings So if we   are going to make the adjustment and de-couple this from the directive itself, then I agree with   Cathy that we have to be clear about it and expressly state it I do have some concern about the   precise wording I think it ought to be the Committee authorizing the Chairman to direct the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York, etc, etc I don’t think we ought to be delegating authority   directly to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and putting the Chairman in a consultative   position But I agree with the basic premise that the Chairman has to have this authority; the   precise wording is another issue   I have just one more comment, which relates to the points of consensus, and I don’t   feel strongly about it Point two says that the FOMC’s vote at every meeting should encompass   both the intended federal funds rate and the symmetry or asymmetry And point three says the   operating paragraph no longer would contain any sentence referring to the Committee’s   consensus about symmetry or asymmetry As I read it, on the surface at least, that appears to be   an inconsistency But I don’t feel strongly about that issue    Virgil, if I had known it was your language, I would not have   questioned it [Laughter] But I’d still like to hear your explanation    I withdraw my suggestion on the words My main point is the   substantive issue that the Chairman needs such authority    Okay, that’s fine    The regional economy in the Philadelphia District continues to grow   Labor markets are tight, yet there are few signs of any upward trend in inflation despite rising   raw materials prices The outlook generally remains positive and there has been no basic change   in recent months One continues to hear stories about innovation, new ways of doing things that   improve productivity For example, the Internet is likely to have a major impact on the way   people buy all kinds of goods, from food to automobiles And while there are a number of   examples that I could cite, given the hour I’ll skip that But the bottom line is that existing   distribution networks are likely to become less expensive over time as a result of all of this   Turning to the national economy, demand remains strong Resources are stretched,   but productivity growth is also strong and inflation remains benign despite repeated predictions   to the contrary The traditional models have not held up and longer-term inflationary   expectations remain well anchored What does the future hold More of the same or a less   favorable mix?  Even if a less favorable mix emerges, it is likely to emerge slowly If more of   the same emerges, then we can continue to have the benefits of higher growth without higher   inflation Vigilance and patience have much to offer in this situation Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I find going up 25 basis points and the symmetric directive   acceptable I think whether we move today or not is a close enough call that reasonable people   can differ, and the difference is so little that what one prefers and what one finds acceptable are   fairly close together I actually feel more strongly about the need for a symmetric directive We   have gone to extraordinary lengths to try to get through the year-end period and all this Y2K   business For us to have an asymmetric directive in the face of that would look as if the right   hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing I think we want to err on the side of calming   markets rather than exciting them, even if the risk of exciting them is very small So, I feel   strongly about the symmetric directive and I find the 25 basis points acceptable    Roger, I think you and your associates have done a first-rate job on   this and I support the majority recommendations To me the balance-of-risks approach is   the preferred course and, separately, I think the language laying out the Chairman’s   authority is much improved And if it’s on the table, Cathy Minehan’s editorial suggestions   also have merit, in my judgment    Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District continues to operate at high levels, with a general sense that the good   times will roll on Retail sales are robust throughout the District Some high-end car   dealers are having trouble getting deliveries, not because the manufacturers can’t produce   the cars but because there aren’t enough truckers and trucks to get the cars to the customer   Home sales are unusually brisk for December, in part, realtors say, because of the unusually   mild weather In commercial real estate, the demand for properties is strong, and I am   hearing reports here and there of some speculative building; it’s not a lot, but I haven’t   heard much about speculative building for a number of years Labor markets are very tight   We hear of some examples of large increases in compensation and special perks, but the   general pattern is still one of modest gains The report from bankers around the District is   that they believe that Y2K will be a non-event They have lots of cash in their vaults but   few customers requesting unusually large withdrawals   The national economy is clearly showing strong demand growth, with pressures   evident on the supply side even with outsized productivity gains, and still generally benign   inflation Some further increases in interest rates to temper demand growth are highly likely   as the new year unfolds Our primary objective during the coming weeks, however, is to get   into the new year with financial markets as settled as we can make them We have gone to a   lot of effort to do just that, and our decisions today should be consistent with those efforts    I prefer the symmetric directive  This is a meeting that in many   ways we didn’t need to have and I think the symmetric approach essentially reaffirms where   we are And it comes closest to having perceptions after the meeting stay exactly where   they were before the meeting     I would second that  I think you earned an A+ for the way you   performed through this period; you and your staff deserve congratulations  I have a question,          14  even though you did so very well!  [Laughter]  Did you learn anything through this process that   would lead you to want to do something differently if we had a similar episode to go through in   the future?     Governor Ferguson captured my views nearly completely and I   would like to associate myself with his comments     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District is strong  Retailing, manufacturing, and construction all are operating at   high levels  Labor markets remain tight with the amount of overtime starting to become a   political issue  The Labor Relations Committee of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives,   for example, recently held hearings on the issue of overtime for construction workers and   concluded that significant overtime reduces productivity and raises safety concerns  I believe we   will hear more about people becoming too stretched for too long in the workplace  And I think   that is going to be the next quality-of-life issue that will probably work itself into the political   campaign of 2000  Although wage increases remain generally moderate, one does hear more   stories of higher salaries being used to entice people to switch jobs   The national economy continues to grow robustly and consumer spending in particular   is growing rapidly  Although productivity also is rising smartly, my sense is that demand is   pressing too much on supply and that unless the growth of demand moderates in coming months   the expansion will be at risk  With concern about Y2K largely behind us, we need to return to   our main task of prolonging the sustainability of this remarkable expansion  Sometimes   prolonging an expansion requires lowering interest rates, sometimes it requires holding them   steady, and sometimes, as in the current situation, it requires raising them  And our task in   coming months is to raise rates in a manner that will contribute to stability while avoiding   initiating instability     I agree with your recommendation of ¼ point and I think we need to   convey the view that we have more tightening ahead of us  My best guess is that there will be a   significant amount of tightening over the coming year  There may well be a time in this series of   tightening moves where a move of ½ point is going to be appropriate  But today I think ¼ is just   right  Our basic product is one of confidence--confidence that we're going to do what is   appropriate to keep the economy on the right path  And in today's environment a 25 basis point   increase in the funds rate captures that because it indicates that, yes, we know that tightening is   appropriate  We're going to do what needs to be done  We are neither going to underreact or   overreact  I think that is important for our image as a strong, confident central bank that the   public deserves to put its confidence in     Absolutely perfect, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, in addition to this remarkable economy, this is a   remarkable meeting  This Committee has resisted the opportunity to talk endlessly about a press   statement  I think we ought to note that!     Thank you  [Applause]     So move   SPEAKER (?)  Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District continues to operate at high levels, with moderate growth and tight labor   markets but with few signs of accelerating inflation  There is a hint of possible slowing in the   housing area, but the rest of the regional economy, including retailing and manufacturing,   continues to exhibit strong demand  Although there are examples of outsized wage increases,   wage growth generally remains moderate  Only the cost of health care benefits is rising   noticeably faster  Productivity growth for the most part, however, is still holding down the cost   of production even with the higher benefit and energy costs              - 51 -     Turning to the nation, the story remains as it has been, very strong growth in demand   pressing on supply  There is little evidence to suggest a slowing in momentum  There is also   little evidence that core inflation is accelerating significantly  Nonetheless, in my judgment the   balance of risks is still clearly on the side of excess demand undermining the expansion  Some   further braking action from monetary policy is needed to help sustain growth, low inflation, and   job creation      I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for the reasons   you've outlined     I think it's an accurate statement of where the Committee is, Mr   Chairman   SPEAKER(?)  I agree with you
