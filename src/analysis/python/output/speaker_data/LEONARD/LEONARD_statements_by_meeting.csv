9331,2011-11-01,"4  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for  Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”   Exhibit 1 depicts the broad contours of your current projections for 2011 through  2014 and over the longer run  As shown, you now see real GDP growth—the top  panel—to be appreciably slower this year than its pace in 2010 and then to pick up  gradually through the end of the forecast period  The unemployment rate—shown in  the second panel—declines slowly over the next three years, yet remains notably  higher than your estimates of its longer-run, mandate-consistent level  With regard to  inflation—the bottom two panels—the central tendency of your projections for PCE  inflation indicates a sizable, but transitory, increase this year before settling back  down next year and remaining at levels roughly consistent with, or slightly below,  your estimates of its longer-run, mandate-consistent level  Your projections of core  inflation generally remain at or somewhat under 2 percent over the forecast period   Exhibit 2 reports summary statistics regarding your projections for 2011  Your  previous projections, collected in June, are shown in italics, and the current and June  Tealbook projections are included as memo items  The central tendency of your  current projections for real GDP growth this year, shown in the first column in the top  panel, is 16 to 17 percent, down more than 1 percentage point from your projections  in June  As shown in the middle column, you now judge there to have been                                                     4 The materials used by Ms Leonard are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   November 1–2, 2011 123 of 282              considerably slower real GDP growth in the first half of 2011 than you or the staff  had previously thought, in large part in reaction to the BEA’s annual benchmark  revisions and the second-quarter data that were published after you submitted your  June projections  That information, together with subsequent data on economic  activity that were softer than you expected in June, led you to lower your implicit  projections for GDP growth in the second half of this year  As shown in the third  column, the central tendency of your second-half projections is centered on  2½ percent, down from about 3¼ to 3½ percent in June  As shown in the second  panel, the central tendency of your projections for the unemployment rate in the  current quarter moved up to about 9 percent, versus just over 8½ to almost 9 percent  in June   Your expectations for overall and core PCE inflation are summarized in the  bottom two panels  The central tendency of your projections of overall inflation in  the second half of this year, shown in the right-hand column of the third panel, is now  significantly higher than in June; the central tendency of your projections of core  inflation, shown in the bottom panel, also moved up but by less   Exhibit 3 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for 2012  through 2014 and over the longer run  You generally see a weaker recovery in real  activity and labor market conditions in 2012 and 2013 than you did at the time of the  June meeting, but your forecasts for inflation have not significantly changed on  balance  In your forecast narratives, many of you indicated that these revisions were  the result of this year’s disappointing economic data, as well as a reassessment of the  strength of the headwinds facing the recovery  These forces include fiscal contraction  at all levels of government, ongoing deleveraging of household balance sheets,  depressed housing markets, weak consumer and business sentiment, and uncertainties  associated with the European situation and domestic tax and regulatory policies   As reported in the top panel, most of you now expect GDP growth next year to be  between 2½ and 3 percent, followed by increases of 3 to 3½ percent in 2013 and of  3 to 4 percent in 2014  The Tealbook projections are within your central tendencies,  but they show a somewhat larger acceleration over the course of the forecast period   Your write-ups indicate that you expect the expansion to be supported by  accommodative monetary policy, declining risks of a tail event, reduced commodity  cost pressures, strengthening household balance sheets, improving financial and  credit conditions, and exports   Your unemployment rate projections are summarized in the second panel   Reflecting the currently elevated level of the unemployment rate and your weaker  projections for economic growth, nearly all of you raised your forecast for the  average unemployment rate in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2013  The central  tendency of your projections for 2012 runs from 8½ to 8¾ percent, and most of you  now project that the unemployment rate will remain centered around 8 percent in late  2013, about ¾ of 1 percentage point higher than your previous projections  The  central tendency of your forecasts for the unemployment rate at the end of 2014 is  6¾ to 7¾ percent—still well above your estimates of the unemployment rate that   November 1–2, 2011 124 of 282              would prevail over the longer run with appropriate monetary policy and in the  absence of further shocks (shown in the far right-hand column)  The revisions to the  Tealbook forecasts of the unemployment rate over the projection period were roughly  similar to those you made   Turning to inflation—the bottom two panels—the central tendencies and the  ranges of your projections for total PCE inflation in 2012 and 2013 changed little   Most of you anticipate that headline inflation will fall back from the somewhat  elevated level seen this year to levels between about 1½ and 2 percent in each of the  next three years  The step-down in your forecasts reflects the further waning of  temporary factors that boosted inflation earlier this year—including higher  commodity prices and supply chain disruptions related to the events in Japan  In  addition, a number of you reported that you expected an extended period of economic  slack to restrain inflation  The low ends of the central tendencies for 2012 to 2014  are a bit below the central tendency of your estimates of the longer-run, mandate- consistent inflation rate  The central tendencies of your core inflation projections for  2012 through 2014 are about the same as those for headline inflation, as most of you  see the effects of the rise in commodity prices earlier this year dissipating  However,  the top end of the range of your projections of headline inflation is as much as ½ to  ¾ of 1 percentage point higher than the top end of the central tendencies, suggesting  that a few of you have significant concerns about the possible effects of commodity  prices on headline inflation over the projection period  The Tealbook forecasts for  both total and core inflation in each of the next three years are at the lower end of  your central tendencies   The central tendencies of your longer-run projections—detailed in the column to  the right—show that over time, the annual rate of increase in real GDP is expected to  converge to just under 2½ to 2¾ percent  The unemployment rate is generally  expected to settle between 5¼ and 6 percent, a somewhat higher upper bound than  projected in June  Your longer-run projections for total PCE inflation suggest that  most of you see PCE inflation between about 1¾ and 2 percent as consistent with  your dual mandate, the same as in your last projections   The final exhibit summarizes your assessments of the uncertainty and risks that  attend your projections  As indicated in the four panels on the left-hand side, a  sizable majority of you continue to judge that the levels of uncertainty associated with  your projections of real GDP, the unemployment rate, and inflation are greater than  the average levels that have prevailed over the past 20 years  Your narratives  highlighted developments in Europe and the unprecedented nature of the current  economic cycle and extraordinary monetary policy accommodation as factors  contributing to this uncertainty  Of note, a few of you raised your assessment of the  level of uncertainty associated with projections of real GDP growth since June; in  contrast, a couple of you downgraded the level of uncertainty associated with  headline inflation from “higher” to “broadly similar”   The panels on the right-hand side illustrate the balance of risks associated with  your projections  On net, most of you continue to view the balance of risks to GDP   November 1–2, 2011 125 of 282              growth (shown in the upper-right panel) to be weighted to the downside, while a  larger majority than in June see the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the  upside  Many of you continue to view the risks to inflation (shown in the two  bottom-right panels) to be broadly balanced, while the number indicating upside risks  fell and those indicating downside risks increased   As the communications subcommittee recommended, the staff plans to include  this exhibit showing histograms of the responses regarding uncertainty and risks in  the SEP that will be published with the minutes of this meeting in three weeks  The  information contained in this exhibit previously had only been described in the SEP  text   This concludes my presentation  Loretta Mester will now provide a summary of  the projections you submitted for the trial run  "
