 Mr Chairman, this is Don Koch for Bill Ford who has asked me to convey the fact that since M2 and M3 are quite strong at this time, he would very much go along with your recommendation Steve, can you tell me what has happened to the excess reserve account during the time that borrowings have gone from [our assumption of] $13 billion to [the current level of] $770 million?  What is happening to the excess reserves during this period as far as your expectations?
