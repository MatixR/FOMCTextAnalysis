30,1976-04-20,"  I have been impressed and pleased with the span of this discussion  I  think to me the key fact is that we have to begin to change  The evidence is not here that the  change is critical or essential, but we all know clearly the beginnings of change have  [unintelligible]  If we believe in moderate and stable growth, then I think our change should be  moderate     I can easily understand the alternate arguments--unemployment coming down quickly but  still very high; bank credit, which we [unintelligible] describe as a financing gap, has not  occurred  Earlier in our discussion, we were talking about the financing gap, when what we  really are talking about, I guess, is the fact that bank loans haven’t come along at the same rate  that the economy has  I think Willis’ comments about the curious dichotomy that exists between  small-bank loan demand and large-bank loan demand is very interesting, but I want to suggest,  gentlemen, that when the prime rate moves, it’s more likely to be a general and nationwide move  when it’s done by large banks and not by small banks  And the large banks don’t have a  significant loan demand     But the point I really am impressed with is that it’s time for the beginning of a change   And in that sense I am impressed with the idea that we narrow the target to some extent--that we  knock a small [amount] off the top of the range and that we not continue the full range by  lowering both the lower end of the range and the high end of the range  I think that’s useful  psychologically and significant and consistent with the position we find ourselves in today     You know, I have no trouble at all rationalizing leaving M3 with a wider range, and the  reason is that we all get somewhat dismayed about the housing industry, which is what the thrift  industry equals, having enormous force  But the key fact is that housing is an extremely large  and important industry, and its recovery at the price levels that are now going in to the average  home is still a very questionable mark in my mind  I think it’s just fine that there is an ample  flow of credit for housing, and so I have no trouble rationalizing leaving M3 in the current  position that it is in today     It’s time to begin to take recognition of the factors that we know must change, and I would  vote strongly for the very moderate proposal that, in my view, the Chairman has made  Thank  you    Just simply to say I would go with alternative C, 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  My  feelings have been expressed by other members  "
57,1976-05-18,"  Mr Chairman, when we were discussing business confidence and  expectations, I didn’t hear any mention of the experiences we’ve just been through in this  economy, which seem to me to add a dimension to our deliberations on what we set as our goals  or our short-term targets for a funds rate or monetary aggregates     It seems to me that we are aided a little bit because of the experience of our private sector  in the last couple of years, and I do not believe we have to get people’s attention by beating them  over the head with some heavy object any longer  I think the whole country is sensitized to the  problems we faced, and the ample evidence of the recurrence of inflation is a grave concern  I  would therefore feel that our actions should be taken [in the context of] that particular new  development  I think recent history, Lyle, does make some immediate difference on  expectations, the capital spending plans, and what have you     I would be perfectly satisfied to see the federal funds rate in the range of 5 to 5-3/4  What  I am trying to say simply is that our signals need not be as dramatic as maybe they [once] needed  to be  I think that’s evident from our experience in the last month, and so I would agree with  much of what Mr Balles has said, except that I’m cutting a quarter off of his federal funds rate,  but I would be happy with a 4 to 7-1/2 [range] on M1 and 5 to 9 on M2  "
84,1976-06-22,"  Tom, the Reserve Bank Presidents, the members of the Committee, are  defendants, along with the Banks  What does Reuss ask, considering the worst case?  He asks  simply, in my view--and I would like your comments--that the court enjoin the defendant from  serving  That the court will enjoin the Banks from carrying out the order, that the court declare  part of the Federal Reserve Act unconstitutional  That seems to me to be the most significant  part of the [case], crippling our operations  On a worst-case basis, the court will--    Mr Chairman, I didn’t mean to open Pandora’s box  I was looking at  the [plaintiff’s] prayer for relief, and what I’m getting at is hopefully a comment from counsel on  the fact that this appears to me to be a totally technical “principal” suit, in which the individual  Bank Presidents do not appear to have any liability     While we are discussing retaining counsel in assisting Mr O’Connell, I’m just trying to  point out that on a worst-case basis, the plaintiff has simply asked for an injunction that would  prevent the defendants from [unintelligible]  And the cost granted to the plaintiff, and  [unintelligible] what other and further relief may be proper--I don’t read into that any liability or  what have you [for the Presidents]  Do you?    At the start of this meeting I was persuaded that we didn’t have  sufficient cause to go [unintelligible] to alternatives A or C, so I obviously support the pause  I  think the pause is appropriate  I want to comment that we do meet monthly on a regularly  scheduled basis  If we met on a basis related to events in the marketplace, we might not have  had a meeting today  I want to just say that I’m rather pleased that we are in a position where we  can pause to some extent     I think we started a process earlier to build a little bit of stiffening in the rates  At this  point it seems to me that the evidence is unclear and that we don’t have sufficient cause to make  important changes  I’m impressed [by the proposal to pause] because of the propensity of human  beings to act when they come together  So far we have a general consensus of not much action     I would make one plea  I’m very sensitive to the fed funds rate because, in the banking  world, these rates result from the interactions and expectations of many people in the money  market, whereas your aggregates are published as statistical facts  I would therefore urge on the  Committee that we do narrow the range  I think a 6 percent fed funds rate during a pause would  be a mistake  I think we should perhaps consider this again as events move on in the economy   So I would vote strongly for 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, narrowing the fed funds range  "
111,1976-07-19,"  I would encourage you to have more debate about this federal funds rate  issue in the substitution for other evidence in the [unintelligible]  I may be at odds with most of  my colleagues on this  You know, the federal funds rate can go from nothing to what have you  depending on the supply of federal funds in the market, and I think an exercise to try to remove  market curiosity from our actions will probably be futile  But I’m not so certain of my own  views that I don’t think we all will benefit by some further discussion, because many of us have  expressed concern about the markets’ sensitivity to our actions in the federal funds market, etc  I  would welcome that, Mr Chairman     Number 2, I have to say, Bruce, that in matters of the kind we are discussing today, with  the pause that none of us really believes [exists] in the economy, I just can’t believe [the  argument] that it’s an appropriate time to act because it’s easier now than it may be later, when  we [are] a little more persuaded of exactly what our consensus view is  Sure, we’ve got a pause  in the economy, let’s be sure we don’t have a real pause in the economy  In summary, Mr  Chairman, I’m very persuaded by Governor Partee, and I associate my remarks with his that we  stay where we are    Well, I’m not as sensitive to lowering the upper limit of M2 and M3,  and I’m willing to accept that    I thought you did    Mr Chairman, you’ve had a majority vote, if we can trust the  Secretary’s count, which I’m sure we can, and I was waiting for Mr O’Connell to say what he  said  It seems to me that those who wish to express the dissent on any one of these particular  issues [may do so], since we’ve already determined that the majority of the Committee concurs  with the long-range target    I think that narrowing the band gives me some concern  Just being  totally pragmatic, I impute a public reaction to levels of interest rates perhaps more than  [unintelligible] because of my prior experience  I would not want to see us up at 6 or down  below 5  Therefore, I think there’s some rationale for not narrowing the band but staying at 5 to  5-3/4 even though that is not symmetrical in terms of what we’d like to achieve; I think that the  psychology of a 6 percent steady funds rate or something like that would be much too dramatic  [unintelligible]    I don’t  "
138,1976-08-17,"  I think it’s important, Mr Chairman, that, as Governor Wallich has  suggested, the Mexicans are attempting to do something with the Treasury position  Depending  on their success there, we will be only one part of a two-part system in the rollover, if I’m not  mistaken  It’s a little different in my mind than our being approached directly with no other  effort being made by the Mexicans    The Chairman is right  I relaxed thoroughly for two weeks, and I have  heard nothing this morning that disturbs my relaxation  I think Willis performed a fine service  with his point-counterpoint  That sparked a very useful discussion  Lyle, with his usual clarity,  has persuaded me that we still do have a recovery, although it’s certainly not an economy  plunging out of control in any sense--certainly not for the last month or so  I agree with the  Chairman’s comment that it is no surprise that businessmen are more cautious today, considering  what they’ve been through  I realize that the expert professional economists among you know a  great deal more than I do about the history of business cycles and the relative activities that have  occurred  But I also give a good deal of weight to change in our economy, in our society, and in  our environment  And I think that’s why we’re useful  If everything could be predicted entirely  on the past, why it would be a rather mechanical function     In any event, it seems to me that this is indeed a time when we are having a pause, or at  least no outward reason to change the performance or our goals or our ranges, which have served  us pretty well since the last meeting  Curiously, even the banking industry today is not expecting  a revival of loan demand until early ’77  I’ve never been through a fall when there wasn’t an  increase in loan demand, but the bankers don’t seem to think they’re going to have it until early  ’77  In any event, the Treasury has been successful, the situation is relatively stable, and it’s my  strong conviction that we should not make a change in our ranges at this time  "
161,1976-09-21,"  I think Paul has rationality and merit in his asymmetrical approach to  the funds rate  I am, perhaps from my antecedents, very impressed with the curious behavior of  bank lending in this period of recovery  You’ve got a sharp divergence, and not only that, but  we’re in a season now where bank lending should pick up, and we don’t have any evidence of it  picking up  And the economic analysis that we’ve had today, I generally concur with it  But a  slight slowing in the recovery process or at least more moderate economic growth leads me to  think that we should, in due course, perhaps at future meetings, consider looking at the  aggregates as President Eastburn has suggested, instead of a money market directive     And I’d like to comment on the proposals that Bob Mayo made and, I guess, Ernie or  Willis  You know the bank reserve picture is such that it seems to me we would want to defer  looking at changes in bank reserves and pressure on the banks--far from it  Banks have very,  very weak and placid loan demands, and this is a curious fact, with all the other elements in the  economy proceeding to the tune of a different drum, I guess  Even the commercial paper  market--if you put that together with bank lending, it doesn’t impress me as being characteristic  of the season or the period of a recovery     I think, therefore, that I can associate myself very clearly with alternative B and those  ranges  I would also opt for the bulge in the lower end [of the federal funds rate] as Paul has  suggested, and I would also urge you to put the reserve question aside at this meeting    I don’t know whether I want to state the case quite as specifically as  Phil has  I sort of like the language in both the single aggregate proposal [unintelligible]  alternative B  The market is proceeding pretty well     9/21/76 - 28 -     SPEAKER(?)  When you talk about Paul’s proposal, what do you mean?    Paul’s was his federal funds rate proposal  "
182,1976-10-19,"  I was interested in Governor Lilly’s work  I briefly discussed it with  Governor Lilly and Governor Partee  I felt at that time that I couldn’t see a revival of great  strength based on any factors that I knew might be present  I’ve been worried about that  conclusion all through this meeting, and I must admit I think I’ve been helped  It is also true that  when you study the possibilities for significant decline, you have to look, in my judgment, at  what conditions might tend to resist that decline  Employment is still high, unemployment is  high, true, but wage increases are not what we feared  Personal income isn’t growing as rapidly  as it had earlier  Inventories are not excessive except in terms of sales, nowhere near what they  were at the time of that plunge in the sharp recession  There has been no huge expansion of bank  credit  In fact there hasn’t been any expansion of bank credit at all  We’ve worried about capital  shortage crowding out     What I’m trying to suggest is that, while we may find great discomfort in the situation  we’re in today--we’re questioning some of the strength of the recovery at this point--I think if we  applied our minds to the reverse scenario, we’d have some difficulty determining that the     10/19/76 - 29 -   economy’s ripe for a sharp decline  I’ve been hoping that this country would get back on stable  growth patterns, away from some of our discomforts in the last few years  We may be unwilling  to accept these stable growth patterns when they have all the characteristics that we’ve been  discussing today     All I’m suggesting is that we have been attracted to the idea that everybody may be wrong,  that recovery may be petering out  I’m not so sure  I also think downside risk always exists, but  the downside risk in my judgment at this point in the economy isn’t the kind of downside risk  that inspires a fearful scenario of a sharp drop all the way around  The conditions don’t seem to  be here anymore  I don’t know what that means for our deliberations but--     Yeah  There may be a risk of decline to some extent but not precipitous  declines  Agricultural, I’ve heard about agricultural income, but I am also well aware that a lot  of people consume, Roger, when agricultural prices are lower  [Unintelligible], and that of  course ameliorates inflationary pressure      Mr Chairman, I see a significant consensus here  I think we’re only  arguing about various minor aspects  I think 5 to 9 [for M1], 9 to 13 [for M2], and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  [for the federal funds rate] would be appropriate  You talk about 4-1/4 on the funds rate  I’d be  a little suspicious of our economy if our funds rate should go down to 4-1/4 I like the 4-1/2 to  5-1/4 midpoint      Well, what I meant was 4-3/4 and 4-7/8 [as alternative midpoints]  I’m  only commenting on extending the full percentage point range from 5-1/4 to 4-1/4 on the funds  rate  I’m suggesting that we’d be doing some upswing if the funds rate were down at 4-1/4  We  had a funds rate of 5, we had a funds rate of 5-1/2, 5-1/4 for quite a while--way down to 4-1/4 is  a significant difference      Listen, we don’t [know] all the shocks  I guess we don’t think [there]  are going to be [any], not in October anyway       10/19/76 - 43 -    I agree with Henry on Ml  And your proposal, I think that’d be the  proper approach--I’m not so sure about the 8-1/2 to 10-1/2 and 10 to 12 for M2 and M3  We’ve  been reminded of significantly [unintelligible] higher end of those, and last time [unintelligible]  seems to be a little uncertain  But I think the philosophy is a change, and the recognition of the  technical factors in offsetting perhaps or similarly explaining what we’re doing on Ml leads me,  finally, after listening to this very active discussion, to go along with the proposal    "
204,1976-11-08,"  Good morning  Can you hear me?     [Others reply “yes”]    I’ll try to be very brief  I’m impressed with the care and thought that  goes into the Committee’s deliberations  I look at the existing supply of money in the economy,  and I see an ample supply of money  I don’t believe that that has been a bar to any of our     11/8/76 - 5 -           progress this year  In my view, there’s a consensus that we are indeed in a slowdown and a  deteriorating condition  As a possible analysis, the measures that are appropriate are not, in my  view, more monetary stimulus, because I don’t believe that our economy or our progress is being  held back  I think clearly we must face the future with an effort to reduce inflation     I think it may be a very difficult time for us to announce a slight lowering in the top of the  range, but I really think that that’s our responsibility and our job, and therefore I would agree  with a slight limiting or reduction in the long-range target for M1, and I think Governor Coldwell  is entirely right in seeing mechanical and regulatory changes in the definition of M1, and we  must put more attention on that subject  But nevertheless, I vote now for a 1/2 point reduction in  the long-range M1 target    I do not wish to mix our signals, and I also believe that the relationship  between M1 and M2 and M3, which gives the appearance of change, is something that this  Committee should consider at considerable length  Therefore, I would prefer to lower the range  in M1 and keep our M2 and M3 targets for the long range, knowing that the immediate  projections will indicate that we will be at the quite high end of the range  "
221,1976-11-16,"  Well, my only comments, gentlemen--you have heard a complete  review of the conditions surrounding the request  I’ll only attempt to again put it in a time and  schedule structure  It’s early November  We know there is a negotiation going on for $800  million credit  We know also that Mexico must begin rolling over and arranging for rollovers for  this enormous amount of credit they already have outstanding in our country and internationally   The Echeverría government goes out of office on December 1  The IMF conditions which were  so carefully drawn do not go into effect until January 1  The tourist season in Mexico begins on  November 15  The US foreign policy position as expressed by the Treasury is one in which  they very clearly indicated they would like us to consider whether or not we could do something  with them, move [unintelligible] the Administration for foreign policy consideration  So we end  up with a small, carefully constructed interim bit of aid    Well, 90 days     11/16/76 - 7 -            I agree, I understand Governor Partee’s comment  My point was  probably poorly expressed  This amount of swap under our regular and some special conditions  is a very small part--as has already been expressed here--of the external indebtedness of Mexico   It seemed to me, as a member of the subcommittee, quite wise to proceed in this small, cautious  way with the schedule that I have outlined for you  And the earnest hope [is] that a new  government headed by a former finance minister, the IMF conditions and their further drawings  as Henry has described, and--as we all know now--a further depreciation in the peso, give  Mexico a fighting chance to manage this situation without an official moratorium  I think that  persuaded me that it was important for us to be a part, or a small part, of this picture    I think it’s been well stated around this table that there’s a natural  caution at the time of significant change in Administration  Sitting and waiting is a kind of  exercise that brings on worry; it hardly ever brings on optimism  I am very interested in some of  the comments that have been made  Clearly our concerns as to whether or not we have a pause  have been answered  We do indeed have a pause, and we have considerable doubts in the minds  of our Committee members  It is entirely justified by events     But I also have to take some of the messages that I’ve heard appraise it  Bruce says things  could go either way, and, Bruce, I absolutely agree with that  Chuck has described some of the  underlying economic basis that has led me for a month or so to conclude that it’s rather difficult  to perceive higher unemployment, basically lower production, basically a sharp or even a  significant drop  We have ample liquidity in the economy, as you all know; we seem to have  avoided, at least for the time being, mass hysteria about the return of inflation  Indeed, there are  concerns, but basically the country is not convinced that they are going inevitably into inflation   Capital investment which has been very modest to date in this recovery, understandably so, has  an added value and the added value is the backlogging, or postponement, of things that business  firms know they need to do, to a period where their vision is a little clearer       11/16/76 - 27 -           Foreign investment is rising in this country  I think this country is going to experience  significant foreign investment considering the size of our economy  The importance of our  currency as the world’s trading currency and the figures occasionally encourage me it’s coming  up quite significantly     The point I guess I’m trying to make is that it’s my view that we are in a period of  maximum concern about the policies of the new Administration  And as the months ahead come  by, I think we must remember that the Administration coming into power has announced that  they will balance the budget in four years, that they will attack unemployment, and as these  events unfold and a mindless trivia of interim press conferences gets put aside for real  pronouncements, I think you are more likely to find some points of confidence in these  announcements rather than further concerns  In substance, I’m willing to accept the clear fact  that our signals are very unclear  We are in a period of, not only pause--I wish I could coin  another phrase, but I don’t read--    The National Bureau calls it a mid-expansion retardation  My basic  concern is of more [significance than] what the new President is going to say at tomorrow’s press  [conference], and that is what the OPEC countries are going to do in December  That is a  condition of uncertainty, and that augments our fears and concerns  But, you know we are going  to shortly find out, and most [of what] has been suggested is unacceptable to us, but at least it’s  finite, and therefore Americans will get about their business when they learn the outcome of  those deliberations--perhaps in compact with the Administration policy--and try to do something  about it     So I’m not altogether pessimistic, gentlemen, and I would expect the position we’re in  today is very understandable  I do think it’s a very understandable condition, but I do not take  from it the inevitable conclusion that we are in a period of significant and important decline    Well, in hopes that I can conform to what I said earlier, I would support  some easing, as you’ve suggested, Mr Chairman--modest, responsible easing--because I’m  convinced that developments will unfold in this period and give us further indications of what  the real underlying situation is  I feel a little like somebody with a surgeon’s scalpel attempting  to treat a patient with hives--mysteries of the formulae compounded by the staff are still new to  me  Nevertheless, I don’t want to overlook the fact that, while November aggregates may indeed  bring the October burst into better perspective, we did, in fact, have a very substantial growth in  October--very substantial, much more than I’ve seen since I’ve been on this [Committee]     Well, the aggregates, even with a modest November, appear to be growing satisfactorily  for this stage of the economic cycle that we find ourselves in  And in short, I would support a  modest easing  Governor Partee picked alternative A and modified it, when I thought, really,  Governor Wallich modified B  I therefore end up a little more comfortable with 3 to 7, 9-1/2 to     11/16/76 - 39 -           13-1/2, and I don’t want to go down to 4 percent on the funds rate  I think that’s prejudging far  too early  [Unintelligible] so I would stay with the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4   [GAP IN TRANSCRIPT]  "
247,1976-12-20,"  The whole thrust of that paragraph, I think, is entirely appropriate  We  must respect the treaty, the IMF articles which our government signed  We certainly cannot take  a position against the foreign policy interests or the perceived foreign policy interests of the  government of the United States, whatever independence we have domestically  Surely they  have the same degree of independence internationally  I think we are courting, in all of our  work, the prospect that at some future date these operations will become defined as treaties,  resulting in a totally different form of handling, and I would much prefer the results of Henry’s  tedious negotiations because I think it’s the right posture    I’ve had a short experience in this activity  [In] seven or eight months,  all of the major events that have occurred have been problem events  I support the collaboration,  I support the eventual narrowing in an emergency to the Chairman, who I also believe is  accountable, and I think that adds accountability to the Chairman’s role and the subcommittee’s  role  But it is also true that the Desk needs support, and it can be most extraordinarily difficult   Now, we’ve had some talk that a problem has never arisen, gentlemen, but we did have a touchy  situation when the Chairman and Henry were both in Manila, and Paul was in Europe, and the  Desk wanted some help  Scott, you remember that  So I am fully in favor of the step delegation    No, I don’t think we need to  Because the sense and thrust to this is  written clearly  One of the problems is security  You just can’t pick up the phone and talk to  Manila, and to Bonn--or perhaps you could to Bonn, Paul, or wherever you were--and come up  with an unmonitored conversation without going through some extraordinary arrangements  The  last time you were in Manila, they assured me that if they could get you to Clark Air Base, I  could use a scrambler phone  Well, that’s about 100 some miles from Manila     I think we have a good procedural memorandum, one which we have not had before, and  I’ll call your attention only to the last sentence  “    any transactions that are not of a routine  character”  So even within the discretion of the Desk, and it could be transactions under $100  million in any one day--I’m delighted with Scott’s statement, I think that’s appropriate as  well--we can have transactions of less than $100 million that are not of a routine character     12/20-21/76 - 21 -          Gentlemen, I think a pause is a pause  Now we can work out particular  selections on the various alternatives, but our forecast contains a belief that there will be a fiscal  stimulus  We haven’t yet seen exactly what that stimulus will be  Our forecast also presumes  that the OPEC price arrangements will be of a certain kind, but we’re still faced with a  confrontation between the Saudis and the Arab members, and if you are not an Arab member,  it’s an [unintelligible] thing       12/20-21/76 - 64 -         Our year-end sales, our consumer demand, may be good  I’m not persuaded that bank loan  demand is on a more normal trend than it has been, but the evidence looks as though we’re at the  beginning of that stage  As Roger said, in a short space of less than 30 days we’ve pushed the  funds rate down to 4-5/8, lowered reserves, cut the discount rate  I don’t think I’m going to find  any great controversy among us here at the table  I think it’s entirely appropriate that we not  further indicate monetary stimulus at this time  And, as the staff has indicated, if we stay where  we are and we adopt roughly alternative B, there’ll be a slight readjustment in some of the  market rates, and I think that would be quite positive in view of our concern about the enormous  deficit coming     Talk about fiscal stimulus--the Chairman made a point that I am very concerned about   For the last three years, we’ve had enormous fiscal stimulus just by the workings of our budget  process  [Unintelligible]  It is also true that we can’t get away from the fiscal stimulus easily or  in the foreseeable future  I think that we will be meeting next time during Inauguration week   People’s Inauguration will be spreading throughout this city  I’d like to see what that  inaugurated Administration decides to do next, in fact     I’d like to stay with B, the same federal funds  We’re exactly at the midpoint of alternative  B right now, and that is exactly where I’d stay, or thereabouts, for another 30 days  "
276,1977-01-17,"  Opinion has been expressed by expert members of this Board that this  isn’t a loan  I just want to say that I’m going to withhold any such determination  It is in effect a  loan  Until I talk to, if necessary, to experts whether this is a loan or a purchase of foreign  currencies that the Treasury--    If we did publish a regulation and presumed that we were subject, the  regulation would be of a very modest nature, is that correct Tom?    Well, if we were by some mischance to be subject to the Sunshine, our  regulation concerning open and closed meetings would almost be entirely closed meeting    Well, we haven’t discussed regulatory matters, and a good deal of [the  Federal Reserve] Board’s time is spent on regulatory decisions  Tom, I believe that, because of  the nature of such decisions, we could close those meetings    I’m talking about a bank holding company application, some matter  involving individual institutions    We have a plan  The problem, Mr Chairman, as you know, is that if a  committee, regardless of its size, is delegated to act for the Board, then it becomes subject to  Sunshine by that delegation  So we are working on alternative ways  Now, a number of the  Board committees--in fact, the majority--do not have delegated authority, and they can meet  without violating any law in closed session because they’re only advisers or what have you    This is really not a synthesis [unintelligible]  I thought the pause was a  pause; many of us did  I was very interested in the external factors--OPEC  December came and  went, and we didn’t get a 15 percent rise or a 10 percent rise; we got something else  I think I  understand the reluctance of businesses to spend for long-term capital improvement and  expansion  I think as long as that fund of private stimulus remains a possibility, it’s a point of  strength in the fact you [unintelligible]     I’m just thinking out loud  We’ve had a pretty good year in many ways  Inflation has  come down  But there is one thing that deeply concerns me  That is 79 percent unemployment   I worry about [unintelligible] getting a little more comfortable with some of the statements  coming from the Administration, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the Congress will not  take off on many spending measures  Unemployment is a very difficult thing because we have  had  a pause and evidence that the pause is past  We are looking forward to improvements, but  still, it’s 79 percent unemployment, which has become such a campaign issue, such a  psychological effect, that whatever conservatism may be inherent in the Administration’s plans, I  don’t think it can weather for long a grudging slow reduction in this number  It’s too visible a  number     I was disappointed with the amount, Lyle, [by which] it came down in the last report  And  I am curious about the more rapid decline in unemployment that occurred early last year  That     1/17-18/77 - 34 -           occurred in the first quarter or the second quarter, and unless that happens, those of you who  have expressed concern about the size of the deficits and the like are going to be wise men--if  unemployment were now 5 percent or 5-1/2 percent, we would all be smiling to see a good year  ahead and perhaps one [in which] we could continue to make progress against inflation  Do you  have any comments about what you expect unemployment to do in the next--    I think we’ve had a kind of good discussion about the prospects of the  economy and we have at least a seeming consensus of what is ahead  I once spoke about the fact  that it is not necessary to change at every meeting of this Committee  But when I see a road  ahead that I generally perceive [as desirable], then I want to get about our business     Now, we’ve had an overshoot in M2, M3  Henry, I take exception to your view that  they’ve been remarkably stable over the years  Actually, I think you could build into the  numbers evidence of a continuous expansion of growth and size    Well, I have another view of M2, and M3 particularly, and that is that it  isn’t only [Regulation] Q; it’s the technological change in the way transactions are handled,     1/17-18/77 - 52 -           which you are all familiar with--telephone transfer, NOW accounts, and what have you  And I  want to get about the business of this overshoot  We have had half again as much overshoot as  we have range in M1, and almost in M2, and almost in M3  So I think it’s wise for us to lower  the bottom, reducing the midpoint by 25 basis points  Because, really, as Governor Jackson  says, what we’ve got to do is to forget about putting these two aggregates somewhat closer to our  targets  Quite a bit over on both of them  They aren’t going to change and become less of a key  in the economy     The two--the velocity of money and the liquidity quotient of the economy--they are going  to become more liquid, they are going to become more volatile  At least they’re going to move  more rapidly  M1 loses status in my mind  M2 and M3 are inevitably going to be more  interconnected with the current state of transactions balances in the economy  So I’m perfectly  happy widening the range a little bit, lowering the lower limit  I think that what we will be  concerned with in the short range is our interest in the overshoots that we have had in the last  year  And I even think this is consistent, or at least it takes cognizance of Dave Eastburn’s  admonition  If there is a rebate or what have you, I wouldn’t lower the top of the range  I’d  lower the bottom of the range    I think we should shave the 1/2 point off of the aggregates  I think the  range in the federal funds rate is important in view of the sensitivity in this current situation  I  don’t want to see the zone of indifference widened without some recognition  The size of the  range is the inverse ratio of the amount of time Steve Axilrod [is] out of his office, and he is  down at the same end of the corridor that I’m in  And I would just as soon have a narrow range,  which means consultation  I wouldn’t like to see a 4-1/4 federal funds rate or 5-1/4 federal funds  rate without some reflection  I would accept your recommendation of 4-1/2 to 5, expecting that,  should the situation require it, we’ll have some consultation  "
302,1977-02-15,"  Tom, isn’t it true that we cannot pretend that we are covered by the  Sunshine Act because a part of what you have to do is public [announcement of] regulations  [regarding our operations under the Sunshine Act], if in fact you are covered by the Sunshine  Act?  We have already gone past the [deadline] date on that    May I make an observation, Mr Chairman?    Listening to this concern about uncertainty, I have to reflect back to the  beginning of last year  The midpoint of last year  What were the points of uncertainty?  What  prevented business from moving forward with capital goods planning or expansion?  Well, the     2/15/77 - 20 -           pause was on our minds almost all of the year  The pause as to whether unemployment began to  rise after dropping  The election was certainly on our minds  OPEC’s protestation that they  would increase prices were with us for many months last year  In fact, there were a great many  reasons or significant reasons for business uncertainty in 1976     None of these are quite the same concerns today that they were last year  The election is  behind us  We have seen the first stimulative program proposals  There’s no question about the  pause being a downturn any longer, and that’s proven to be an unnecessary worry in some  respects  Unemployment, even in a crazy mechanical way, dropped by a macro number for [a]  month; but nevertheless, the Saudis seem to be holding out with a two-price system to [the]  advantage [of] our economy  I remember a lot of concern about the fact that if we didn’t have a  big December, we would have great difficulty in retail sales, but we did have a big December     I [am] persuaded, gentlemen, that businessmen are very inventive in thinking about things  to worry about  Now they are worried about the weather and the energy shortage or what have  you  But when I try to balance these against last year, I don’t think they are terribly impressive     All I’m trying to suggest is that I look someday to the time when the perception generally  in business will be that they ought to go ahead with some of their capital expansion    Pardon?    Now wait a minute  We haven’t had any significant capital  investments  We’ve had a recovery without that leading the way  And this has always appealed  to me as a fact of future strength  At some point, we may indeed get some additional thrust from  the longer-delayed capital expansion developments  I’m a little bit from Missouri when it comes  to businessmen and their worries    I want to ask one question, Mr Chairman  Jerry, steel capacity  worldwide, aluminum capacity worldwide--I don’t know anything about pulp and paper  capacity--do we have the same set of conditions today that we had in ’73 on capacity?  We are  worried about our 85 percent rate or our movement toward an 85 percent rate [of capacity  utilization]  I seem to remember an enormous burst in construction of steel plants throughout the  world very readily available  Some very basic industrial commodities readily available from  input  Can you comment on that?     2/15/77 - 21 -            I have the conviction that we should stay with B as stated here  In  addition to all else that’s been said, I want to make this comment  I don’t think that we can  pragmatically lay in some supplies for the future in this instance  The reason I say that is the  stimulus program is not yet passed into law  If market rates begin to do things that those who  [seek] stronger stimuli take exception to, we could be possibly a partial instigator  I’m entirely  clear that we should stay where we are at the moment, although I recognize that the job before us  in the coming months is terribly important  I suggest if we start that job prematurely, we may  compound [the difficulty of] our own mission  So I would stay right where we are at the  moment     Mr Chairman, the release of the policy record is in a new phase--of 30  days  I would have some concern if I thought that release might be accelerated  I think we all  would     Mr Chairman, I have one final concern, and that is, twice, I think, it  appears that you [are] given the discretion in this statement of calling the Committee together   Now if it appears “the Manager will notify the Chairman and will then decide,” this could--I may     2/15/77 - 41 -           need counsel’s assistance on this--but this could conceivably create a position where you might  be criticized for not calling the Committee together  You might--  "
329,1977-03-15,"  Well, gentlemen, I’m pleased with many of the perceptions that have  been expressed, and I particularly want to identify with Mr Morris’s view that we do better  when we don’t deal with our expectations but we deal with what our current knowledge is  And  I have nothing, really, to add to the discussion, because I synthesize it into some accord on the  4-1/2 to 8-1/2 range for M1, and 7 to 11 on M2     I want to point out that M2 has been living a reasonably happy life for many months  M2  has grown consistently, I think, based on a pattern of rates and structure that will begin to  change  We’ve seen some falloff now in the competitive nature of savings, and I expect to see  more of it  While I’ve never understood M1, I think if we can exclude M1 from M2, I think I  can understand the residue called M2  We’re going to have probably some slower growth in M2  for a variety of reasons in the competitive world     On the other hand--well not on the other hand, but as we get down to a federal funds range,  I’m perfectly happy with the inner range  I think it’s desirable and wise  And I see no harm in  adding 1/4 to the upper limit of that range, because, I don’t know, Frank, whether it’s my  expectations or absolute assurance that there is going to be a rise in the federal funds rate  sometime this year  And I see no harm in expanding that a little bit for the comfort that we may  gain philosophically from, in a sense, believing we are preparing modestly for the future, and  that preparation would probably be inadequate  So I wouldn’t find anything wrong with keeping  the inner range and adding 1/4, and many people have spoken to that possibility about our outer  limits of the federal funds rate    Mr Chairman, the [sub]committee--a well-balanced group--met and  discussed the issues which are fully set forth in the memorandum  I hope everyone has had a  chance to read it  If you have, you know it’s the [sub]committee’s conclusion that the Desk  continue to use repurchase agreements in bankers’ acceptances, which is a useful and important  tool     Point number two, that the Desk will allow its direct holdings of acceptances--which are  now at about $175 million and have been much reduced from the peak in the past, when we were  up near 3/4 billion dollars--to run off and no longer engage in direct purchases of bankers’  acceptances from the accepting bank  If someone wishes to discuss the issues, they’re on pages  4 and 5, the arguments for and against     I want to assure you there was a full and complete discussion [within] the [sub]committee  There remain--we can go back to that in a moment--but there remain two or three other items  If  the Committee does approve the recommendation before it, there is a question about how we  treat the present authorization to the Desk  The [sub]committee felt in the majority that they  would leave the authorization in place for direct purchases up to $100 million--not practice or  use that authority routinely, but have it available for exceptional developments  One member of  the [sub]committee, President Eastburn, felt we should remove entirely that authorization and  retain only the language that pertains to the repurchase process, which is contemplated by the  [sub]committee’s original recommendation     The majority of the [sub]committee then is recommending that we continue to use  repurchase agreements on bankers’ acceptances; that we allow our outright portfolio to run off,  which it is presently in the process of doing; that we leave the authorization in place for  emergencies or exceptional developments; and finally, that there should be some form of public  release, if the Desk is no longer the direct buyer of acceptances     Lastly, there was some discussion about the quality of acceptances  The Desk has  generally followed the practice of treating what the market considers prime to be prime and to  deal only in prime acceptances  Of course, by the workings of our own intimate knowledge of  the banking system, we may often have some different perceptions about what is a prime name,  based on examinations and supervisory information  It was the general feeling of the     3/15/77 - 36 -           [sub]committee that we should follow in good conscience the normal workings of the prime  mechanism in the market place, not deal in what the market classifies as nonprime, and very  rarely, if ever, use our special knowledge of an individual bank’s condition to question the use of  its acceptance or the purchase or repurchase agreement for its acceptance     And that’s a general statement of the issues, Mr Chairman, and the [sub]committee’s  recommendation to the FOMC    I think we did, Monroe, basically by the majority view that we no  longer would purchase directly because, when we use the repurchase agreement, we have an  additional point in strength  And therefore, the issue to which I think you’re alluding would  probably be of minimal importance    Well, I can only say, Bob, that the [sub]committee did not address the  implications of an incipient growth of regional new markets of acceptances  Perhaps we were  over-awed by the size of New York, and the fact is, we didn’t think of your particular point as  we deliberated    Well, I’d hope not to give the implication that there isn’t--the opening  that I believe should exist, Mr Chairman, is the fact that we were buying Franklin National’s  bankers’ acceptances too close to the day that Franklin National became a problem  Now, I  shouldn’t be talking about what the Desk was doing at a period of time when I wasn’t here     Nevertheless, the purpose of the paragraph was to mean that we may classify in our own  examination process some major banks who have perfect confidence in the acceptance market  and general marketability--we may find some problems in those banks as we look over their day- to-day operations  The Desk should be guided, in our view, by the market’s perception  Of  course, there could be a case where a major bank or an accepting bank is beyond repair  And in  such case, I think the Desk would have some difficulty  And that’s the only opening I meant--      3/15/77 - 38 -            I agree  "
355,1977-04-19,"  Mr Chairman, I want to first disclaim any expertise in the agricultural  lending field  On the other hand, I have talked to Roger, I’ve talked to some of our Branch  directors in the agricultural area     All of this was inspired by significant interest recently in Washington about the problems  of grain farmers and feed-lot farmers--[in the case of] the grain farmers, in carrying over crops  because of low support prices and the need to [take] additional crop financing loans or operating  loans for this season  There is clearly a very large overhang of wheat in the marketplace  Many  farmers are heavily committed to carrying old crops, and smaller banks, particularly in the rural  areas, have shown a counterseasonal or a larger-than-seasonal increase in their loan portfolios   Their deposit growth has not kept pace because of the backup in grain     As a result, there have been some protestations made in Washington by various groups,  including authorities in Nebraska and the like  And the Agriculture Department, in order to  provide an immediate short-term picture, made a quick survey, or is in the process of making a  quick survey, Ernie, as you may know, of some 400 banks  They sought our help in designing a  questionnaire, in selecting the banks; our agricultural economists here at the [Federal Reserve]  Board participated in that endeavor  Now that process is still going on, and I don’t know that we  have any report on this yet, Jim, at all     But in addition to this, we have the aggravation, which you’re very familiar with in the  District, of low moisture in the soil and semidrought conditions in the grain-growing areas  I  talked to the Iowa groups yesterday, and they don’t seem to have the same problem in corn  But     4/19/77 - 13 -           this is probably in large part an economic problem, because if foreign demand for grain--if grain  prices were buoyant in the marketplace--at least you would remove this piling up of credit and  stored grain  We think many of these actions were designated to focus the Agriculture  Department’s and the Administration’s attention on the support price structure, hoping perhaps-- and this is speculation on my part--that the new Administration would provide some short-term  carryover bridge, higher support prices or loan values, for the grain  I’m not sure that’s going to  happen     We’re still getting information here, and we can use any and all information, as Roger  knows--he telefaxed to me most current material that he had, and some additional material that  was quite interesting concerning the classification of loans in small banks and showing a rise in  the classified loan portfolios for this very reason     Now, there have been some very abnormal events; a small bank in difficult condition  began foreclosing on farmers  In so doing it made Newsweek or Business Week  This is what  our media tend to do--highlight a problem with a dramatic example; and some fairly large farm  operations were sold out because this bank needed to restore its proper financial condition   Incidentally, that bank applied to us a year ago to become a one-bank holding company, and we  declined because of the condition of the bank, but that was an exceptional case  It just happens  to be a newsworthy case     So, in general, there is clearly a pileup of bank credit, a pileup of inventories of grain  The  best estimates given to me by others is that maybe 10 percent of the farmers are seriously  disadvantaged by this problem in their area  Roger, I’d appreciate any additional information   In other words, I’m not suggesting there’s a national crisis here but that there is clearly a  problem, a visible problem because farmers have not marketed the last one or two grain crops,  and they’re growing another one now  Roger, would you care to add to that?    It contains the seeds of that, Ernie, in my judgment  It could develop,  but it needs some more external unfavorable forces at this point    I have to add, you were talking about the Financial Reform Act,  gentlemen    Mr Chairman, we had an energy program proposed to the Congress  that lived [unintelligible] for 12 months  And it went through almost exactly the process you  described  The one key difference was that Congress was never persuaded to seriously consider  it  But your comments about the uncertainty that this kind of process inspires is particularly  germane, in my opinion, because of the effect on business investment  The uncertainty of how to  proceed    I hope to be brief  The economic [situation], as Willis has just  indicated, is clearly buoyant  It has rekindled more specific fears of inflation  We have to  expect that  That was bound to happen whenever the economic data became clearly positive  It  seems remarkable to me that with the dispensing of the rebate program, we’ve gone from fears of  too much stimulus to fears based on the yet unannounced energy program, which clearly will  have some significant impact, depending on its reception and development in the Congress     I often have taken the position of staying in place  I think clearly it is appropriate for us to  continue reducing our targets or our ranges  I would support the reduction in M2 and M3 that is  proposed; I would support a reduction in M2 as shown in alternative B, and M3 a half point on  either end     But I think the principle is more important  I think we should make some changes  We are  asked to do this tentatively, subject to our afterthoughts after the President’s program is  announced, and for that reason I would be happy with leaving M1 alone at the moment  We do  have to look, in a minute, at where we are with M1 and where we will be in the next quarter with  M1  And so I would support either a 7 to 9-1/2 or 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 for M2  Commensurately, an 8  to 11 or 8-1/2 to 11 for M3  I think that is the important action to be taken today--a one-year  adoption which we will of course review again in three months    Mr Chairman, I have found some support for my concern about a 10  outer limit on an M1 growth  I’d like to see that range 9-1/2 or something  I guess it’s a point of  principle with me  I believe we do have special factors, but I believe they’re also indigenous to  April at the moment until proven otherwise  If we get a range of growth from that range of the  size indicated in alternative B, I think we would all be disturbed  I can really be  I’d be glad to  move up the bottom of the funds rate to 4-1/2 and to begin to take some action on the funds rate  if warranted, but the idea that the outer limit of the range of M1 at 10 is deeply disturbing to me   We’ve had our huge burst  If we get no reaction in the next month or two, or no diminution of  the size that the staff presently anticipates, I suspect we’d be having a meeting of this  Committee  I just would like to see that range dropped a little bit    Could you repeat your language Bob?     4/19/77 - 47 -            Can you stand an editorial comment?   SPEAKER(?)  No  Declined    Well, you’re solving my problem  I wanted to reduce the range, and so  if you approach it, why that satisfies me very well    I won’t  "
382,1977-05-17,"  Just a question, Jerry  What does the staff think about the proposal to  increase Social Security withholding applied solely to the employer?    Gentlemen, I have been listening to a great deal of wisdom  I guess we  all know who we are today  I think originally, until I heard the Chairman’s suggestion,  [unintelligible] I asked myself, in view of the buoyancy of the economic indicators, what would  we be doing if we hadn’t had a 19 percent growth in M1 in April?  I suspect we wouldn’t be  quite as aggressive in raising rates as some of our colleagues are proposing  So if we look at the  alternates involving quite constraining M1 and M2 ranges and, on the other hand, a fairly narrow  and modest proposal on the funds rate, I think this has some advantage  If we can achieve what  the staff forecasts and [eliminate] the very dramatic bulge in M1 in April through passage of  time, we’ll have present market rates already up and [a] willingness to go up half a bite, Henry,  in our range for the federal funds proposal     It seems to me that incorporated in this reduction in the aggregates ranges and retaining or  narrowing the federal funds range, we have a compromise that makes a good deal of sense to me  because there [were] a great number of queries expressed about the future of the economy   We’ve put a lot of attention on automobiles  The auto business falls apart in the middle of the  year, as we all know  It may fall apart further this year because of the incipient energy program     5/17/77 - 32 -           that might change the mix significantly  I’m quite happy with this alternate suggestion, although  I haven’t heard it before because I think it’s a balanced suggestion  "
402,1977-05-27,"  I’d like to say a word now, Paul, if I may  I think that the course of  action that you suggest is a very proper course  Now, we are fully aware of a ruling of the IRS  that will probably change the procedures under which you operate  I think the responsible  course is for you to go through the Treasury to attempt to obtain this ruling or opinion from the  IRS of the [validity of the] exemption that could be contained in the procedure where we act as  principal  At that point we will have sure knowledge of what the full tax status of these  transactions are, and I think we can then better deal at an FOMC meeting with the full  complexities of Henry’s concerns and the other concerns that may be expressed by other  Governors  And most importantly, we can better understand this complex subject which you and  I have been discussing for a couple of days now     I think our colleagues should know that your summary was brilliantly concise, but there is  a great deal of complexity to the issue, and I don’t think we should, on the basis of an interim  [decision], however concise, make a major change in procedures and policy without full  Committee deliberation  So I personally would urge you to go forward to the Treasury to get the  ruling, engage the Desk people and our staff here at the Board in a full exposition so that the  Committee can have a broad and appropriate discussion at the earliest opportunity    Paul, you’ve heard from all of the Governors who have remained here   You may want to seek the counsel of your colleagues at the [Reserve] Banks    I think that would be not only wise but the only practical course in that  eventuality  Now you’ve had the best abilities of our counsel, both in New York and here,  telling us, and the Treasury telling us, we think the IRS won’t give us that [objection]  But if  they do give us that [objection], I would think one of two things would eventuate  One, you  would have to stop; and two, you might want to call an official meeting  This is an exchange of  views, as you know, in a conference call, but absent that result, the whole matter will be fully  discussed under your suggestion at the FOMC, and with appropriate background material      In other words, you’ve stopped acting as agent    Then your plan is to limp along, as you characterize it, until we get  some clarification of this IRS ruling and it’s applicability to our operations with central banks  And I think we should remember, as Paul said initially, that the ruling was taken by the IRS in a  totally different context, applicable to transactions in the commercial area, but it does affect our  operations [with] the central banks      I agree with that because you’re prejudging the whole conclusion if you  don’t continue it, with great prudence of course    Bob Mayo, were you coming on?  I’m sorry    I’m persisting in believing this is an exchange of views      5/27/77 - 8 -       Paul, I think we’re finished here in Washington  If our [Reserve Bank]  colleagues have more, fine, but I think you certainly got an expression of the views from all of  the members of the FOMC      Very good  Have a nice Memorial Day  "
419,1977-06-21,"  Seems to me [that] protestations about people who have watched our  money supply figures and immediately translate them into market actions are contradictory in the  sense of the subject we are now discussing  If we are really going to tell the world to stop  worrying about weekly fluctuations, we ought to think a long time about making adjustments in  those weekly fluctuations  I wouldn’t mind commenting on them  If we don’t want people to do  what they are already doing, and I suppose that’s a vain hope--    My experience with this recovery--the only one I’ve had the  opportunity to live with in the introspective halls of the Federal Reserve System--is that we are  never quite sure of it  It is certainly protracted, it certainly has not spawned an enormous  number of pressures  It has not been traditional  I can understand all of those uncertainties  because of the world’s present environment--the energy problem and the like     I think our posture, standing firm or standing where we are now, is entirely appropriate   We had a long discussion this morning about pessimism or unease in the business community   These are quite different, I would suspect, than any discussion which might have occurred prior  to the oil embargo and other events that have taken place in our historical perspective   Therefore, I’m pretty sure that the recovery is still going to drag out  I think that’s a logical  presumption to make     And I’ve been told that the federal funds rate is going to be at 7 and 7-1/2 or 8 percent six  or eight months from now ever since I arrived  Therefore, I want to stay where we are, and I  think it would be wise to adopt a caution in the sense of the sensitivity to the economy by  keeping that 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 federal funds rate  And I think there has been a lot of wisdom  expressed for having either an aggregates or a money market directive  I’m not going to invert  logic further; I’ll accept whatever direction the Committee agrees on      Paul, you are suggesting, really, that we continue under the first  approach and consider, after the IRS ruling, whether to adopt the second or the third approach    Now, you’ve already had a meeting of the FOMC to discuss this by  telephone    Informal discussion, all right  I have a strong preference for the second  approach, but I will deal with that as you find it in order to be dealt with  Because we are not  going to make, according to your specifications, a final decision    The Federal Reserve could not get a ruling    Well, I expressed earlier a preference for alternative 2 if you want to  debate that, but I didn’t think you wanted to debate all these alternatives  Incidentally, SAMA  [Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority] didn’t apply for the exemption for any reason connected with  this transaction at all  It applied for an exemption some years ago for other investment purposes   They got a declaration that they were in effect an instrumentality of the Saudi Arabian  government  Which is all they got  So whatever they do in our marketplace would be an  investment in private or government securities, they‘re not subject to the withholding tax that’s  applied to foreign investors    In essence, this is the same subject that was discussed at the conference  call, but that was not a meeting, and this is a meeting of the FOMC    "
444,1977-07-19,"  To speak first--how can I--you have 14 names    All right    I didn’t speak to the staff projections, but I do feel that it was very  valuable  And I do feel that we still have much to look forward to in this very quiet recovery,  gaining ground slowly  That’s good in my judgment  There are the obvious points of difficulty  that have been addressed here, but on the long-range proposals, I’m entirely sympathetic with  what Governor Partee said  I think he stated it too well for me to attempt to add further to his  statement, and I would think in the present financial and monetary market situation in which we  find ourselves, [it would be] perfectly appropriate to put out a target that is 4 to 6-1/2     And I listened to Willis Winn, and I’m very concerned with these trends, and they’re  occurring over time  On the other hand, we haven’t really been able to codify and analyze  what’s happening here  And if I look at where we’ve been in the last six months or so, I would  not feel uncomfortable in not changing M2 and M3 from the present picture  I think dropping  M3 has significant difficulties with the extent of private housing that’s going on today  I would  come out in strong support of your proposals, Mr Chairman  And I think we have a small  luxury of adopting those proposals until we see in further meetings and further developments a  more cogent set of reasons for changing  I would support the 4 to 6-1/2 and the M2 and M3  position we’re in    I have no difficulty with the ranges of M1 and M2, but if you will  forgive me for appending an additional comment on your comment this morning, I don’t want a  6 percent federal funds rate without further deliberation  So I would support the narrower range  in the federal funds rate because I think this would be a most significant point in all of our  processes  And I see no reason to move that midpoint up, adopt a higher limit  Particularly in  this--and I suppose this is always true--sensitive time  So I would support the 5-1/4--the  alternative B federal funds rate range--very vigorously  "
471,1977-08-16,"  Gentlemen, I want to ask a question of staff and make one point  Last  year, we were in the midst [of the] bicentennial and a presidential election, and the country’s  bicentennial [celebrations were] dispersed  I don’t know how much travel occurred  Resort  travel, vacation business is a very large industry in this country, and I want to ask the staff, since  I don’t worship at the idol of seasonal adjustment, I continue to be impressed with where we are  in the calendar and I just want to ask the staff what indications they’ve had of Americans  traveling, going to resorts, vacationing     We’re concerned a little bit about the diminution in retail sales  This is a very normal year  in my opinion; there’s nothing terribly exciting going on  The economic factors, while they’re  not what we would like--let’s look at the average man and what his plans are for his  summertime  Jim, have we had any look at how much Americans are traveling or are away from  home on vacation, spending money in resort places, rather than in their normal residences?    Well, having followed long lines of campers and recreational vehicles,  and having been totally astounded by the traffic in rural Maine seaports, yes    Not what [President] Carter says  The Administration is very  concerned, of course, that Americans have not stopped driving and have--    Well, thank you  This may not be worth a memorandum, Jim     The point I wanted to make is that, in my career in lending, banking, it seemed to me that  there are two sides to this question of profit  [Unintelligible], one significant way to increase  profits of course, is to make capital investment  And we know that capital investment has  lagged, has been a disappointment to us  Prices can be raised, sure, if profits are inadequate, but  most of my manufacturing customers were continually on a process of applying capital to the  business of reducing their cost  And so, if we find American industry less likely or disposed to  make major capital investment for all the good reasons and uncertainties that we’re aware of,  we’re not getting the benefit from the profit side that one might expect and have to rely too much  on pressure on prices    I’m listening to the adjectives    I understand exactly what Frank is saying  Inflection in the voice,  examiners coming in early     8/16/77 - 39 -            The discount window is administered pretty expertly    We’re running late  I will try not to be long  I was not around here  when you got your reports of an 18 percent growth in M1  I was quite surprised when I heard  about it  And it bothers me because it is an out-of-phase blip  We’ve spent a lot of time trying  to explain our April surge, but we can’t find many good reasons for the July surge, and that  makes me a little uncomfortable  I think you took the right course  I think your telephonic  meeting was proper; I’m glad to see that you climbed that next ridge  I would also say that,  without that 18 percent change, the sensitivity that many of you have expressed about the  economy ahead and the reasonable satisfaction that our growth rate, though declining, will be all  right, are two points in some conflict     Therefore I come to the conclusion that the alternative B is a good idea, that the lower limit  could be 0 on M1 and 3 on M2, and that the federal funds rate might well be 5-3/4 to 6-1/2  But  I want to point out that--Governor Partee said it first--if you’ve got a 5 percent upper limit on  M1, you are probably going to be very, very quickly faced with going to the 6-1/2 federal funds  rate  So that’s why I prefer the 0 to 6 [on M1]  I think the skewed [federal funds] rate makes  pretty good sense, because the Desk has only 25 basis points to deal with at the moment, starting  from where we are today in the range that’s listed in alternative B     So in substance, what worries me most is the July surge, and I haven’t yet grappled enough  with the new math to understand or allay my fears  So I would follow that course  And as to the  directive, I think the aggregates directive would be probably a better solution    My 6-1/2 was related to the 0 to 6, and I’m willing to go back [to] 6-1/4  at 0 to 5     8/16/77 - 55 -            Tom, when was the five-year rule adopted?    Prior to the five-year rule, what was the Board’s procedure?    Mr Broida discussed this matter with me when he first denied the  request  The reason is, I’m another alternate for a Freedom of Information [Act] appeal  I  formed an opinion at that time, a very firm opinion--after Roger discussing months, whether  May [is] five years, or up from May, or for April--and the more I thought about it, the more I  became convinced in my own mind that this Committee met as a body in 1972 with a general  understanding that their Memoranda of Discussion would not be released and that therefore did  not anticipate either the Freedom of Information Act or that the Memoranda of Discussion would  be brought forward to be used for whatever purpose by media and otherwise except on a  standard basis  And I think it’s a disservice to the Committee, and I don’t know how many of us  were on that Committee  I know I wasn’t in 1972  And I believe it’s a disservice to that  Committee to change our rule, and accordingly I’m going to vote for alternative four, Mr  O’Connell, if that’s the one that you think I’m talking about     8/16/77 - 63 -            I think, more likely, that will inspire them to take it to court   Gentlemen, I want to make these points  When I considered this matter first with Mr Broida, I  did not consider it in the context of what the Chairman has just described  I thought about it a  good deal  I want to also try to reinforce the point I made  Those of us who sit at this Board are  fully experienced in the tyranny of a recorded meeting  And our meeting discussions are  inhibited  Now during those FOMC meetings in ’72, ’73, ’74, and ’75, you had no such  experience  You knew perhaps that your Memorandum of Discussion would be prepared and  released five years later     We sit here with a green light  I don’t see it this morning--it inhibits us as a Board of  Governors  We’re fully subject to the [Government in the] Sunshine [Act], and my experience  with the discussions that take place--and I have not reviewed those five years of minutes that will  eventually become available--lead me to believe that the proper course of action is not to do a  disservice to those who sat on those Committees over those years and spoke their minds with  only the condition that they knew their thoughts might be fully disclosed five years later, and [so     8/16/77 - 68 -           we should not] suddenly rush into court or rush into the New York Times with five years of  FOMC discussion  Now--    In case my remarks are misunderstood, I want to add this addendum   We are fully complying with Sunshine and Freedom of Information at this Board, but we know  what the rules are, and we’re living under those rules  And my position is based on the fact that  the FOMC didn’t know it was living under those rules five years ago  Or three years ago  Or  two years ago  I’m not trying to avoid the effect of Sunshine or Freedom of Information, I’m  simply pointing out that we’re now dealing with a post-operative situation, a situation that  occurred when the FOMC had no idea they were subject to those rules    I made a motion earlier  I will revise that and say I urge the Committee  to adopt a consensus that’s generally consistent with [alternative] four--    Yes, but you don’t want to bring it up--agricultural credit, farm credit,  use of the discount window   END OF MEETING         "
499,1977-09-20,"  I don’t know whether this will help or not, Jim, but I have some concern  about your analysis that indicates that the credit demands aren’t likely to show much change  over the balance of the year  I’m a fugitive from the crowding out theory  And as I look at this  situation, I have to try to find the perspective that said that the economic shock to consumers and  businessmen which ended in ’74 or early ’75 is now some ways away from us  It has given  people faced with tenuous employment, debt accumulations, and businesses with heavy  inventories a chance to reestablish their financial positions  And I think the majority of people in  businesses have had enough time to reestablish their financial positions  So I have to look now  at the attitudes and the propensity of people and businesses to incur indebtedness     And if I first look at the demand side, I find strong consumer demand  I think your figures  will show that  I find strong mortgage demand, and that’s been commented on extensively  And  I think that indicates that there will be strength in consumer spending, both in major durables and  automobiles  I don’t agree with you, Frank  I think there are some exciting new automobiles  coming out  And we are locked into an energy crisis [that] will generally inspire people to  attempt to buy cars that are not yet in the marketplace to obtain better mileage figures and  prepare for the modern energy crisis  I find state and local governments having weathered one of  the most serious crises in their history, beginning with a revelation that New York may go  bankrupt, that Massachusetts credit may disappear in the marketplace, and so I think that  offerings at the state and local level, or the needs to borrow there, may well continue     I think the demand at businesses is something we should look at very carefully  The  restructuring of balance sheets has clearly had plenty of time to go on  We used to have a  seasonal in this country, and I’m not talking about an adjusted seasonal but a heavier demand for  bank credits into the fall and through the Christmas season  And that seasonal has largely been  absent for the last couple of years as inventory positions became a burden  And people dealt  with those conditions as best they knew how, including, last year, probably not having enough  goods on hand to meet the Christmas demand or the year-end demand and so forth     So I think that farm credit, surely, Roger and others, is backed up, and there won’t be any  diminution in the demand of farmers to borrow  I think we may see a stronger use of seasonal  credit by businesses returning to a pattern that’s existed for two decades  I think capital  expenditures, while obviously weak and obviously not being a major factor in recent years, may  become more of a factor  When I look at all of the demand side from state and local  government, consumers, individual businesses, and I don’t--    --federal government, I haven’t mentioned that--I thought I was the  fugitive from the crowding out theory  But nevertheless, I look at the demand side, and then I  look at the supply side, and it’s also true the banks are offering more competitive terms   They’ve had time also to deal with their internal problem  We see evidence of cap loans, we see  evidence of fixed-rate loans  Now, I look at the money flowing in here from other countries, the  money and competitiveness of foreign banks in the US and foreign investment in the US  I  look at the insurance companies and the pension funds and their propensity to find investments   And I find the condition in total that suggests to me, Jim, that I can’t quite be comfortable with  your idea that total credit demand is likely to show little net change over the balance of this year   In fact, using all of this evidence, I would come to the modest conclusion that we are going to  see some expansion of credit    Jim, the average car in the United States is six years old?    Oh, it is    And I’m delighted    I guess you could have taken from my earlier remark today that I’m a  little apprehensive about the projections we have for the demand for total credit in the economy   And clearly we have been experiencing higher growth rates than we have expected at each of  these meetings  I am prepared to be quite conservative today  And I’m delighted that there is at  least tacit acceptance of the fact that the economy is not going to fall apart, because there are so  many other opinions expressed about appropriate lower monetary aggregates targets and letting  the funds rate rise further  I think we are clearly in a period where action should begin to be  taken  And [I would] reverse a statement I made many months ago that there were often periods  when one need not be overly concerned  But this time I’m prepared to work overtime  I don’t  see any reason why, if we are at a key point in determining the continuation of the recovery and  the strength of final demand and the like, we ought not to expect to make more decisions  between now and our next meeting than we might normally make     Therefore, I would not want to raise the upper end of the M1 proposal that the Chairman  suggested  If anything, I’d be as happy with something a little less  I’d leave M2 on a 4 to 8 as     9/20/77 - 52 -   recommended  And I will be perfectly agreeable with a 6 to 6-1/2 percent funds rate because I  suspect that by having this rather unsymmetrical set of specifics, we may be called on to take  some action between now and the time of the next meeting in October  And it wouldn’t bother  me a bit because we will have more information  But I do suspect that there will be a stronger  demand for money, as there has been, and certainly, from my earlier statement, I suspect that  conditions are favorable for expansion of credit  I can accept your proposal, Mr Chairman, and  I expect, if we did come to that, we would probably be hearing from the Manager sometime  "
524,1977-10-17,"  I’ll be very brief  The procedures that we have set for ourselves are to  determine the long-range proper course of action followed by monthly deliberations to achieve  those targets  It seems to me entirely appropriate to reinforce our dedication to the principle of  moderate growth consistent with the expected performance of the economy, and I think as a  layman, philosophically I would not quite understand the Fed widening its range on M1, the Fed  severely lowering its range on M1 for the next four quarters  The Fed has not been able to  manage M1 within the accepted long-run targets for some time this year  Therefore a  rededication to that principle seems to me entirely wise, and to couple that with a modest  lowering of the M2 target [and] M3 target seems entirely appropriate     I’ll have more to say when we get to the directive to the Desk for the period immediately  ahead, but I also say all of this in recognition of the fact that we have two great imponderables  today  the usual one, the economy--fortunately we have to go through the fourth quarter of ’77  before we get to ’78, so we’ll know a little more--and secondly, what’s happening to the velocity  at which M1 is moving through the economy  I would strongly support a hanging commitment  on M1, and because of the difference in performance of the aggregates, a modest lowering in M2  and M3--the upper end of the range    I do not    Gentlemen, I listened carefully to Frank’s description of our frailties,  and I was pleased with Chuck’s response, because he took into [account] the environments  surrounding the conditions in the past  I have no memory of those conditions at this table  It  seems to me we’re dealing with a curious change in velocity  Aggregates are responding to  something other than heavy demands for credit in the economy  We’re really dealing with a  reasonably technical and structural change  Now most of you are a little apprehensive about the  future of the economy, but you’re also willing to accept the fact that the economy may indeed  improve and that you’re not in a pause and not in a recession  I think we bear a very heavy  responsibility, because there is a technical factor pushing the growth of the aggregates which we  can neither understand fully nor explain to our own satisfaction     There are ample supplies of credit in the economy; the inflation numbers published by the  various agencies haven’t shocked anybody recently; unemployment--the country has lived with  it for some time; they just passed a jobs bill in the House; there’s an ample supply of energy  available for this winter, although we have long-range energy problems, as we’ve always had;  and Congress is about to adjourn  Putting all those things together, I’d say our posture is to  better understand our analysis of the aggregates     I would accept B very strongly for a very specific reason  I don’t want the Federal Reserve  to tip the scales in this matter  When I listen to the public world, I hear more concern about  rising interest rates than I do about inflation  Now we don’t have 220 million monetarists in this  country  And until I know a little more, I don’t want to vote for a 7 percent funds rate, which  will continue the recent basis point rise in the path  I think there’s some merit for us at this  stage--and I listened carefully to what Willis Winn has to say, too--to accept B  I strongly think  that, in accepting B, I am prepared to come back to the table anytime in the next 30 days to  decide that something else has happened and that we must take some further action or have the  Chairman call the Committee again But if we tip the scales, if we keep pushing because of the  structural change in M1, we can bear very heavy responsibility  And I’m willing to bear that, but  I just don’t think the economy is bubbling like that, that we have to bear it at this time     Maybe, in my own view, the rest of the fourth quarter is rather positive  I mentioned the  congressional adjournment, which will remove some of the business uncertainty in the near term   I think the automobiles have been delayed this year, and I think they’re going to be pretty good   And we are facing a Christmas season; building activity; commercial is now even beginning to  move after a boom in residential  Net supplies of credit in the economy are ample right now  I  don’t want to go for a 7 percent ceiling at this time on the funds rate  So I would support B    How do you vote when you are in favor of either one?  The point is, the  differences are small, and I’m not going to complain about package B even though I voted for A   If you put in the record somewhere that it was seven to four--  "
553,1977-11-15,"  Gentlemen, the core of this discussion is whether or not our instructions  to the Desk should be immediately released for the next 30 day of its activities  Do we need any  more evidence that the policies of this [Committee] over the last 30 years have been appropriate?      11/15/77 - 9 -         The last three weeks clearly indicated the impact of our activities on financial markets  We’re  enmeshed in [these] splendid intricacies of the law, and I firmly believe that we have a  responsibility to pursue that course  Appeal to the Supreme Court is a perfectly normal  procedure  You need suffer no embarrassment whatsoever by proposing that your position be  appealed to the Supreme Court  That’s what the intricacies of the law require us to do at this  stage if we don’t agree with the Court of Appeals decision  I’ve had decisions appealed to the  Supreme Court  We’re discussing the court’s interpretation of congressional intent  I think  clearly we should exhaust, and we have the responsibility to exhaust, all the normal courses of  action     I don’t look on this as an effort by the Federal Reserve to continue to hide its operations  [under] a blanket of secrecy  We’re talking about something we’ve all agreed in the past is an  extremely sensitive issue in the matter of the stability of financial markets  So I have no  reservation whatsoever about exhausting the normal, absolutely common legal proceedings  In  fact, whatever else we do in strategy, I believe personally that we’re required to exhaust the  courses of action that are open to us at the moment    I’m pleased that so many of you have been optimistic  I believe in a  sequential analysis  And I look at the length of this recovery and recognize that, all through the  recovery, we’ve had the troublesome question of lack of business confidence, business  investment; consumer confidence has varied  I don’t find that too strange in view of where we  were when the recovery started and the great shocks that have occurred in the economy  And  then, almost immediately, the engagement of a political campaign for the Presidency and then  maybe nine months to inspect the new Administration and what their initiatives were, and they  flowed quite freely     But now we find a little drawing back  I expect that the energy program will be addressed  by Congress in the Joint [Economic] Committee, and then eventually we will have some energy  policies finally put in place  Not as extensive as some might wish, but perhaps not as macro in  some respects, as others claim is necessary  I see uncertainties clearing up  I see uncertainties     11/15/77 - 29 -         about the intent of the Administration when a revised Humphrey-Hawkins agreement is reached   Now Social Security bothers me, but at least it has come out of the unknown and into the known     I look at all of this, and I see the staff slightly improve the fourth quarter, and that’s  exactly what I wanted to do at the last meeting  At the last meeting, I said, fortunately you have  to get through the fourth quarter before you get to 1978  What I meant by that comment was  simply this  I see that the propensity of people to remain in a confused, uncertain, and  conservative mood has certain time limits  Life is not infinite, and I expect that if we do have  this reasonably good fourth quarter--in fact, I expect it to be a little better than the staff does--but  even if we do, I expect that this will have some impact on business and consumer attitudes in  1978     Now underneath all of this is a very large pent-up idea that optimism breaks through at  some point--the clouds part  We haven’t had the benefit of that in any part of this recovery  I  totally agree with Chuck Partee that the propensity of people to reduce their forecast [according]  to the length of the forecast is a natural and human characteristic  So I see some chance for not  only the good ’77 fourth quarter but the continuance into ’78  And if I’m correct--and some of  these things brighten, and some of the confusion is cleared away, and some of the fear of  macrogovernment policy is reduced--gentlemen, we have an opportunity, we may not all  welcome it, but we do have an opportunity to see a second phase coming into this recovery,  where there is less pessimism, more realization of the gains we have achieved so far, and an  opportunity, clearly an opportunity, to increase economic activity     I’m not predicting that yet  I’m just saying I think the fourth quarter will be good, and  that’ll influence the next year--and further, that sequentially, that will have a significant impact  on our best estimates in 1978  Now this sounds like an optimist talking, but I’ve tried to sort out  the background and reasons why I feel there is a latent opportunity for further strength in ’78   That becomes part of an emotional analysis that has to do with the propensity of people to not go  on [being] forever beset by confusion and fear and reluctance    Gentlemen, I have no problems  I would like to adopt alternative B and  I won’t dissent if you modestly adjust it  I don’t think it’s time, yet, Ernie, to proceed on  [Regulation] Q  "
580,1977-12-19,"  The only thing that I didn’t like was--I think Chuck did that extremely  well--but I don’t like his idea of characterizing as a small, unimportant addition in the first  recommendation    I strongly support that as you know  I’m sorry I called you on this, very  minor change       12/19-20/77 - 10 -          The South and the West were settled by immigrants from New England    Well, I have very little to say  I felt two months ago that the staff was  not expecting as good a fourth quarter as I thought I saw in prospect  I said at the time,  “Fortunately, we have to go through the fourth quarter to get to 1978”  We are having a good  fourth quarter, and I’m not going to abandon the staff now that they have improved their forecast  for ’78  I am also interested in the Redbook comments, which I take as a further expression by  my colleagues that they see relatively good conditions     I refer to the automobile industry only because it’s commented on as a disappointment   But I want to point out that [it is] a disappointment [that] is confined to two or possibly three of  our 3-1/2 major producers  And we have evidence [of] foreign car sales and evidence of one  auto company which is setting all kinds of records  Now I think that the auto companies that are  not achieving this have expressed clearly their view that they have created some unpopular  models  But I have great confidence that these people are flexible enough to deal with the  situation if a competitor is succeeding well  I expect that they will make some adjustments in  their own activity     The preliminary surveys taken some months ago on capital expenditures for 1978 seem  incongruously low, and all of us are now agreeing that those surveys were perhaps biased in a  most conservative way  Housing continues to be a keystone of what is going on  All in all,  gentlemen, I’m quite pleased with the way ’77 is ending and with the staff’s forecast for ’78   I’m particularly pleased that the domestic monetary markets have quieted, and this is all very  helpful to me as we approach the next subject on this agenda     I’m still optimistic about the extension of this long-term recovery  I even see virtue, as has  been said a number of times before in other meetings, in the fact that we haven’t had full support  of a strong capital spending program, and therefore there is an element that could reinforce the  staff’s projection for ’78 and could surprise us in some respect  I don’t look for this particularly,  because there are too many constraints on capital spending  I just point out that we really have  one way to go on capital spending    Mr Chairman, I can agree with your specifications, and if we can  negotiate a slightly lower top, I won’t have any trouble with that  But in any event, I believe that  I came into this discussion with the hopes that we would continue on as much of our present  course as possible, and I would favor the money market formulation in order to do that  So I  have no difficulty with your proposal     12/19-20/77 - 75 -        "
600,1978-01-05,"  You can hear me, I hope  Last week we met with the acting Secretary of  the Treasury  The Secretary was out of town so we met with the Under Secretary for Monetary  Affairs  We discussed this problem and we reached some agreements with them which were later  reduced to writing  We have a letter from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve referring to our  interventions to that point, confirming that they were made in close consultation with the Treasury  and that the Treasury was fully aware of and in full concurrence with what we were doing   Secondly, we asked the Treasury to begin the process of freeing the Exchange Stabilization Fund to  participate with us  They also confirmed in writing that they would do that and would meet with  the appropriate banking committee leaders on the Hill to explain our concern and to point out the  need for the US Treasury or the United States government to assist and to take a clear  proprietorial part in these operations     I accompanied Tony Solomon, the Under Secretary, to Mr Proxmire’s office and we had an   hour-long discussion about the dollar, the exchange rate difficulties of the dollar, and the disorderly  markets  He pursued questions with the Under Secretary as to what effect might be expected by the     1/5/78 3  Treasury [in the event] of some action on energy matters and he reviewed the status of and  expectations regarding our trade balance  The Under Secretary told Mr Proxmire that the Treasury  would like to join us in these activities  He said he would like to arrange his own swap [line] with  the Bundesbank of upwards of $1 billion  [He indicated] that this would not exhaust all of the  ability of the Exchange Stabilization Fund; they perhaps could go further if the need was obvious   Mr Proxmire agreed to that proposal and accepted the actions that we had done on our own as  being appropriate  Prior to our talking to Mr Proxmire jointly, the Under Secretary had attempted  to arrange a meeting with Congressman Reuss of the House [Banking] Committee  He was unable  to do that because Mr Reuss was overseas  But Mr Solomon was able to talk with Mr Reuss  before he left for overseas and received what he characterized as a general agreement with the  conditions and principles that he had discussed with Senator Proxmire  The Under Secretary also  contacted two members of key subcommittees in the House and Senate, Congressman Neil and  Senator Stevenson, and they were fully advised of the process that was begun on that day   Following that development and with the clearance to go ahead, the Treasury arranged a billion  dollar swap line with the Bundesbank--that was the genesis of the announcement that went out  yesterday--and the Bundesbank approved it and they have been full partners [in the intervention  operations] today, as you have heard      Alan and Scott, on this question of foreign banks, is it likely that these  banks are operating facilities both in the United States and overseas or are you looking at them  from an overseas standpoint?     1/5/78 6   "
620,1978-01-17,"  Only to say that I don’t disagree with his presumption that it indeed has a   possibility of being enacted; it’s not an ethereal sort of idea at all  The Home Loan Bank Board has  [seen] the liquidity positions of the savings institutions declining, and it has been speaking about  that for months  I believe, [based on those] conversations, that they are concerned about the  availability of mortgage funds in the institutions      Not to my knowledge  Not an increase  We have in effect just touched on   disintermediation in their comments about their studies of the liquidity conditions of the institutions  and the amount of Home Loan Bank Board borrowings that they are using  I think, Chuck, I would  fully agree with you  It’s certainly not out of the question that the coordinating committee would     1/17/78             21  agree to consider such an issue, if events incorporated in the staff projection become facts     Well, I feel that in view of the imminence of a decision of some kind on   Merrill, it might be very wise to put it off at this point  We’ll know whether the Solicitor General  is going to take the appeal to the Supreme Court        1/17/78             27   Well, I don’t want to revisit all of the discussion  I have accepted the   staff’s forecast and I feel reasonably comfortable with it  We’ve been through a long recovery,  excessively long, and we’ve looked for ghosts almost at every meeting since it started  I have my  own personal theory that in time--although there are new ghosts at this meeting--[others will join]  the consumer, who demonstrated [a willingness to spend] in the last quarter of the year  And prior  to that time [the recovery was] driven by consumer spending  Eventually, others will begin to  sense that it’s time to meet this marketplace, if consumer spending continues  And we have in  prospect a fiscal action, which would put more money into the hands of consumers  Somebody  suggested that the theory of a lack of confidence or confidence wearing out is a possibility  There  are obviously technological changes; there are new markets and new activities  Some constraint  will be put on imports; I don’t know altogether how much  But if I were a businessman, I would  see some opportunity and I would have a belief in a longer term for the recovery  I’m not trying to  make the second half of the year more questionable, along the lines that Phil has suggested  I don’t  necessarily agree with that  In all, I can accept the staff forecast and I look at some point to a  change in the general disposition of business confidence as well as consumer confidence  I’ve been  waiting a long time; I may never get there  But still there’s more to be heard; there’s a possibility  of pluses occurring in that area  So, I don’t object to the staff forecast at all, and I think all told  we’d better design our directive in accordance with it because we may have more demands for  lending--more demands for funds as the year progresses        1/17/78             34   Well, I haven’t much to add to all that’s been said  I would like to see the   ranges brought down a little  I can accept the 1-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent President Volcker suggested  and the 5 to 9 percent or even some modest shaving of the top there  But I’m curious about this  6-5/8 to 7-1/8 percent, using fractions [of eighths on the funds rate range]  I don’t quite know how  to handle that  The other idea is to bring the [intermeeting] funds rate span to an even narrower  range; several have suggested 6-3/4 percent as the lower end  When we get through with this we     1/17/78             50  are going to be down to one rate; we’re not going to have a range  Therefore, I’m confused  But I  would add 1/4 to the 7 percent [top]  If that requires you, for orderly discussion, to bring the 6-1/2  up to 6-5/8 percent, okay Otherwise, I would add a 1/4 to the 7 and go with the lower range for M1  as Paul suggested    "
716,1978-04-18,"  No, I don’t have any difficulties [with that]       4/18/78             35    I will put it very simply  When you testify you will, I am sure, indicate  that you have discussed all these measures with the Committee and, therefore--       4/18/78             40    Yes, that whatever you’ve come to, you have talked it over with the  FOMC  Now, that doesn’t indicate exactly how far you would go in saying three members  disagreed on the low side and two members were very much [higher]  I wouldn’t do that  That is  terribly dangerous  We will all be testifying on our own forecasts  Having expressed the  projection, I think if you made it very clear that you talked with the full Committee and had gotten  their views, then I would feel more comfortable about it      I’d only say that I have listened carefully to Chuck and am supportive of  his statement    "
738,1978-05-05,"  Well, I think you’ve made a very modest request and I could go along  with it without difficulty  The thing I think we should remember, because this is a political world,  is that what we have done so far has been reasonably accepted and I think that will help us if we  have to go further  But your request is quite reasonable and I would be able to support it    "
756,1978-05-16,"  Yes, I’m reasonably in agreement with the staff  I’ve been thinking that  this very old and aging recovery would eventually get a thrust from business investment spending  and you seem to feel that that’s coming on now  That can only not be a factor for a certain period  of time; it must come on [eventually]  Technologies change and costs change  I’ve also been  convinced since last fall that it’s time to change automobiles  There are an incredible number of  models which offer longer mileage and certain advantages like front wheel drive  It’s quite  impressive and, therefore, I’m not surprised at all by the automobile record that you expect and that  the industry is anticipating  So I believe that there is merit to the staff forecast and that we will  have a stronger period this year than we originally thought      Well, you’ve heard me speak before about the danger of organized  meetings of groups who will then feel that they are pressed to do something  I would be supportive  of your view  I think we have had good luck and good fortune and the Federal Reserve’s role has  been somewhat spotlighted  And I am not sure enough about a continuation of this bulge to be  certain that we should throw at the country a significantly higher rate at this time  We’ve got some  transactions balances to worry about--the announcement we made about transferring funds from  savings to checking accounts  We have a new system for setting ceiling rates  And I’d just as soon  move cautiously at this time for any length of time that you wish  It may not be as long as [until]  the next meeting but it certainly would require another conference of some kind  So I would much     5/16/78              33  prefer not to boost the fed funds rate significantly higher than we have already boosted it  There  we will be leading  The prime rate will go up and all kinds of things will happen  Therefore, I  would stay around [the current rate] for awhile      Tell me what the funds rate is  What’s the range?      What I wanted or hoped for is a consultation before we went above 7-1/2      We have 30 days, don’t we?    "
784,1978-06-20,"  Well, you just heard a very scholarly presentation and you=re not going to  get one now      I have no staff so I=m glad to accept the staff=s work and material  I noticed  the Presidents often comment on their staff and the Board=s staff but I don=t have that problem since I  don=t have a staff at all  The feeling I have is always related to where we=ve been  I think back to a  year ago and unemployment was just beginning to break at this time  I=m not quite certain when it  was but a little before June I think it began to subside  Employment continued to grow in great  measure       Now, all I want to suggest is that the common interest today is inflation  The President has  appointed an inflation fighter czar  Everybody is talking about inflation  Everybody is being asked  to do something about inflation  I just don=t believe these pleas will fall entirely on deaf ears  The  public is terrified about inflation  I think that when we set the national mind to achieving something  we have to estimate as best we can what will be achieved  I think there will be stop-and-go on  inflation in preventing its growth  We just released more South American beef into this country to  offset somewhat the rising price of beef here at home and that=s kind of a courageous act; nobody=s  really pleased because our farmers had a couple of tough years  So, I think a national purpose to do  our best to control inflation will be respected       In any event, I=m also persuaded that there=s a little more strength in the economy than many  of you are willing to [suppose]  I see in my own routine survey that the conglomerate movement is     6/20/78                27  starting up again  Why the heck is the conglomerate movement starting up again?  It got us into all  kinds of trouble the last time it started up in this fashion but we see it happening all the time  At the  present time banks who have for two years been doing their best to control their bought funds--to  reduce them and to get rid of their bad loans--are now in a position where they=re more aggressive   They=ve been through that cold shower  So I think credit availability is likely and in time that will  add some fuel to this recovery we=re in  I have always thought that capital investment was due to be  part of this at some time in the future and it is now beginning to be  Some people are telling me that  it isn=t likely to persist but if we=re talking about inflation and investment, we=ve got two connected  things  If you can put in a process or machinery in a plant that will reduce your cost, you=re being  very patriotic on the inflation side  So I expect to see an inflation push coming on      I don=t think unemployment will go high  All the country has been dealing with this question,  or trying to deal with it, of unemployment in an affluent society  It is down to 6 percent now  All  possible policies have not been used; more can be  Chances are that minimum wages can be  ameliorated in the future to keep the youngsters employed who would otherwise be priced out of the  market  So I think we=re going to have a fair experience with employment  When I put all this  optimism together I get to the point where I think the staff forecast is, if anything, about right  I  don=t think that employment will go much over 6 percent  And I don=t think inflation will go much  over 7-1/2, particularly if it=s a national purpose of this country and our whole society to keep  inflation down the best we can  I think the housing activities will continue  As Phillip said, it isn=t a  great activity but nevertheless it certainly is [important] at the Federal Reserve Board      Four      I can agree with Paul and Dave on the measures specified  I=m a little bit  concerned about going up because everybody expects it, and the market has discounted it and  everything else but I guess there=s no alternative      I would much prefer 5 to 10    "
839,1978-08-15,"  I wasn't here last month, so I don't have to correct what I said      I don't take any exception to the general consensus including the staff's  3-1/2, 7-3/4, and 62 for unemployment  I've felt that this recovery is a little stronger than most of  my colleagues, I think  I've always felt that  It hasn't yet disappointed me although it may be going     8/15/78             17  to do so very soon  In any event, I have gone along on that course for quite a number of months  and I'm not going to change at this point        I have no difficulty with the 5 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 or Paul Volcker's  specification--and 7-3/4 to 8-1/4  But I am convinced that some reference to the international  situation would be well advised in view of our former experience recently and in view of the great  interest that has to center around the decline of the dollar  I think the last one worked beautifully  and I think this will have a salutary [effect]      Well, I'm very pleased with what you just said  I concur with Henry and  Philip and whoever else was suspicious  There's an underlying problem here that's got to be  solved Now, we can try with intervention and a stop-gap measure  But I'm sincerely suspicious of  the effectiveness of that    "
863,1978-09-19,"  Well, I can agree with the staff's forecast  I've felt in the last month or   so that we've had lots of points of strength and an implicit desire to be pessimistic  I just can't do  that when we've had as much strength as we've had  I'll go along with the staff's forecast      I have difficulty in hearing my colleagues, which means I’ve missed   great wisdom  I'm sorry     I have no problems with alternative B and the intermeeting range for the   federal funds rate with 8-3/4 as the midpoint on whatever range we set  We do have to slow the  aggregates; we often immediately reach for the red telephone when the aggregates show higher  numbers than they should or than we want  But that doesn't seem to work very well, both in the  longer ranges and the shorter ranges  I think we ought to keep playing the same game and put the  range for M1 and M2 in October [unintelligible]  Nobody mentioned the fact that M1 is going to  change all around [soon]  When is it, the 1st of November, Steve?       9/19/78            24     That's going to create some havoc with our systematic collection of   figures     Right  In any event, that's the way I would feel, Mr Chairman     Yes   "
