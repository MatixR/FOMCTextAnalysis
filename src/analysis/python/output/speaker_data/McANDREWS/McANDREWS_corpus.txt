  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The last time that reserve   collateral accounts, or RCAs, were discussed, at the November 2009 FOMC meeting,   a decision was made to delay further operational work on them to avoid any   contention for resources with the implementation efforts for the term deposit facility    As the TDF work subsequently progressed, an RCA planning group was convened    This group consists of staff from all the relevant System groups and is considering in   detail the operational and policy issues associated with their implementation  This   group has explored all the expected operational implications of establishing and   March 16, 2010 9 of 146    managing RCAs and has found no major impediments to their implementation  In   particular, the group has found that RCAs would likely be straightforward to   implement and operate using existing Federal Reserve platforms with only relatively   minor changes to accounting and reserves procedures  The legal aspects of RCAs are   clearly an important element in their creation, and Board and Federal Reserve Bank   of New York attorneys have written a draft agreement under which the accounts and   their transactions would be governed  The degree to which RCAs would fulfill their   goal of a tighter link between interest on reserves and market rates is uncertain; past   interviews with market participants are encouraging but not definitive  I now turn to   a summary of the RCA policy goal and how RCAs would be expected to achieve   their goal; my remarks summarize a memo that was distributed to FOMC members   last Wednesday            The large negative spread between the interest rate paid on excess reserves and   the effective federal funds rate has raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s ability   to remove monetary policy accommodation smoothly using interest on reserves alone    One explanation given for the size of this spread focuses on the limited nature of the   competition among buyers of funds sold by the government-sponsored enterprises, or   GSEs  The GSEs, who are ineligible to earn interest directly from the Federal   Reserve and are significant sellers of federal funds, considerably reduced their lists of   approved counterparties and credit lines starting in September 2008  As a result,   competition for their funds has fallen, and buyers are able to purchase funds from   GSEs at rates well below the IOER rate   If RCAs were made available, GSEs and potentially even some banking   institutions that lend at rates below the IOER rate would have the option of selling   funds to banks that owned RCAs, where the funds in such accounts would serve as   collateral for the repayment of the principal amount of the loan  The dramatically   reduced level of credit risk on these transactions could prompt GSEs to lend to an   expanded set of counterparties for potentially larger amounts, thereby improving the   competitive environment for the sales of funds  Under more competitive conditions,   trading in federal funds would be expected to move closer to the IOER rate     Information obtained through a limited number of staff conversations with two of   the GSEs suggests a strong interest on their part as lenders in the RCA concept, but   conversations with a small number of depository institutions have not yielded much   concrete information about their potential interest as borrowers under these   arrangements  Thus, a significant outstanding question is the likely extent of   participation of borrowers in RCAs, which could ultimately determine their impact on   the federal funds rate  Notably, however, all of the interviewees felt that RCAs   would narrow the spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate  One   possible drawback of RCAs is that, if they work as intended, there would likely be   fewer sales of fed funds by GSEs to banks  As transactions of this type currently   dominate the brokered trades used in the Desk’s calculation of the effective federal   funds rate, RCAs could make measurement of the effective federal funds rate less   reliable     March 16, 2010 10 of 146                One question that should be addressed is whether the RCA program would be   needed if the Fed plans to conduct reverse repos with the GSEs  The following   reasoning suggests that RCAs would indeed continue to serve their policy objective in   that case  First, it is not certain that an RRP program arranged by the Fed, where we   expect to conduct term RPs with periodic auctions to settle on T+1 via the triparty   repo mechanism, would necessarily be structured to fit with the GSEs' particular   investment preferences  GSEs clearly prefer a same-day settlement, overnight option,   which we are unlikely to accommodate with RRPs  In addition, because GSEs cannot   incur daylight overdrafts, they would prefer RCAs at a given interest rate because   they control the timing of return of funds, while in the triparty repo mechanism they   have less control  It is also not clear that GSEs would necessarily be able to   participate in RRPs on the scale they would desire  GSE lending volume has   fluctuated between $50 and $100 billion during the past six months and appears to   vary by $10 to $20 billion in a typical month  RCAs may be better suited to handle   such short-term fluctuations in supply than RRPs, which are targeted toward less   volatile supply  It is also not clear what the long-run disposition of an RRP program   will be, in terms of size, whereas RCAs represent a change in the account framework   that would be expected to last as long as there was market demand for the product,   regardless of what we might prefer to do with discretionary operations  Finally,   RCAs put their use at the discretion of the seller of funds, whether it be a bank or a   GSE, while RRPs will be conducted with a specified dealer, money market fund, or   GSE counterparty at the Fed’s discretion   Staff recommends that policymakers ask the planning group to proceed with the   following steps  Complete the necessary legal agreements; enter into discussions   with the FDIC regarding the treatment of RCAs in bank resolutions; share the term   sheet of the legal agreements with GSEs on a confidential basis to allow them to write   the bilateral legal agreements that they would need in order to enter into RCA   arrangements with depository institutions; and, once the RCA proposal is made public   through the publication of the minutes of the March FOMC meeting or another   vehicle, engage the GSEs and their possible counterparties as needed to better   determine their interest in entering into RCA agreements   The planning group would expect to be able to report back at the April FOMC   meeting, and if the RCAs appear to be desired by GSEs and their counterparties, the   group would recommend going forward with publishing a notice for public comment   to amend Regulation D prior to a final decision to make RCAs available  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  That concludes our prepared remarks     Yes, Mr Chairman, and that would also involve essentially   making the concept public to facilitate the discussions with the GSEs and depository institutions    But then we’d report back to the Committee regarding the outcome of all of those discussions, at   which time we’d have a more precise view on how the market would receive RCAs   March 16, 2010 12 of 146      The observation is that they are concerned about the risk  It’s not   necessary that they can unilaterally change the competitive conditions that they face  So the fact   March 16, 2010 15 of 146    that they shed almost half of their counterparties after September 2008 is consistent with their   being very concerned about their risk  The questions are whether any one individual GSE can   change competitive conditions sufficiently to get higher interest rates, and what is essentially the   elasticity of the interest rates that it would face if it expanded its counterparties  That does not,   however, suggest that it wouldn’t be beneficial to both the GSEs and, more importantly, the   market for funds altogether, if there were a more competitive environment for the bidding for   funds  The Federal Reserve is paying 25 basis points to the banks for holding this risk-free asset,   and that is not getting passed on, through a competitive mechanism, to nonbanks  The RCA   program is attempting to achieve that  No individual GSE can affect competitive conditions very   much by adding or dropping one counterparty     Your point about the allocation of rents between the GSEs and the   banks is well taken  But the point of the RCAs is to create a competitive environment for the   purchase of funds generally  And this will set a harder floor on rates as conveyed by the IOER   rate  Again, the problem is essentially that the Fed is paying 25 basis points, and yet that   monetary impetus is not being passed on to nonbanks generally  In a frictionless banking   system, the funding rate for banks would be bid up to 25 basis points  That underlies Jeff’s   comments that the IOER rate should be the funding rate of banks  In fact, it’s the rate that banks   earn on a certain asset, but through competition we would expect the funding rate to be equal to   the IOER rate  In fact, it’s well below the IOER rate now, and so RCAs are intended to make the   link much tighter   Another point is with regard to the volatility of that spread between the funds rate and the   IOER rate  With a more competitive environment at such high levels of reserves, we expect very   little volatility between the market rates and the IOER rate, such as we’ve seen just recently   Finally, on measurement, and perhaps Brian can talk about this, we are considering better   ways of measuring market rates generally, and we expect that the RCA would lead to higher   market rates not just in the measured effective federal funds rate but in repo rates and euro dollar   rates   March 16, 2010 19 of 146      We discussed it  At current rates of euro dollars and RPs, with   RCAs banks would certainly start borrowing euro dollars and RPs  That would increase demand   in those markets and lead those rates to rise as well  So that’s a fundamental linkage between   those market rates     I think that whether we use reverse RPs, term deposit facility, or   RCAs, the GSEs will have to get paid a higher rate for the federal funds rate to rise  An element   common to reverse RPs, RCAs, and term deposits is that GSEs would receive higher interest   rates in the market by their counterparties—under RRPs, it would be by the Federal Reserve—  but the intent is to raise market rates in a way that they would earn higher rates in the market    Again, when the Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay interest on reserves, the idea was to   avoid the reserve tax for banks, and essentially it was an oversight that many other entities—the   Treasury, the GSEs, the World Bank, and so on—had balances at the Federal Reserve, but they   were not reserve balances  The fact that the GSEs are heavy users of the federal funds market is   essentially an unhappy coincidence  What we’d simply like to achieve is a very competitive   environment when they’re out selling their funds, and that competitive environment would be   conveyed to all sellers of funds who are funding banks  It would be essentially a healthier   market overall and not something that would benefit the GSEs necessarily  So we think it’s   perfectly consistent with the legislative mandate
