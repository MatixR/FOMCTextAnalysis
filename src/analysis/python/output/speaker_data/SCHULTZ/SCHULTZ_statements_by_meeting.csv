1125,1979-08-14," Well, I want you to know that I shall protect my position as the caboose with fervor! My feelings are pretty much the same as I expressed to you yesterday, Mr Chairman It seems to me that inflation and credit demands, the difficulty in projecting the aggregates, and the sensitivity of the dollar would argue very clearly against any easing On the other hand, in spite of the little snapback that we've had in July, the economy is certainly very fragile And in spite of the persuasive arguments in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York [article] on demographics and credit cards, I continue to be worried about the level of consumer debt I'm very concerned about consumer confidence, not just because of the Michigan and Conference Board surveys, but in light of the longer-term kinds of studies that are made about consumer confidence I just don't know how low that can go and I don't know how serious the recession could get I think that is a clear and present danger, so I would argue against any very strong moves to tighten  That leaves me to suggest that we stay where we are or tighten moderately It seems to me that at this point in time a message is very important, so I'm persuaded that we should tighten moderately I am concerned that the messages we send be clear, which under ordinary circumstances might make me want to take a little stronger move than I would support today But in the present circumstances, with everything that has been said in the media and with the changes in leadership, it seems to me that any move toward tightening is going to be a fairly clear message I would hope that sometime in the future we could narrow the aggregates ranges and let the fed funds be perhaps more volatile But I would be a little concerned about that right now, as perhaps muddying the waters a little on the clarity of the message I would also have a bit of concern right now about raising the discount rate because I would like to save some powder if the message is not taken as we think it is going to be So I would come down generally in favor of alternative C; but the fed funds rate range I would prefer is Governor Partee's 10-1/2 to 11-1/4 percent "
1153,1979-09-18," Furthermore, there was actually an announcement  by the Bank of America that it was going to make automobile loans at  12 percent--a lower rate just to help out the automobile dealers as a  sales mechanism It would be an unusual situation, but it certainly  doesn‘t indicate much tightening   Well, I’ve only been on this [Committee] for  six weeks and we’re having a little barnyard humor, so I’ll just say  that unfortunately I feel like the little boy who dropped his bubble  gum in the barnyard! It’s a very difficult time to be here I think  we have a Hobson‘s choice It seems to me that the likelihood is that  the economy is going to weaken and we‘re going to get accused of  overkill, overstaying [a restrictive policy] The problem is, if we  look at it on the other side, that’s conjectural; the facts are that  the aggregates continue to grow And it’s hard to find where monetary  policy is biting very much We see a little in real estate, and a few  banks talk about their consumer credit [lending] at a fixed [interest]     9/18/79 -33 -    rate so they‘re beginning to slow down But by and large it’s hard to  find very much bite any place I call around the country and I don’t  find very many people screaming very hard There just isnrt very much  pain out there I‘d love to believe these numbers but the problem is  I don’t know what inflation is doing to them I don‘t know what  people are really doing in response to that and what kind of variances  we have So I‘m afraid I just have to go with what I can see and what  I know to be the facts And those are that the economy still looks  pretty strong and the aggregates continue to rise   So I come down on the side of some further tightening I  would go with an increase in the discount rate and some moderate  tightening in the federal funds rate, though probably not very much  I would like to see the range widened to at least 100 points and at  some point in time deal with the stimulative problem that President  Eastburn talked about when we start coming out [of recession] I’d  like to see us go to an aggregates directive but now probably is not  the time, with all the volatility But my feeling is that we need to  take another [tightening step]   I‘m happy At some point in time I’d like to  see us go with a wider [federal funds] range and the aggregates  directive but right now, considering the volatility problem, I’d be  happy with your proposal  "
1187,1979-10-06," 12 percent?   I think we are going to get a bigger  psychological impact than you think we're going to get   I‘m going to vote for the 46 percent   Well, looking to the future, I may want to let  [the funds rate] be more responsive, because in my mind that’s one of  the advantages of this system The technique fits the times; our  situation is more volatile So, that’s one of the reasons I like  this I would vote yes, for the time being, on the package that you  presented  "
1230,1979-11-20," That's seasonally adjusted   I think the only economic law I believe in at  this point in time is Murphy's Law I don't know how human beings are  going to behave in this particular period, so I'm torn It seems to  me that autos and housing are very weak and the rest of the economy  continues to hang up there I have a feeling that at some point  that's going to change Consumer attitudes are going to change and  things are going to get pretty weak rather quickly; and I would like  to be responsive when that occurs On the other hand, it seems to me  that we have some real dangers from oil and other exogenous shocks  over the near term I wonder what shape we'd be in if we hadn't taken  the steps we took on October 6 ,  in view of what is happening in Iran  It seems to me that we'd be in pretty bad shape So my feeling is  that we have to continue to hold on to this [policy] a while longer     11/20/79 -35-   and that puts me somewhere in between ""B"" and ""C"" I feel that  Governor Partee's approach is a very reasonable one  "
1257,1980-01-08," The Chairman giveth and the Chairman taketh away!  They differentiate that much between buying money and borrowing it?  I thought you were going to quote the Heisenberg [uncertainty] principle That merely states that if you observe it, you automatically change it by the act of observation and, therefore, you can't possibly know what it actually is  -19-    1/8-9/80  What would [your view be] if we say on the long-range issue that we are not going to publish any figures but merely say that we are on a long-range program to reduce inflation and we're just going to set money supply [targets] each year that are consistent with a continued reduction in inflation?  Do you think we have the luxury to do that, Willis? It seems to me that we are charged with deeper responsbility than that  It's an uncertain world so we need all the flexibility we can get We need at least a 3 percentage point range, with a midpoint of 4-1/2 to 5 percent, which would argue for alternative 2 or a half point higher Longer range I agree that we'd be absolutely foolish to set specifics I do think it's necessary that we say something that indicates some commitment or resolve of some kind We're the only group that has any credibility to do so I think that's absolutely essential for us if we are going to continue to attack the inflationary expectations problems  What in your opinion is likely to be the effect of the announcement this morning that OPEC is seriously going to pursue a basket of currencies?  Jim, you have an inflation rate of about 15 percent this first quarter, don't you?  There was an announcement that the prices of homes declined some in November We've been wrestling with this question of when we will start to see a leveling out of the housing component in the CPI Are we getting any better feel as to when we will see some impact? Is it as early as March, or are we going to have to wait until later before we see any impact?  You did mean to say it was multiplicative, didn't you?  -49-    1/8-9/80  But don't you think, even though one could view this as very imprecise in terms of the numbers we come out with, that we can predict the direction? Isn't that really the more crucial question?  I'm just very uncertain about where this economy is going to go, particularly in this quarter I can foresee a situation in which growth of 6 percent could be very restrictive and growth of 3 percent could be very loose, depending upon what happens So I come out between ""B"" and ""C"" and I would hope that there's some  -73-    1/8-9/80  real flexibility for us to react as we see what actually is going to occur this quarter I do have some concern about interest rates I'd like to see them slowly come down as we go through the year It would worry me if we had a sharp drop in interest rates in this quarter when we show very high inflation rates That could be disastrous in the foreign exchange markets and I don't think it would give a very good impression to the country as a whole I come out somewhere between the B and C alternatives  As I see it, Steve said the best estimate the staff can make at this time is that January [Ml growth] looks like 5 percent That would mean that if we center it on 4 percent, we're going to have to have some additional restraint at this point in time, and I'm not sure that that's that we want "
1285,1980-02-04," That sort of follows the pattern for most everything, doesn't it?  And he will now deliver an unbiased opinion!  I'd like to comment--I'm probably the only simple-minded person on the Committee--that I found your presentation to be the best I've seen It was presented in a form that I found very easy to understand and I liked it  And year-over-year is different from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  What do you have year-over-year, for 1980 over 1979?  For everything  Eggert is very cheap Why don't you go ahead and buy it so you can have it?  What kind of assumption do you have on normal GNP growth? To put those figures together, you need some assumption on normal growth too Is 2-1/2 percent what you used? That's what I think the staff here is using as their assumption  Well, you have to make some assumption to come up with the calculations  That's fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, though; that's not [the rate] in the fourth quarter  Well, as everybody around here is aware, I have had a high degree of uncertainty about what was going to happen I have a little less right now, so far as my feelings about the near term are concerned I see three areas of weakness First, I think the economy is a little weaker than the numbers will show in January because the weather in January was so remarkably good all over, and I think that had a considerable effect I am seeing some areas of restraint that are secondary kinds of reactions to the October 6th [action] In the area of consumer credit, more and more banks are cutting back on the availability of consumer credit and are increasing the price and other factors We're also seeing that with [credit extended by] retail establishments; Sears and Penneys and others have recently made those kinds of announcements So, I think we are seeing some restraint that hasn't been there before and the pressure is increasing in that area I do not think that we have seen the low in housing I agree with Frank Morris that it's going to go lower; it could go considerably lower We saw that chart on the commitment rate, and my understanding is that the situation may be even worse than that chart looks And that's bound to begin to spill over into housing durables pretty quickly It hasn't done that much yet As far as autos are concerned, I don't see anything that is going to bring them back very fast Things may have to get worse in that area, partly as a result of the [tighter] consumer credit and partly because gasoline prices are going to continue to go up We see that there is more conservation than we really thought People are more concerned about [gasoline prices], and I think it's going to have a big effect on their purchases of automobiles So, I don't look for any strength there in the near term  On the other hand, longer term I see some areas of strength that may be stronger than the staff assumptions I disagree with Bob Mayo on the defense side The reason I do is that we're looking at all of the news reports that say this involves sophisticated weapons and there's a very long lead time We are not looking at the operations and maintenance side My understanding is--I have just seen some recent figures--that the Pentagon is estimating that for ammunition alone they need more than $20 billion Now, ammunition is something that can be produced pretty quickly So I think we may see some faster impact on the defense side The other area is the tax side It is an election year I do not favor a tax cut this year; I would, I think, next year But we may get it this year If you look at the staff's chart ""fiscal alternative-tax cut"" and see what a politician would see--that with a cut in payroll taxes he can have the best of both worlds, better growth in GNP and lower inflation, which is what that chart shows--that's very attractive to a politician And I just think that we may get enough weakness in this first half to make a tax cut much more likely this summer So, my figures are a little stronger than the staff's GNP down 1 to 2 percent;  -43-    2/4-5/80  unemployment 7 to 7-1/2 percent; and the CPI in the fourth quarter a little worse than the staff's, at 10 to 11 percent  Well, we may have to consider it; it may be more important than lagged reserve accounting!  Well, some of us will agree with that!  Well, I am not opposed to some degree of confusion Last meeting it seems to me that we had a pretty hard time being very precise about these things At the last meeting, I made mention of Heisenberg's theory of uncertainty, which in physics is a theory that when you try to observe sub-atomic particles the act of observation changes the way they act so you never know exactly where they are I think that some of the same principles apply here and it seems to me that we should not try to be too precise at this point in time These numbers are going to be revised That's clear Some time during the year, for some reason, we're going to have to engage in some revision So, I would agree with Mr Winn that there is some  -56-    2/4-5/80  considerable impact in terms of [reactions to] the numbers we announce and I would come down on alternative III  I think we can get off this subject  I would like to have somebody explain the Balles approach to me I find Steve's comments important here Why shouldn't it be alternative III on M-1A and M-1B and alternative II on M2 and M3? That would seem to me more consistent with what actually happens in the economy Am I looking at it the wrong way?  I understand what he proposed He's just taking a somewhat mechanistic approach But I am thinking of what actually happens in the economy It seems to me that if we're going to go away from alternative III, which is the alternative I continue to prefer, where we should ease is in M2 and M3 rather than the other way around Is that the wrong way to look at it?  I don't understand that there's any particular reason to ease on M-1A and M-1B because I have some real questions about velocity But if Mr Axilrod is right, the figures on M2 and M3 are likely to be more stringent than those on M-1A and M-1B  Well, I got more than he did!  SPEAKER(?) No, you didn't  I got 5 votes  You were the only one Maybe you're the only one who can offer a compromise  I'd feel more comfortable with that than with the Balles approach  Are we not likely, though, to end up with a situation in which we're going to miss on both sides with the Balles approach? M2 and M3 may be strong and M-1A and M-1B could be pretty weak  To show you how weak I am, I'll vote for it As I do so, I am being dragged kicking and screaming into this I would much prefer the other  Straight alternative III got the most votes  It gets us to quarters  Actually, alternative III, you have to remember, is much more lenient than where Governor Coldwell would like to be So that--  Things are coming my way!  I am really much more concerned about M2 and M3 than I am M-1A or M-1B because at these interest rates and these inflation rates I am very unsure of the connection between the two And I think there is going to be a demand shift this year The staff indicates that they can see no indication yet, but--  All right I'd go for that  That's logical, and I like that  I'd vote for it  I think the Chairman is saying that we may have had more votes on that, but those who are the unhappiest would find this last one acceptable Is that your reasoning, Mr Chairman?  I can go either way  Henry thinks it's too high  It will have a result all right It will really knock housing and autos in the head!  You mean the discount rate?  I think alternative B represents some restraint Restraint is continuing and we're beginning to see it in the things that I called attention to I would not like to see us change from alternative B "
1305,1980-03-07, And we still could have very high bank credit growth  I would favor the same thing [I'd move the] upper limit to 18 and leave  the lower limit alone 
1326,1980-03-18," Mr Chairman, after great soul-searching until late last night, and contrary to the exhortations of many people around this table, I have decided to nominate Paul Volcker as Chairman of the FOMC!  Pressure will do it every time!  Mr Chairman, I nominate Anthony Solomon as Vice Chairman of the FOMC  There may be more farmers in Manhattan, though, fairly soon!  May I ask Steve a couple of questions first? Steve, I'm a little confused about the relationship between M2 and the other aggregates [in the Bluebook alternatives] First of all let me ask this question Is the relationship between the new M2 and GNP pretty similar to the relationship between the old M2 and GNP that people often looked at? I'll get that answer first  For the second more important question, let's look at alternative B The implied rates of growth for February to June for M-1A and M-1B were lowered by 1-1/4 points from the growth rates for December to June, but the growth rate for M2 has only been lowered by 3/4 point from 7-3/4 to 7 percent Now, given the new actions, with the likely impact on money market funds, are we to [understand] that you believe there will be strong growth in MMCs and 2-1/2 year certificates? How do you get that strong--  On a cash basis, isn't the budget going to be in some surplus between April 1 and the end of the year?  I understand that, but just on a cash basis--  I doubt that we can get out of this situation without a recession, and I think the unkindest thing we can do is to drag this on It seems to me that the greatest pain can come if we let it go on and on and our financial institutions really do begin to go under Small businesses and others can stand a lot of pain for short periods of time but if this keeps dragging on, they will be in deep trouble I would worry very much about a big bulge in April I am not strongly influenced by alternative B or C; somewhere in that area would suit me fine I would like to see the upper end of the federal funds range raised to 20 percent My feeling is that we ought to be very resistant to a big bulge in April  If you did it that way, that would show real resistance to that April bulge, if it occurs  We're not saying that, are we?  Unless we have a meeting  I like the broader range, too There's some slight--  The [decision] certainly should not rise or fall on this issue  Or we could say ""Close attention will be paid to bank credit"" or something like that  So moved "
1348,1980-04-22," So much for that!  What about people paying off debts?  I would just remind you of how he charmed Gail Cincotta  Well, I certainly would agree that it is important that we continue with a course that strengthens our credibility I believe we have made the right moves in going to a different kind of procedure I think it's important that we hold to that 3-1/2 to 6 percent [Ml] figure for the year But while I want interest rates to go down--I think it's important that they go down--I really am concerned about the speed with which they go down We have to keep in mind that this is where the action is right now The country is looking to the Federal Reserve Like it or not, we are in the eye of the storm And people look at interest rates We've done a lot of things If there's anything to be said for the whole credit control program--and in my view there's damn little--it's the shock effect And it has had a shock effect It was important [Changing] inflationary expectations was crucial Why did the actions we took on October 6th not work better? Because people thought [our actions] were just going to be overridden by other things that were happening So we see interest rates at these awful levels But people are looking at those interest rates; and if they see them come down too rapidly, they're going to say the Fed has given up [on inflation] And we're all they have to look to at this point in time Let's not panic and do something that will tend to negate the strides we've made We're getting there and we're getting the job done A fed funds rate of 15 to 16 percent wouldn't bother me much, but I must say that if it starts getting down around 13 percent or below, under these circumstances, I would get really nervous  As you know, we haven't been that good with our forecasts or projections It does look as if this economy is weakening very rapidly and going off a cliff But I would remind you that it looked pretty weak in October It looked as if we had done the job then Now, [the evidence] is stronger this time, and I feel pretty well convinced; but I don't see the necessity for letting interest rates just absolutely also fall off the cliff I think the implications of that are very important We can do something here which says we will stay within the target ranges, but let's not panic on these interest rates I'd let them come down slowly I hope we can hold these fed funds rates; I think they're important I like our new operating procedure but interest rates, whether we like it or not, are a perception that other people have And I hope we don't get in too much of a hurry and blow this  ""B"" sounds fine; I'm not a bit uncomfortable with funds in the 15 to 17 percent range and I think having a consultation point makes a lot of sense Maybe I just don't know quite enough about how the projections are put together to have great belief in them, but on the track record they have been [unintelligible]  I'd really just like to sneak up on this animal a little in case he springs at me So, rather than borrowing at    4/22/80  $1-1/4 billion plus the emergency or the special lending, I'd like to start at $1-1/2 billion and if things look a little weak, then we can move back down in line with the sort of technique we're talking about here It seems to me that we have time and, as you say, this last week may have been quite an aberration We may get a big change in these numbers If we started at $1-1/2 billion and the aggregates continued to come in weak, it would be easy enough to move borrowing down to $1-1/4 billion  I'm not uncomfortable with consultation at 15 percent I wouldn't mind seeing it get down in that range, but it would make me feel--to use Larry Roos' term--a bit antsy below 15 percent  That's pretty nice! My gut reaction is for now just to go ahead and get in their plans and talk to them I'm not ready yet to give up too quickly on the first go-around I'm perfectly willing to take the chance of looking a little foolish; I think we're going to look foolish no matter what we do I don't think that's a situation we can get out of with credit controls, but I'd hate to give up too quickly on this thing My feeling is to have a talk with them and then next month, if it looks as if things are easing off, then we can begin to ease off We may eventually have to face the question of whether we want individual banks to cut back below 9 percent if it looks as if the total for the country is going to be at 6 percent "
1368,1980-04-29," Well, like President Winn, I'm a little concerned about getting whipsawed and I'd like to see us hold the funds rate at 14 percent this week and talk again next week I love seeing these interest rates come down; I just have some concern about the speed, which has been extraordinarily rapid "
1387,1980-05-06," Well, given what appears to be extreme weakness in the economy, I would favor 10 percent I had been afraid that perhaps we could get some surge in either the economy or the money supply but the chances of that at this point seem slim or none So, I would agree with Frank Morris that we ought to go down to 10 percent  I would hate to see that  Prospects? It's here  I have one other comment I would hope that everybody out there is doing some hard thinking about how and how quickly we can get rid of these credit controls  Okay Thank you very much  END OF MEETING   "
1411,1980-05-20," So moved  Do we have any other arrangements on our swap lines with a takeout arrangement similar to what you are suggesting?  Individual bankruptcies are already up very substantially, but there is a real question as to whether that's related to the new bankruptcy law--how much effect one can assign to that  May I ask a question of Steve? Steve, what you have done is [to present] two alternatives here, both of which are geared to reaching the midpoint of the range Now, Governor Partee feels that structurally it is better to do it by September But doesn't it leave us a lot of flexibility if we attempt at this point to target the midpoint of the range by December? It gives us the flexibility, if we have a substantial shortfall, to look at the lower end of the range as an alternative if money growth is not very rapid over that period    5/20/80  And maybe L is even; as Steve points out, those T-bills may be pretty high  May I comment on that from an anecdotal point of view on the basis of talking to bankers and others all over the country who are involved in credit extensions? I think Nancy [Teeters] would corroborate what I say Well, I don't know that for sure but I think so It's clear that [the credit restraint program] was a real shock to the consumer If the credit controls are removed, the people I talk to do not believe there will be a resurgence of the same attitudes the consumer had before They believe this effect is not reversible So I think it's important to get them off because they are having a serious effect on the economy at this point I just  -19-    5/20/80  worry about how we are going to get them off if we're going to have an easy money policy, too It could be pretty difficult to do both at the same time, and I would hope that we would keep that in mind as we are talking here  I am amazed, and I must admit disturbed, at the fact that I haven't heard the word inflation mentioned around this  -23-    5/20/80  table this morning My word, it was only two months ago that we were wild about the subject and terribly concerned about it I admit that we're in an unusual period Things have moved exceptionally fast But I don't think we can seriously say that we're out of the woods on inflation And it seems to me that at least we ought to continue to think about it a little We do have evidence that things are getting somewhat better and are likely to get better in the future, but that certainly is not in the bag And the perception out there is absolutely crucial There aren't very many people around the country who understand our change from a federal funds operating target to a reserves operating target But a lot of people understand that what the Fed does is crucial in the fight against inflation And there are people who still do worry about inflation If we move too rapidly, that could have some very serious attitudinal effects [on the] psychology of inflationary expectations and could subvert [any progress we've made in that area]  The other side is that I think the economy is weakening very rapidly and will turn down very sharply, and I want interest rates to come down But if they come down too fast, the result can be counterproductive If we want mortgage rates to stop coming down [so rapidly] we have to let them back up a little There is volatility We gave up some things when we went to this reserves operating target and one of those things was some stability in interest rates The volatility in interest rates does have an impact on people They see interest rates jumping up and down and they say ""What is happening in the country?"" Those interest rate risks get greater and lenders want to protect themselves against them so they don't bring interest rates down as rapidly We need to think about the rapidity with which we're [lowering the funds rate] I don't know if we [should] take these lower targets of alternative A; I do believe we need lower funds rates targets than we have in that alternative But if we [implement them], are we really going to [reduce] the interest rates that have an impact on people any more rapidly than we would if we proceeded a little more slowly or had a little steadier approach? I think [a slower steadier approach] would avoid a lot of risks So, I'd certainly like to argue for alternative A, but I do admit that the funds rate target would have to be widened some  Amazingly enough, I find myself somewhere in between Governor Partee and Governor Wallich  SPEAKER(?) You could still be wrong!  I really am in the morass They're on the mountain tops and I'm down in the swamp What is the big difference among us if we're going to consult at 9-1/2 or 9 percent? I don't understand what the big deal is on whether we set the lower constraint at 9-1/2 or 9 or 8 percent If we're going to consult each time, why can't we change it to 9 or 8-1/2 percent?  If you use that argument, you're not accepting the consultation part If you accept the consultation part, I don't know why it makes such a difference  Would you refer to this as the twilight zone?  He'll spend all his time on the phone!  With consultation at 9-1/2  I could go that far  I think that's good; I would go with that "
1432,1980-06-05," No, and I don't have anything special to say I think we're talking about contingencies and we'll move down through 9-1/2 percent if we have to If things are very weak and we begin to bump against the 8-1/2 percent, we'll look at it on a weekly basis But we will not push it down; we'll just respond and do what we have to do "
1461,1980-07-09," Either that or the Governors can't have [a rug]; it's one of the two  So moved  That's the same problem I have in the Board meetings!  How much of the Carter notes come due a year from September?  There is some indication that SAMA is now making direct investments in this country in bits and pieces of $50 to $100 million We first heard about it from the Texas bankers It began 5 to 6 months ago and seems to be continuing  So moved  It's supposed to be the other way around Steve gave an actual yesterday, if that still stands The figures are transposed, aren't they, Steve?  Steve, yesterday you gave figures which indicated that the target had been raised over the period by some $170 million  Now that we have had that little ego trip--!  When did you talk to Arthur Burns?  Well, I talked to him the day before yesterday, and he told me that the resolution as originally introduced had been much more specific and that he had Proxmire make it much more general and so forth So it was a bigger problem when--  What effect do you get from the fact that energy prices in manufacturing never made very much difference? They were so low in terms of the costs Now the situation is quite different; a lot of manufacturing firms are thinking in terms of  -15-    7/9/80  capital expenditures of the kind that lower their energy costs What does that do? Is there any way to calibrate that sort of thing?  I would have some arguments against doing that in addition to the problem that it creates for '81 Number one, the credibility issue of having stated targets and leaving them alone at this point is worth thinking about The other is that if we start fooling around with these ranges and try to get them a bit tighter or [the expected outcome] a little more in the middle of the range, it's likely to get us into trouble We have to fight Proxmire all the time anyway because he is always trying to get us to narrow the ranges; and at some point that is going to give us problems I think we should try to hold out for somewhat broader ranges  Except that it is in the wrong direction  Well, my point of view is strongly driven by something that we haven't talked about yet, and that is that we are still kind of on a honeymoon and that the tough times are ahead The technique that we are using implies that at some point in time, when the economy begins to strengthen, unemployment will still be high and probably rising and interest rates will begin to go up And that is  -41-    7/9/80  when the moment of truth will arise That is the period that Governor Wallich is afraid of in that he thinks it will put us in the cowardly camp I don't believe that's correct But it is important that we follow a strategy that gives us the best opportunity to stick to our guns in spite of what may be at that point considerably more pressure than we are presently feeling Therefore, my approach would be to hold to the present targets and to ease toward them reasonably slowly, which would mean aiming to reach them in December I would not like to see us [promote rapid growth] to reach them in September, which would mean that the fourth quarter would be the period in which we will start to see interest rates rising rapidly It would put us in that box quickly  For 1981 I believe the 4-1/2 percent figure is sufficiently restrictive for us to be using in our thinking at this time However, it's very important that we give ourselves as much leeway as we can I would like to suggest that for 1981 we comment along the lines that the aggregates will be generally at or below the present targets We are all very uncertain about the state of the economy We all recognize how difficult forecasting is currently and it would not help us much at this point to be specific I would like to see us have the opportunity to have a little more running room at the end of the year So far as the bank credit figures are concerned, I don't think they are very critical The monetary aggregates are much more important I certainly would not be opposed to Governor Teeters's approach that we say [bank credit] is running below the target range but that's because of a shift in the type of debt [being used] or something like that  So far as wage and price guidelines are concerned, I don't think they make much difference at this point There is a possibility that somewhere down the road they may make some difference There is something to be said about rational expectations in terms of getting inflation down over time and, although we can't have a social contract like they have in other countries, I believe that some wage-price guidelines together with a variety of other things can make a difference As far as the tax cut is concerned, I favor one; I favor a tax cut that will help on inflation and help in terms of savings and productivity Therefore, I would agree that we ought to do something about depreciation or investment tax credits or something in that area I agree the timing would be much better if it could be put off until next year If it can't, let's have it as late as possible  Either that Nancy, or leave the top where it is and drop the bottom a little and that will make it look as if we're cutting it down some  I think the markets would like that even less than if we were more general That may get us in trouble  -51-    7/9/80  Before we got into that discussion, what you said just prior to that sounded pretty good to me It was somewhat in accordance with your talents It was even more waffling than what Steve had to say!  I would like to waffle a bit more than what Steve said, and I thought you had done that very effectively  Yes  We're suggesting that the staff, rather than have lunch, eat their work!  I don't mind that much, but I don't want [growth] to get too high in September That makes me nervous  At some point it would be very nice if we could get the discount rate down a little more I think we need to be so careful that--  Well, if we show a willingness to tolerate an 8 percent funds rate before we do anything on the discount rate, it clearly limits our ability to move on the discount rate So I would think that we would want to keep the 8-1/2 percent [lower limit] at this point  Well, it would be nice to move a full point but we just don't know whether we can or not at this point We're arguing in a vacuum here because we don't really know  One of them is about $400 billion and the other one is almost a trillion dollars  -68-    7/9/80  And then we'd need at least $40 billion to support the market  That's a Solomonic tactic This is the Arabian [Solomon] of the Arabian Nights  Why don't we see how close we can come to a consensus? If we can get a strong enough consensus, maybe we'll take a vote; if not, we--  Can't we even say that the Committee is committed to bringing the money supply growth down to non-inflationary levels over time and that for 1981 we will have the monetary aggregates generally at or somewhat below the figures for 1980 depending upon conditions in the economy?  Say that again  On that note, I move we adjourn  While we're on the subject of the books, what about the Redbook?  And that is an entirely reasonable conclusion "
1506,1980-08-12," So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  That was exactly what happened to us this last time We wanted to get the discount rate down but we were very nervous about the foreign exchange problem [Unintelligible] policy that had to come to an end Then we changed the path Given the change in the path, it became almost essential that we just go ahead and bite the bullet and lower the discount rate, which we did It just so happened that we got lucky because at the same time the fed funds rate was strengthening But the real reason was to attempt to lower that gap because, given the change in the path, we needed to do it  One other factor is the effect of actions by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board Monthly payments are the crucial [factor for most homebuyers] If the FHLBB proposes that thrifts drop downpayments from 20 to 10 percent and that [mortgage terms] go from 30 to 40 years, that will considerably lower [the initial outlay and  -14-    8/12/80  then] the monthly payments What effect will that have on the whole picture? That's another factor that probably will be important  Jim, I thought I saw some figures the other day that [the ratio] had peaked at 18 or so percent and has dropped now to less than 15 percent in this very short period of time  Well, as everyone around this table knows, I believe that inflation is the major problem and that hasn't changed at all, so I think we have a long hard pull ahead of us I believe, though, that alternative B would be a mistake at this time because it seems to me, short term, that we are already getting some restraint Interest rates have already backed up some, and I think it is not likely that mortgage rates will come down from where they are They might rise a little One of the things we didn't talk about is the fact that mortgage rates are much more sensitive to bond rates because of the passthroughs We have this enormous backlog of securities that are sitting there, and it's just hard for me to see that mortgage rates are going to come down any; they might even back up a little We have already seen some of that in California, where they are  -30-    8/12/80  particularly sensitive to this kind of thing So it seems to me that the path we are presently on is already giving us some restraint I get the feeling that we are doing reasonably well at this point and I don't see much sense in trying to shut down further In addition, I have a feeling that longer term we may need some flexibility next year I don't know what shape recession we're going to have--whether it will be a square root or an L or a W or whatever But one characteristic I think it will have--and I think properly so--is that it will be a very slow recovery I don't see how we can get out of the mess we are in without that slow recovery, because I don't see how we are going to be able to get unit labor costs down without some pain And we are not getting very much pain in this economy at this time; corporations still are looking to increase prices, as President Winn said And until there is some real restraint on them in terms of their corporate profit margins--and I think there will be next year--I doubt that they are going to start getting really serious about trying to hold wage rates down So it seems to me that we are looking at a very slow period of recovery for next year I have the feeling that I would like to go into next year [with money growth] near the middle of the range, and not biased toward the bottom, to give us the kind of flexibility we may need So my feeling is that alternative A is much superior [to alternative B], both for the short run and the long run  I think the Congressional comment was that he'd make a very good prisoner of war because he'd tell the enemy--  I think 8 to 14 percent looks better; that leaves the top of the range at the same place  I think that would be important  It's not a big difference, is it?  Take them up one quarter point toward ""A"" and that will take care of everybody!  The staff takes an awful beating! "
1521,1980-08-22, Do you want to tell [the Presidents] what we did with the discount rate this morning?  Let's call Milt!  Everybody took vacations in July! 
1543,1980-09-16," I would call to your attention that Mr Axilrod and Mr Lindsey recently wrote a paper for the American Economic Association which addressed some of these questions You might find it interesting reading I suspect that you will not agree with it very much, President Roos, because the indication is that we need to continue to exercise some judgment and that we need to continue to look at interest rates to some degree I also felt that it argued very strongly for keeping fairly wide target ranges, which I think is consistent with that as well But there has been some thinking and some writing on that subject, and you might find that article interesting  My view is very simplistic I have been on this Board a little over a year now and my attitude has changed fairly considerably I've come to believe that inflation is intractable, dangerous, and overwhelms all other problems that we have I think we are going to have a very slow recovery; I think we need a slow recovery I don't see how prices and wages are going to come down unless there is pressure on them over a considerable period of time I hope whatever Administration we have understands the luxury of having the first year of its Administration be one which follows a recession, which hasn't happened in a long time in the past I hope they understand that they can do something next year that they may not have the opportunity to do any other time My attitude on a tax cut is that it ought to be geared with inflation in mind We should ignore questions of equity; we should ignore questions of stimulus Our policy should be geared entirely to attempting to do something about inflation I like the idea of doing something about depreciation I like the idea of trying to offset somehow the social security [tax] increase I think we have to have some consideration of a tax-based incomes policy I don't know how that would work I haven't been able to figure out anything that is practical Our experience with credit controls leads me to believe that it's hard as the devil to have that kind of situation, so I'm not very sanguine about [devising] one that can work But I believe some kind of an incomes policy is necessary because I think every single thing we do has to be geared to that one fact that inflation is the most serious problem we face It's bigger than everything else put together and we've got to begin to get it down over time  I'm delighted to hear that there's so much commitment to our targets and that we're going to have the strength to make sure we get growth within them I'm a little surprised to hear so many people feel that the fourth quarter is going to be so strong I would remind you that interest rates have already gotten to the point where they are having some impact on economic activity Mr Kichline, for instance, has housing starts for August at 14 million but then dropping to 12 million in September And that's just with mortgage rates where they are right now I don't know how sensitive automobiles are going to be to interest rates, but it seems to me that we don't have very much chance of a big strong recovery in the fourth quarter, yet that is what I hear influencing the [policy preferences] around the table I'm afraid that alternative B or something even more conservative than that risks putting us in a more difficult  -39-    9/16/80  position than a path that is a bit more expansive I don't want to go to alternative A; that may put us in some danger of going out of the range on the upper end But, you know, New York may be right one of these days I'm afraid that if we go to ""B"" or something even more conservative than that, we may get ourselves in the difficult position of having to be too expansive in the fourth quarter And we will get this stop-start pattern again With these forecasts being all over the lot, I think we're much better off somewhere between ""A"" and ""B,"" which gives us much more flexibility And I really think it is crucial that we retain as much flexibility as we can So that makes more sense to me than anything else That will give us an opportunity to look at September and will give us the kind of flexibility we need to get where we want to go through the end of the year  But they are going to be distorted by Labor Day, I think  You want raised hands on that issue?  I think you're probably right It looks better without the quarters And those numbers are a bit more conservative, which seemed to be where people wanted to move to a little  I hope we don't lose anybody  Mr Roos, I don't want to engage in an argument, but I think we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do on October 6th If you recall, we announced that the former policy had been that we looked at the aggregates and at interest rates and we put more emphasis on interest rates; but now the policy was going to be that we would look at the aggregates and at interest rates but we would put more emphasis on the aggregates At no time did this Committee ever say that interest rates would be ignored  You'll pardon me if I respectfully disagree  It's a bit more toward ""B""  Well, we might have to talk about ""Peter who?""!  END OF MEETING     "
1566,1980-10-21," But we're coming up pretty close to the limit right now We do we have left--a hundred and what?  The lags are shorter than they used to be  If one carries that to the extreme, the amplitudes of the swings get higher  We have another problem The communications problem is terrible There are enormous numbers of people out there who believe that the money supply is controlled by some magic wand And there are an awful lot of people who say Look, if you guys would just hold down the money supply, then interest rates wouldn't go so high I just sort of look at them and my eyeballs twirl a bit, because it's very difficult to figure out how they intend for us to do that So, we really have a serious communications problem we are going to have to address  Steve, we may have made an error at midyear in not changing the M-1B target ranges Do you think it makes any sense at this time to consider the possibility of making a downward change in the target range for M-1A and an upward change for M-1B for this year? Or are we already too far through the year so that we are unlikely to get any positive effects from that kind of action and might get considerable negative effects?  -22-    10/21/80  I had heard that  Well, I had hoped that the discussion was going to help me some, but so far it hasn't! We are in a terrible dilemma  -38-    10/21/80  and I would like to vote for ""none of the above,"" but I don't have any good alternatives to offer you  You know that silence is not my nature!  We have credibility problems on one side and on the other side we have interest rates that I think are beginning to bite I'm not sure how much we can do about monetary growth over the next couple of months As the Chairman says, [the outcome for this year] is probably already in the cake And although I think the [economy's] momentum is rather strong and this fourth quarter might be a little better, [the economy] is very fragile; and if we run interest rates up too much, I see a real possibility that we will slip into another downturn I don't think that would be very helpful nor is it the kind of policy we want to carry out It seems to me that stability is pretty important but I hate to be slavishly chained to any kind of special numbers So I really am having a very difficult time I would like to talk in such a way as to keep our credibility, which leads me to ""A"" And I'd like to act in such a way that we don't let interest rates go up too high, which is equally problematical So, we have a very difficult decision to make today and I don't have a very good answer at this point  I don't want to do that  I hope you will also hammer in or fight against any move to narrow the target ranges Heaven knows that we ought to have learned that we really don't know that much about the [relationships among the aggregates] at this time  We'll go to L!  Let's vote  It's the only way we can do it  Well, you have enough [votes] Roger Guffey voted yes He had a pencil up, but he did have [his hand] up  No, I think under the circumstances you're probably lucky to get 8 votes for anything It's all smelly; it's all tough It's just a question of what one is willing to live with I think that's absolutely right  Governor Wallich, I would tell you that if you talk to people out in the business world, there are already some real screams of pain We are already flagellating them, but I think you want to crucify them  Oh no, no  No, I agree that there's no painless solution But there's already some pain out there "
1592,1980-11-18," Second  So moved  That is what it does; it pushes it up not down  Mr Chairman, could we get a staff analysis of our own reserves and those of other countries and some analysis of this particular question? Then maybe we could discuss it at the next meeting  So moved  Legal questions aside, we are already getting enormous criticism that we are not doing a very good job of explaining what we are doing right now And if we attempted to do that, I think we would get inundated with criticism And I suspect certain members of the Congress would rise in wrath  Well, I would hope that if you do a paper of that kind there would be an added dimension to it And that is that given the environment we are living in today, communication has become an integral part of monetary policy to a degree that it never has been before What people are thinking about in regard to what is going on and our credibility are of considerable importance to the policy itself So I would say to you that there may be an added dimension in terms of communications that wasn't an issue 2 or 3 years ago, which should be addressed in such a paper  Jim, do you have the preliminary survey on building permits for last month?  I was with him right up to the very last  Furthermore, the very preliminary figures would indicate another increase for next week, so--  I can be very brief because I agree with Governor Wallich's and Governor Gramley's arguments and I come out pretty much where Governor Partee is I think the economy is going to ease off considerably; I think inflation is extremely intractable; and I think volatility in interest rates is going to give us a real problem, so I would not like to see rates go up very much because I don't want to see them come down very much in the first quarter We are going to have a great deal of trouble with this yo-yo effect I like the technique we are using because it has a tendency to get interest rates to go more rapidly where they appear to need to go in an inflationary environment But we must use judgment rather than adhere slavishly to some of these targets or we are going to get ourselves in deep trouble I think we ought to look at the aggregates the way Governor Wallich has [suggested] we look at them--through the first quarter So to me something between ""A"" and ""B"" makes sense for aggregates targets, but that's not the crucial question; at this point borrowings and the funds rate are I would put borrowings at about $16 billion and the fed funds range at 13 to 17 percent  I'd rather consult if the funds rate got over 17 percent  That's the problem  I don't know Chuck, what do you want to do?  Over the long run it will That's a long time, Mr Roos  Well, the reserve path is drawn on borrowing--  That's better than you usually get on the first try [Now] it's eight or nine  I think you did very well You lost Henry and Nancy And that's about as good as you can--  You better vote before you lose somebody  What is even more disturbing is that I'm convinced that the vast majority of people in this country think control of the money supply has no connection to interest rates That is really disturbing They say You know, interest rates wouldn't be so high if you people would just control the money supply That puts us politically in a very difficult position  That's right That's what they're talking about "
1613,1980-11-26, I don't think we have any choice on the 18 percent What I find disturbing is the increasing evidence that people in this country seem to be learning to live with higher interest rates all the time And that may become a greater problem as time goes on 
1673,1980-12-18," So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Our course is clear, you know  Which is the horse and which is the rabbit? That's what we need from you!  Are you sure?  Well, I'm going to argue that short term we ought to look pretty carefully at interest rates and long term we ought to get maximum flexibility We have a very tough situation here, a real dilemma We have put the economy through all this agony and we don't want to [waste] that if possible On the other hand, as a friend of mine said You were sending a message to the country prior to November 4th, but since then there hasn't been anybody there to receive it So we do have a little problem about what we're doing at this point in time It seems to me that the policy of the new Administration is really critical the psychology they generate, what  -50-    12/18-19/80  they can do about credit demands to allow the private sector to re- liquify, what long-run program they can come up with that looks credible on balancing the budget and getting the economy going Obviously, monetary policy has to do its part But one good thing about all this is that we are very effectively proving that monetary policy can't do it all And maybe that is going to have the effect of getting us a little more help  But if monetary policy is going to do its part, it seems to me that we've talked so much about reducing the growth of the aggregates to non-inflationary levels over time that we somehow have to stick to that approach Everybody looks at that and thinks about it and I believe we have to continue on that path I, too, would ignore base drift If we don't start from where we are, we will really have problems I see no way to make it work  So far as what we target on, internally maybe we can develop some better single target but externally I would argue for putting a lot of targets out there for the simple reason that I haven't heard anybody make a very convincing argument that there's any single aggregate that is going to work very well And it seems pretty clear to me that we really don't know how they're going to work So I'd put out an M-1A and an M-1B, adjusted for the NOWs because I don't see how we can [operate] if we don't I don't know what to do with M2 at this point, but surely we can find some way to massage that so it doesn't look too bad and is consistent I guess what I'm really arguing for the long term is flexibility We don't know what the Administration is going to do We don't know what the next month or two is going to bring We can't have very much confidence in any one of these aggregates, as I see it So it seems to me that we ought to be thinking about a family [of targets] and the point of view--the way that the public looks at this situation and the kind of signal we are going to send short term It's just amazing to me that banks seem to be willing to pay almost anything for money if they think they can sell [the funds] for more money There are no institutional constraints at all and what we are doing is trying to affect the credit demands of individuals and businesses out there It just doesn't seem to me that putting interest rates any higher at this point is going to accomplish very much So I would argue that we ought to look at the level of interest rates at this time and we ought to put more emphasis perhaps on targeting the funds rate short term than we might ordinarily do I am not willing to give up the procedure that we are using I think it does make some sense to argue for heavy emphasis on monetary aggregates over time But there are times when interest rates become very important and ought to receive more emphasis, and I think now is one of those times  That brought it home to him!  He had no trouble with that one!  What would you want the Manager to do? You want him to get that funds rate down to 18 percent now?  Now?  My heavens, I think the effects of that would be terribly dangerous and disruptive  We're going to publish a drop [in the money supply this week] and next week we'll publish what looks like an equally big increase If we get that rate down to 18 percent now and publish that increase next week, God only knows what is going to--  You're celebrating early, Larry!  Remains within a range of--  You want hands raised on 16 percent?  I can accept 15 but I prefer 16 because I'd like to see us talk about it if the rate gets down to 16 percent  We have never had a problem on the up side I would see no particular problem on the down side but it would be worth talking about There are a lot of things going on And 16 percent seems to me [a big move]; we have talked about the volatility problem I think we ought to do some talking at 16 percent  That's our lower end now  -86-    12/18-19/80  Taken over a period of time  SPEAKER(?) That's okay  Let's stay as loose as we can here  I'm for a period of time  Are we going to talk when it gets to 16 percent?  If Henry and Nancy dissent, you know you're in the right area! "
1702,1981-02-02,"  We'll watch carefully  It may come as a  surprise      I had a couple of questions, Steve First, I noticed in the Bank of Canada's report to the United Kingdom that they indicated that they didn't believe fluctuations in the money supply [for periods] of less than six months made very much difference Is that a judgmental [assessment] on their part or did they do some studies? Or would it really make any difference to us?  Well, that leads into my second question, which is essentially on the question of lag time How good a handle can we get on that question, and does it make any difference at all or could it make any difference? If you look at the question of money supply on one hand and interest rates on the other, do you get a different feel for a lag time? That, of course, goes to my final question about whether interest rates have induced wider cyclical changes If you make different assumptions about lag time, do you come to different conclusions on that question?  Does the evidence indicate that the higher interest rates go the shorter the lag time? Do you have any empirical data on that? Or do you get about the same kind of problem That the credit controls have put you in such a situation that you can't come to any conclusion?  Final question When you were looking at the discount rate, did you look at the possibility of varying the discount rate with some relation to the capital ratios of the borrowing institutions?  -13-    2/2-3/81  The reason I asked is that it is clear that interest rate spreads seem to have more effect at this point than interest rate levels And, obviously, the larger banks tend to be doing the biggest borrowing And they're the ones that are more concerned with interest rate spreads because they can go out and buy their money more easily If [borrowing] had some connection with capital ratios, wouldn't it have some interesting effects on [the amount of] borrowing? Is it worth thinking about?  Isn't it true that there are certain countercyclical elements in the broader aggregates because of their composition? That is, if the economy begins to slow down, isn't there a tendency for people to put more money into some of the assets that are in the broader aggregates rather than in the narrow aggregates? Is there not a countercyclical movement in the broader aggregates? So, would it not basically be true that what Governor Rice has said is accurate because of the composition of the broader aggregates?  Yes, I think John Paulus just did something on that [suggesting] that the narrower aggregates were better to look at than the broader ones because of this countercyclical effect of the broader aggregates  My goodness! Better than under previous research directors?  Continuing on this question just a bit more In the Bluebook I noticed that you assumed that if short-term rates were at current levels a year from now, the mortgage rate would be higher Why is that? That was the one thing in that family of interest rates that seemed rather interesting to me All the other rates you assumed would be at about the same level but the mortgage rate was higher  I see You just repressed demand during the period and it's going to get stronger and stronger Okay  All animals are equal, but pigs are more equal than others!  Could it not go either way? Could it not be destabilizing as well as stabilizing?  Suppose it all went in one direction in one week Does it not have the same kind of effects we might--  I agree It's certainly worth study  I suggested [basing] it on a capital ratio  We'd have to differentiate between emergency and adjustment borrowing  You have heard about fungibility, haven't you?  We did the same thing with bank credit, too, early last year That was certainly part of the thinking  I think it's a particularly useful function at times of extremes It seems to me that most of the time the band  -53-    2/2-3/81  doesn't make much difference We don't pay too much attention to it It's easily changed But there are times when it ought to bring forth some very serious discussion Last spring it did bring forth some serious discussion on whether we should allow [the rate] to go lower We probably ought to have had those discussions earlier And in the last month or two it has been of some importance to think about the level of interest rates It seems to me that most of the time it makes more sense to have the emphasis on the money supply, but there are times when the interest rates get to be well worth considering because they have a tendency to go to these extremes  My position is that we ought to stay away from a mechanical approach That's what gives us the most trouble If we don't retain some elements of judgment in what we do, I think we're in trouble  I'd just hate to get hung up on any of these mechanistic kinds of solutions I don't think any of them work  I don't understand  There are some of us who do feel that way, Tony  I'm not sure I understood You were saying we get less interest rate variability with contemporaneous reserves?  And there are some who believe that those swings would be rather extreme  Very strongly or just strongly?  Yes, I'm with Tony If he's going to raise his hand--  Mr Chairman, I want to argue for not doing everything at once It seems to me that it makes a lot of sense to move more rapidly on nonborrowed reserves I thought I heard practically everybody say they wanted to do that  Well, I said practically everybody I could have said everybody who counted, but I was trying to be nice!  If we throw all these other changes in there all at one time, I'm not sure that we're going to know what the heck is doing what  I would remind you of the recent interview that Newsweek had with Bill Martin in which he ended up saying that he doesn't know much about monetary policy but he knows a lot more about it than most other people and he spends most of his time trying to combat simplistic solutions And it seems to me that there are an awful lot of simplistic solutions being offered I'm not convinced that those who are criticizing what we are doing know more about it than we do around this table  -72-    2/2-3/81  Yes, but I'm not sure you can make that comparison, because they had--what do they call it--the corset?  Well, they had some other things and I just don't know--  SPEAKER(?) Well, they haven't been [unintelligible] overshooting  When was this?  Well, I don't know Was Frank arguing that? I'm not sure I understood Were you arguing that we ought to target on M2 and--  --M2 or M3 and that we ought to replace the single variable of M-1B that we're targeting on with another single variable? And are you going to the extent of saying that we just publish that one? If so, I can agree with you partly I think the Kaufman idea that we need to look at much broader [aggregates] and that we need to look at credit makes some sense But there are all kinds of problems in that It seems to me that we can't do very much better than to target on the M-1B that we're using now and look at the other aggregates, including bank credit, as judgmental factors  And in fact we'd get [requests]  We have given [Congress] a Board forecast in the past  Not this year  SPEAKER(?) It was different this year  What were those permits figures, Jerry?  We understood rational expectations in the--  I noticed that Dr Burns in his testimony to the Budget Committee added in several other things; he added in the guaranteed borrowing of those agencies that are federally sponsored Could you have somebody give us a breakdown on that as to what goes into those categories and what your estimates are? I noticed his estimate was around $141 billion  No, no I didn't mean right now  Humility has set in  Well, the critical thing here is that it is absolutely clear that monetary policy [alone] just can't do this job If we don't hold on to the monetary aggregates, inflation gets worse; if we do hold on to them, all we do is put all the pressure on certain sectors of the economy And [the result is] a very difficult economic situation unless the government gets out of the way and lets credit demands come down some These people who are going around saying that monetary policy can do the entire job of getting inflation down are just terribly destructive I don't know how in the world we can get that point over; monetary policy [alone] just won't do it  I don't understand that  I would just note that I happen to get Burt Cox's forecast for Merrill Lynch economics I am very much afraid that the Secretary of the Treasury may be looking at that one because it's much more optimistic than yours And I think therein lies part of the problem  That's the problem with this stuff floating around It doesn't bear much relation to reality  I think it is clear  Do you think that's easier, Frank? If we put our targets [that way], when the money supply figures come out they are going to be different from our targets The average person in the public doesn't understand all of these things And anybody who does try to look at the money supply figures--though I guess that's not the average public to start with--will see that we publish target ranges and then the numbers that come out are outside of these ranges Isn't it better--  Well, abstracting from the Partee integral and the Wallich differential and given my lack of confidence in the forecast and estimates of velocity and inflation, I have a very unscientific proposal I think we ought to lower the M-1A and M-1B ranges by 1/2 percentage point from the ranges of last year and keep M2 and M3 where they were last year It seems to me that we knew in the middle of last year that the relationships between the M1s and M2 and M3 were not right We probably should have changed those ranges in July, and I don't think we're going to catch a lot of flak by not changing them now I do think that most people still look at M1, particularly M-1B now, so I feel it's important to lower that by 1/2 percentage point But it seems to me that, given the uncertainties, that's about the best we can do  Bank credit?  Oh, you mean how to present it?  Well, I agree with Nancy that it's easier to talk in terms of the actual money supply data than to try to [adjust] the money supply figures as they're coming out week-by-week [in order to] abstract from [the shifts] every week I think it's easier to try to explain it one time rather than every week, and that's what we'd have to do So, it seems to me better to go ahead and make the changes in the target ranges and try to explain it and do it one time To have to go through that process each week when the figures come out would be much more confusing than to try to tinker with the targets Either way is lousy, but the one is lousier than the other  Well, sometimes Chairmen are expendable  I'm not sure I understand What would you do with M2 and M3?  All the way down the line?  How we are going to get a consensus out of this, I don't have the faintest idea  You better provide something to sniff now!  Everybody who understands that raise their hand!  I would like to be persuasive on staying where we were last year It seems to me, given all of the uncertainties, that we might as well get hung for a sheep as a goat here This 1/2 percentage point doesn't seem to me to make that much difference, and if we go up from last year, I think we're going to get a lot of criticism We will say ""Well, we're going to go down 1/2 point on M-1A and M-1B"" And they are going to say ""Aha! But you're going up on M2 and M3"" I just don't think it's that crucial; we are looking at a whole family [of aggregates], which I think is important If we get outside the range on M2 and M3, that does exert some additional discipline Most people continue to [focus] on M-1B, and I think that is the more crucial number; I don't think we help ourselves very much by going to, say, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2 rather than 6 to 9 percent We would lose a lot in the presentation I do think that the perceptions are crucial at this particular point in time, just as I think the perceptions of budget-cutting are crucial in the fiscal area So, I would make an argument for 6 to 9 percent on M2 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M3, understanding that we're not only going to be at the upper end but that the relationships may be such that it's very difficult to stay below that upper end I still think we're better off that way  And I'm sympathetic with your view, too  Then it gets us in the awful box of indicating that the FOMC agrees with that kind of number We have some hard data on it now A recent survey that was taken indicated that 26 percent of the people said they would save  Even that is a low number  Or equally unlikely  It depends on what kind of budget cuts we get If the market looks at the budget cuts favorably, we could get a situation in which corporations would be able to come to the capital markets to a greater degree And, boy, they would do it! They're really sitting at the ready there  We assume that it's going into savings  Let's save them all up and use them later  I don't think we can do that  I thought you just mentioned that S&Ls are going to be selling CDs up to $100,000  Yes, I think that's right  Mr Chairman, I don't think we will accomplish anything by tinkering with M3, by differing that relationship 1/2 percentage point  I don't think it holds together intellectually at all If we fight the battle on the 6 to 9 percent, the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 that means [unintelligible] I don't know why that should please anybody particularly  I don't read it that way  -144-    2/2-3/81  I disagree with Mr Corrigan's argument My heavens, the likelihood is that the great need in the economy will be to reliquify And any opportunity [corporations] get to go to the credit markets and get out of the banks, they're going to try to take, even at interest rates that are somewhat higher than they have been historically So, I would feel comfortable about that bank credit number, Jerry  I want you to know that if the Mafia comes after me, I want you on my side!  I thought Ezra Solomon had the best comment I heard about that when he was talking about Switzerland He said the great advantage the Swiss have is that when they run their economy into a brick wall they have a foreign employee in the front seat  Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority  With that kind of entrance, you may get by with none at all!  What I don't understand is why you read that to those of us who are here You should have read it to the ones who weren't here Punish them!  Insofar as your head does!  [Unintelligible] Now we're going to get ""D!""  Yes, I said what I wanted  You were right about don't ask!  -162-    2/2-3/81  It does affect the borrowings, though How are you going to decide on what the borrowings are?  Nonborrowed reserves are coming down fairly rapidly  We'll just blame it on the guy who ran the credit controls!  Larry, I think the answer to your question is that we're not going to have credit controls in 1981  You've put a totally new light on our procedures!  I don't know  That's better  SPEAKER(?) It was hard  It was asymmetric in that-- "

1748,1981-03-31," I thought we had more Swiss francs than that  Where did I get the idea that we had more than that because we have a Carter bond?  Oh, I see; we've already sent it over We bought it for them The total position we have in Swiss francs is a little over $1 billion, is that right?  Okay  It's also important to clarify that there was nothing mechanical here Just because the funds rate dropped below 15  -18-    3/31/81  percent didn't mean that automatically the Desk was going to drain reserves They look at the projections, both the Board and New York projections, and they look at the funds rate as an indication of what the conditions are in the market And if the rate falls below 15 percent, then the market is saying that things are easier than the projections would seem to suggest So, it's important that maybe there was the sense that 15 percent was regarded as an absolute floor by the Desk and the minute it went below that, then an automatic response would be triggered That is not the case That's not the way the fed funds rate is being used at this point in time It is a consultation point; it is not a mechanical thing on which we target  Mr Balles talked about a range of possible outcomes It's rather important to think along those lines because, at this point, it's easy to parade the horribles In spite of my great respect for Mr Kichline, I think his forecast is not likely to come to pass If you look at what he has for budget deficits--$85 billion [in 1981 and $94 billion] in 1982--and then look where he ends up with his GNP forecast, which is for very sluggish growth, I think the proper assumption is that we have very high interest rates during that period From my discussions with bankers around the country, I just don't think the real world is going to operate that way I get the feeling that they're pretty concerned about the financial condition of a lot of corporations out there, and I just don't think a lot of companies can stand that kind of environment for that length of time I don't know what it's going to be like, but I doubt that it's going to be like that forecast Take two possibilities One is that this M2 growth is more meaningful and that we get tax cuts this summer, which are going to be very expansionary We [could] get an enormous surge in money growth in the last half of the year and very high interest rates, and then get socked like the devil in 1982 Or take the other way around that we are going to have a much weaker economy short term than now appears likely, so [money] growth is going to be much slower Add to the whole problem what the House Banking Committee said--I was struck by this--which was that they could accept the upper end of the target ranges for monetary growth for 1981 provided that budget and other fiscal policies offset the high unemployment effects that the monetary policy is expected to produce That seems to me to be a scenario for absolute disaster If they are going to continue to look to us to hold the line, I don't think we have a choice We've said what our path is going to be and, if we were to attempt to ease, it's pretty clear that everybody would think we had let the inflationary cat out of the bag And it seems to me that interest rates would be even higher under those circumstances So, I don't think we have a choice; we have to stay on our general path here But the scenarios of what could possibly happen can be pretty wild So, it's rather crucial at this point to try to retain what flexibility we can and to have some range of options because this is a pretty tough period we are heading into  Scared!  The fact that we have much higher interest rates now indicates that the adjustment would take place more rapidly We are seeing shorter lag times in everything  I was arguing against ""A"" and ""C"" So, I'm for ""B"" and I tend to agree with Tony that we ought to start out with borrowing around $13 billion And I would go with a federal funds range of 12 to 18 percent  That sounds pretty good because, as I recall Steve's figures, the staff is looking for velocity to slow down some in the second quarter so you were anticipating that we would have to have the higher borrowing, weren't you? What were you looking at in terms of--  Yes, for ""B"" You were talking about $15 billion, weren't you?  People think we know a lot!  SPEAKER(?) As you can tell from the previous discussion, we have great faith in the forecast!  Furthermore, both bills have been referred to the Commerce Committee, which is a very unfriendly referral  Mr Chairman, if we just go with 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less, doesn't that really give us the kind of flexibility that we need to take care of most of these [contingencies]?  Yes  Well, it doesn't really have--  It's only somewhat less, Nancy  I voted with you, Nancy "
1770,1981-04-28," And that's going to clear everything up!  I don't think we're in any danger Anybody listening in on this conversation is going to be totally confused!  This is Fred Schultz I agree with that statement  The Secretary of the Treasury said this morning that they were watching the situation and did not believe it to be critical and were not ready to propose any legislation That, however, is not the position of the regulatory agencies "
1791,1981-05-06," This is Fred Schultz I might want to argue that It seems to me that we do need to deemphasize this funds rate range It appears to be giving us an awful lot of difficulty It has added to the confusion in the market Events are such that we do have the opportunity to continue that deemphasis I think we should go ahead and take the opportunity, and I would hope that at the next FOMC meeting we could have a very thorough discussion about exactly what we want to do with that funds rate range "
1813,1981-05-18," So moved  That's where it is hurting  I told you about going to a cocktail party a couple of months ago A fellow who happened to have had a few drinks came up to me and clapped me on the back and said ""I want you to know that I'm with you all the way, you SOB""  SPEAKER(?) That's the exact [sentiment]  Let me ask a question, Roger Are the cattle being slaughtered or are they being put back in the pasture? With the rains you've had, I would imagine some are going back to pasture  Most of the commercial paper that thrifts had out was in the California area, is that right? What has happened to it? Is there any indication? Does anybody know?  Does the State Department have its economic team in place yet?  I know, but he hasn't been confirmed  When?  I thought [unintelligible] told me last week that Rashish had not been confirmed Did I misunderstand?  That comes next  Let me ask you a question You recall the last telephone conversation I expressed some concern about the market perception along these lines and wondered whether we might not be able to say things a little better in a way that might help the market When we get to the directive today, I think some alternative ways of talking about the federal funds rate are going to surface because I do have a sense that some confusion still remains out there On the other hand, I also have some concern that it is probably important not to change the wording very often because just a change of wording has a tendency to confuse people So, there are pros and cons on this Peter, do you have a sense at this point as to whether there might be some better way to explain what we are actually about in order to clear up any confusion they may have? Or is a change of wording going to add to it?  Well, that's what I keep hearing If it's just a checkpoint, why do you put it in or why don't you just say that more clearly? They get confused about the way we say it  I know, but it seems to confuse them for some reason  Maybe I started a conversation that best ought to be done later on I withdraw the question  Yes, he brought us right to the brink and then dropped us, didn't he?  Let me start out with a very quick story about the fellow who went to Dublin and asked directions to a castle outside of town He said ""Can you tell me how to get there?"" And the fellow he asked said ""Of course I can, but you can't start from here"" I'm afraid I have that same kind of feeling as we go around The last time I expressed a lot of vague fears, which I guess have all come true, that we have gotten higher interest rates and a stronger economy and everything seems to be going in different directions due to that Money seems to affect interest rates, and interest rates affect money; but neither one seems to have much effect on the economy So, I have some real questions about how we should go about doing this In addition, I have the same thoughts that were expressed here a little earlier That we are putting a lot of pressure on various parts of the economy and that it's going to be hard to get out of this without some kind of financial crisis The one really strong feeling I have is that monetary policy alone won't do the job for us But we don't have much choice Over the weekend I looked at the Bluebook and I thought about ""B"" tending toward ""A"" But the more I  -24-    5/18/81  listen to the reports that things are pretty strong out there, it seems fairly clear that we don't have any option but to continue to restrain this economy What we've done so far isn't having too much effect So, I guess I would now come out somewhere between ""B"" and ""C,"" keeping borrowing around $2 billion and perhaps shading that up if necessary  And the way they talk about it  I think the way they say it is of critical importance The President is essentially an upbeat kind of fellow; I think he wants to talk that way But the talk has been essentially that we can get out of this almost without any real pain and without any real problems I just don't think that that's the right way to be talking at this stage of the game because, heaven knows, it's pretty hard to see how that could be possible If they would talk in a little more practical way, I think it would help  What a friend!  Yes  But you want to be asymmetrical about that, don't you?  This is not my day!  That borrowing [level] is pretty good  -34-    5/18/81  [I don't think] that's right I was starting at $2 billion and moving it up from there  We're about to!  Suppose we said ""3 percent or lower unless it becomes inconsistent"" What happens if we do that?  Starting out with $2 billion is starting out $250 million above where we are  Doesn't that have something to do with the fact that there aren't any excess reserves out there?  But the point is that if we move borrowing up, we ought to get a fairly quick effect, shouldn't we?  It sounds strong to me That's why I started out with $2 billion But I certainly would be interested in moving it quickly, depending upon what kind of reactions we see  When I was looking at this before, the one thing I didn't like about it was the use of the word ""necessary"" Is that a good word or is ""advisable"" a better word there? If we say it's necessary, are we not then implying that again the fed funds range is part of the--  I think if the money supply is running outside its range, you will consult [with the Committee]; and if the fed funds rate is running well outside its range, then you may consult  All right  I rather like the other alternative we were talking about, which is that a Committee consultation may be called for by the Chairman if it appears during the period before the next meeting that the federal funds rate is likely to be significantly outside a range of _ to _ percent for an extended period  SPEAKER(?) I think that's pretty much the same  I thought that was pretty straightforward  But, unfortunately, the way we have said it has led to the feeling on the part of a lot people in the markets that we still do have a fed funds rate target  I understand what we've done It's just that I think there still is a misperception in the market, which it seems to me we might be able to clear up with some rewording I do have some reluctance about changing it, just on the basis on the fact that every time we make a change there is some confusion in the market So, whether it's worth making the change is a question My feeling is that it would be good if we did change it I would hate to see us give up some kind of fed funds range because I think the uncertainties that we're dealing with here and the relationships between the aggregates and the economy are so difficult that the fed funds rate tells us something There can clearly be a situation in which something is happening out there and we ought to be consulting But that's what we're doing We keep telling people that that's what we're doing and they don't believe us very well because this range appears in the directive  I prefer ""may"" because ""will"" implies that there is a target there  -49-    5/18/81  I don't like that much, but I think what Chuck is suggesting is fine  This is not my day!  What would you do? Would you go further than what we're suggesting?  Yes, he did  That's exactly what he did  I have a feeling the Chairman can talk the Manager into--  With a ""B"" specification  -53-    5/18/81  How about ""2-1/2 percent or somewhat lower""?  Accept 2 percent? I'll accept either one  I just really can't get awfully excited over this thing  This is becoming a theology session!  And we'll be lucky to hit any of them!  -56-    5/18/81  Yes, or not [unintelligible] That gives us more room--  My word!  That's pretty good  -57-    5/18/81 -58- "
1828,1981-06-17, Yes 
1851,1981-07-06," I move the election of Mr Bradfield as General Counsel  So moved  I hope when you are talking about municipals being the ""wallflowers in the industry"" that you are not suggesting that people are now papering their walls with them!  Current account or trade account?  Whether the Treasury will [want to intervene], given its--  I just don't know [at what point] we'd intervene I recall that we were surprised that the mark moved from 180 to 190 and we were intervening and then it went from 190 to [200] Those were big moves Why didn't we go in at that point? I don't know--  Yes, we did; we bought quite a few [deutschemarks] at that time And now look how much further it has gone It's terribly difficult to know when to intervene I do think we'd be a lot better off if certain people in the Administration would not make such a public [declaration] about nonintervention and the fact that we're not going to do anything It seems to me that we'd be a little better off if there were a little less talk about it, but I'm not sure that I'm for jumping in with a policy of [large-scale] intervention  Isn't that what's likely to happen--that we'll have periods of weakness that will tend to be followed by some strength? It seems to me perfectly reasonable to expect some weakness in the latter half of the year followed by some strength in the first part of next year caused to some extent by lower interest rates, by the tax bill that will go into effect, and by [higher] defense spending And given the kind of monetary policy we have had, if we have some strengthening in the economy, we most certainly will have some upward movement again in interest rates So, are we not likely to be faced by these opposing forces going back and forth?  Oh, I think they do; they go down I think they're going to go down in the latter half of this year  -21-    7/6-7/81  What do you get for real growth and inflation?  But it seems to me that this is only half of the problem Half of the problem is that we don't know what the monetary aggregates are; the other half of the problem is that we don't know what the relationship is between the aggregates and GNP  I thought I was the outlier on that deflator I had 6 to 7 percent, but you have me beat!  Corporate profits aren't going to be very strong and [corporations] are going to have some real incentive to start getting a little tougher  But futures prices for meat in the last couple of weeks have been down surprisingly I don't understand that  I think that's moving too fast  That's 3-1/2 percent You are not suggesting that we attempt to get on a path right now of getting back to 3-1/2 percent by the end of the year, are you?  If you believe that  But some comment in the directive to indicate that it is indeed being looked at might well be worthwhile Given that we are in fact looking at a family of aggregates and that none of these aggregates is behaving very well, it might be a good idea to indicate to people in the market that we are indeed looking at least to some degree at M2  Well, with the exception of Mr Black, I was the outlier on my forecast for inflation for next year [My forecast was] predicated on the idea that we would continue with the policy of monetary restraint I disagree with Governor Wallich I think we have a real opportunity at this point to bring inflation down There are a lot of indications that the groundwork has been laid and that there is sensitivity [to that possibility] I certainly would agree with Mr Solomon, though, that it takes a period of intense price and wage competition to bring inflation down We have that opportunity over the next four quarters and I think it is very important that we not lose this opportunity for two reasons (1) because the American public are going to get very impatient if they don't start to see some real effects from the kind of policy we've been carrying out; and (2) because we have another big tax cut coming up on the first of July of next year and that's likely to be very stimulative  So, to me, the next four quarters are really crucial It is vital that we have a continued policy of monetary restraint There are risks on both sides There is a risk in what I really would like to see, which is a period of very slow growth or a mild recession, and the risk is that it could get out of hand on the down side I don't think that's likely to happen, first because there is a great deal of latent demand in the economy and if the economy does weaken to that degree, interest rates would come down and that would have a stimulative effect Also we have another tax cut coming on October 1 and we have continued heavy defense spending, [both of] which I think are likely to prove to be a support underneath the economy if it should get much weaker than I would anticipate The risk on the other side of not having a firm policy of monetary restraint is that we could have a very difficult time early next year It seems to me that the period of greatest danger for the thrifts is that period; if we ease up and then have this tax cut and the defense spending and the other things that could well take place, we could easily be in a situation in the first quarter of next year where interest rates are rising and there is tremendous pressure on the thrifts I think that's the period of great danger It seems to me that we have a real opportunity here and it's very important that we not let this situation get out of hand as we did last year The economy is poised so that we can exert a real effect on inflation  So, I would like to see us reduce the lower M1-B band for this year to 3 percent from 3-1/2 percent I see the arguments on the other side, but if we leave it at 3-1/2 percent the market would look at it and say ""That points to a big increase for the remainder of this year and if the Fed weren't going to try to hit that target, why did they leave it there?"" I think that makes a lot of sense The argument can be made that if we put in 3 percent, then that is a real target and maybe we would have to hit it in spite of what may happen in the meantime It seems to me that the stronger argument is that if we leave it at 3-1/2 percent, the market will anticipate that we're going to be pumping up the money supply pretty rapidly between now and the end of the year to get to that figure So, I'd like to see us lower that range to 3 percent on the down side  Next year, I do think there's likely to be a wide swing, particularly in M-1B My anticipation is that the economy likely will  -45-    7/6-7/81  remain somewhat sluggish in the first half But if we do have some success in getting inflation down and that tax cut hits on July 1, the second half of the year could be pretty strong and I think we are likely to get some rather wide swings [in monetary growth] I would opt for alternative III, which would mean a further lowering of the target range for M-1B on the bottom side but retaining the 3-point range  I would I'm very much afraid--  I'd leave the upper part of the range alone for this year or lower it 1/2 point I wouldn't lower it by more than that I am afraid of tightening these ranges too far  All right I'd accept that I'm really much more concerned about the bottom part than I am the top I'd accept the lowering of the top  2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent  Explain to me what worries you about that Are you worried that we would be making a major effort to get growth up to 3 percent? Is that what bothers you? Or are your worried that that is too constraining? Which side are you on?  -49-    7/6-7/81  A more determined expansionary effort if we lower it to 3 percent than if we leave it where it is?  And the one who goes off will also need a psychiatrist!  Or keep it simple, stupid  No, I want the economy to be a little weaker  I think the economy is going to be a little weaker in the third quarter and to me that's a consummation devoutly to be wished for I would not move too rapidly to offset a little economic weakness; and under those circumstance I think alternative C is as fast as we ought to go, not as slow as we ought to go So, I would favor alternative C for M-1B and M2 and I would start the borrowings at $15 billion and put the fed funds range at 15 to 21 percent  To be consistent  No, he said it would not be consistent with 19 to 20 percent  That's why I picked the 15 to 21 percent funds range for a borrowing [assumption] of $1-1/2 billion  He suggested something very high  At any rate, $15 billion should certainly be consistent with a lower funds rate than we're experiencing right now  Theoretically, yes  Borrowings of $1-1/2 billion  That's not the way it works, though  Yes, but we're likely to have some offsetting weakness in the money market funds  Well, the proposal is not quite as constraining as I would like I still prefer a straight alternative C, with a little lower figure on everything; but you're halfway between ""B"" and ""C"" on both M-1B and M2  Well, okay, you're right; it's closer to ""C""  But if the economy weakened, even though interest rates were coming down, in fact there would be some force pushing M2 up, but at the same time M-1B is likely to be--  -78-    7/6-7/81  That's what I argued for before, Henry; I ran that up the flag pole and there were some who didn't salute  But the midpoint between 2-1/2 and 5-1/2 is 4 percent, which is above where I certainly hope growth will be this year So, in fact, if we adopt 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, we are actually allowing for more growth than we're likely to get this year  Well, don't you think the process of innovation is going to continue, though, to some degree? The momentum involved now--  But the other side of it is that we would certainly, we hope, get substantially less nominal GNP next year than this year  Well, it isn't  Yes, but listen When you talk to [Administration officials] in private they are very clear about the fact that they really don't believe in these numbers that they are publishing here at midyear They say it quite directly They have said it to me  I know, but they just have wild numbers Privately they say quite directly Don't pay much attention to these midyear figures we are coming out with  By across the board, do you mean on all the aggregates or on the top and bottom of M1?  But we don't need anything like that kind of rise next year, depending on what one is assuming on nominal GNP If [GNP growth] is in the 9 to 10 percent range and [money grows at the] midpoint of 4 percent and normal velocity is 3, that would give you an extra velocity of 3 rather than 5 You can play with numbers like that I don't think you--  SPEAKER(?) A lot of that is possible  No, I wasn't making that kind of--  Well, I think you know that I have less and less confidence in M-1B; I give less and less weight to it  I think Chuck made a pretty good argument for not doing it now and taking a look at it later  Do you want a show of hands?  And I made such a beautiful argument!  Some get rained out  -92-    7/6-7/81  We're not changing '81  I was worried about how I would look if I dissented  No, that's not the problem  I'll vote ""Yes"" "
1888,1981-08-18," If 10 or 15 percent is a free fall, would it also be considered a disorderly market?  We might have before  I asked for an analysis of 1974 not too long ago and just got it this morning In looking at it, it indicates that in periods of volatility such as that the relationship among the various interest rates changes considerably and very rapidly So, I think Governor Partee's point is accurate It really hasn't happened for very long and it's the kind of thing we probably should expect, particularly at these very high rates with all the volatility going on I'm not sure one can read that much into it  I would tend to argue the other way, Larry, that if we were to target very precisely on just one aggregate, it would put us even more in a box The object of trying to target on any aggregate is that it's a proxy for GNP But the problem is clearly that those relationships are not very tight any more; they are getting looser and looser It seems to me that the events that are taking place argue for looking at a broader range of aggregates and for having wider target ranges for the aggregates that we look at Now, that may give us some difficulty in terms of the precision of monetary control on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, but it seems to me that we'd get into a bigger box if we tried to target on any single aggregate and tried to be very precise about it because these relationships are changing We could easily get into a situation such as the British got themselves into by targeting on sterling M3; suddenly they were just way outside of the target ranges and they had very serious problems I, for one, would argue for looking at more aggregates with broader ranges than for looking at a single aggregate or a very narrow range  That's right But that relationship seems to be getting looser all the time  -11-    8/18/81  How do we do anything about interest rates when credit demands are the way they are? What did you estimate that the Treasury has to [raise] in the fourth quarter, counting sponsored agencies--$41 billion? These credit demands are very disturbing I don't know how in the world we make--  That's the point, though Unless the economy slows or the deficit comes down, how do we get the credit demands down? I don't see how there is much--  But, Governor Gramley, would you not agree then that if the Fed were to be seen as pumping out reserves at a rapid rate, it would have a severe expectational impact and would, in fact, put upward pressure on interest rates?  What's the story on International Harvester right now?  What does say about commercial construction?  -26-    8/18/81  The Chairman is going on the MacNeil Lehrer program tomorrow night There are some of us around here who hope very strongly that he would be willing to go not only on MacNeil Lehrer tomorrow night but that there will be a couple of other opportunities for him to speak over the next month or two Those of us who feel that expectations are absolutely critical are trying to push him to do a couple more public appearances  It's not quite $14 billion, is it, Steve? What is the target, $137 billion? I understand that's pretty close  That changes the whole situation!  Well, there's a lull in the conversation, and it's a good time for me to comment I continue to think that we must not lose sight of what we're trying to do long term We just have to get inflation down this time If we don't, I'm afraid that we will have an awful period ahead of us lasting a great many years We're making some real progress I get concerned, as Tony does, about getting blown out of the water next year I get concerned about it maybe even from a little different point of view I get concerned  -41-    8/18/81  that if this economy continues to hold up and doesn't break--and it's remarkably resilient--and if the Administration doesn't do something to stretch out defense expenditures or hold down spending in some way or find some way to cut the budget further, these interest rates are going to stay very high Next year is an election year, and I think we could easily get blown out of the water because I think the Administration could well come under enough pressure at some point early next year either to go for credit controls or to cut and run on supporting a firm monetary policy So, I think we have a tough, tough period to go through here  What we're trying to do is to walk a rather fine line It strikes me that we do have some restraint on the economy at this point in time These interest rates do seem to be high enough to bite, but they don't seem to be high enough to bite as badly as everybody thinks they ought to I continue to be amazed at how well small businesses are holding up, at how well they continue to be able to be viable entities They're learning how to price; everybody is learning how to adapt I would not like to see further restraint on the economy, but I certainly would be afraid to start letting up I don't know about the rest of you, but I look at those retail sales and I hear my wife talk, and we haven't changed any consumer's ideas about [inflation]; they all still talk the same way They say ""I better buy it now because it's going to cost more next year"" We haven't changed many of those perceptions in the marketplace All those market participants are still [behaving] the same way They've been burned and burned; it took us 15 years to change their expectations and we aren't going to change them back very fast It's going to be a slow process So, it seems to me that we ought to continue to move on the course we're on Things might clear up a little after Labor Day Governor Gramley, as you say, things do tend to get a little clearer in the economy after that time But they're murky enough right now that I think that we ought to continue with the course we're on  Scylla and Charybdis have overlapped  I hate to tell you, Mr Black, but I really don't believe there are very many people out there who understand the difference between these kinds of numbers you're talking about I would hope the Chairman would not speak in these specific terms but would give, in effect, a broad overview of what is going on  New technical differences "
1915,1981-10-05," I'll make a bet that it took longer to ask for it than you just outlined it  Mr Kaufman is projecting a large increase [for the week of] October 7th  From whom? Where are you getting that? I keep trying to get a feel for this--I've talked to bankers all over the country--and it's hard In general, when I talk to big bankers, they say things don't look so bad; they look pretty good Even the ones that have special divisions that lend to small businesses say they have checked and the people they have loaned to are under a lot of pressure but none seems about to break Then when I talk to the little bankers, they say the cataclysm has arrived  Just to be specific about your District, I had lunch with who has a very good program for small business lending He said the small businesses are all under pressure but he didn't see any that are going [under] That's the problem that I have The [small businesses] all are saying that they're in really difficult condition but if you ask the banker who has lent to them, he says he thinks they're going to make it okay  The bankruptcy rate is up 415 percent over last year But one has to remember that the new bankruptcy law has this new Chapter 13, which is very attractive for these smaller  -8-    10/5-6/81  businesses who can go into that and keep running under their management It's a different kind of animal than they've ever had to work with before  Well, only in the latter part of last year  That's right; it was late '79  Yes, that's right  Well, you said I was optimistic; I am optimistic I'm optimistic because of just what Jerry Corrigan said I have never felt that there was any way to get inflation down without putting pressure on business and labor Put pressure on business and they have to find a way to cut those costs because they don't have [available] the path of least resistance of raising prices And if you put pressure on business, labor begins to get the point that if they get too much in wages they won't have a business to work for I think that really is beginning to happen now and that's why I'm more optimistic Every business I know of out there is doing everything it can to cut costs When the Teamsters open the master contract because they see some of their truckers going under, when the UAW talks about job security instead of wage increases, and when Pan Am workers are willing to take 10 percent cuts because the airlines are in trouble, I think those are signs that we're at the point where something can really start to happen So, that's why I tend to be optimistic on the subject  There have been more oil wells drilled in the continental United States than in the rest of the world put together  You mean an oil well by every 70-story building!  That's the [view] nationwide It's everywhere It's really remarkable I have been meeting a lot with homebuilders; I went up to Boston to talk to the board of directors of the National Association of Homebuilders Would you believe that their board of directors is 1800 people? That was exactly the [sentiment] I'm dying, what are you doing to me? But you have to hang in there and get rid of inflation  Well, I want to take off from a comment that Mr Roos made on the subject of credibility That's an issue that all of us have wondered about and thought about, particularly in view of the fact that there is a lot of pressure on this institution We've had a lot of bills introduced in the Congress to restructure the Federal Reserve or to do away with it or, perhaps the one that makes the most sense, to impeach all members of the Open Market Committee! At any rate, it strikes me that our credibility is not at issue when it comes to whether we hit the bottom of the target on M-1B or not Our credibility is really at issue in the more basic question of whether we are going to do the job that I think we were in essence created to do It seems to me that the basic function of a central bank is to avoid deflation on one hand and inflation on the other And I'm not terribly sure how successful we can be fine-tuning in between My feeling is that maybe we shouldn't call this the moment of truth because it's going to be a lot longer than that It's going to be a period of truth I don't fear all of these bills that are in the Congress to change the Federal Reserve if we do our basic job of finally getting inflation under control If we don't do that job, then what the heck is our reason for being? How do we justify our existence under those circumstances? It seems to me our basic raison d'etre would be gone So, I think that's where the credibility issue is whether we are in fact going to do the job that we were created to do We've been criticized in the past, and I think a lot of that criticism is proper But now we're at the point where we have to  -28-    10/5-6/81  carry through and get the job done I'm certainly not attempting to say that we ought to crush the economy but we just can't lose sight of the basic fact that what we're trying to do is to keep that steady pressure on--we have some luck here in food and fuel prices--and if we keep the pressure on, we can get some movement in the wage-price structure and begin to get this spiral going in the other direction  So, I for one think alternative C is the one that makes the difference I agree that M-1B has problems and that M2 has problems, so it seems to me sensible to look at both of them and in some way to incorporate both of them in the directive I would get terribly worried about going much faster than [alternative C] on M-1B because what happens, then, when we get to January? Not only do we run the risk of stimulating these latent demands-- Mr Roos asked what difference interest rates make Well, it strikes me that we've been keeping the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy under a great deal of pressure And if interest rates do go down, that has a stimulative effect on those sectors of the economy And then what do we do when we get to January if we're not going to pick targets that are lower than what we have here? If we're going to go to 6 percent or even faster [M-1B growth at this point], what happens then? Do we then tighten the screws and get the up and down effect again? So, anything that's faster than ""C"" would worry me  Well, I've made my general comments I feel that the economy is going to be weaker in the fourth quarter than the projection I think we are going to have trouble keeping M-1B even at the level of alternative C I don't see that alternative as being very restrictive, frankly So, I would come down on alternative C, with initial borrowing at $800 million, an M2 proviso, and a fed funds range of 12 to 17 percent  Larry, that's not the problem, though If we did ""B,"" M-1B would be running at a 12 percent annual rate in December Then we'd go into the new year and let's say we set [the midpoint of the target for M-1B growth] at 4 or 5 or 6 percent or whatever we want to do for next year That's a lot of leeway; then we'd really have to turn that screw That's the problem we run into If [M-1B growth] is going up like that and all of a sudden we have these lower targets, then we really have to shut down on the economy And it seems to me that's what we want to avoid We want the continuity of running along from here rather than getting into the kind of box that you're thinking about  I just want to avoid this yo-yo  If you did that, would you also put in this language about the all savers?  I have some sensitivity to what Mr Roos said about narrowing that range  I think we really ought to retain a 5-point range anyway, and I would have no problems with 12 to 17 percent  Well, I think we would want to if it got down that fast How precipitous the decline occurs is of some importance, don't you think?  I'd be very nervous about not consulting if the funds rate got down to 12 percent in such a short period of time That could be misinterpreted by the market  That's the weak part of the whole thing!  -53-    10/5-6/81  I don't mind that I prefer a little less than 7 percent on the growth, but I prefer a little less than $850 on the borrowings, so they balance off "
1940,1981-11-17," Would you care to designate him?  I move it  It depends on where we put the borrowing If those borrowings get too low, then rates can drop pretty fast  Yes, it's there in the back of the Bluebook  Well, one comment about what Mr Boehne said As far as latent demand is concerned, we've had a policy of monetary restraint for a couple of years now and it does stand to reason that in the interest sensitive sectors, which have been under pressure for that length of time, there would be some latent demand--certainly, for example, in housing The auto sector would seem to have some latent demand because of scrappage on the one hand and because of the recent very rapid rise in used car prices; one would assume that would have some connection I happen to feel that auto sales may be a bit more interest sensitive than the staff does, as a psychological factor, if nothing else I recognize the sticker shock phenomenon Another interesting thing to note is that in the quarterly survey of the National Association of Small Businesses a large percentage of respondents say that their biggest problem is interest rates But only a portion of those people say that the problem is that they are under terrific pressure A lot of very solid small businesses say that they'd like to expand if interest rates would come down, so I think there's considerable latent demand in that area as well  -16-    11/17/81  Let me speak to what Bill Ford had to say, because I think that's the crux of the matter at this point in time I believe that the very high interest rates have been a primary cause of the recession we're in If that's the case, then we certainly need to have lower interest rates before the economy begins to pull up And I think we clearly do need lower interest rates There are three things, though, that bother me a great deal about the speed and depth of that drop [in rates] The first is that if we let borrowing go too low--I'm not sure about Steve's frictional level of $50 to $100 million because I have a feeling it may be a little higher--we get into a situation where the funds rate could drop very precipitously And if the funds rate were to drop to a negative real rate, that would be an indication to the market that would not be very favorable You asked Peter what his judgments were about expectations The fact is that the army of Fed watchers out there has history on its side in feeling that we are going to cave in We have in the past and they continue to expect history to repeat itself So, I think a very sharp and precipitous drop in the funds rate could have serious expectational consequences  The second part follows on that expectational point It is important that we get mortgage rates down if we're going to get some recovery in housing Now, how do we go about doing that? Well, if we get more savings flows into the thrifts, that helps If the rates on all the other alternative investments come down, then the mortgages will look better But the fact is that the thrifts have been killed by investing in mortgages over the years, so the expectational factor is very important for them in terms of when they're going to start making mortgage loans again The California thrifts keep coming in and telling us that they're not making any mortgages at all even with these very high rates So, how do we get them to [make such loans]? I'm not sure that a very precipitous drop in short-term rates is the kind of thing that would make the thrifts feel that they'd want to go out and start making mortgage loans again The expectational factors are important there I don't really know how to assess that, but it's something to be considered  The final thing that just scares the devil out of me--it gives me some nightmares--is what will happen if we do get this recovery in the first or second quarter and then the tax cut comes in; I just have to feel that interest rates are going to start back up again at some point in time Now, 1982 is an election year What kind of problems will this country face in its anti-inflation efforts if we are in a period of rising interest rates in a political campaign? On the question of how rapidly interest rates come down and how rapidly they come back up, in talking to small businesses of all different kinds, my sense is that there are thousands of them out there that are hanging on by their fingernails and they're going to continue to hang on when they see interest rates coming down But when they see those interest rates start to turn back up again, I think a lot of them are going to let go, and we could be facing a really, really serious problem Willis Winn brought in a letter this morning which he says is typical of what he has been getting from businessmen In effect it says that the Fed is being too tight and it's causing the recession and not letting the President's program work It's that kind of argument Now, what happens if we get into  -17-    11/17/81  the summer in a political campaign under those kinds of circumstances? I just have a feeling it could wreck the whole anti-inflation campaign and then we're in deep trouble I think we do need to get interest rates down It's important But the speed and depth of that drop and the potential for the rebound is something that we really have to keep in mind  Who's that, Heinneman?  -19-    11/17/81  That gives [unintelligible] more important If they hang them all, that's all right  I don't think I heard anybody at the table say that  I didn't think so I don't believe you'd get anybody to vote for that  That may be; I agree with that But I don't think anybody wants to--  You're just elliptical looking, Jerry!  May I ask a question in line with that? As you pointed out, most of the drilling going on is deep drilling  That's natural gas drilling?  -30-    11/17/81  Is there any oil at those [deep] levels? Are they doing a lot of betting on natural gas decontrol? Is that [a major factor]?  MCO  Thousand cubic feet  If it's below 15,000 feet, but it's almost all--  Well, I've said my piece on the interest rate issue I'm not bothered by the fed funds rate getting down below 10 percent, but not between now and the next meeting I would go with the idea of a target and then say ""or somewhat lower"" My choice would be alternative B with initial borrowing at $350 million and a federal funds range of 11 to 16 percent It's basically ""B,"" but with a different funds rate [range] After all, that's a consultation point I think we ought to consult if it gets [to 11 percent]; remember, the next FOMC meeting is only 5 weeks away, so it's a very short period of time I suspect, as I said yesterday, that we're going to have to move that basic discount rate pretty soon And I would have some concern about the rate going [down] faster than that, which is why I say 11 to 16 percent I'd have some concern about the borrowing getting down any lower than $200 million during this period of time  Incidentally, I'd be willing to go 11 percent with 15 percent on the top end; the only problem is that it's only a 4-point range I don't think we're going to hit that [upper limit] anyway  The question though, Steve, is When we first hit that frictional level what happened to the funds rate? That's what gets me concerned There's a point at which the drop in the funds rate gets very rapid in that kind of period  Good idea When in doubt, punt  That's where it begins to bother me  What happens if we just take what we had last time, which is the 7 percent--leave it alone--and set the borrowings at $400 million and our consultation rate on fed funds at 11 percent?  No  No, November to December  Yes  One might term my proposal ""a son of a B,"" I guess  We got rid of the base drift  -55-    11/17/81  SPEAKER(?) Somebody said there is a definition shift  [Secretary's note Mr Guffey was leaving the room]  Well, if we said ""7 percent or somewhat lower,"" what does that do for you?  What is the great difficulty with using 7 percent--and that sets the reserve path--and then using the borrowing  -60-    11/17/81  assumption and the fed funds constraint to take care of the fact that we are going to miss that one way or the other?  My problem is my simple mind; I don't have any difficulty with what I just said But maybe others do  I just would use the number 7 percent in a straightforward directive--the normal kind that we have used before I'd use the numbers for M1-B and M2 that are under alternative B, which are 7 percent and 11 percent or something like that And then I'd put in a fed funds constraint, which I would prefer at 11 percent because it's very difficult to know what is going to transpire in this very short period of time and I think it's worthwhile to confer at 11 percent I'd start with a borrowing assumption of $400 million, recognizing that there is every likelihood that it will come down and none that it would go up because we would be generally tolerant of some additional strength in the aggregates, which none of us feels is going to happen  A number has two purposes One is a target; then there is a number which is used to construct a nonborrowed reserves path So, it has two functions And it seems to me that even if we really don't think conditions are such that we will make it as a target, it is useful in setting the path  No, it's almost seven  Well, we never consult unless that bottom level is broken We never consult just because it drops and touches the number and pops back up I tell you The funds rate is a little over 13 percent now, and if we're breaking 11 percent in a 5-week period, that's really moving down  We might go with a straight crap shoot and call it 7 and 11  But, Henry, that's symmetrical You don't want to be that--  11 percent  -66-    11/17/81  Let's vote  And will be known as the Federal Reserve crap shoot when it comes out "
1969,1981-12-21,"  So moved      SPEAKER(?)  Second       Yes, it wasn't severe criticism       As a matter of fact, they also said that there  was some general agreement that intervention policy should be used  sparingly or something like that  I didn't get the feeling that they  had a strong position on that  That's my recollection  I didn't  think it was a very vitriolic comment       Is my recollection wrong?      I'd be interested to know what people are hearing about the labor situation Jim puts together some tables on wage concessions, every week or so I guess, and they are lengthening I was on the plane Friday with a fellow who recently retired as head of one of the major trucking companies, and he said that a lot of the Teamster locals are likely to go with just a cost of living increase because the competition is just tremendous and, indeed, a lot of unionized trucking companies look as if they are not going to make it What kind of noises do you hear as you talk to CEOs?  I have a comment on work rules When John Sagan was here for the Conference of Chairmen, he indicated that at one Ford plant where they had 44 work rules they had gotten the number down to 6 or something like that There were some major changes in the work rules which he thought was really significant Are you hearing that kind of noise too?  No, I think Nancy's right  That is for 1980, you see Look back to the--  Let me ask you a [question] The loan/deposit ratios in agricultural banks, remember, had been pretty high in the spring of 1980, at about 68 percent nationally When we looked at them here not too long ago, a couple months ago, they were down to 60 percent Are your banks pretty much in that same situation--that their loan/deposit ratios are pretty good? Do they have plenty of room to make loans if they want to make them and carry them over?  What about the land prices? Again, looking at the places where most of the problem loans tend to be, people had gotten pretty extended on land Are you beginning to see a break in your land prices?  Do you have numbers down there, Mr Kichline?  To give you a little more time, would you like to have a filibuster?  You just let the cat out of the bag, Henry!  Ted, why doesn't Japan stimulate [its economy]? They have their inflation rate down to around 4 percent, as I remember the figure, and the domestic economy is weak The yen has been pretty strong The current account surplus is just-- What is the reason they don't stimulate?  I think Otto Eckstein is using a figure of around $15 billion or something like that  I think Mr Boehne made the right comment We are at that stage of the cycle when one thinks it could just go ""whoosh"" down It doesn't do that, but it always looks terrible  Yes  Steve used the word credibility several times I have been talking to market participants the last few weeks and that term keeps coming up in their discussions as well In particular, just to give you three examples and names that might you remember In talking with Paul Boltz, who used to be with us and now is at Continental, and George Henry who is now up on Wall Street, and John Phalen from the NYSE, I asked the question about credibility They all said that the credibility of the Federal Reserve is much higher than it has ever been before There is a cost to that, however The cost is [related to] the second question I asked them What do you think would happen to financial markets if we were to change course perceptibly? And they said they thought it would have enormous impact on the financial markets So, I think we have a situation in which we have built up a lot of credibility, but the flip side of that is that we have painted ourselves into a corner in that if we don't stay pretty well on the course that we have generally outlined, it is going to have a rather substantial market impact  Some information on the payroll plans probably would be the best indicator that we could get, if there is a way to find that out relatively soon I think that would give us some real indication  I'll vote for that  Or a temporary parking for IRA-Keoghs  Well, I'll do it quickly The $350 million and the 10 to 14 percent I think are fine I prefer 4 and 9 percent [for the aggregates] because I don't believe we're going to have a great deal of problem with that My feeling is that there's a risk in the economy that tends to be on the down side and I just don't understand the OCDs I don't know, but my gut feeling is that [the recession] is not going to continue forever, so I don't feel that we are going to have much of a problem On the other hand, if we do have some  -59-    12/21-22/81  problem, I wouldn't mind seeing us have a little leeway on the up side there I am perfectly willing to tolerate a little stronger growth depending upon what happens in the economy and what happens to interest rates  That [depends on] the initial borrowing number What happens initially with that borrowing?  From a perception point of view, I think we're a little better off with 4 and 9 percent and tolerating somewhat higher growth than with 5 and 10 percent, tolerating somewhat lower  Well, I don't want to get into that one! I have some rather strong feelings about the fact that the critical thing we have to do is to find a way to get long-term interest rates down So when we target on that sort of thing, the perception of what we do has considerable importance since expectations are so much [a factor] in those long-term rates But I don't want to get off on a diatribe on that issue  precision?  You take off from the regular M1-B series  Isn't it wonderful to be able to deal in such  Yes, that may be the more critical point ""Around"" means anything from 0 to 10  If it doesn't work out that way, we'll kill the messenger! I was going to say put it in--  You're being a little too frank!  Oh, I think that gives a feeling of greater precision [than is warranted]; really that's nitpicking it  I know, but--  I'd rather go with either 4 or 5 with some appropriate language than with 4-1/2 I continue to prefer 4 and 9  -66-    12/21-22/81  There are some who would feel strongly--  Me too  We're going to have to get Henry a red suit and a beard here! I sense a conversion in process here  That is the best kind!  I'm less happy with it than I am with a precise number  No, I want a [single] digit  The problem with it is that I think Tony is right The Fed watchers will misinterpret if given any opportunity to do so And I think it gives them a greater opportunity to misinterpret if we say ""around 4 to 5 percent"" in that they will in fact look at that as a range in which we're trying to operate, with a degree of precision that we don't have  No, my objection to it is that I prefer 4 and 9 percent and a willingness to tolerate somewhat higher growth It is easier to draw the path and I just think it works better than your--  I still prefer 4 and 9  Well, I just expressed my preference, but I'm not going to fall on my sword about this  -71-    12/21-22/81  I have great confidence that between you and Mr Axilrod you can make it properly obscure! "
1996,1982-02-01," I'm delighted  Well, we do studies to see what the comparable salaries are out there And when comparable salaries go up, why it's consistent  Can we pursue that for just a minute? I believe it is of some importance to think about the possibility of a real shock, a break of some kind It is difficult for me at this point in time to see a single domestic shock to the system--the kind of thing that really sends a big tremor through the system--of the size of Penn Central in '70 or Bank Herstatt in '74 If International Harvester or if Chrysler goes [belly up], I don't think those would create that kind of shock in the system The paper market seems to be in so much better shape Now, if Ford goes, that would give us considerably more to be concerned about One worries in the international area about all the East European loans and about the condition of the German banks And yet whenever one asks the question the answer always is that [the German authorities] would keep any major German banks from going under They may have a problem So, it certainly is worthwhile to think about where the shocks could be We had, what--about 43,000 corporate bankruptcies in 1981? It seems clear that the number is going to be larger [this] year The order of magnitude is very difficult to forecast, but one would think that the erosion of those balance sheets would cause more difficulties However, it doesn't seem logical that that would provide a shock to the system of the kind that a single traumatic event would Or would you disagree with that? Do you think that the number of bankruptcies    2/1-2/82  could reach such proportions that it could provide major problems to the financial system?  Are you hearing as much of that as you did in late 1974 and early 1975? I'm not, but maybe it's because I still only get a parochial point of view  But think of the deficit that they're assuming [in their forecast]  We were putting in 100,000 [barrels] a day And then didn't they raise it?  Is 120 billion what they're trying for?  I mean million  Was it 57 percent in the fourth quarter?  What was that figure for compensation in the fourth quarter--57 percent or something like that? It was pretty low  I never did get to ask the question Why was it so low? I recognize that there's a lot of volatility in those quarterly figures, but that 57 percent did seem to be quite low Do you think that's an aberration or was that indeed indicative of some real progress?    2/1-2/82  That was First Chicago, though, and that was because they put that 2-point bonus on, wasn't it?  Did you find any other bank that had that kind of percentage increase?  Well, I argued last time for retaining the same targets that we had adopted tentatively I want to come out the same place, having gone through a [lengthy] thinking process in the meantime because of the big jump [in monetary growth] that we got in January Obviously, the question was why and one got very nervous about whether these targets were going to allow us to have anything like the leeway we might need So, I went through the process of taking a long look at what would happen if we shifted the base Should we go to [the average for] December or even the end of December or use November-December-January instead of October-November-December and all that kind of thing? I might tend to opt for some change in the ranges for the aggregates if I had a little stronger feeling that we knew precisely what all these relationships were But it does seem that we have been a bit off in these from time to time in the past All of which seems to me to argue very strongly for a broad family of aggregates and for some fairly wide ranges in each of the aggregates If I had to make a bet, I would bet that whatever we come out with we're going to miss something along the line And, therefore, if I felt it was really critical that we set these targets very precisely and say that absolutely we're going to stay within these ranges for the aggregates in every case, I might feel a little differently But I have some considerable doubts on that score The other side of it is What do we give up?  Well, there's no question about that That's a different subject You know, there is some very good news This is the last time I'm going to be with you and it's very clear that when I came on board things got worse and now that I'm leaving things are bound to get better! So you're going to do better this time than you have before But even under those circumstances, it strikes me that there are some costs in making any changes How big are those costs? I have talked to a lot of market participants and I can't find a single market participant who doesn't feel that it's going to have some impact if we change these targets They will argue differently on how big that impact is going to be But I think that's a vital question here It's not only what we do that's critical but what people think we're doing and what we say we're doing, and that's going    2/1-2/82  to make a heck of a big difference through the year So, I would be perfectly willing to see us take our time getting back to the targets I have a feeling that we probably are going to end up in the upper part of the range for M1, but I really do believe that if we change those targets, there is going to be a cost and I urge you to think carefully about that cost  We ought to put Messrs Morris and Roos in the center of the table and let them go at it!  I don't quite understand this, but I gather that the argument is whether interest rates are the price of money or the price of credit You are arguing that it's the price of money, and I have to agree with that; I think Larry's Reserve Bank would argue that it's the price of credit that's--  But what Henry is trying to say is that if that is because the demand for money increased, then it takes place that way If it's because the supply of money increases, it has quite a different result  Why would we do that if borrowing is already running above $15 billion right now? If we start out setting it at $13 billion, which is a considerable drop from where we are at this point, and even $15 billion is a drop from where we are--  SPEAKER(?) No, it isn't  Yes Borrowing is running--  Between the aim and the actual?  I'm a little confused  Now, wait a minute I don't think ""B"" with a slight tilt toward ""A"" is accurate because that's January to March The Chairman is suggesting zero [M1 growth] from now until the next Committee meeting I think that's a different animal  I'm ready to vote on it, Mr Chairman I don't have anything to add to the discussion I think we've settled in here There seems to be a very general consensus    2/1-2/82  Good common sense We can't have that!  That gives us a little problem There are three of us on the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and I'm leaving  Oh, I see Okay, fine  The world is a little different than it was 25 years ago  But I do agree very much with Tony Solomon that if indeed we do want to be a bit more flexible in the future, then the way to do it is to go ahead and testify--we have the best opportunity we are ever going to have--along the lines that the Chairman has just put forth  Because we say so We say it and that does not--  Well, I'm not sure I agree with that either I still contend that long-term interest rates are the key And they are not going to come down until the deficit comes down I think Governor Gramley is making the assumption that we by monetary policy are going to make these changes in what happens to the economy I do not happen to believe that that is the case because if we give up, then the inflation problem is just going to explode again and the economy will be in terrible shape We are in a box I do not think we have the opportunity to move We have to stay where we are and do our job We cannot control the economy; we cannot control what the Administration does You say, [Nancy], that you are supporting the President It seems to me that the President has to support his program, which he is not doing right now  I disagree with your comments on credibility I think there is an enormous sense out there that we are still the only game in town in the fight against inflation If we do something to change that, we are going to do something very important To me that credibility question is really critical We are right back in the situation we have been in before, particularly now that the    2/1-2/82  President will not do anything about the deficits We are in this uncomfortable, improper, nasty situation that we have to deal with, which is that the central bank of the United States has far more responsibility than it ought to have But the fact of the matter is that we have it because of the way the political system works And this credibility question is just absolutely vital We have not yet changed those inflation expectations because everybody thinks that we are going to cave in to the political pressure that is going to be on us They do not understand all these nuances about demand shifts and linkages and all this other stuff; all they see is that the Fed is the only inflation fighter we have in the country If we give an indication that we are caving in and if we start making some changes, there are some really serious costs in terms of credibility, Paul I think that credibility factor is more important than you just gave it credit for  Well, it could be earlier  I think we have that problem right now, Larry  We have real costs in terms of credibility if we change the targets We ought to change them only if we have good, strong reasons And I disagree with Larry Roos; I think if we have good strong reasons to change them, we are better off changing them in March or April than right now  But I do not believe that at all I just do not believe that the monetary policy that we have carried out has been the sole cause or even the primary cause I think this country was in for some real economic problems Inflation was just shooting up like crazy And I do not think that we can be held responsible for all of this It is clear that if we are going to change inflation, we have to go through a painful period There was never an easy way out of this I refuse to accept the view that monetary policy has to take credit and I do not think it is correct to say that if we change monetary policy, everything is going to get better all of a sudden I just do not believe that that is going to be the case  SPEAKER(?) Hear, hear!  We are always flexible; we just haven't flexed yet  Why don't you have a show of hands?  -101-    2/1-2/82  Yes, everybody has heard enough from me already, and I guess you are going to hear a little more But just to make you feel better, I would remind you that this will be the last day that you will have to do this  I wanted to sing a little swan song today You understand that swans do not sing very prettily but they generally sing a long time, so you will have to indulge me Just remember that I am very shortly going to turn into an ugly duckling!  There are a couple of points that I wanted to make before I leave You people are going to be under a lot of political pressure this year and a lot of outside pressure, and I have a little political advice for you You understand that you have to be careful about political advice from a losing politician, and I fall within that category, but that is not always true It is my belief that over time what is right is the best politics I believe that if you do what is right and you are steadfast and consistent in your policies, the political pressures will ease and you will not be in great danger from them  You are also going to have considerable internal pressures I know I felt enormous internal pressures about whether what we were doing was right and whether what we were doing was the best way to go about it Clearly, there are costs to this technique that we are using; we have all kinds of problems But when the question is asked of me If you were going to do anything differently than you have done over the past 2-1/2 years what would you do? I say that I did not like the credit controls and that I think we might have reacted a little better to the increase in 1980, but I honestly believe that the technique we are using now is considerably better than what we were doing It is like Winston Churchill's comment about democracy being the worst form of government ever devised except for all the others I think the operative question is not whether this technique we are using now is better than some other technique in an ideal world but whether it is better in view of what we have had to face It just seems clear to me that it has enabled us in a time of great volatility to adjust interest rates more quickly and to adjust them far enough to have some market impact I am with Tony Solomon on this I do not know what these linkages are; they are getting looser and the demand shifts are coming more and more often; I don't know what the heck is money; all of these kinds of things are very difficult But the real question is What alternative do we have at this point in time? And it seems to me that what we are doing is the alternative that is best at this point  I read the other day that somebody criticized us for playing to history I would certainly hope that we do indeed have a sense of history It strikes me that with the political system we have in this country and an election every two years, it is impossible to take a long-range view in the political sphere We are the only organization that seems to have the opportunity and the ability to take a long- range view Again, I think the pressures are going to be enormous  -108-    2/1-2/82  because, whatever you do the economy is not just going to get better very quickly And the question that is going to be asked of you is How much pain are you willing to inflict on the economy? I do not happen to think that it is [the Federal Reserve] that has been inflicting the pain on the economy, but that is the question that you are going to get asked And the answer is What is the alternative? If you stop now in this fight against inflation, if you do not carry it through, what kind of pain are you going to inflict on the economy then? It is an issue that just has to be faced and I believe it is a lot easier to face it now and overcome the problem now than it will be later on  Finally, I would urge you to remember that you have a remarkable degree of support out there Nobody is going to love a central bank; and heaven knows, nobody loves high interest rates But the fact is that the Federal Reserve has built up an awful lot of respect out there People in this country want to believe in something and you are about all there is to believe in at this time I think there are a lot of people ready to come to your defense; you have been seeing some comments recently in the news magazines and the newspapers in response to the current criticism A lot of people out there want to support you I think you really do need to try to keep in contact with those people and marshal that support when it becomes necessary, because the fact of the matter is that you are still the only game in town And good luck to you!  It makes no difference to me!  I will be in Hawaii "
