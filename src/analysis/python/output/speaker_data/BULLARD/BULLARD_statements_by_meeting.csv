8224,2008-04-29,"  I am the new guy, but I will just put in my two cents here  Everyone   seems to agree that there is no quantitative impact  I can’t see any quantitative impact  There   are political implications  I don’t see why we are doing it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy of the Eighth District continues   to show signs of weakness  The services sector has continued to soften, and sales of both general   and big box retailers are down from the same period last year  The residential real estate sector has   continued to decline throughout the District  Across major metro areas, sales were about 15 percent   below the level from last year, and single-family permits were down about 30 percent  Employment   growth has slowed and is estimated to have turned negative in March for many areas  Typically,   however, employment growth in the District has been stronger than that for the United States as a   whole  Manufacturing has remained roughly flat, despite temporary shutdowns that have affected   domestic automobile production  Also, commercial real estate construction remains strong, and   April 29–30, 2008 59 of 266    vacancy rates are low; however, there are increases in the number of delayed projects  Banks in the   District are still in good shape, generally speaking  There have been modest increases in total loans   in all categories, including real estate   Contacts in the shipping and trucking industries reported a mixed bag  In some instances,   business seems to be holding up, whereas in others it is down substantially  These businesses are   being critically affected by increases in energy prices  Similarly, a contact in the fast food industry   painted a picture of a business struggling with substantial increases in commodity prices  On the   other hand, a contact in a large technology firm indicated that business is holding up quite well, in   part because a large fraction of this firm’s business is overseas  Contacts in the energy sector   reported robust business prospects, as expected  A contact at a large financial firm suggested that   the discovery process concerning asset-backed securities, which has been ongoing for many months,   has effectively come to a close  The idea that the discovery process—and the considerable   macroeconomic uncertainty that attended that process—is over is an important consideration at this   juncture  My sense is that expectations of future economic performance are changing rapidly  The   probability that the US economy will enter into a debilitating depression-like state has fallen   dramatically     In the meantime, other risks have increased markedly—in particular, that the FOMC will   lose credibility with respect to its inflation goals  The US economy has certainly encountered a   large shock  Monetary policy can mitigate the effects of a large shock but cannot be expected to   completely offset exceptional disturbances  Attempts to do too much may create more and more-  dangerous problems in the future  Best-practice monetary policy would do well, it seems to me, to   avoid setting the stage for future problems     April 29–30, 2008 60 of 266    The problems with the rate structure, which is too low, are threefold  First, there is the risk   of setting up a new bubble  The exceptionally low rates of a few years ago are sometimes cited as   providing fuel for today’s problems  Some have argued that today’s commodity price increases are   exactly that new bubble  Second, continued unabated reductions in interest rates will bring the zero   bound issue into play with unknown consequences  Third, still lower rates will push the envelope   further on inflationary expectations  Those expectations may appear to be reasonably well anchored   today, but that is because the private sector expects us to take actions to keep inflation low and   stable  Should those expectations become unmoored, it will be too late, and an era of higher and   more volatile inflation would be very costly for American households  Much has been done   already  A low rate environment has been created and has been in place only for a short time    Marginal moves at this juncture are minor compared with the general thrust of policy over the last   nine months  The Committee would do much better at this meeting by taking steps to address   eroding credibility  Thank you     It’s related to this     Is it a regime-switching kind of model in which you enter the   recession state—you call it the recession state—and then add-factor down further?       Then, is that calibrated against the 1990–91 recession or the 2001   recession?      Oh, is 1980–82 in there?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The FOMC is badly in need of a stopping   rule on the federal funds rate  Continued reaction to bad economic news—and there is likely to be   bad news in the coming months—is going to set up serious future problems for this Committee    The fragile credibility of the Committee is being eroded as we speak, and we will do well to take   steps to reassert inflation-fighting resolve at this meeting   The intuition in dealing with the current crisis is that we can use new lending facilities to   help return financial markets to more normal operation and that interest rate policy is not that likely   to help on this dimension  But exceptionally low rates can create new problems  Since lower rates   are not really helping directly with the smooth operation of financial markets, I suggest that we put   that on hold for the time being and let our past, stunningly aggressive, interest rate moves have an   effect through the summer and into the second half of the year  This would be consistent with   alternative C in the policy alternatives   Many participants have emphasized that there will be a long unwinding process  The   Chairman described us as being in the third inning on this, similar to the late 1980s and early 1990s    During that episode, the Fed went on hold at 3 percent, considered an exceptionally low rate at the   time  That gave financial markets a chance to heal following the S&L problems without creating   other problems for the mid to late 1990s  In retrospect, this policy worked quite well during that   April 29–30, 2008 122 of 266    era, and it seems to me that something similar could be done today at the current level of the federal   funds rate  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a proposal for study  The timeline   seems fine to me  The study period is pretty important in this case because it is not clear to me   April 29–30, 2008 179 of 266    which option is best, and so I think maybe we should keep more of the options on the table  One   question that I have is, To what extent are current reserve requirements actually binding for   depository institutions?  There is a past study by the St Louis staff—Dick Anderson and Bob   Rasche—suggesting that, by and large, existing reserve requirements are not binding  To me   that calls into question whether objective 1 for this study group is really appropriate  Dead   weight losses make sense to me only if there is a binding reserve requirement  In that regard, I’d   like to endorse President Yellen’s comment, which I thought was right on target, about whether   you are going to make up for lost revenue from somewhere else and how distortionary that   would be  There is a bit of political risk here that, if this starts to get painted as a handout to   banks, maybe it wouldn’t serve us well   I would like to see more emphasis on option 3, which based on the discussion seems to be   not too bad a system  That is the Canadian system  That is a tested system in an economy that is   not too different from our own—certainly, an economy that is closely integrated with this one    The corridor would be narrow  There might be more volatility within that corridor, but you still   seem to get pretty good results  I know they have a small number of banks, but it seems to me   with today’s technology you might be able to get a good read even for a large economy  I would   like to see it kept in the mix here  They have had lots of success and very low administrative   burden, if that is what you are worried about  I am perhaps not so familiar with options 2 and 5,   which are the favored options in this discussion  But I am concerned about the language of   voluntary balance targets, which seem to be maybe not that voluntary  It seems to me to create a   risk that the systems are really not as market-oriented as I would like to see or that they could be   manipulated by market participants, particularly in a time of stress  Those are some of the   concerns I had about this   April 29–30, 2008 180 of 266   "
8252,2008-06-24,"  I want to ask a question about exhibit 7, which talks about factors   affecting the GDP forecast  The second bullet point mentions judgmental adjustments, which were   tempered this time relative to last time  Last time I described this as a regime-switching model, and   you said that was perhaps too much  The economy sort of switches into this recession-like   behavior, and we know that the economy might behave differently in that environment  But do we   now think the probability of switching into that behavior is smaller?  What is the forecast?  Is the   forecast some kind of average between this high state and this low state?  That’s what you said   June 24–25, 2008 28 of 253    here—it has tempered our judgmental adjustments  It sounds as though there is less probability of   switching into that state     But the rationale is that you switch into the recession and you get the   correlations from—     But then you’re switching into the low-growth period, and then we take   the correlations for low-growth periods, which I guess are maybe not as severe as in recession   periods     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The District economy continues to be   sluggish  Severe weather, combined with a very wet spring, is hampering agriculture in some   areas  Major flooding has caused significant damage already, and the situation continues to   develop  Many business contacts in the District emphasize energy costs along with some other   high commodity prices as an overriding concern  Most of the descriptions I have encountered   concern businesses and consumers scrambling to adjust to new pricing realities  Many contacts   June 24–25, 2008 59 of 253    are reporting skittishness over the inflation outlook, fueled by dramatic increases in key   commodity prices  Many contacts with deep experience in the commodities markets remain   convinced that market manipulation or speculation is behind the run-up in commodity prices   across the board over the past several years  This belief is widespread and deeply held  Many   predict a crash in market prices of these commodities once the bubble bursts  My assessment is   that this very strong belief may, by itself, have important macroeconomic implications    Businesses and households may be reacting very differently to price increases that they see as   temporary, as opposed to their reaction if they view price increases as permanent and unlikely to   reverse   Reports on the level of economic activity are decidedly mixed  The housing sector   remains in a deep slump and subject to a widespread shakeup  Business in the energy sector   continues to boom  High energy prices are affecting the logistics business, which has to try to be   profitable at higher prices with reduced demand  Still, a very large retailer reports brisk activity,   and a large technology firm is essentially unaffected by the macroeconomic slowdown  Recent   data on the US economy have been stronger than forecast, keeping economic performance weak   but avoiding a particularly sharp contraction  The worst outcomes stemming from financial   market turmoil have failed to materialize thus far  There is, to be sure, still some potential for   additional upheaval, depending in part on the managerial agility among key financial firms    However, the US economy is now much better positioned to handle financial market turmoil   than it was six months ago  This is due to the lending facilities now in place and to the   environment of low interest rates that has been created  Renewed financial market turmoil,   should it occur during the summer or fall, would not now be as worrisome from a systemic risk   perspective  In addition to this lessened risk from financial markets, I see the drag from housing   June 24–25, 2008 60 of 253    dissipating during the second half of the year  Most likely we will also see a moderation in   energy price increases  Output growth is, therefore, likely to be moderately stronger going   forward   Policy was very aggressive during January and March of this year  This was, in part, a   preemptive action, insurance against a particularly severe downturn brought on by financial   contagion  This was a very real possibility, but it did not materialize  This has created a   situation with more stimulus in train than would have been intended had we known the outcome   in advance  This is putting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations in the second   half of this year  Policy has to turn now to face this situation   On the long-term projections, I think it is a good idea to put down long-term projections    I am happy with any of the options  I have a slight preference for option 3  I think a trial run   would be good  If the objective is to name these numbers, such as an inflation target or the   potential growth of the economy, another way to do it would just be to name those numbers and   not have it tied to any projection or any particular year  We could just say, “This is what I think   the inflation objectives should be  This is how fast I think the economy could grow in the   absence of shocks  And this is what I think the unemployment rate would be if output were   growing at potential and inflation were at target”  You could just name those numbers  You   wouldn’t have to say five years away or ten years away, which kind of brings in new long-run   factors that you might not want to get into  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  US economic data have been stronger   than expected during the intermeeting period  The earlier, very aggressive moves in January and   March taken by the FOMC were viewed in part as insurance against the possibility of a very   serious downturn brought on by financial market turmoil  That very serious downturn has not   materialized  Tail risk has diminished significantly  This means that this Committee has put too   much economic stimulus on the table and must think about ways to remove it going forward    Failure to do so will create a significant inflation problem on top of problems in housing and   financial markets  Slack might be helpful, as mentioned by Governor Kohn, but those effects are   small compared with expectations effects  I think it is too early to tighten at this meeting    Therefore, I am supporting alternative B with the language proposed by President Plosser  But   the Committee has to think carefully about how and when to embark on a path for interest rates   that will set us up to achieve price stability in a reasonable time frame  My sense is that this will   require more-aggressive tightening of policy than currently envisioned in staff simulations   Financial market problems have been described here as a slow burn, and I think that may   well be an apt description  Many firms in this sector took on too much risk and, in retrospect,   had poor business models  I expect that this will take a long time to unwind  Despite this, the   systemic risk component of the situation has diminished considerably  Systemic risk is in part a   function of the degree of surprise in the failure of a financial institution that was perceived to be   in good health  Surely by now few market participants would be surprised to encounter the   failure of certain institutions  Failures, should they occur, can be handled in an orderly way    June 24–25, 2008 120 of 253    Certain investors would lose out in such an event, to be sure, but my sense is that the panic   element that would be associated with systemic risk would not be present  I believe that we   should start to downweight systemic risk concerns substantially going forward because it is no   longer credible to say that market participants are surprised to learn of problems at certain   financial institutions  Thank you     Yes, I just have a few comments  In reading through this memo and   hearing the presentation this morning, I think that these are fantastic questions  They deserve a   lot of research and analysis  Just to echo Vice Chairman Geithner, they cannot easily be   answered in a forum like this one  What is happening is that we start out looking at these   questions, which just spawn more and more questions; so we end up with an even longer list of   questions  The short-term strategy seems perfectly reasonable, somehow tied to an exit strategy   maybe next year  So I didn’t have any problems with that as outlined by the Chairman     When we get down to approaching a more detailed analysis of what we want to do   overall, it brings up very difficult questions of what the optimal regulatory environment is  I   think that we all think the regulatory environment in the United States is not optimal right now    Also, in a world of increasing globalization, it is not so clear how you should set up your   regulatory structure  This is a once-in-a-generation chance to possibly reformulate the regulatory   structure  I wouldn’t hold my breath on that  I think the Congress does not have a great record   of dealing with issues like this  These issues are complicated, and it is very hard to get   agreement on them  But you would like to have a benchmark  I think that one is out there in the   June 24–25, 2008 172 of 253    economics literature about what that environment should look like  That is what we could   possibly work on over the next nine months or so   Then I have another comment  When we are evaluating these programs, we have to think   about whether these programs have been effective and to what extent  How do we measure   success?  One of the comments earlier was that the mere existence of the programs might be   success in some sense  In a model, that is going to work  Even if you take it out of existence,   because the market knows it’s there and you can put it back into existence in the future, it will   have exactly the same effect  Whether or not you have the program in place, the equilibrium is   going to be the same in a lot of models, so the effects would still be there  If it is just the   potential of putting the program in place that is considered successful, then maybe it is not   critical whether it is in place but priced not to be used or whether it is actually taken out of   existence temporarily   "
8278,2008-07-24,"  Mr Chairman, I am going to have to leave the call, and I just want to say   before I go that I think a lot of good questions have been raised here, and I just wouldn’t rush into   this  I think the 84-day term seems to be long in this environment of troubled banks; and frankly, it   is not very clear that either of these proposals is really going to buy us a lot  I am also sensitive to   the announcement effects, and I am not quite sure what the announcement effects would be  So I   would prefer to think about it longer before we go ahead and approve this  Thanks  "
8299,2008-08-05,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m just following up here  I mean, as   much as I love exhibits 14, 15, and 16—and I have used a lot of them myself when I talk about   the economy—it is not really appropriate to look at these as measures of stress  You could just   say that these are the equilibrium prices in an economy that is adjusting to a big shock  You   could have a completely flat line here that would indicate stress in markets because these prices   August 5, 2008 12 of 145    aren’t moving around appropriately to the risks that have developed and opened up  So a lot of   the concern around the table has been exactly that, when markets freeze up, you can’t do any   trade at any price; and for that the volume data would seem to be a much better indicator of the   kinds of things that we are worried about  I think that this is conditioning a lot of our thinking   about the economy—you look at this picture, and you naturally think it has to go back to 10 basis   points before the crisis is over  That probably is not going to happen anytime soon and maybe   never  Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Eighth District has   remained roughly stable during the summer  Activity in the services sector has increased slightly,   and except for the auto industry, manufacturing activity is also stable to slightly higher  Automotive   contacts reported a variety of plans to lay off workers or to idle production, and at least three   automotive parts suppliers will close plants in the District  Contacts in the auto industry are not   optimistic that production will increase in the short term  Retail and auto sales have softened in   recent weeks, and some District retail contacts have expressed concerns about summer sales  Many   contacts continue to emphasize commodity price levels as a key factor in business decisions  They   August 5, 2008 49 of 145    are concerned both about the necessary business adjustments, given the new pricing structure, and   about the implications for the overall level of inflation going forward   The residential real estate sector continues to decline  Across four of the main metropolitan   areas in the District, home sales through May declined about 18 percent compared with 2007,   whereas single-family construction permits declined about 40 percent  The number of foreclosures   in the St Louis area in the second quarter increased to about 6,300 filings, up about 77 percent from   last year  I am impressed, however, with the regionalism in the foreclosure situation, as some areas   of the nation continue to have far higher foreclosure rates than others  In contrast with the generally   positive reports in commercial real estate activity for the earlier part of 2008, recent reports have   indicated more uneven conditions in the nonresidential real estate sector across the District   Turning to the national outlook, I was encouraged by the recent GDP report for the second   quarter, which showed growth at an annual rate of 19 percent  Real final sales increased at an   annual rate of 39 percent  It now appears that the worst quarter associated with the current episode   of financial turmoil was probably the fourth quarter of 2007, when the economy abruptly stalled    The slow- or no-growth period was through the winter, with the economy gradually regaining   footing through the spring and summer  If there were no further shocks, I would expect the   economy to grow at a more rapid rate in the second half of this year  But there has been another   shock—namely, substantial increases in commodity and energy prices  I think it’s important to be   careful not to confuse the effects of this latter shock with the effects of the housing-sector shock   My sense is that the level of systemic risk associated with financial turmoil has fallen   dramatically  For this reason, I think the FOMC should begin to de-emphasize systemic risk   worries  My reasoning is as follows  Systemic risk means that the sudden failure of a particular   financial firm would so shock other ostensibly healthy firms in the industry that it would put them   August 5, 2008 50 of 145    out of business at the same time  The simultaneous departure of many firms would badly damage   the financial services industry, causing a substantial decline in economic activity for the entire   economy  This story depends critically on the idea that the initial failure is sudden and unexpected   by the healthy firms in the industry  But why should this be, once the crisis has been ongoing for   some time?  Are the firms asleep?  Did they not realize that they may be doing business with a firm   that may be about to default on its obligations?  Are they not demanding risk premiums to   compensate them for exactly this possibility?  My sense is that, because the turmoil has been   ongoing for some time, all of the major players have made adjustments as best they can to contain   the fallout from the failure of another firm in the industry  They have done this not out of   benevolence but out of their own instincts for self-preservation  As one of my contacts at a large   bank described it, the discovery process is clearly over  I say that the level of systemic risk has   dropped dramatically and possibly to zero   Let me stress that, to be sure, there are some financial firms that are in trouble and that may   fail in the coming months or weeks depending on how nimble their managements are at keeping   them afloat  This is why many interest rate spreads remain elevated and may be expected to remain   elevated for some time  These spreads are entirely appropriate for a financial system reacting to a   large shock  But at this point, failures of certain financial firms should not be regarded as so   surprising that they will cause ostensibly healthy firms to fail along with them  The period of   substantial systemic risk has passed  Of course, we have also endured a bout of systemic risk   worries stemming from the operations of the GSEs  However, my view is that the recent legislation   has addressed the systemic risk component of that situation as well  Because of these   considerations, my assessment is that the chances of unchecked systemic risk pushing the US   economy into a severe downturn at this point are small, no larger than in ordinary times    August 5, 2008 51 of 145     Unfortunately, while the threat from this source is retreating, another threat is upon us—  namely, a substantial shock from increased energy and certain commodities prices, which is leading   many to forecast slower growth during the fall  Real automotive output subtracted 11 percentage   points from real GDP growth in the second quarter  Many contacts seem to attribute this largely to   consumer reaction to increased gasoline prices  If this is true, then it seems to me that some of the   most visible reaction to this shock may have already occurred, being pulled forward into the second   quarter   Labor markets have been weak, but I am not as pessimistic as most on this dimension  So   far this year, the US economy has shed about 387,000 nonfarm payroll jobs as compared with a   drop in employment of 402,000 jobs during the first seven months of 2003 or 315,000 during the   first seven months of 2002  Neither of these latter two episodes is associated with the recession   label  These two years might provide better historical guides to the behavior of today’s economy   than those associated with the recession label, such as 2001, 1990–91 or 1980–82  This is one   reason that I think the labeling game can mislead us in our thinking about the economy   The main contribution that the FOMC can make to the economy is to keep inflation low and   stable  The headline CPI inflation rate is running close to 5 percent measured from one year earlier    The University of Michigan survey of inflation expectations one year ahead reflects this reality with   the most recent reading at 5¼ percent  The June CPI annualized inflation rate was a 1970s-  sounding 134 percent  Of course, much of this is due to energy prices  Still, with these kinds of   numbers we’re going to have to do more than talk about inflation risks  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to make my remarks a little   shorter here  My judgment is that the current situation is a difficult one for the Committee    Because of the very appropriate focus on financial market turmoil over the past year, our   attention has naturally turned away from keeping the level of interest rates consistent with   longer-term inflation objectives  This was done to avert particularly extreme, but low   probability, outcomes in which the economy would experience an especially severe downturn    As it turned out, the bad state did not materialize, which I think will go down in history as a   successful element of the Committee’s policy over the past year  The ability to take on financial   market turmoil of this magnitude and prevent it from doing substantial damage to the economy—  a recession of the magnitude of 1980-82, let’s say—has been a real achievement  In that sense,   all has gone according to plan  At the same time, we have moved interest rates to a very low   level in the context of rising inflation and rising inflation expectations  A severe downturn was   unwelcome, to be sure, but it was also projected to keep inflation in check  Since that did not   materialize, we are left with low rates and an environment of CPI inflation running at 5 percent   headline, measured from one year earlier, and long-term inflation expectations creeping higher    We face more risk now of creating a serious inflation problem than we have in a generation     To make progress, I think we should keep rates steady today but with the plan of   preparing markets for an increase in rates at the September meeting, conditional of course on   incoming data  This would be consistent with alternative B today; and with intermeeting   statements, it would move probability mass toward higher rates through the fall and through the   first half of 2009  I have several remarks on a fall tightening campaign  First of all, moving   25 basis points is by itself not likely to have a large effect on economic activity, nor does it bring the   August 5, 2008 110 of 145    level of the federal funds rate high enough to have a meaningful effect on inflation  The FOMC   started tightening in mid-2004 but achieved a core CPI inflation rate below 2 percent in only one   month during the entire three-year period of 2005, 2006, and 2007  What the move would do is get   the Committee started on returning interest rates to a more normal level, a level more consistent   with our inflation objectives  The Committee could pause or even reverse course should   particularly adverse data suggest that economic activity was weakening substantially  Preparing for   an increase in rates means that we would be signaling that financial market turmoil is no longer the   paramount concern  On that, I think we can reasonably stress that we have provided   accommodation over the past year in the form of lower interest rates and innovative liquidity   facilities  We have bought time for financial firms to repair and adjust  While all is not as it was,   we do not want to create an inflation problem in the aftermath of a shock of this magnitude, which   may actually compound the situation and make it worse   Longer-term inflation expectations have been creeping higher, a fact that has been widely   cited in commentary on monetary policy  I would like to stress that, in my view of a well-  functioning inflation-targeting regime, these inflation expectations would not be moving at all    Short-term interest rates would be moving higher and lower in response to shocks to the economy,   and inflation expectations would never move  This would reflect the confidence that the central   bank’s short-term interest rate adjustments were being accomplished in just the right way to offset   disturbances buffeting the economy  Because of this, I prefer not to interpret observed movements   in inflation expectations as evidence of what we should or should not do with respect to interest   rates  The short-term interest rate would have to move to offset the shocks to the economy even if   longer-term inflation expectations never moved  Thank you  "
8324,2008-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to start with the national   economy in the interest of brevity here  Concerning the national outlook, it is difficult and   probably unwise to try to assess growth and inflation prospects in the immediate aftermath of an   event like the Lehman bankruptcy  I expect to see more failures among financial firms, and I   expect those failures to continue to contribute to market volatility  This is part of an ongoing   shakeout among financial market firms, following some of the worst risk management in a   generation  I expect sluggish growth in the second half of 2008, in part due to labor markets that   are somewhat weaker than expected  Financial market turmoil is certainly a key concern, but the   US economy still outperformed expectations in the first half of 2008, despite the demise of Bear   Stearns—an event not too different in some respects from the current episode   My sense is that three large uncertainties looming over the economy have now been   resolved—the GSEs and the fates of Lehman and Merrill Lynch  Of these, the resolution of GSE   uncertainty seems to be the most pivotal, even though it is not the one leading the news today    Normally, the elimination of key uncertainties is a plus for the economy  As is typical in this   type of situation, safe interest rates have fallen dramatically across the board   A second macroeconomic shock stemming from the dramatic rise in oil and other   commodities prices has been an unwelcome development during the past six months  The retreat   September 16, 2008 35 of 108    of West Texas intermediate prices to $94 a barrel, and today down to $92 a barrel, should   improve second-half growth prospects   Meanwhile, an inflation problem is brewing  The headline CPI inflation rate, the one   consumers actually face, is about 6¼ percent year-to-date  That does not include today’s report    This is against the federal funds target of 2 percent  While it makes sense to focus on financial   markets for the time being, it is essential that we keep in position to put downward pressure on   inflation going forward  The financial crisis threatens to roll on for such a long time and to   demand so much attention that the private sector may rationally conclude that we have lost all   sight of our inflation objective  In such a case of unmoored expectations, outcomes could be far   more severe than those envisioned in the Greenbook   My policy preference is to maintain the federal funds rate target at the current level and to   wait for some time to assess the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, if any, on the national   economy  In uncertain circumstances like these, I think it would be unwise to react too hastily to   a fluid situation  Any immediate effects may not be the ones that are intended, and further down   the line—that is, once more data have accumulated—a hasty action may leave the Committee out   of position relative to the incoming data  By denying funding to Lehman suitors, the Fed has   begun to reestablish the idea that markets should not expect help at each difficult juncture    Changing rates today would confuse that important signal and take out much of the positive part   out of the previous decision  In addition, a rate move would be poorly targeted toward   mitigation of difficulties at particular financial firms  The FOMC has already done a great deal   to create a low interest rate environment in order to shepherd the economy through a substantial   shock to the financial and housing sectors  The Committee now needs to allow the financial   September 16, 2008 36 of 108    sector shakeout to occur using liquidity facilities to the extent possible to help navigate the   resulting turbulence  Thank you  "
8382,2008-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Bluebook here, it says, “Additionally,   the Swiss National Bank announced plans to draw on its swap line to help finance up to $60 billion   in purchases of assets from a major Swiss bank”  So is that really what you have in mind here for a   country like Brazil—that they’ll draw on their swap line to purchase assets from banks?     Well, if you think that there are systemically important institutions in   these countries, why not?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Eighth District   have deteriorated since the September Beige Book  Citing weak demand and higher input costs, a   variety of manufacturing firms throughout the District reported job cuts and plant closings  The   decline in manufacturing activity has been concentrated in firms producing durable goods  Service   sector activity also continues to decline  In particular, recent layoffs have been reported in business,   medical, and financial services  Two large auto dealers have closed and filed for bankruptcy  Retail   sales are steady, but contacts have noticed that consumers are trading down to lower-priced   products  The residential real estate sector continues to decline across the District  As lending   standards have tightened for commercial building projects, industrial construction has slowed   Payroll employment numbers continue to vary across the Bank’s Branch cities  The most   recent figures suggest that Memphis and St Louis continue to lose jobs at a pace faster than at the   national level  Louisville has moved from two consecutive months of positive year-over-year   employment growth to negative growth in the most recent month  Little Rock continues to   experience positive year-over-year employment growth  Unemployment rates in St Louis and   Memphis remain above 7 percent—that’s 72 percent and 71 percent, respectively  Louisville’s   unemployment rate is 66 percent  In opposition to the national trend, Little Rock’s unemployment   rate has fallen to just 4 percent   The national outlook is clouded by dramatically increased uncertainty fueled by the financial   market turmoil  The explosion of uncertainty is driven in part by speculation about the nature of the   government response to the turmoil, both in the United States and abroad  We know from past   October 28–29, 2008 90 of 206    experience that, when economic actors—investors, businesses, and consumers—are faced with new   and substantial uncertainty, they tend to adopt a “wait and see” approach, during which they make   as few commitments as possible  This seems to be a reasonable expectation in the current   environment, so we should expect to see many types of important economic decisions being   deferred  Anecdotal evidence seems to support this idea  Most likely, this means we will   experience an important deterioration in economic activity during the second half of 2008 and into   2009   In times of increased uncertainty, it can be useful to consider distinct alternative scenarios   instead of considering a baseline scenario with many possible offshoots  The financial sector crisis   that we are experiencing has some admittedly inexact parallels with the banking crises that occurred   in Japan since 1990 and in the Nordic countries in the early 1990s  The general tenor of the   literature on these events is that the Nordic countries dealt forthrightly with their financial sector   problems, suffered through recessions, but were well positioned to grow once the crisis had been   addressed  For Japan, real economic performance was subpar for a long time, and it is the Japanese   outcome that is a looming risk for the US economy  Part of the Japanese experience was the   lowering of nominal interest rates to zero  This was done, no doubt, in the name of doing   everything possible to help the economy recover  It was not very successful and, in fact, may have   been counterproductive   Recent academic work—I’m thinking of Jess Benhabib here—has emphasized the   possibility of a low nominal interest rate, low inflation rate, steady state equilibrium, and a trap at   very low or zero nominal interest rates  This steady state coexists with the targeted steady state, the   one we know and love, which has inflation at our specified target and relatively high nominal   interest rates  So there are two possible focal points for the economy  Markets clear at both of these   October 28–29, 2008 91 of 206    focal points  My main concern is that if we choose to continue to flirt with the trap steady state, we   should think clearly about the possible implications given the current environment  The trap steady   state is associated with very low inflation expectations, actually deflation  This is, in fact, what   happened to Japan  They experienced deflation of about 1 percent for a number of years  Since our   core problems are in the housing market, which is dominated by nominal contracting, deflation   could sharply exacerbate our problems and lead to further difficulties  I am, frankly, not sure that   this is a wise route for the Committee or for the nation  My preferred approach would be to   maintain rates at the current low level and to use alternative fiscal policy actions to address the   particular concerns in financial markets  Thank you     I do have a handout   8  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess before I start, I just want to say   that I generally agree with everything everyone is saying  This is a dire situation, and I am   perfectly comfortable with that assessment  What I want to do with my comment here is just put   on the table one idea about why a rate reduction might be counterproductive  That is what I’m   trying to do here     The US economy now appears to be in recession  Intensified financial market turmoil   and very fluid expectations have created a very difficult situation  A key question for the   Committee is what to do with the monetary policy piece of the policy response to the situation    We know that monetary policy is a blunt instrument that does not directly address fundamental   problems in financial markets  We have other programs in place to try to address those problems   more directly  We also have important fiscal actions, which are probably having the largest   effect in trying to stabilize the current situation  Unlike the ECB, we already lowered nominal   interest rates aggressively earlier this year in anticipation of the possibility of weak   macroeconomic performance  We are now in the middle of a further round of easing, which is   threatening to send nominal interest rates to zero, given the force of events   Is this the optimal policy, or could it backfire on the Committee?  I want to at least lay   out the possibility that a very low nominal interest rate policy may be counterproductive  My   key worry is that housing markets remain at the core of the current turmoil  Mortgage markets—                                                   8 The materials used by Mr Bullard are attached to this transcript (appendix 8)   October 28–29, 2008 132 of 206    $14 trillion or so, about one GDP—are based on nominal contracts  Deflation tends to be very   destructive in an environment of nominal contracting  I want to stress that macroeconomic   expectations are very important for the way the economy actually evolves and will evolve going   forward and that those expectations are very fluid in the current environment  The Japanese   experience, while it is not an exact parallel, represents an important reference point for the   current situation  Japan’s problems were very real  Some have described the outcome as a lost   decade   So let’s turn to the graph here for just a second  This is what I was talking about   yesterday  This is an argument put forward by Jess Benhabib, Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé, and   Martín Uribe  On the vertical axis is the nominal interest rate  On the horizontal axis are the   inflation rate and inflation expectations, which in this graph are going to be the same thing  The   diagonal line labeled “Fisher” is just a Fisher relationship  The nominal interest rate is the real   interest rate, r, plus inflation expectations  Then policy is described by the line with the kink in   it  The policy line means that, when medium-term inflation expectations are above target, we   raise the nominal interest rate and, when medium-term inflation expectations are below target,   we lower the nominal interest rate  That works beautifully around the targeted equilibrium, the   π* in this environment, and all goes well  It’s just that, when you go to low nominal interest   rates, strange things start to happen because you have to do something with policy as you come   to very low nominal interest rates  You could just go to zero, and then you would have the   horizontal line labeled “policy” that would go across all the way to the minus r there  Or you   could stop at some earlier level  I chose something here to illustrate what the Greenbook seems   to have in mind, say ½ percent   October 28–29, 2008 133 of 206    But any way you cut it, this is going to create another crossing of the Fisher relation and   create a second steady state  This is the main point of the Benhabib analysis  You can layer on   top all kinds of other stuff that you would like to include in your model, but most models are   going to have a Fisher relationship, and most models are going to have the policymaker reacting   by adjusting the nominal interest rate  So this other steady state, the steady state with low   nominal interest rates, has deflation  If you get stuck there, in our current environment, this   would exacerbate the housing problem a lot and make our problems much more severe  So this   is just one caution about going to a very low nominal interest rate environment  When I saw this   six or seven years ago, it had some influence on me  Before this, I was not worried about any of   the zero bound issues  But then, this does make me a little nervous, given the core problem in   our situation, which is the housing problem  That’s the argument  So let me set that aside then   One thing this line of research pointed out—and a whole bunch of papers have been   written since this paper—is the existence of this second steady state and that the deflation   associated with the trap steady state is a worrisome phenomenon  There are two steady states   here  You can just argue that you don’t think the lower one is going to be the one the economy   coordinates on and that eventually we are going to go back to the high one and that is perfectly   fine  However, the Japanese case seemed to be zero nominal interest rates and a moderately low   rate of deflation for quite some time  You could say that, if we coordinate on this low nominal   interest rate steady state, we can somehow take fiscal policy actions to move off that to the other   steady state  That is a more complicated issue  That has been addressed in the literature, and   that is also a reasonable thing to say  I guess my main concern about this is, since it is a very   dire situation and I think we are going to go very close to zero very soon, I want us to do it with   October 28–29, 2008 134 of 206    our eyes open  It has some possibility of creating a worse environment  That is the only thing I   wanted to say here   So my preference based on this would be to leave rates alone and say, “Let’s use fiscal   policy”  I don’t think what we have now is an interest rate problem  What we have now are   problems in credit markets, and I think they are being fairly well addressed by the most recent   fiscal actions, including capital injections into the banking sector  So that would be my   preference at this point  "
8409,2008-12-15,"  At the beginning of your comments, you said that you expected further   big mark-to-market losses  Do you mean over and above what markets anticipate now?     You cited that Goldman number of $2 billion, but that’s been widely   reported     Then I just want to understand—on exhibit 2 you said something about a   fully discounted default rate last seen in the Great Depression  What did you mean by that?     Do we know?  Was there something like a junk market in the Great   Depression that we can compare this with?     I just want to follow up on that  Would you say that that represents a   tremendous amount of pessimism out there, or are you saying that you think we’re going to get   default rates like the Great Depression?   December 15–16, 2008 13 of 284      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to thank the staff for preparing   these memos  They are very stimulating, a great discussion of a very difficult topic, and I know   it was a lot of work  I also want to agree with the Chairman that all comments in this arena are   in the spirit of optimal monetary policy, which is the only way I would make any comments here   at the table  What is the best policy?  What will get the economy back on track soonest?  That is   always what we are trying to think about here  The truth is that there are lots of ways that you   might think about what the optimal policy is, so that is what the debate is about   Let me begin with the first part of the memo asking for comments saying whether we   should go quickly or gradually to zero  I think the most important element is somehow to switch   away from nominal interest rate targeting once the target approaches zero because at that point   December 15–16, 2008 47 of 284    the target just ceases to make any sense and you leave the private sector in the dark about any   signals that they might be receiving about where the Committee intends inflation and monetary   policy more generally to be going forward  To go quickly to zero is effectively what we have   already done with respect to the federal funds rate, at least in terms of the actual federal funds   rate, and if I am reading the Greenbook appropriately, according to the staff Greenbook forecast,   it is evidently not going to help very much going forward  I think we did go to zero fairly   quickly here   I do not find the Reifschneider–Williams paper, which I know carries some weight   around here, very compelling, so let me give the brief reasons behind that  For one thing, you   are taking a model and you are extrapolating far outside the experience on which the model is   based  That might be a first pass, but that is probably not a good way to make policy, and I   wouldn’t base policy on something like that  There are also important nonlinearities  This   whole debate is about nonlinearities as you get to the zero bound, and in my view, they are not   taken into account appropriately in this analysis  You have households and businesses that are   going to understand very well that there is a zero bound  It has been widely discussed for the   past year  They are going to take this into account when they are making their decisions, so you   have to incorporate that into the analysis  That is a tall order—there are papers around that try to   do that, and many other assumptions have to go into that   The third thing I think is important is that, in other contexts, gradualism or policy inertia   is actually celebrated as an important part of a successful, optimal monetary policy  Mike   Woodford, in particular, has papers on optimal monetary policy inertia, and many others have   worked on it  In those papers, it is all about making your actions gradual and making sure that   they convey some benefit to the equilibrium that you will get  All of a sudden, in this particular   December 15–16, 2008 48 of 284    analysis, when you are facing a zero bound, that goes out the window, and I don’t think that it is   taken into account appropriately in the analysis  Also, it is thrown out the window exactly at a   time when you might think that the inertia and the gradualism are most important, which would   be in time of crisis when you want to steer the ship in a steady way  So I think that we have a   long way to go to understand exactly how to behave near a zero bound, and I would not make   policy based on that particular analysis or the subsequent work  But as I stated at the beginning,   I think it is a moot point anyway because the effective fed funds rate is trading near zero  We are   there  We have arrived   Does the zero bound impose significant costs on financial institutions?  In general, to this   I would say “no,” as the markets can adjust  More important, markets should be expected to   adjust to the optimal monetary policy that we set  We are not in the business of keeping   particular markets working in the particular ways that they have worked in the past  I don’t want   to disrupt things so rapidly that we upset the apple cart  On the other hand, I think the attitude   should be that, given enough time, we should expect markets to adjust appropriately  I guess that   is what I think about that issue of going quickly or not   We talked for a minute about communication strategies  Three were mentioned in the   memo  The first was to hold the federal funds rate at zero until specified conditions obtain  The   second one was the FOMC will act to counter inflation below target, and the third one was to   accept higher inflation later  In general, I think that the communication idea is important and   valuable to think about in this situation  This is because it plays to the rational expectations,   forward-looking aspect of the behavior of households and businesses  My sense is that the   benchmark forecasting models embodied in the Greenbook or in a prominent private-sector   forecast such as Macroeconomic Advisers may understate these kinds of effects because they   December 15–16, 2008 49 of 284    don’t completely incorporate the forward-looking elements probably as much as we would like    That is because it is very difficult to do   So I think that the communication thing is the right idea  But I do not think that   communicating that we intend to hold the federal funds rate at zero until specified conditions   obtain will have much effect because the market already expects that we will maintain the rate at   zero until conditions improve  That strikes me as a way of saying that we have hit our constraint,   we are bound by our constraint, and so we are effectively doing nothing further  I wouldn’t want   to get into that kind of message in the communication game, and the communication game is a   tricky one  If we went that route, I think deflation would develop  The economy would become   mired in a deflationary trap similar to Japan’s, which I illustrated last time  In general, my   feeling is that understanding the Japanese situation as something like a steady state is more how   we need to think of it  In a steady state, the markets are clearing, the expectations are consistent   with outcomes, and there is no pretense of returning to the previous situation unless you   eliminate that steady state or somehow shock the system out of that steady state  In Japan the   policy rate has not been above 1 percent for fourteen years  Fourteen years!  That starts to sound   to me as though the best way to think about this is that there may be multiple steady states out   there, and you may be at risk that the dynamics will send you to the deflationary trap   Our understanding about the dynamics of those—I know because I have worked on them   myself—is very poor  Exactly how they would work and how you would get coordination on   one versus the other is a very difficult question  That research is in its infancy  But the concept   that you might think about the possibilities in the situation as being multiple steady states should   perhaps be entertained more seriously around the table here   December 15–16, 2008 50 of 284    It is much better to say, as far as a communication strategy, that we are constrained on   interest rates and therefore we are switching to something else  I think a monetary base,   reserves, or some kind of quantity measure would be fine  The reason you want to do this is that   you want to remind the private sector that we control inflation and that we intend to keep   inflation close to our target  This is a way to tell a story about how you are going to do that—a   way to signal to the private sector  So to get the intended effect in the minds of the private   sector, you eliminate references to the federal funds target and force them to rethink their views   of monetary policy and rethink what we are doing  Of course, this has to be done in a reasonable   way  It can’t be done in a willy-nilly way  Also, all the issues that have ever come up around   this table about monetary targeting and reserves and all the difficulties with that would come up   again  But I think it is a great way to make the switch, much as Volcker did in 1979, and get the   private sector to reorient to the new reality   So, yes, it is very important to stress that we will counter inflation below target—I guess   that is the second part of this question—and the idea of, well, you could say we are going to   accept higher inflation later, perhaps much later  Although being a theory guy I like that because   you are playing on rational expectations, it doesn’t seem as credible to me with the private   sector  The way we are looking at it now, you would be talking far into the future, promising   some more inflation—you know, in 2013 we will do 5 percent or something like that  It just   seems too far away to have a lot of effect on our situation right now   Let me talk briefly about purchases of agencies and longer-term Treasuries  In general, I   think this is okay, but I do not think we should expect a lot of impact from this  I think the effect   will be marginal  I might remind the Committee that the famous Operation Twist from the 1960s   was generally judged to be ineffective, and that is why I think the central banks did not,   December 15–16, 2008 51 of 284    generally speaking, play games on the yield curve in the past  I guess I would prefer agencies to   the longer-term Treasuries because of the more direct correlation with the mortgage markets  I   think that might help our case a little in this current situation, but I wouldn’t expect a lot out of   that policy   Expansion of 13(3) credit backstops—I see this as likely, the way policy is going  I think   it is helpful in some circumstances  I would like to see us work harder, maybe much harder, on   the metrics for success of these facilities and perhaps rework or discontinue facilities that may   not be meeting expectations  We saw some justification here earlier in the report by Bill Dudley,   which I interpret as saying that the goal is to reduce risk premiums from what markets say they   should otherwise be  Frankly, I am not sure in all cases what the purpose of the programs is  We   have a lot of them out there  We have ideas  We should quantify that  We should be assessing,   and then we should turn around and say, “This one is working  This one is not working”  I   would like to see a lot more in that direction  I understand that we haven’t done it so far because,   obviously, we are running on all cylinders  We are fighting very hard here  But going forward,   that is something we should be thinking about   Our other nonstandard tools are useful  Again, I think we need to reestablish with the   private sector that the central bank controls the medium-term inflation rate, even in environments   where the nominal interest rate is zero  A simple way to communicate this is to start talking   more about reserves, the monetary base, and the monetary aggregates  Again, this has to be done   in a reasonable way  We understand that taking out a program is going to change things, and we   need to communicate that effectively  We understand that the links between money growth and   inflation may not be exactly what we would like them to be, but this is the situation we are in   December 15–16, 2008 52 of 284    because our interest rate channel has turned off  So in normal times, I would prefer to   communicate in terms of interest rates, but that is not the situation that we are in right now   Let me talk a bit about the directive to the Desk  In my opinion, the directive should be   in terms of the quantity of reserves, letting the level of the federal funds rate trade as necessary—  again, not unlike the Volcker situation  Presumably, the federal funds rate would trade close to   zero on average  The prescription to express the directive in terms of reserve quantities has a   long tradition here on the Committee  That language was used at least through 1994, if I have it   correct  I remember when I was first in the Federal Reserve System we would talk about the   degree of pressure on reserve positions, and so there is ample precedent inside the System to   work this way  I think that would keep everything working smoothly in terms of governance  I   see no reason not to go in that direction   The introduction of new programs that are intended to have a minimal effect on the level   of reserves, as occurred before September of this year, would not interfere with the reserves   objective of the Committee  Others do interfere with that objective, and in that case they would   need to be approved here  But my sense of the Committee here, though I can’t speak for   everybody, is that I don’t think we would have any pushback on that, and we would keep the   governance thing very clear if we did it that way  So that would be my preference  I agree with   the Chairman that we want the best policy  We want to work in a cooperative manner, and I   think that is one way to do it here   When the market turmoil abates, then we should begin setting target ranges for reserves   or monetary base growth  Once the crisis is past, then we can begin setting a federal funds target   again, maybe coming back with a range initially for the federal funds rate and then gradually   December 15–16, 2008 53 of 284    moving back into the targeting regime, which I agree in normal times is a much better way to   communicate policy   Let me talk just for thirty seconds on the communication of alternative tools  Above all,   we have to communicate that we control medium-term inflation even when nominal interest rates   are zero and that we intend to keep inflation near target  That is the overriding objective in this   situation  Otherwise, you are going to let inflation probably drift far below target, and the   market will be scratching its head about, well, what are you going to do about it?  Okay  Thanks   very much     I was just looking at the policy rates abroad here—this is the picture in   exhibit 3, I guess  It shows the ECB, the Bank of Canada, and the Bank of England all leveling   out before they get to zero  Do you have a sense of what the plans are there, or what they are   saying about that, or are we going to see a sort of global move to zero?  What is your sense of   that?     So this is from surveys of market participants?     Right  But you are getting the information from surveys and other   things     On the same topic—the medium-term outlook and, in particular, the   optimal control exercise at the bottom, which is showing us how we’re constrained—is there some   quantitative policy that we could undertake that would get us to the green lines here, maybe by   creating more inflation than we would think desirable in the long run?     Sometimes what people do is they say, okay, suppose you could just   control inflation directly, which we know is hard, but suppose then you just trace out an optimal   path for inflation that would get you to the green line     This optimal control exercise then would have an objective that would be   a quadratic objective in some real output or unemployment—     That’s saying that you wouldn’t be willing to suspend your inflation   target for a while to improve things on the real side  I think that might be helpful as well because   then the Committee could think about what those tradeoffs are  In ordinary times, you might have a   certain weight on the two objectives, but you might shift that in other situations   December 15–16, 2008 125 of 284      May I just make one comment on that?  For those of you who have not   read about the Nordic experience, Seppo Honkapohja, who is a member of the Board of the Bank of   Finland, has given a speech within the last two months  You can probably go to the Bank of   Finland web page  There may be other information, but that is just one summary from a person   who lived through it and has been involved in policy for a long time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be brief  In the Eighth District, there   is a clear and sharp downturn, as in the national picture  There is a clear turn to survival   strategies, and you really see that when key CEOs and other figures start talking about lower   capital expenditures for 2009, cutting the lower levels in 2008 in half or more  I think that’s very   consistent with the Greenbook  The effects on our District from any auto restructuring may be   substantial, and that is something I have ratcheted up here in the last few months  A common   theme among all contacts—and it echoes some of what has been said around the table here—is   that rate cuts at this point will have no effect on the macroeconomy  Their thinking is, well, of   course, since short-term Treasuries are trading at zero—I think one-month Treasuries actually hit   zero here a bit ago—they are not going to have any effect  But as Governor Duke pointed out   yesterday, and I think this is an important concern, the impact on bank profitability may be   substantial, exactly at the wrong time  First Vice President Cumming picked that up, too  I think   December 15–16, 2008 144 of 284    that is a concern  I think it suggests favoring an option of de-emphasizing the federal funds rate   as a target at this meeting, as we will get to in the policy discussion  But then you might not   trigger this prime rate cut that would otherwise normally accompany a major move by the Fed   On the national picture, I expect a sharp downturn in the fourth quarter and the first   quarter  Expectations are extremely negative now and extremely fluid  I think that is probably   the biggest factor facing us going forward into 2009  The expectations are so fluid that they   portend a deflationary environment if we do not control the situation very soon  I am also very   concerned about the global aspect because we haven’t really seen this kind of coordination   across the globe in the rapid movement to probably zero interest rates  I don’t think we really   know what that means going forward  We are going to be looking at bad news coming in at least   until summer, and we have no way at this point to signal a reaction to that bad news via normal   policy  That is the gravity of the situation, and in some ways it is the downside of a preemptive   policy  Had I been on the Committee earlier this year, I would have supported the preemptive   policy to try to avoid this situation  But one downside of it is that you do not have the ability to   continually react as bad news comes in   In sum, I think we are moving to a Japanese-style deflationary, zero nominal interest rate,   situation at an alarming pace  To stay in the game and control expectations, we need a Volcker-  like transformation, something like—although the situation is different—the ’79 announcement,   which knocked private-sector priors off the idea that they should trigger all reactions to   announcements on nominal interest rates  You need a dramatic move that emphasizes this new   reality  Continued focus on the federal funds rate at this point would not face that reality     Above all, we have to establish in the minds of the private sector—and maybe in our own   minds as well—that we control medium-term inflation  We should take the attitude that we can   December 15–16, 2008 145 of 284    create the inflation we need to stay near target by one means or another  I think, actually, this   may be an excellent time to set the inflation target, although it sounds as though we are drifting   away from that  But if I can argue for it for a few minutes here, I think it might have an   important effect on the navigation through the recession during 2009  Of course, in normal   times, to undertake some action like that, we would want a lot of study, and we would want to   have time to talk it through with the Congress and other interested parties, as we would for   interest on reserves  But we don’t have that luxury right now  We want to take the action now to   help control the situation, and I think we could sell that as a work in progress, which can be   modified later  But we do want to keep these expectations under control in this very fluid   situation  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative A, so let me just talk   for a few minutes about what I like about it  I like the language “not useful to set a specific   target for the federal funds rate” in alternative A because I think this will begin the process of   getting the private sector to think in alternative terms about monetary policy  That would be   similar to the moves made during the 1979-82 period  Let me just stress that I think the whole   process is going to be very difficult  We have an entire generation of private-sector financial   market participants who are conditioned to think only in terms of a federal funds rate target as   the whole definition of what monetary policy is  I might remind the Committee—if it needs   reminding, and it probably doesn’t—that it is a big country out there  When you start talking to   others outside the particular participants in financial markets, the level of understanding of   monetary policy is very limited  The subtleties get lost, and so it is going to take a lot of time   and effort to convince everyone and to explain to everyone that we are switching to new policies    I expect, in fact, that it will probably be a three-year period that will be marked by controversy   December 15–16, 2008 171 of 284    over headlines that are of the form, “What is the Fed doing?”—much like the 1979-82 period,   when there was continuing controversy and continuing efforts to explain   I also like the paragraph that places emphasis on alternative policies  I would keep the   bracketed information  I thought the conditionality was okay  I will say about the alternative   policies, those policies have unknown impact, and so we don’t want to be too detailed here   because they may have to evolve in the future  I would take out the part about the longer-term   Treasury securities   I would put in the inflation target  I said before that I think it is an important point to be   able to reassure and anchor expectations in this very fluid situation, which may rapidly unravel   on us  This is a good opportunity to do this, and I would go ahead with that  I don’t think it is   that different from our longer-term projections, but it is much more direct and communicates   much more clearly to markets that we have a medium-term inflation target   On the question of what should be in the directive, I will say this  I see it as somewhat   dangerous for this Committee and for the nation to say nothing about the level of reserves or the   monetary base  It is true that it may not be inflationary now or in normal times, and it may not   have been inflationary in Japan  But there are many examples around the world where money   supplies got out of control and inflation was a very serious problem  It could be explosive in   some parts of the world, especially if there were a large loss of confidence in the US   government or in the performance of this Committee  So I think we want to reassure the world   that we are carefully monitoring that situation, that we have our eye on it  As several people   have commented around here, a common refrain among business leaders we talk to is, “What the   hell is going on?  You know, your balance sheet is way up  Isn’t that going to be inflationary?”    And we are saying “no,” but I think we need to give continual reassurance that we are   December 15–16, 2008 172 of 284    monitoring that situation, we have it under control, and we are thinking about it  I also think, as   President Stern said yesterday, that it would help signal our intention to keep inflation near   target, other than simply promising to do so, which is just pure reliance on our credibility  You   have something quantitative that you can point to  Obviously, it has to be done in a sensible way   that allows us to bring in other programs and expand the balance sheet in other ways  I think it is   just a matter of making a statement that we are keeping our eye on the whole situation   As far as the other alternatives, let me disparage them for a minute  [Laughter]  I don’t   know—we haven’t gone all around the table here—but I don’t want to be naming targets that we   don’t intend to hit  So I don’t want to say that we have a target but we are not actually going to   do it  If we are going to do that, then we have to change the language somehow that whatever   the number that we are naming is not really a target  Okay?  I would be very averse to doing   anything like that   In alternative B, the first sentence states a target range for the federal funds rate  My   feeling about this is that effectively, in the big picture, no one will read past that first sentence    They will just say, “Oh, yes, the Fed lowered interest rates”  The idea that we are switching to   some new regime or that markets have to start thinking in alternative ways about monetary   policy is going to be lost  If you wanted to put a more aggressive spin on this, this is the do-  nothing option  The effective federal funds rate is near zero anyway, so this is just saying,   “Well, this is business as usual  We are going to sit on our hands  We are constrained by the   zero bound, and we are not going to really change anything”  So I see it as important to get the   markets off this, and I see alternative A as one way to do that  But maybe you all will convince   me otherwise  Thank you  "
8436,2009-01-16," Thank you Just coming back to President Fisher’s question  How are   we going to play this going forward?  Should we expect more deals in the category of Citi and   B of A?  How are we going to draw the line sometime in 2009 about how to do this?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am in favor of an explicit inflation   target, and I think now might be a fairly good time to embark on this  Echoing your opening   comments, I think today’s expectations are extremely fluid  Should they become entrenched,   they will dictate inflation over the next five years and may lead us into a particular regime, one   that involves a side of the two-sided risk that we face—either a Japanese-style deflation or a   1970s-style resurgence of a volatile inflation environment  So I think naming an inflation target   now would help a lot to avoid both of those possibilities  If we can exit the current crisis with   inflation at target, we will set up the next long expansion along the lines of the 1990s expansion   that increased incomes substantially in the United States  I think that should be our goal, even   though we are in the heart of a financial crisis right now        January 16, 2009 32 of 69  My reading of the foreign experience is that it has been extremely valuable for countries   whose monetary policies were somehow at a crossroads—they had a lot of problems in the past,   often with managing exchange rates, and then they were able to move to inflation targeting and   get good results from that  That hasn’t been the case for the United States, but now may be a   different time  You might think that we are at a crossroads right now and that we could lose   control of the inflation situation, either on the high side or the low side, during 2009 and   therefore we might want to take the step at this moment   Let me talk for just a minute about interference with the dual mandate  My view on   inflation targeting is that this point is the most misunderstood in the public domain and actually   also in some places inside the central bank establishment  The whole point, at least in my view,   is that anchoring expectations is part of the optimal policy from the point of view of a typical   household in the economy That is the Woodford analysis of inflation targeting  You name your   inflation target exactly because this is the optimal policy from the utility point of view of a   typical household in the economy  It does not mean that you ignore any part of the equilibrium   of the economy It means that this is the best you can do with monetary policy in terms of   shaping an equilibrium, which delivers the most to the median household in the economy  So if   we are able to communicate that and get that across in a public debate, that would go a long way   because, really, everyone should be for inflation targeting from that point of view   There is a question here about excessive declines in inflation  I guess I am maybe more   concerned than some of my colleagues on the Committee here, but I do see this as a real risk  I   might mention that five-year TIPS are at minus 35 basis points today  That is the inflation rate   implied by the five-year TIPS  I know there may be distortions in this market, but that number is   making me nervous  If that actually materializes—that is, we have declines in prices over the           January 16, 2009 33 of 69  next five years—I think there is no question that we will be in a Japanese-style equilibrium for   the foreseeable future I am very concerned about that possibility, and maybe the inflation target   would help us on that   As far as the FOMC’s conduct of monetary policy, I don’t think actual policy conduct   would change that much because I think implicit inflation targeting is going on inside the   Committee, and much of the discussion about monetary policy is based on implicit inflation   targeting This, to me, is all about communicating to the private sector in a very turbulent time   what it is we are trying to do Also, I don’t see any hindrance to our ability to address financial   stability issues In fact, we are addressing financial stability issues right now, and we are saying   that, because we can reverse programs later on, the inflationary effect is minimal   I don’t have strong opinions on the time frame  I think it should be a medium-term   target We should be looking at average inflation over several years  I do think that setting a   price-level target might work in some models that depend heavily on rational expectations  As   much as I love those models, I think they may not be ready for prime time as far as actual policy   is concerned So going to a price-level target at this juncture is just too difficult, and it would be   difficult to maintain credibility if we went in that direction   As far as a single number or a range, I have always liked a single number  For me, a   range doesn’t make any sense  I think it implies that you have a region of indifference about   inflation—that inflation in a certain range is all the same—and I don’t think that is what we   really think So I prefer a point for the objective  As far as which basket, I would prefer the   headline CPI As much as possible you want to get to prices that households actually pay  That   came up all through 2009, when we were emphasizing core inflation and other prices were                       January 16, 2009 34 of 69  moving radically That harms our credibility  Also, the CPI is not revised later  Core would still   be used as a gauge, but that is not the ultimate objective   For the numerical value of the target, I think inflation is quite distortionary for the   economy  That is my reading of the literature on the topic  Not least among the many types of   distortions that occur is significant interaction with the tax code, which is that the tax code is   necessarily imperfectly indexed to inflation So when you get inflation, you are changing taxes   all around We know that that is distortionary in the economy, and it is an unintended   consequence I would suggest 15 percent as the target   One question was whether we should have a higher inflation objective in the medium   term, saying that we would come down to a lower level of inflation at some point further in the   future I would really not want to do that  I think that is playing with fire  It seems to me that a   press release that says something like that might ignite exactly the 1970s-style of inflation, and I   wouldn’t want to go in that direction  It seems to me also to be opposite to the general idea of   inflation targeting, which is to anchor expectations and to reassure the private sector that you are   not going to shift inflation around on them unexpectedly  I have a few more comments, but in   the interest of time, I am going to stop my comments here  Thank you very much     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just following up a bit on some of these   comments, I was wondering if you thought that some kind of metric like the permanent component   or the consistent component of the expansion of the balance sheet is really what we are thinking   about in a lot of these comments  Maybe that is the kind of measure that we are trying to put   together A lot of your comments and everybody’s comments are that there is much reversibility in   many of these programs  They are temporary programs intended to address the financial crisis, and   they will go away once conditions return closer to normal  But there might be components that are   substantial and are harder to reverse, and somehow we would like to get metrics about that so that   we have some sense of what we are doing in terms of price-level implications or inflation   implications over the medium term  I do not know if you think something like that is sort of where   we are headed, or is that just too difficult to get a handle on?  Thank you  "
8453,2009-01-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to play the role of provocateur   here and ask a couple of questions that are in the spirit of having a wide-ranging and strategic   discussion, as we are having here  Here is something that people said to me recently  This is a   question for Mr Sheets about swap lines, one of our favorite topics  Here is the statement   These swap lines are giving control of the US monetary base to foreign governments, especially   through persistent and large usage by the foreign central banks  I will stop on that one and see   what you think about that    So what is the magnitude right now of the swap lines that are   outstanding?    Okay So a scenario would be that you go over the next five years,   with zero nominal interest rates and an ongoing financial crisis, and these things stay out there           January 27–28, 2009 76 of 267  because of needs for dollar funding in Europe  Now you had a permanent one-time increase of,   say, $500 billion in the monetary base Isn’t this what we are looking at?    Okay I am just trying to ask a series of provocative questions    Thank you [Laughter]    Okay Thank you So now I am going to try to reconcile Presidents   Lacker and Rosengren [laughter] and get your and our new Vice Chairman Dudley’s reactions   My experience in economics is that it is not that helpful to talk about equilibrium and   disequilibrium So I am going to talk about it in a different way  You have firms and people   who do the best they can, given the constraints that they face  There are frictions out there, and   we know what the friction is here  It is a very severe information friction in certain financial   markets  It is a crisis of financial engineering in which, when the new financial instruments were   created, they were thought to be good devices, but they turned out to have serious transparency   issues and that created information problems  So now you say that, given that friction, I am   going to let everybody optimize  Jeff will say, well, that is a Pareto optimum given the friction     January 27–28, 2009 77 of 267  and, if there is nothing you can do about the friction, then that is the best you can do  But if there   is some policy you can do to ameliorate the friction and pull that out, you will get a better   solution I would say that that is Mr Dudley’s position  The position that it is just technology   and there is probably nothing we can do about the crisis in financial engineering would be the   Lacker position I was wondering if you guys would react to that and see if that reflects your   views    Yes, and I agree with that There seem to be a lot of things that are   being done in many parts of the government and maybe parts of the Fed that are not really   getting at that information friction  So I am going to ask the most provocative question of all    The Chairman said at the beginning that we should obviously be allergic to taking on credit risk,   and normally, I think everyone here agrees with that  But maybe now is the time to rethink that    You have a serious information problem out there  You have a lot of reactions to that that are   tangential to the core problem, and we are talking about doing open market operations, which   used to be always in Treasuries, now in MBS It would not be that hard to say let’s just do the   open market operation swap of money for a financial instrument using the toxic assets that are   such a problem in this economy  Normally I would not say things like this, so I am stepping out   of character But in the interest of provoking discussion, maybe now is the time to at least start   thinking about something like that  That would get to the heart of the matter  If you try to go   through the Congress, they are wonderful people and everything, but the process gets   politicized—and we know this; we are seeing that already—and so all kinds of other things get        January 27–28, 2009 78 of 267  done This would get at the core of the problem  You would be taking on risk, but you take on   some interest rate risk even when you buy Treasuries  The whole idea would be to price these at   the right price, which I understand is very tricky, but who better to do it than the 500 economists   that hang out at the Fed?  So I don’t know—should it necessarily be a 100 percent benchmark   that we do not want to take on credit risk, or should it be only a 95 percent benchmark or   something like that?    We do not want to maintain that if it is going to send us into an even   more prolonged downturn I mean, it might be nice if we always did liquidity and Treasury   always did credit, but I am saying—    I am comparing exhibit 3 with exhibit 6 here  In exhibit 3 you have   the middle panel on the right, “Overvaluation of Single-Family Homes,” and in exhibit 6, the   middle right panel, you have “Prices of Commercial Properties”  On exhibit 3, I guess this is a   judgment call  a reduction in home values of about 25 percent—am I reading this right?—from   where they are now    Another 15 percent on homes    So I have done pictures like this, too, because I think it shows that the   bubble part is out, and whatever else is remaining is overreaction, which is what you are saying    But on commercial properties and then in exhibit 6, you have maybe a   different story, a more moderated downturn there, if I am reading this right    Is there a reason that we should think commercial properties are not as   susceptible to the overcorrection as housing is?           January 27–28, 2009 105 of 267   Okay I guess I will interpret that as there might be some downside   risk in this area      On the assessment of fiscal policy, what is the effect of the deficit   program on longer-term Treasury rates?    Is that a global output gap or just the United States?    Okay I just have one more thing  It is exhibit 9, which is “An   Unconventional Policy” We have two graphs at the top, on the unemployment rate and core   PCE prices I guess I would interpret these to say that, if you were serious about putting   confidence bounds around these estimates, you probably could not tell these apart statistically    Do you think that is a fair assessment, or are they more tightly estimated than that?    So there is a lot of additional uncertainty that may not be properly   captured in those confidence bounds? Is that what you are saying?    We didn’t get lines that went like this or where it would have a huge   effect but it would be very bad for other elements of the economy or something like that  We did   not really get that  We got things that are close to baseline    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy is clearly in   recession There has been recent significant deterioration in labor markets  The only comment I   would have on that is that the pace of decline may be somewhat less rapid than in the nation as a   whole Other parts of the country appear to be deteriorating faster, but certainly the Eighth   District is not immune, and anecdotal information from many, many sources suggests that credit   market frictions continue to be a substantial drag on economic activity   In the national outlook, of course, we are in the midst of probably the worst of a sharp   and significant downturn For the shorter term, like 2009, I think the Greenbook assessment   seems plausible  Longer term, I don’t think that the Greenbook assessment is plausible    According to the Greenbook baseline, the federal funds rate remains at zero into 2013, even   though, according to the table in Part 1, page 19, real GDP at that point will have grown at rates   of 26 percent, 49 percent, and 53 percent for the previous three years, and we would still be        January 27–28, 2009 128 of 267  sitting at zero according to the forecast  Unemployment would have dropped 300 basis points,   and we still would not have moved  That doesn’t seem very plausible to me as a longer-term   forecast Core PCE inflation remains below 1 percent according to the baseline forecast  So this   strikes me as a little implausible, and I think it might color our thinking from a strategic   perspective It strikes me as implausible, especially if we pursue some reasonably aggressive   quantitative policies Then I would expect that that forecast would not materialize  So one   reading of the baseline forecast would be that, under current planning, the FOMC is not going to   be aggressive enough to keep inflation at target over a reasonable time frame, like five years    That is one way to look at it To do that, you would have to be more aggressive with the   quantitative policies I am going to have more to say about that   Like President Yellen, I am concerned, as some of you know, about a deflationary trap,   and I just want to stress here for a few minutes the global aspect of this  We are not going to get   any good news globally over the next six to nine months on the economy, anywhere  A baseline   assessment would be that this will force the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Bank of Canada   to zero nominal interest rates  They are saying maybe not, but I think that they will all be forced   to zero Of course, the Bank of Japan is at 10 basis points right now  So you will have the G-7   economies all at zero  Absolutely unprecedented  That is a lot of time to be getting bad news on   the economy worldwide  That is why I am very concerned about deflationary expectations   possibly taking hold, and I would regard expectations as being the main determinant of actual   inflation If that is what transpires, we will face many years in this deflationary trap outcome,   and that will be a global outcome  I am very concerned about that, and so I say the key near-  term goal is just to avoid that outcome           January 27–28, 2009 129 of 267  How can we do that?  Well, much of the analysis that we have remains in terms of the   federal funds rate, and much of our own thinking around the table remains in terms of the federal   funds rate as defining what monetary policy is  If we are not planning to move off zero for five   years, I think that we have to change our thinking and we need even greater focus on quantitative   measures in future analysis  Like it or not, we need to see our policy more in quantitative terms   so that we can assess possible paths and what is going to be effective  I am afraid that is going to   mean talking more about the monetary base, monetary aggregates, reserves, and the balance   sheet The key thing is how much balance sheet expansion we can accomplish before we run   into inflation troubles There has to be some kind of answer to this  Is it $1 trillion—in which   case we are already over and are in inflation danger?  $2 trillion?  Maybe $5 trillion?  Maybe   $10 trillion? I don’t know where that is right now, and I think we need some kind of quantitative   assessment of that   We did get some of that in a simulation from the staff—a $1 trillion outright purchase of   Treasuries and MBS, with minor effects on inflation according to the baseline model  That   would suggest that we have a lot of room to maneuver  I am sure that we could have a long   debate about how accurate that is and everything, but that would suggest that we have a lot of   room to maneuver, and we could be much more aggressive if we want to avoid this deflationary   outcome, which is the real danger over the next twelve months  So I see that as the key to our   policy choices Again, if it is not inflationary, then we can do a lot more  If it is inflationary—if   it is going to translate into inflation—then we have to be very careful about it  But we need to   get better metrics of where we are on that, and right now it just seems wide open   I am going to close with the mystery of the round numbers  Proposed expansions of   programs seem to come in suspiciously round numbers  Some of them are like $500 billion;           January 27–28, 2009 130 of 267  another number is $250 billion  Contrast this with the accuracy of the federal funds rate, where   we will talk about small increments and out many years into the future  This just shows how   much we are used to thinking in terms of the fed funds rate, and we are used to doing the   analysis in terms of the fed funds rate  We have lots of mechanisms in place  We have a lot of   inexperience when we are thinking on the quantitative side, so we are very rough in our   characterization That is perfectly understandable, but we need to move more and quickly in that   direction It seems to me that we would like to think maybe in increments of $25 billion or   maybe a little larger increment than that and then have some kind of quantitative assessment   about why the numbers are what they are and what we think that they will do  That will inform   our choices going forward When we have done quantitative policy in the past, it has often been   in terms of growth rates  You would think in terms of money, reserves, or whatever you wanted   to think about, and you would talk about a certain pace of expansion, maybe moderating later in   the future or something like that  That seems like a very logical thing to do in this situation  So   those are some thoughts on the economy and on policy  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to counsel essentially a wait-  and-see attitude, and then I am going to confuse you by arguing that later we should be very   aggressive I think the wait-and-see attitude would echo a lot of what President Yellen said  We   have a new Administration coming in  They are promising to be very aggressive on many   dimensions  One of them is a fiscal stimulus package  I think we want to see what that turns out   to be and what the provisions of that are at the end of the day There we have some fairly good   expectations, but I think I would still want to see how it pans out   More critical are the discussions about direct approaches to try to mitigate problems in   financial markets, possibly through an aggregator bank  I see this as absolutely critical as to how   we might proceed going forward, so I would want to hear more about what is going to happen on   that dimension  I do think we will get a lot of information over the next several weeks along that   dimension, so that is an argument to wait and see what happens  Also, we have our program of   outright purchases of MBS, which is generally regarded as successful, but we are only a bit along   on that We are not up to our $500 billion target, and so we can let that continue while we try to   get information about what the new Administration has in mind  For these reasons, I think my   position is most consistent with alternative B, but I do have several comments on the   alternatives   My first comment—and I was talking about this last time—is that I would prefer to get   the federal funds rate off the top of the statement  I would move it to the end  This is not   projected to change for a long time, maybe four years  What you learn in English class about           January 27–28, 2009 178 of 267  writing is that you put your main message first  Your main message is, Here are the things that   are different from where we were last time  Obviously the interest rate is not going to change for   a long time  You want to be stressing right off the bat that here is the key decision that we made   today, and so I would try to rearrange this to put that first  I do not have specific suggestions on   this I think that would go a long way to communicate the nature of monetary policy during   2009, 2010, and 2011 Again, I want to stress that we really have to work hard to get the private   sector off the idea that the federal funds rate is the definition of monetary policy  There are   many things that we have been discussing that can be done, and we are doing them, so we have   to design our statement to reflect that  I think that even our own thinking has not evolved away   from the federal funds rate as the definition of monetary policy as much as it needs to   A central bank that refuses to talk openly about money creation is suspect  If we refuse   to discuss the matter or discuss the matter only euphemistically, we will lose credibility    Furthermore, others will discuss it for us, and the private sector will define who we are and what   we are doing So I think we should be more open in talking about our policy, which is direct   open market purchases by reserve creation  We should think harder about that, and we should   talk more about that   I think that I have quantitative measures  I know we do not like to talk about money here,   but let’s talk about money for just a minute  M2 growth was quite rapid in the fourth quarter,   and that seems promising to me given the situation globally  But it seems that the staff expects   M2 growth actually to moderate in 2009 down to 3 percent  That seems counterproductive to   me  We should be more aggressive if we want to get something like a broad measure of money   growing rapidly enough that we’re sure that we’re going to be able to avoid a global deflation   trap That gives you something to shoot for  We recognize that the old debates on money        January 27–28, 2009 179 of 267  pointed out that linkages are not tied to ultimate outcomes  We know that, but still, in an   environment of zero nominal interest rates, this might be a reasonable way to go  People would   understand what we’re talking about and would understand that we have our inflation objectives   in mind as we are trying to ease here  So that is just a little comment on M2   I have also come to the conclusion—and maybe all of you were ahead of me—that time   may not be a healer here as far as financial market problems  There were a lot of comments   around the table that, well, we’ll give the financial markets more time—six months—to adjust   and so on Well, we are 18 months into this crisis, and I actually thought when we were a year   into the crisis that markets had had enough time to adjust  It did not prove to be the case  So the   thing is that these information problems do not go away with the passage of time  I think that is   the key thing that we have learned here Eighteen months along, and this is as bad as ever—this   is in the last couple of weeks  So direct approaches to solve market information problems are   going to be essential, and that’s one reason that we need to see what the new Treasury and the   new Administration have in mind on that dimension But to the extent that a direct solution does   not materialize—and it is certainly very possible that something gets proposed, and something   gets done, and then it does not work very well—then that may dictate our policy  We may have   to be all the more aggressive in that scenario, but I want to wait and see how this stacks up in the   next few weeks   Explicit numbers in the alternatives, as in Alternative A, seem crude and suspect to me    What we would like to be talking about is the growth rate of the balance sheet net of the   temporary components or the easily reversible components  We would like to cull out the   lender-of-last-resort programs, the ones that we think will go away in a reasonable time frame or   will naturally go away if market conditions improve  But we also have more-persistent or more­        January 27–28, 2009 180 of 267  permanent components of the balance sheet, such as MBS purchases, which I do not think we   will be in a position to reverse anytime soon  That to me is just an increase in the money supply   These individual numbers might also create option values to waiting in the market  You might   think that mortgage rates are low today, but maybe the Fed will come out in the spring and   announce another $500 billion, and so you will wait because you think mortgage rates are going   to be even lower in the future  In the past when we have talked about quantitative things, it has   always been in growth rate terms or some kind of growth rate strategy that extended over the   whole projection period, so the explicit numbers at this point seem crude to me   My sense is that we may have room to do much more in open market purchases than we   have right now based on what the Greenbook is telling us  Five years from now we still do not   have inflation up at 2 percent, as President Rosengren pointed out  If that is really what we   think—and one of the simulations added $1 trillion to that and we still did not hit our inflation   target after five years—possibly we have room to do a lot more and could be a lot more   aggressive  But I just do not think at this point we have the right metrics in place, so I just   cannot be sure at this point I think that is where we can improve in the next couple of meetings    Thank you  "
8480,2009-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to make one comment about   our boards of directors who are concerned about losses in the Federal Reserve System  They’re   just trying to be good business people They hear a lot of things, and I think what they’re   hearing mostly is actual reported losses on the Bear Stearns portfolio, which has already been   marked down, and they’re worried about our arrangements at AIG and Bank of America and   Citi So that’s what I think is going on I think the clearer we can be about the fact that we’re   watching it and that we have it under control, the better from that perspective   I just wanted to circle back Generally speaking, this is, as we expected, a comprehensive   plan It has many moving parts, and many of them seem very reasonable to me  I think the   biggest issue that has been brought up today is really this communication issue  Our near-term   concern would be that we really get a bad reaction and create more difficulty this week  So I   don’t know if we can think a little bit more about things we could do to mitigate that  I know   that it’s up to the Treasury Secretary to decide how he wants to make the announcement  I think   there’s a lot of political pressure to make a big splash, but maybe making a big splash isn’t   necessarily the right way to get this to sail off in a smooth direction   One thing on Vice Chairman Dudley’s comment that TALF is not really about the   banking system—you could pull that out and announce it at some other time when perhaps it   could be better explained and better absorbed  It’s going to be in with a lot of other provisions,   so the impact might get lost and people might be confused about what it is  I’m just suggesting   possibly there’s another time we could announce that           February 7, 2009 58 of 65  The other thought is about the scrubbing provision that—at least as I interpreted   Governor Duke’s comments—might cause a very nasty reaction out there  Maybe that could be   soft-pedaled or done in a way that says that we’re just thinking about this The intention of that   would be to mitigate some of the potential for a very nasty downturn that might exacerbate the   situation and make it much worse  The signaling effects during this financial crisis have been   astounding, absolutely astounding And I think we do need to be very aware of that  It seems to   me that’s our near-term challenge for this discussion  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I understand, and I think my board appreciates that  But they also start   to ask questions, because the numbers get so large that you start talking about more than we send   back to the Treasury in a typical year  And the crisis seems to be going in unpredictable ways,   so I think they’re just trying to be prudent business people on this question  As long as we have   good risk-management in place, I think it would be fine—they’d just like to see reassurance on   that  "
8498,2009-03-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some of my questions are for David and   Joe I’m looking at exhibit 3 again  I think the overall analysis is beautiful, but this   unconstrained policy with the negative nominal rates is not really a feasible outcome  The truth   is, you don’t know what would happen, because it’s not feasible  But then, to put that on here as   where we’d like to be in these pictures, I think, gives a little bit of a misleading idea about how   we should think about these large-scale asset purchases  Would it be possible to say, “If I could   pursue an optimal unconstrained policy just on asset purchases, here’s how much I’d do, and   here’s how I’d let it unwind”? Maybe that should be the baseline and we should skip the   negative fed funds rate Is that possible?  What would that look like? Would that get you all the   way to the funds rate line, or throw that line out?  Or where would it take us?    So we have a baseline, which is just to stick with our zero nominal   interest rate, conventional stuff, and not do anything else, just let the economy play out  Then   we say, “Well, we can improve on that with some asset purchases”  But we don’t want to go too   far, because you just get too far out of bounds      The natural thing to ask is  Why are there limits on this?  As I’ve said   before, there’s the mystery of round numbers Why $500 billion?  Why not $750 billion?  Why   not $15 trillion?    Our job as policymakers is to somehow trade those off  And I guess   the model just doesn’t help us with that    It’s great to know these kinds of constraints     I can’t give up the floor without tormenting Mr Sheets  In your   report, and in some of the questions, we’ve talked about moral hazard problems  Your response,   which I thought was a good one, was that you were going to do the pricing in a way that made it   a backstop facility, so that you gave the proper incentives to financial firms to stay out of this                      March 17–18, 2009 52 of 266  facility unless it was absolutely necessary  Is your sense that that’s going on with the other   swaps, especially in Europe?  Are we pushing them so that they are avoiding the same problem   on the other side?  Or do you think we run the risk of becoming a permanent part of the market   for dollar funding elsewhere in the world, just sort of a routine thing?    I just wanted to ask a few questions about the accord  What kind of   legal standing does an accord have?  Is this a gentleman’s agreement, or what is it?    Except in textbooks?    Okay So it’s a genuine agreement    The ’51 case held for a long time because there were no attempts to   change it subsequently, and that’s the hope here as well, I guess  But it’s really just an   agreement between the Administration and the Fed for now  Two of the provisions are really   “asks” from the Congress  Do I have that right?    The Congress may or may not agree to them        March 17–18, 2009 72 of 266   So the accord in ’51 was about how the Fed and the Treasury were   actually going to interact It did not involve this part about what we’re going to get the Congress   to do or not do I’m just trying to understand what the object is     Okay    I was just going to talk about asset purchases a little bit  What I’m   concerned about is these one-off moves, and I’ve been concerned about round numbers—   $1 trillion, $500 billion, and so on I think all of the things that we do in interest rate targeting   should also come in when we’re doing our asset-purchase program  In interest rate targeting, as   it has developed over the last 20 years, it’s all about the whole path of interest rates over a long   horizon in the future That’s all part of the policy  How credible you are about letting the   private sector know how you’re going to behave and how you’re going to react to things in the   future   When we hit the zero bound, that all went out the window  Now we’re taking one-time   actions, with the private sector very uncertain about how we’re going to frame that in the future    And we know that, no matter what model you have, that’s not the right way to do policy  So I   think we want to get back to something like policy paths for asset purchases  Even if we don’t   say it in our statements, the private sector is already imputing what they think that’s going to be    They just have bigger confidence bands around it than they would otherwise have  So what I   was going to talk about during the policy go-round is somehow to get to where you can   announce continuations of purchases at some rate, or something like that  My intuition is that              March 17–18, 2009 79 of 266  that’s the right way to do these policies, instead of saying, “I’m going to come in with   $500 billion to this particular market on this particular day, and I may or may not do any of this   in the future”    Yes, what happens after that?  And, I think, on the Treasury purchases,   we have vacillated a little I think as a Committee that we want the whole path out there for the   policy tools Also it might be good to indicate a little bit of contingency about buying at a   certain pace; for example, “we’re looking at the data as they come in—if they come in a little   stronger in the fall than we think, maybe we’ll tamp down a little bit,” that kind of thing  That’s   what I’d also have in mind  Otherwise, you commit all the way to the next year, or beyond next   year, and it turns out something else happens that you didn’t expect    We should feed back the conditions  We don’t know what the rule   looks like, I agree    “We’re going to monitor conditions”  “We’re going to buy at this   pace” “We give ourselves the option of buying at a slower pace if things come out better than   expected,” or something like that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy is in   recession It’s possibly somewhat less severe than in some parts of the country, but still a very   sharp recession All of the problems that we see nationally are certainly apparent in the Eighth   District, including credit market problems, deeply depressed auto sales, declining house prices,   and so on The national economy appears to have weakened further relative to January   expectations I think there’s further downside risk, and I agree with many here that the main risk   is some kind of failure to get the financial sector on track toward recovery  The global aspect of                  March 17–18, 2009 121 of 266  the downturn continues unabated I think this is a very worrisome factor  It’s largely outside our   historical experience in the modern era  It may be that we’re not fully comprehending the   meaning of global events because they haven’t really been part of our experience  And I’m   worried about that   I think expectations remain very fluid, both for the course of the real economy and for   inflation We know that expectations have a huge influence on macroeconomic outcomes  That   influence is partially masked in normal times  In normal times, expectations are very stable; in   normal times, for output, the private sector would expect something close to the balanced growth   path; in normal times, for inflation, the private sector would expect something close to the   implicit inflation target pursued by the central bank  So, in normal times, it appears that   expectations don’t move that much, and, perhaps, therefore, are not so important to how the   economy is going to function   But these are not normal times  As a result, expectations are very fluid and can be   significantly influenced by just a few events  It’s as if the private sector is throwing out all of the   old data, because the old data come from a different regime that doesn’t apply anymore, and   they’re looking at the most recent developments, just a few things that are happening, and   deciding which direction the economy is likely to go and which direction inflation is likely to go   This is what makes me especially worried about the economy and the inflation path during 2009    In particular, I think further disinflation and possible deflation is a clear near-term risk   Deflationary expectations could become entrenched during 2009, especially given the downside   risks to the forecast, including the global nature of the very sharp downturn and the possibility   that the financial sector problems won’t be addressed in an appropriate way or quickly enough    Deflation would exacerbate problems in the housing sector and credit markets generally because        March 17–18, 2009 122 of 266  of the prevalence of nominal contracting in the economy  So I think a near-term goal for   monetary policy is to avoid this outcome  In the medium term, we actually face inflation risk,   because the expansion of the balance sheet would suggest lots of inflation possibilities out there    I call this a two-headed dragon But if we get stuck in a deflationary trap, you’re never going to   see that materialize  And, again, a deflationary trap is, to my thinking, a steady state  You get   stuck there, and you cannot get out   Is a deflationary trap a real possibility?  We have the clear example of Japan  We have   foreign central banks sending their policy rates to zero globally  Our own model and our own   baseline forecast have core PCE inflation at 1 percent in 2009, and below 1 percent for 2010,   2011, 2012, and 2013 With an economy in that kind of state for that long, suppose you get   another negative shock at some point; then, you do go down to the deflation trap equilibrium and   get stuck there  So I really think it’s a problem for the near term—that we could get stuck in that   trap   Policy should attempt to avoid letting deflationary expectations take hold  How should   we do this?  I really liked the Bank of England’s announcement during the intermeeting period    They said that they were planning to expand the balance sheet to increase the monetary base    They said that they expected that to feed through to the broader money stock measures and that   the growth in the money stock would help them to maintain their medium-term inflation target  I   thought that was a crystal-clear piece of communication, and the markets understand exactly   what it means and what the intent of policy is  So I thought that that was a good example to   follow Those are my comments on the economy  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to talk a little more about this   B′′ option Let me just follow up on some of President Plosser’s and some of President Fisher’s   comments When we think about optimal policy under interest rate targeting, which is what   we’re all used to, we decide what we’re going to do and we communicate it  It has a path   because you’ve got a rule in mind about how you’re going to operate policy in the future, so that   gives you a projected path, and that allows the private sector to coordinate on that path  That’s   all part of how the equilibrium works and how the optimal policy works  What I’m concerned   about right now, and in the last couple of meetings, is that we’re not doing that  Because we hit   the zero bound, the interest rate targeting regime was taken off the table by events, so we’re   ending up with these one-time announcements, with round numbers, and that makes the future   path of policy unclear  The private sector, as I said yesterday, will try to guess what the FOMC   will do, regardless of whether we say anything or not  For years and years we didn’t say   anything But we can do a lot better, I think, by reducing that uncertainty and by laying out some   kind of a path—“here’s what we’re thinking”—and making it contingent, of course, on   macroeconomic events  So that’s what we are trying to get at here   Clearly, the focus is on asset purchases around the table, so this B′′ certainly talks in   those terms  A problem that I’m concerned about is that pre-committing to a particular number   without making it contingent on macroeconomic developments may not be wise  Incoming data   may not match up with the commitment that you made  It would be the same thing under           March 17–18, 2009 187 of 266  interest rate targeting You would say, “we’re going to go somewhere today, there’s a projected   path out there,” but, of course, it’s always dependent on incoming data   Alternative B′′ tries to address these issues, and I might say it’s equally well called A′′,   because it’s not really tied to particular amounts  In fact, you might end up with a little more in   total here  It’s very aggressive, let’s put it that way   First, the form of the statement  You say the main thrust of policy at the beginning of the   statement, which is something I’d like to see us do, and we certainly did that under the interest   rate targeting regime—we would say right away what we did with the fed funds rate  The fed   funds rate at zero is not news right now Even the fact that it’s going to stay at zero for a long   time is not news right now  So I just moved that part down in the statement  Most of these   statements have that   There are three principles behind this B′′, so let me just talk about them  First of all, there   is the agency MBS plus Treasuries as a group Second, there’s a growth rate feature to it, so you   talk in terms of growth rates instead of specific numbers  And the third principle is that you   adjust in response to economic developments, so you have this policy rule aspect   Let me address all three of these  First, the agency MBS plus Treasuries  This is   certainly the type of large-scale asset purchases that we’ve been talking about  It avoids mention   of balance sheet growth as a whole, because you’ve got volatile aspects of the balance sheet that   are under what I would call liquidity provision  There you’ve got the TAF in particular (it’s   whoever shows up for the auctions), you’ve got the swaps, and you’ve got the commercial paper   facilities That’s now about $1 trillion, as President Lacker was pointing out  It’s kind of   volatile It’s liquidity-oriented  Our own projections expect that to run off as financial                 March 17–18, 2009 188 of 266  conditions improve So this version just sets those programs aside and thinks about managing   them separately   The agency MBS plus Treasuries as a group provides some flexibility  As Trish has   pointed out, MBS can be lumpy  You’ve got this refi wave coming in  So you could do more   MBS at certain points, and you could do more Treasuries later, and you don’t have to specify it   at the level of the Committee  There are good arguments on all sides about the choice between   MBS or Treasuries, and demerits on both sides, so I think maybe the thing to do is just mix them   together and provide some flexibility  Also, my own view on this is that they’re both backed by   the Treasury effectively, anyway, so I don’t see a lot of difference   Now you’ve got this persistent component of the balance sheet, which is the MBS plus   Treasuries, and that’s going to grow at this 10 percent approximate rate  Frankly, it’s an   extremely rapid rate, but that’s what we want because we’re in a very sharp downturn here    Then, you’ve got these temporary components of a balance sheet, which are going to run off,   hopefully, when the financial market turmoil abates  And it’s this underlying trend that you want   to get the markets to focus on, as the Chairman was saying a minute ago  So this is a plan for   expansion in the persistent components of the balance sheet, and it helps coordinate private   sector expectations and reduce uncertainty about policy going forward  This has been a key   private sector concern, as we’ve heard around the table  All of the contacts are saying to us,   “What are you guys doing?  I don’t understand the policy  There are all these announcements  I   can’t figure it out” So maybe this is a simpler and more transparent approach, without getting   into a lot of specifics about particular asset categories   The biggest thing for me, and perhaps for President Plosser, is that you’re not pre­  committing  You can adjust as you go along  This is a plan, but, like an interest rate path, it           March 17–18, 2009 189 of 266  would be contingent on macroeconomic developments, and you’re not stuck with a particular   number going forward  That’s the third part You’d be able to adjust this in response to   economic developments  Again, we’re going to be at zero nominal interest rates for a long time,   probably globally I think it’s important to try to lead globally and give a signal to other central   banks about how they might implement their policies  This is a kind of a feedback rule   Obviously, we don’t know what the rule is at this point, and we don’t know how much we will   react to incoming developments  That’s something we have to learn over time  Hopefully, we   can figure that out as we go along But this would get us going in that direction and provide a   credible replacement for our interest rate rules that were taken away from us by events   That’s my case for the main part of it  I’ll talk just briefly about the other parts of the   statement  The description of the economy, paragraph 3, is whittled down from the text in some   of the other statements  That’s in response to President Fisher’s comments  We can certainly   say that the economy is in bad shape, but I don’t think we have to say too much more than that    Obviously, because we put convenient numbers on here, you can mix and match with your other   favorite descriptions of the economy   I agree completely that we should be very aggressive in this situation  But we need to be   aggressive in an organized way Also, we’re taking unprecedented actions  You have to be   careful about going too far in a direction without a plan  We don’t know what the effects really   will be; our models really don’t tell us too much about it  So this alternative holds out options   for adjustment as data arrive  Hopefully it would provide better communication to the private   sector, and hopefully you’d get a more effective policy out of that  A lot of communication is   not just us talking, but it is saying “I’ve got a clear path for future policy”           March 17–18, 2009 190 of 266  I’m very concerned about deflation near term  I’m concerned about a deflation trap in   which you go to this new steady state and get stuck there  But a medium-term risk is that the   economy behaves sort of like normal, and if a normal recovery takes hold, then you’ve got a   possibly explosive inflationary situation But that’s down the road  You have to avoid the   deflation trap outcome first  Maybe if we did get to that medium-term stage, this would set us up   to be able to react to that situation a little better     I took it from the discussion that people would like to front-load MBS   to the extent that’s feasible  But this formulation would let you still have growth later on, if you   want    I don’t know why the announcement effect would be any different  It   adds up to the same amount     Yes, sure    Just to respond a little bit, this doesn’t say anything about the   monetary base This says large-scale asset purchase done in a certain way, which, I guess, is   what our model has said  This is just a way to set the asset purchases—that’s my intent    I just want to press on that a bit  It gives the impression that we’re   hanging on a thread as to what the Congress does or what we do or something like that  I don’t   think you want to leave that impression  Despite what the government does, you might recover   faster or you might recover slower, and I think you should leave that thought in the minds of   private citizens  "
8525,2009-04-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy, like the   national economy, is mired in recession  I think it is somewhat less severe than some other   areas, but it is still a very sharp recession  One winner in the District, and in the nation, is   Wal-Mart, which has benefited from trade-down by consumers during the recession  This has   also mitigated some problems in an otherwise overbuilt northwest Arkansas  Some contacts—   not all, not even most—see very tentative signs of a bottoming out  But at least one contact who   has been very pessimistic—this is like President Plosser’s contact—felt that sales volume and   revenue numbers had flattened out and that, therefore, the firm had found the bottom  More           April 28–29, 2009 64 of 201  important, this particular CEO was actually acting on that idea going forward and developing   business strategies based on the idea that they were at the bottom  That is in the transportation   industry   Nationally, this is one of the worst recessions in the postwar era, according to a number   of metrics  My judgment is that, at this point, we will just need to have more data before we can   see what is going to happen here I am not particularly convinced that we have seen signs of   bottoming out  Turning points are notoriously hard to predict  You could easily turn down   again, given the situation that we are in As President Yellen has stressed, we are susceptible to   further shocks from unknown quarters  In my view, we have lots of issues that are really not   resolved at this point, especially the financial market turmoil but also issues in the auto sector   and the prospects for global recovery   Measures of financial market stress are showing only modest improvement, and that is   relative to very high peaks, so I would not find this very convincing  If we were seeing these   kinds of numbers before the crisis began, we’d be saying that these are horrible numbers  So it is   only modest improvement relative to a very bad situation  Time has not been a healer for   financial markets  If you would have told me at the beginning, in August 2007, that these would   still be lingering this long, I would have been very surprised  I would have expected them to   heal   The FRB/US model is probably not a good guide for policymaking in this environment  I   base this on the brilliant figure provided in the memo by Robert Tetlow and Peter Tulip  It is   their figure 1, which shows 90 percent confidence intervals for key forecast variables as of June   2007 No doubt, many of you read it  Actual events have far outstripped these measures of   uncertainty, so we are way outside the confidence bands that were put around forecasts at that           April 28–29, 2009 65 of 201  time except for inflation, and my interpretation of that is that we are quasi-inflation targeting and   inflation stays close to the target The memo does a great job of summarizing issues about   thinking about uncertainty in our models  We often talk about uncertainty around the table, but it   is hard to internalize the extent to which it is true and what the magnitudes really are   One way to think about how much uncertainty we face is to consider not just what has   happened in the United States in the last 20 years or even the last 4 years but to consider what   happens sometimes in foreign economies  You have lots of experiences internationally—many   different countries, many different times and places, and many different policies that have been   pursued, some of them with disastrous effects  Of course, we always say, “Well, those are   foreign countries That didn’t happen here”  But getting a range of experience and a range of   the kinds of things that can happen in what is a very explosive situation that is marked by panics,   runs, and huge expectational effects might give you a better idea of the kinds of outcomes that   might materialize going forward and how much uncertainty is really out there, as opposed to   what has happened just in the United States over a relatively benign period until recently   We know that macro expectations are critical for the behavior of the economy  This is   probably not the FRB/US model’s strong suit  The model is great at tracking the evolution of the   US economy in ordinary, relatively tranquil circumstances  It is not designed to capture the   types of dramatic global signaling effects that we have witnessed during the last nine months  So   I would downplay the predictions from the model at this juncture, and I think implicitly we all   say that I think that is also the recommendation of the staff—if you work with the model every   day, you understand what the limitations are, where the assumptions are, and what other kinds of   effects are not part of the design of the model           April 28–29, 2009 66 of 201  I just want to mention the memo by Eileen Mauskopf and Jae Sim, which I thought was   also quite good They also stressed the uncertainty about their estimates, which is certainly   dramatic  But at the same time, this memo begins to lay out the ideas about an optimal plan for   the Committee and for monetary policy going forward  Whatever policies we decide on, we do   need a reason that we think a particular path is the optimal one As I have said before, I would   like to get away from the one-time announcements that tend to surprise the market  When the   market is surprised by what we do, that is not necessarily a very good sign  That is a sign that   they are not understanding what we are up to, and that they are surprised at the time that the   announcement is made  That is not usually a signal that the policy is close to optimal  Current   policy in the United States is trading heavily on US credibility  If we were a small developing   country pursuing our current policies, I do not think we could get away with it  Expectations of   inflation would rise rapidly, in my opinion  So this shows how much credibility and   expectations will influence US outcomes going forward  We are leaning very hard on this   aspect, and the rest of the world is counting on our credibility   Our models are not good at dealing with these issues  The model, as I said before, is   designed to track in tranquil times  If we push too hard, we may again get surprised by outcomes   that are not potential outcomes that the model can describe  One possibility would be a sharp   rise in longer-term Treasury yields, such as that which the Chinese officials described to   President Fisher   I am concerned at this juncture about the potential for large mistakes  We have an output   gap, which is yawning by traditional measures  However, like President Plosser, I would   emphasize the New Keynesian concept of an output gap, which is probably far smaller  The   New Keynesian model is the leading theory on the table today in academia  In it, the economy           April 28–29, 2009 67 of 201  has to react to a very large and very real shock  The gap is then not the difference between what   happens on average and actual output but the difference between a flexible price concept of   output and the actual output that you get on sticky prices  That gap is likely to be much smaller   than what is described in our FRB/US model, and this has the potential, at this juncture, to be a   huge policy error   If you consider the description by Athanasios Orphanides, the rise of inflation during the   1970s was all based on poor estimation of output gaps and maybe poor concepts of output gaps    I think it is a clear and very pronounced risk in the current circumstances  If you think that the   economy had to react to this real shock and then the flexible price level of output is a little   different from the sticky price level of output, that’s your output gap  Otherwise, you think that   the output gap is way up here and so it is very different  A key medium-term risk for the   Committee is that we think about that concept in the right way   I will finish up with a few comments on the balance sheet  I have advocated splitting the   balance sheet into two components, and much of the analysis is doing that in various ways    There is a lot more discussion in terms of seeing certain programs as transitory, lender-of-last­  resort programs, so-called liquidity programs, as opposed to the persistent outright purchase   programs of MBS, Treasuries, and agency debt  One idea I would have going forward for the   lender-of-last-resort programs, one thing the Committee and the Board could consider, is trying   to price those programs so that they are all backstops  This means that especially the TAF, the   CPFF, and the swaps would all continue to exist, but we would arrange the pricing to make them   just outside what would be available through market channels  I am not sure exactly how this   could be done, but I think it could be done My sense is that we are closer to that right now than   we have been in the last nine months  If we could do that, you could take the volumes in those        April 28–29, 2009 68 of 201  programs down to zero, but the programs would remain in place with the backstop pricing in   case financial market turmoil again intensifies  This would provide the benefits of these   programs without clouding up the balance sheet with large volume, which might be helpful for   monetary policy going forward It is close to what a lot of people have talked about here—that   the programs would fade away But we could make them fade away by doing the pricing in just   the right way, so that they would be backstops, but they would not have much volume in them    Thank you    If I understand your comments correctly, the Committee has   effectively committed to more than what we said, according to the private sector’s view of what   we’re going to do, and probably more than what the Committee is going to do—because, if we   don’t believe our own cliff, it’s just not credible  It’s not a credible commitment to say we’re   just going to stop all at once at a point in time    The fact that the private sector has some expectation about what we’re   going to do doesn’t tell you anything  They’re always going to have an expectation about what   we are going to do, even if we’re a completely silent Committee  The point is that it is not   optimal policy as we’ve come to understand it over the last 25 years  You want to be in sync   with the markets, and a lot of that is that the measure of success is not announcement effects  If   you say that you’re going to buy a new category of assets that you have not talked about before,   you’re going to surprise the market  You’re going to get some effect on that day  It might have   nothing to do with optimal policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I was saying yesterday on the   economic outlook, my judgment is just that we’re going to have to see more data at this point    As many people around the table noted, turning points are notoriously hard to predict  And when   the economy is down, as Governor Tarullo and others noted, it is vulnerable to further shocks,   which might come from directions that are not contemplated right now  I’m also probably more   pessimistic about financial markets than most here  I think they probably have not improved all   that much, and I guess I would not put too much weight on stock price movements  These are   the guys that brought us the tech bubble, remember?  They just fluctuate way too much to take   them as much of a signal in the short term  So I think the basic mode for this meeting is that we   probably need more information  As many people, including President Pianalto and others,   emphasized, we’d like to see how these stress tests come out  This is a big near-term issue for   the Fed, and we’d like to see what happens there   A critical issue for this Committee is how the Fed bills are going to go and how they are   going to move through the Congress, as the Chairman was talking about yesterday  I’d also like   to hear more about interest on reserves and related issues—possible sterilization techniques—to   be discussed at the June meeting  That may change the framework of discussion around here   dramatically if we can think about those things and make more progress on those issues   On policy, we were very aggressive last time—appropriately so, I think  Part of the   argument around the table was that it was a timing issue with respect to housing and mortgage   markets  I agree with Governor Kohn  We’d like to learn more about the effects of those actions   as we go through the spring here Any further commitments that we would make on asset   purchases at this point would seem to apply mostly to a date in the future—say, the October–   December time frame  To me it seems unclear why we would make that commitment based on     April 28–29, 2009 134 of 201  the information we have today  We could make that commitment at a future meeting when we   have better information on how the economy is progressing  Also, alternative A, as I’ve been   arguing, does something I haven’t liked—it contains what seem to me to be arbitrary round   numbers of asset purchases  I do agree with President Yellen that outcomes are certainly bad;   and the fact is, as the Chairman was noting, in September–October this economy experienced a   very large, very real shock, and the economy is going to have to adjust to that shock  Optimal   policy can mitigate and help that adjustment, but it cannot offset it completely  So our job is to   figure out how much and what is the optimal path that we can calculate that will help as much as   we can help  But I think there are probably limits to what monetary policy can do in the face of a   very large and global shock   Of the many B alternatives, I like B′′, but I’m willing to entertain the discussion around   the table here A lot of good ideas are being mentioned here on this  So as I said before, I would   like to see policy expressed as a state-contingent rule to the extent possible  What we should   have in our heads is a Taylor-type rule for asset purchases  In a Taylor-type rule you do not say   what you are going to do with the funds rate in the future  You say, “Here’s the rule; here’s how   we react to developments in the economy”  Everyone understands this, this informs the entire   equilibrium, and that’s how the equilibrium works  We could maybe do the same kind of thing   for asset purchases and say that this is how we are going to react to incoming events and on   inflation, the output gap, and maybe other variables that we think are important, and that will   inform the entire equilibrium and this is how we go forward  Inside models, that is actually the   optimal way to proceed  I would like to try to get—and we have been doing a lot, and the staff   has done a lot, which I appreciate—more in that direction in a difficult environment when we   have a lot of challenges in front of us So that would be one way to implement what I would           April 28–29, 2009 135 of 201  interpret as the key lesson from optimal monetary policy in the past 20 or 25 years in academic   circles, as President Plosser and others have talked about   I like the emphasis that the Committee has adopted in a lot of the discussion here that   we’re concerned mainly about the persistent components of balance sheet expansion—agency   MBS, Treasuries, and agency debt—and that it is the key issue going forward  I like thinking of   those as one group, which some of the staff memos did—it’s a great way to think about it  I also   have the idea that I floated a bit yesterday that, for the more temporary programs—the liquidity   programs—to price them all as backstops just a little outside what would make all the volumes   fall to zero Those programs would stay in place, but then they would all get off the balance   sheet, and you would not be clouding up your balance sheet with these temporary liquidity   programs  They would still be there as a backstop; and if financial turmoil intensified, they’d be   there to be used But you’d have the idea that these things are used in time increments of weeks,   not months or years  I think we should think about that, but maybe I’m the only one who thinks   that we should   The temporary expansion of the balance sheet or the monetary base or asset purchases   even over many months is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on inflation in the medium term    We know that the effect of any policy depends importantly on the private-sector expectations of   that policy—that is, on the whole policy path  If we do not define a policy path, the market will   form expectations anyway and define a path for us, and so I think we should be clear in our own   heads about what we are trying to do, what we think the optimal policy path looks like, and why    It’s a state-contingent path  As I stressed yesterday, surprise announcements are not a   characteristic of optimal policy as I understand it  Good policy is a state-contingent plan that is     April 28–29, 2009 136 of 201  well understood by the private sector Most announcement effects tend to go away and might   mislead us on what the impact of policy really is   So I think the bottom line is that we should stand pat for today  We should get more   information on the economy, on the stress tests, on the Fed bills possibility, and on other   sterilization techniques I’d also like to look into the backstop pricing for liquidity programs    I’ll stop there Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I liked your explanation that you thought you had two   bases covered here That is the way I read it  I didn’t read it the way Governor Warsh did  "
8551,2009-06-03," Yes, a question for Bill Dudley  Wouldn’t the other rating agencies   follow suit and then change their methodology eventually, so the idea of having just one outlier   maybe isn’t that realistic over a medium term?   "
8562,2009-06-23," Just to follow up on that, are there examples of foreign central banks   that have been in a position like this?    My sense of this, then, is that you are at the mercy of the Treasury  If   they’re merciful, then they recapitalize you               June 23–24, 2009 48 of 261   That’s not the foreign experience    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to see if I have this right   about exit strategies And I have to say Brian Madigan’s memo here on liquidity facilities is a   masterpiece of clarity, so thank you for that, Brian   It’s super clear what we’re going to do and what we’re thinking about with each program,   why we’re thinking about it, why we’re thinking of the different options  And when I look at   large-scale asset purchases, it’s much less about exiting, and maybe it’s a little bit about coping    But I expected to see more about what we could do if we wanted to reduce our holdings, and all I   see is that we’re going to have to sell  So my question for Trish is this  Is the bottom line that   the plan is basically buy and hold?  In other words, when we’re buying now, we’re basically   committing to a very large balance sheet for a very long period of time, and then the other stuff is   all a question mark about what that means in terms of macroeconomics, that is, whether it’s   worrisome or dangerous or not  But as far as the balance sheet itself, it’s ramping up, and we   don’t see good ways to mitigate that    If you get into a high-inflation environment, it’s too late  We’ve   already failed at that point I can believe at that point you might want to take more radical   action, but the idea is to get this optimal path      Earlier this spring we were thinking of having Fed bills or a Treasury   program that would mitigate this problem  But those are now politically off the table  Is it   correct to think that now that they’re off the table we have basically committed to a large balance   sheet? That’s the way I read these memos    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just have a few quick comments  I agree   with all the points in the Madigan memo  I think it does recognize what is happening with our   liquidity facilities I have advocated before that we get them all priced as backstops and not that   they actually need to be used at every point in time  I would also announce a rescission date for   GSE lending Couldn’t we make that February 1, 2010, as well?  That would push it off into the   future and would line it up with the other dates as opposed to doing it immediately  I would go   ahead and raise the minimum bid rate  I don’t feel strongly on that  I guess I come out where   Governor Kohn and President Fisher have My thinking on that was that we could encourage   more-normal market functioning there  Vice Chairman Dudley brings up a good point, namely,   that it sounds like raising an interest rate  I think that’s a communication issue, and that would   have to be handled appropriately   On the issues related to exiting, my overall reading is that there are some very promising   but unproven ideas here, mostly to do with interest on reserves and reverse repos  We think   they’ll work, but at this point they’re not really proven  I guess I’m reluctant to go further with   asset purchases without more concrete ideas on how we’ll manage this going forward, although I   do admit that these are promising   The current policy response to the crisis has been to lower nominal interest rates to zero   and more than double the monetary base  I think this discussion indicates that that increase in   the monetary base will be very persistent, which is unprecedented in post-war US history  I am   worried that we don’t really know what the implications of that might be, and we don’t really   have tools in place to manage that  So we’re not really exiting from that increase in the base,   we’re just saying “That was our response We’re going to more than double the monetary base,   and we’re going to see what happens”           June 23–24, 2009 94 of 261  On asset purchases strategy, I’d be fine with the tapering off  I don’t feel really strongly   on that I think if we stick with our dates, the exit might go fine on the Treasuries   In the current environment of large fiscal deficits, as several people have mentioned,   including Governor Kohn, there’s always going to be talk about monetizing the debt  I just don’t   think we can get away from it in this environment  Anything we do that smacks of buying up   more Treasuries is going to be problematic  So even though I have advocated in the past for   treating MBS and Treasuries and debt all as one package and letting the Desk manage it, now I   think it may not be the best thing to do   I’m also sympathetic with President Rosengren, who spoke earlier this afternoon about a   state-contingent reaction function  I have advocated for this before here, and though I know we   are a long way from that, that’s really what you want  You want to be able to communicate to   the public that if the data come in a little bit worse, then we’re going to do a little bit more, and if   the data come in a little bit better, we’re going to do a little bit less  That’s the kind of thing that   you want You have that in something like a Taylor Rule for interest rate policy  You’d like that   for asset purchases We just haven’t been able to formulate something like that  I’d like to   encourage us to keep thinking in that direction  After all, zero interest rates might go on for   several years, so it’s not as if this situation is about to end  So I think we should still keep   thinking about that, but I know that we’re a long way from that at this point  Thank you very   much    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Eighth Federal Reserve District, the   decline in economic activity is slowing or stopped  Still, there are no immediate signs of   improvement during the summer or fall  Business contacts are definitely subdued  I might even   describe them as resigned to sluggish economic performance for the foreseeable future  In recent   calls that I made, there were some reports of slower activity in the second half of May and into   June, so we’ll see if that shows up in the numbers going forward  That worried me a little bit   On the national scene, my sense is that markets may have jumped ahead of the reality of   the economy during the last 60 or 90 days  That said, I am hoping for some improvement in the   second half, but I think there’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about where the economy   will be going forward  I think we’re vulnerable to further shocks  Shocks are unpredictable, so I   don’t know where they would come from  But when you’re down, other things can happen  I   also think that the longer that the recession drags on, the greater the likelihood that new problems   can arise that would not have been problems if the economy had turned around sooner  And I   just wanted to say I remain concerned about the global nature of this recession, which I think is   largely unprecedented in the postwar era     I’ve been concerned about possible deflation and a deflationary trap, that is, a steady state   that we could actually get stuck in If we were to enter such a trap in 2009 or 2010, we would   have a very hard time getting out  The first priority for me has been to avoid this outcome, and   that means building up inflation expectations  I think the probability that this will happen has        June 23–24, 2009 131 of 261  fallen some  For instance, the five-year TIPS inflation compensation has increased—it’s about   125 basis points now I know there’s a lot of analysis about exactly how to look at that  If you   just take it at face value, it has improved a lot from very negative values in December and   January, but it’s still not a lot of inflation over the next five years  It’s below our inflation target,   and you’d like to see it higher, I think  Also, the Greenbook forecast has inflation declining   further, so I don’t think we’re out of the woods on the deflation threat, although the outlook has   improved a lot from what it was in the December-January time frame   I think we’re entering a period of volatile expectations in markets  The markets are just   not sure what to think about the unprecedented policy environment  They’re looking at numbers   that they have not seen before, and they’re not sure what to think—large budget deficits where   the longer-term outlook is very unclear  Given that, I think our purchase program looks like—   and I put that in quotes “looks like”—debt monetization  I don’t think anybody involved wants   to go there, but that’s the appearance   And you’ve got legislation pending that may appear to threaten Fed independence  I   think the hard thing about our debt markets is that they’re global markets, so especially for those   outside the US who may not understand the subtleties of our politics, this just looks like a lot of   debt issuance by the Treasury and some purchases by the central bank  It’s just very hard to get   away from that perception, and that has made me pessimistic about further expansion of our   large-scale asset purchases   I think current policies are pushing very hard on our credibility  As I mentioned before, I   don’t think we could get away with these policies if we were a smaller developing country    Fortunately, we do have a large stock of credibility to draw upon, but we need to be careful  Just   because everything has gone well for a long time in the US doesn’t mean it will continue to do           June 23–24, 2009 132 of 261  so this time around  Again, the policy response to this crisis has been unprecedented, so the   current situation may not produce the outcomes that we hope for   I’m also concerned, along with President Plosser and others, about the emphasis in the   narrative on a large output gap keeping inflation at bay into the indefinite future  I don’t think   inflation is a near-term problem, but it could be a medium-term problem  I also think there are   conceptual difficulties with the traditional output gap measures  The empirical relationships are   not that great So the moment is really ripe for a possible policy mistake along this dimension,   since we’re coupling that with our unprecedented policy action  I think that’s going to remain an   issue for the FOMC for some time to come  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think alternative B is sensible at this   juncture In this situation, I’m going to argue here that it’s a good time to take stock and get   more information—we’d like to see how this recovery develops over the summer  Also, I think   we’re able to retain alternatives for future meetings, and I agree with Governor Kohn that we   may want to move at future meetings  So I’ll talk about several aspects of alternative B   On the bracketed last sentence concerning the exit strategy, I agree with some of the   comments that have been made that this may be more confusing than helpful with respect to the   LSAP program  We will discuss exit, and, as President Yellen said, it’s better discussed in   testimony  This is an inherently technical, complicated thing—it just will not come across in a   simple way to the general public  It takes a lot of explaining, and I think it will be hard to figure   out from this sentence what is meant in terms of exit strategy  I also prefer the “as warranted”   language   I want to talk for just a minute about forward guidance and naming specific dates for   when we might make future interest rate moves, as are contemplated in alternatives A and C    First of all, I think everyone has said that we need the conditionality—you need to know how the   economy is evolving in order to know when you’re going to make a move  Naming a specific   date seems to undermine that, and in fact, I think it might go the wrong direction  You might   essentially be pre-announcing a rate increase far ahead of when you actually have the   information to decide whether you want to do that or not  Of course, you could always move   later and get the market to move off that, but you’re kind of drawing this line in the sand, and   I’m not sure that’s what the Committee wants to do  I know other countries have done this One                 June 23–24, 2009 186 of 261  thing I will say about that is, when you do that, you do get announcement effects, but that’s   because you surprised the markets  That’s not necessarily good policy or a good thing to do   This business of promising to keep rates lower for longer works well in models, but   you’re pushing very hard on this rational expectations assumption inside the models—everybody   has great foresight about the future, everybody understands, there’s a lot of credibility—and I’m   not sure that that maps into the reality of our situation  Also, when you say “lower for longer,”   you mean relative to what would otherwise be the optimal policy rule, and I’m not sure that we   actually have that embedded out there in the market  I think the effects that we might get from   further strengthening our commitment to low rates further out in the future are probably lost in   the reality of the situation that we face  I also think there are limits, just because of discounting   in the future—if you promise to keep rates low far into the future, then that gets discounted by   the markets the farther you go into the future   In summary, I would just keep the “for an extended period” language at this meeting and   at future meetings  I think that taps into the amount that we can get out of that future   commitment, and it’s doing as much as we can on that dimension   Let me just make a few brief comments here about expanding the LSAP  I’ve   characterized this as increasing the persistent components of the balance sheet, so I would ignore   the components that are running off, such as the TAF  They are going up at a rapid rate As I   said earlier, you know, there are concerns about monetizing the debt, and I won’t go into those   again—I think that’s an appearance issue, not an intention on anybody’s part  Those perceptions   are very hard to control outside the US I guess what I think about LSAP is that we are only   about halfway through the current program  We don’t really need to commit to further purchases   at this time, but we have the optionality to do that later  I may be sympathetic with that later on         June 23–24, 2009 187 of 261  So right now I think it’s better to wait and gather information over the summer  On cliff effects,   I’m convinced now that we can just let the program expire as scheduled, and it won’t have a   major market disruption  Again, we have conditionality to do more if we want or if it seems   necessary   Let me just regale you with policy rules for large-scale asset purchases  President Lacker   said earlier that discretion is the enemy of clarity, which I thought was Shakespearesque of him   But we’ve not been clear about our reaction function with respect to these programs, and that   makes it hard not just for the public, but also for ourselves  You make a one-time announcement   and the market is wondering, well, will they make another announcement in six months and   another announcement six months after that?  It’s very hard to know   I think it’s the Committee’s job—I should add, not the Desk’s job—to get a reaction   function so that, if unemployment or output gaps deteriorated in a certain way, that would be the   case when we would do more Or the Committee could set some kind of mapping for how much   we would want to do in various situations  I actually think that would help us and allow us to do   more if necessary, because you’d be conveying this understanding of a state-contingent path out   there in the future, which is the object that we don’t have right now   Finally, this is a lost cause, but I would advocate moving the federal funds rate later in   the statement  I think it reduces emphasis on the federal funds rate as the key tool of policy    We’re seeing now that—everybody’s wondering, “Oh, maybe you’ll raise rates later this year or   next year” or something like that  It may be that, the way things are evolving, the fed funds rate   will turn out not to be our primary policy tool on the other side of this  So I think we should   think more about de-emphasizing the federal funds rate  Thank you, Mr Chairman              June 23–24, 2009 188 of 261 "
8591,2009-08-11," I am looking at exhibit 4, figure 24, on mortgage spreads  I just want   to understand your interpretation of this chart  I see toward the end here that conforming spreads   come down dramatically and the ARMs come down dramatically, but you said that you thought        August 11–12, 2009 11 of 165  the purchase program did not have an effect on the ARMs  That means just that the level is   high?    What about the sharp downturn that followed the other line?    I expect ARMs to be unpopular in the stage of the business cycle when   interest rates are low and people are talking about, well, when are you going to tighten, as   opposed to being in the stage of the business cycle when rates are higher and might come down   at some point    Thank you    Larry, a year ago or more, we talked some about regime-switching   models, where when we entered recession some of the relationships are different, coefficients are   different, and so on Now it appears that we might be exiting the recession  Would we switch   back to some sort of more normal times model, or is this all by the bye here?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy remains   weak The latest reading on Eighth District unemployment, 93 percent, is about the same as the   national average, but this does mask a considerable variation within the District  Arkansas, for   instance, has an unemployment rate of 71 percent, whereas Kentucky and Tennessee are at   11 percent This variation has actually increased the spread between those numbers, which has   about doubled in the last year   Like others here, the reports from my contacts are mixed  There are reports of continuing   job cuts from contacts in the automotive, transportation, electrical equipment, and aerospace   industries—Boeing has a big presence in St Louis  But firms in steel, fabricated metal,   furniture, and plastic products reported plans to actually hire additional workers  I would   interpret mixed signals like this as typical of a business-cycle trough, and I am hopeful that this           August 11–12, 2009 84 of 165  is what we are experiencing I think the story from the Eighth District is very consistent with the   narrative for the national economy   On the national outlook, I am encouraged by signs of improvement, especially that the   financial market turmoil continues to abate by many measures, but I think we still have some   way to go on that dimension  And while the financial sector continues to repair, we are still   vulnerable to further shocks, and so we have to remain vigilant  My sense is that we have   established the credibility of government guarantees in many areas since late last year, and that   the credibility of government guarantees has largely controlled what Governor Warsh and many   others have called the Panic of 2008  I think we may be at the end of that phase right about now    Control of the panic is not the same as actually having a healthy and efficient financial   intermediation sector  The next phase will be to emphasize efficiency and health in the financial   intermediation industry  My sense is that getting that right will have important consequences for   US economic growth in the medium term  In particular, the Japanese have been widely   criticized for not finding the right policies during this phase, contributing to their lost decade   outcome   I thought that during the intermeeting period our discussion and communication of exit   strategy, mainly by Chairman Bernanke but also by many others around the table, was very   useful Markets seemed to back off the idea that the Fed does not have a plan  I think we did   establish that the Fed certainly has tools and a plan for exit, and I think some medium-term   inflation fears receded during the intermeeting period because of that communication  More—   maybe much more—may have to be done in this area, though, because the message is quite a   complicated one, as I found myself trying to explain to people  We have complicated   interactions among our set of liquidity programs, the asset-purchase program, and what to do           August 11–12, 2009 85 of 165  about interest rates going forward in the longer or medium term  One lesson from this   intermeeting experience is that markets are still pretty focused on interest rates at the end of the   day, really overly focused on interest rates, given this Committee’s apparent plans and given the   fact that we have stressed that we intend to keep rates low for an extended period  I would like   to knock markets further off the focus on rates because our plans do not contemplate moving   back to ordinary interest rate targeting any time soon  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support alternative B, the revised   version I think the tapering ideas that have been expressed by the staff are fine, and I also think   that we can think about tapering the MBS program at the next meeting  As you know, I have   suggested growth rates instead of these flat, level amounts, which I find a bit arbitrary  They are   still in this Bluebook with $450 billion in alternative A  You may want to think about moving to   very low growth rates for these programs  You know, a lot of people have expressed the idea   about keeping the programs alive  You can move to very low growth rates, and I’ll talk a little   more about that in a minute  If we did that, we could react more easily if the data came in worse   than expected and we wanted to again expand asset-purchase programs   On policies to manage excess reserves, that sounds as though we’re planning to rely a lot   on our interest-on-reserves policy  I have a comment on that  I think it sounds expensive It   could be viewed as a large transfer to banks in an environment where that would be politically   quite unpopular As I understand it, the Congress opposed interest on reserves for decades   exactly because of the revenue implications  So this is just a caution that it seems as though we   are going down this path pretty rapidly and we are putting a lot of emphasis on interest on   reserves as a way to manage the very extensive excess reserves that are in the system, and it   could be viewed in an unflattering light   President Stern made some comments about the monetary base, and because I have the   last word and it’s his last meeting, I’m going to comment on that  It is true that, if you run   regressions over the last 25 years on the monetary base, you are not going to get very much  But         August 11–12, 2009 137 of 165  I just want to stress that we are in an absolutely unprecedented situation  We have more than   doubled the size of the monetary base  I do not think you can rely on whatever those regressions   said in the past as to what the outcomes of this experiment might be  So we have to be very   careful in thinking about what the implications are going forward  Of course, it all has to do   with, well, how would that ever get out into the money supply and so on, and what are future   policies?  How permanent is it, so on and so forth?  How much slack is there in the economy?   All of those things are important, but this is an unprecedented experiment in US monetary   policy   Let me turn to communication for a minute  I take the lesson of the last 25 years in   macroeconomics to be that it is important to communicate future policy partly because you care   about the future but also partly because it really affects your equilibrium outcomes today  It   informs the pricing today  We do not really have that for this asset-purchase program  I think   we made some progress in talking about exit strategy, and I actually think that was pretty   successful during the intermeeting period  But still, there is a lot of uncertainty about future   policy, say, over the next two years and about what we would do   I agree with President Yellen that, if we went with alternative B unrevised, it could be   interpreted that the Fed goes on hold We have said that we are not going to do any more asset   purchases According to the Greenbook, we are not going to raise the funds rate off zero for a   long time  So we just go on hold for two years I don’t think that is really the intent of the   Committee, and I would not want to lock us in that direction  As many people have said and I   think Governor Tarullo said, you have a pretty high probability that you will get an outcome that   isn’t very desirable over the next two years  Then the question is what the Fed’s reaction will be,   and I think you have to keep the option open that you might extend the asset purchases at that            August 11–12, 2009 138 of 165  point The market doesn’t know what we will do; this Committee doesn’t know what we will do   If we could reduce that uncertainty, that would help us a lot  I would like to make some progress   toward a more systematic policy on asset purchases and more generally a systematic policy while   we are at the zero bound   Let me just make a couple more comments  Fixed dates for rates at zero—some of the   language in these policy options says things like we will keep rates low until the end of the year   or we will keep rates at zero until the middle of next year  I really prefer not to get into the   particular dates for when we might raise rates  I think it does two things that we don’t like  First   of all, it de-emphasizes the state-contingent nature of optimal policy  Everything depends on the   data It depends on how the data on the economy come in  So I do not think that we should be   saying, all of a sudden, that we are going to make it non-state contingent and that just at this   certain date we are going to do something Also, I think it sets up an expectation that we really   will raise rates at that point, and we may not want to do that at that point  This is not in   alternative B, but it is in the other alternatives  I think it is not something we want to get into in   any of our alternatives   Lastly, I agree with President Plosser and many others who have commented here   concerning the narrative that slack alone will contain inflation pressures going forward, which is   really reflected in paragraph 2 of our statement and has been there for a long time in alternative   B I think too much reliance on this view could lead to a policy mistake and a repeat of the   1970s experience There are three problems with the output gap  One is the conceptual   problems that were outlined by President Lacker  Another is empirical fit, as mentioned by   President Stern No matter how you do the measurement, it just doesn’t help you that much in   forecasting inflation It helps a little, not much  And the third one, which has not been     August 11–12, 2009 139 of 165  mentioned, is that it is also inconsistent with a lot of our rhetoric about a bursting bubble  If you   think that something went wrong and you had some housing bubble or some other kind of bubble   and this thing collapsed on you, you can’t be saying, well, we want to go back up to this bubble   level of output When you get into the discussions of potential output, bubbles are out of the   picture, right?  But when you’re talking about the economy and the situation today, bubbles are a   big part of the story So that’s another piece that I think is inconsistent with our current rhetoric   about output gaps Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    It is a great example to look at  I don’t think theirs was that persistent,   and so they didn’t get that much inflation  Ours is looking pretty persistent  "
8619,2009-09-22," I just want to understand exhibit 4 and number 19, the MBS   option-adjusted spread You cited this figure as evidence that there was an effect on the   purchase program, and I just want to understand how we should think of this  If you look at the   left part of the graph—from August 2000 to August 2003—that would be a period of recession   and very slow economic growth following the recession, and the spread fell maybe 80 basis   points, just eyeballing it In the current episode, you’ve got a much more severe recession, and   the spread fell maybe 100 basis points  There was no asset-purchase program in the earlier   period, and, if we control for recession effects, maybe there wouldn’t be very big effects from   the asset-purchase program Or do we not want to interpret it that way?    Are we doing the policy debate now?  I can get into the policy debate,   if you want    You just said, “Don’t go off on your policy round today”  He’s   preempting the debate    I don’t mind, but if you want to do it now, we can do it now    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy performed   somewhat better than the US economy as a whole during the summer  According to our   calculations, 16 metropolitan statistical areas in the Eighth District actually had slightly positive   June–July job growth As you know, the US remained negative as a whole, of course  Some of   this reflected auto production recalls, but generally I took it as a positive sign for the Eighth   District economy  In fact, job growth has been less negative in 2009, generally, for the Eighth   District versus the nation   However, anecdotal information does not line up with the national forecast for growth in   the second half of 2009, and here I would agree completely with President Fisher  A general                 September 22–23, 2009 89 of 212  comment from directors and business contacts is  “There’s official talk about recovery, but we   don’t see recovery in our businesses  And we’re not planning on recovery, and we’re hunkering   down” I find that somewhat worrisome, because it is ubiquitous, and because we’re already at   the end of the third quarter I would have expected to hear more positive anecdotes coming from   the July–August–September period It could be that these contacts are not seeing a return to   previous levels It’s always a little hard to interpret when you’re talking to businesspeople    They may only be seeing stabilization at a low level, and they’re thinking back to the good old   days when they had much higher levels  I did get just a few firms reporting that they’re more   optimistic now and are seeing better business conditions, to the point where they might consider   additional cap ex One firm was in health care, and another was in transportation   On the national outlook, I agree that the US economy is poised to return to growth after   a year of declining GDP  I am anxious, as many of you probably are, to actually see positive   growth as opposed to just market anticipation of that growth or macro forecasts of that growth    The current scenario does seem quite a bit stronger than some of the darker scenarios from   earlier this year when we took aggressive policy actions  I hope that what we’re seeing is a   durable bottoming out in housing, and I do find it heartening that the recovery internationally has   been stronger than expected I was one who was consistently worried that the global nature of   this recession might present special problems for the FOMC, but I think that worry has subsided   somewhat, as the bounceback in Europe and emerging Asia and elsewhere has been very strong,   or stronger than expected   I remain worried about inflation expectations over the medium term  Of course, we have   lots of surveys and market-based measures of these expectations  They seem to be well   anchored However, I’m worried that these may not be that informative  I think the typical     September 22–23, 2009 90 of 212  market participants or survey respondents are effectively saying that the policy looks a little bit   crazy, but they kind of trust us to get the right inflation in the end  And so they say, “Okay, I   will predict 2 percent, even though I can’t really see how you guys are going to do it”  I think   that is what’s going on with a lot of the market-based measures and the survey measures     Let me just follow up on this  It seems to me that people who hang around central   banking and financial markets really don’t know what to think about the unconventional policies   that our Committee is pursuing And I’m not sure, really, that we know ourselves what to make   of these policies, because we don’t have models or a lot of experience with them  So the   situation is that informed opinion is all over the map—you do see that when you talk to people in   financial markets  I think that creates a risky situation for the FOMC  It may appear, based on   surveys, that expectations are well anchored, but it’s masking a real uncertainty that’s out there    Some people think there might be a lot of deflation, and some people think there might be a lot   of inflation, and they’re not sure what to think   In conjunction with this, I’m concerned that current policies do not have a clear   state-contingent aspect to them  The last 25 years of macroeconomics has argued that good   optimal policy reacts to shocks, reacts to the incoming information on the economy  The   canonical Taylor rule is one way to do that  But no matter what policy you want to pursue, you   would want to have the state-contingent character to it  How this reaction occurs needs to be   communicated to markets  That informs the market pricing and the interest rates today, so it   does matter what people think your future policy is going to be, and that means some kind of   mapping to how you are going to react to future shocks  Those expectations, then, complete the   equilibrium, and that’s how the equilibrium is supported            September 22–23, 2009 91 of 212  I’m concerned that we’re not doing that effectively right now  At this meeting, we’re   seeing that the outlook has improved substantially over what we thought earlier in the year  But   we’re going to largely continue, based on previous decisions, without very much explicit   reaction to the change in circumstances  That doesn’t sound like the optimal state-contingent   policy we need And we’re not communicating because, I think, we don’t know how we might   adjust in the future  So it strikes me that this is an area where current policy could be improved    If we could make adjustments in that direction, I think the benefits would include a more   effective program for us and better economic performance for the nation  Thank you    Do you mean that we’re at the zero bound?    Definitely at the zero bound  We’ve got other policies, though  We   could tell markets how we’re going to adjust  Let’s suppose we get bad news in the January–   February–March period, and the economy didn’t turn out the way we had hoped  Markets would   like to know now, if we got in that situation, how we’d react  And I just don’t think we’re ready   to tell them, but we’d like to be able to tell them as part of an optimal policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I see it, current FOMC policy has three   parts One part is our liquidity programs, one part is an asset purchase program, and the third   part is a near-zero interest rate policy   The liquidity programs are running off, and, in my view, that seems to be going   smoothly  I would see that as the panic receding and as our having performed our lender-of-last­  resort function by developing liquidity programs to address the crisis   On the near-zero rate policy, if you look at the previous two recessions, it was about two   and a half to three years before a rate move following the end of a recession  So it could be that   this FOMC is different from previous incarnations, and I do think that the “too low for too long”          September 22–23, 2009 155 of 212  argument will weigh heavy on us in the coming quarters  But just taking the staff forecast at face   value, and taking the experience in the previous two recessions, we are looking at a rate move in   the first half of 2012, if you believe that back of the envelope estimate  During the interim, more   shocks are going to hit the economy  In my mind, the question is how to run an active monetary   policy to be able to react to these shocks while your interest rate policy is going to remain on   hold for some period It seems to me, like any reaction, it would have to come through asset   purchases So the question is how to do this   The policy we’re contemplating, to me, looks like this  We’re contemplating ending the   asset-purchase program in the first half of 2010, and we’re contemplating letting the natural   runoff draw down the purchased MBS over a period of several years, as long as six years  A   round number for that runoff is $200 billion a year, so let’s just tuck that away and keep that in   mind  We’re going to use other tools to control the flow of excess reserves into the money   supply, if we should get into a situation where the excess reserves start to move in that direction    In my view, there’s nothing optimal about relying on this natural runoff  This is just an   unconditional decline, regardless of how news arrives about economic performance  So in my   view, the question would be Can we do something that leaves the Committee in a better   position to control this situation?   Here’s my suggestion  I think we could taper, as suggested by the staff, but not to a full   exit from the MBS purchase program, or, more generally, asset purchase program, as suggested   by President Rosengren, President Yellen, and many others in the discussion just now  In my   view, if we quit the program altogether, it will be harder to make adjustments  Of course, you   could always come back and say, “I’m going to restart the program,” but it’s going to be very   difficult, and it would take a big event to get that going  So one idea would be—and I talked           September 22–23, 2009 156 of 212  about this last time—to taper to a very low number; a number that makes sense to me, just to fix   ideas in our head, would be something like $4 billion per week  That would add up to roughly   $200 billion a year, and I would leave it to the Desk as to the best way to transition to that   You could think of that, maybe, as a neutral policy, then—you’d be replacing the natural   runoff And you’d still have a program that was intact  Then, you could take action from there   depending on how conditions evolve and how the recovery evolves going forward  So this is one   way to go to a much lower growth rate of MBS purchases  By keeping the program open, we   can react as news arrives on the economy  If the recovery is unexpectedly soft or we face   renewed problems, we could increase the pace of purchases, though probably not up to numbers   like $50 billion a week If the recovery is unexpectedly robust, we could consider selling some   amount per week, probably without too much market disruption  Of course, we would do all of   this in conjunction with other tools, such as interest on reserves and reverse repos   One idea about going in this direction is that it might help us avoid an early pullback   from our quantitative easing program, like the one that doomed the Japanese quantitative easing   program in the early part of this decade  I don’t think we want to get into that boat  I’m   describing an alternative strategy for where to place the asset purchase program in 2010  The   discussion today is mostly about tapering and the size of the MBS program  My proposal is to   think less about the size of the program in an absolute sense and more about how we might want   to adjust the program going forward based on incoming information  I would agree with   President Lacker that as long as we continue to purchase assets, we’re implementing a policy of   further easing  So I don’t really see how we’re pulling back in any sense on that  The liquidity   programs are running off, but I see those as related to the panic        September 22–23, 2009 157 of 212  For today I support alternative B with some caveats  Like President Plosser, I think we   should retain the “up to” language to retain flexibility  I’m talking about transitioning to a slow   pace of purchases, but not to zero, in a reasonable time frame  We may end up at a level of   anywhere between $1 trillion to $125 trillion, but it does not have to be $125 trillion  For the   agency debt, it may be reasonable to stop short of the $200 billion, given the market disruption   and the difficulties there So, like Governor Kohn, I would want to retain flexibility by keeping   the “up to” language   I prefer the second quarter of 2010 for the transition  I guess my idea was, at least for   today, that would give us some room to continue to adjust our program at future meetings and   maybe move to this small flow purchases model at some future date   And, lastly, I think it is entirely appropriate, as in alternatives B and C, to mention the   stability of inflation expectations in paragraph 2 when talking about the inflation outlook  In my   view, this better reflects modern theories of inflation determination and, I think, views around   the table I think most everyone talks about slack in the context of stable inflation expectations    As I said yesterday, I’m actually suspicious of how anchored these expectations really are  I   think we’re seeing a lot of faith in the Fed, even in the face of our unprecedented policy actions    My sense is that informed opinion on inflation is as widely dispersed as it has been at any time   since the 1970s in the United States  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Starting with the red part?    “The Committee will gradually slow”—    I would like to leave it more open  I don’t have exact language Was   this what you were proposing, President Rosengren?    I wasn’t sure if what he was suggesting was consistent with what I   said    I guess my thought was just to take it to the second quarter and then, if   you wanted to go this direction, you could do so at a future meeting  "
8645,2009-11-03," Yes I’m looking at exhibits 17 and 18, which show the effects of   large-scale asset purchases And we have some pretty substantial effects here, which I can see   and I agree with But there are no measures of uncertainty around these  So I wonder if you   could comment on how much confidence you would put in these estimates because they are   probably very difficult to estimate  Now, the one on the left maybe looks as though some   statistical significance is there     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a question about swap lines  I like the   memo, and I like the approach  The policy of discontinuing the swap lines with certain central   banks—I’m not quite sure where that leaves us because it seems as though now that, when we get   into another crisis, the presumption would be that we would reestablish those lines with those banks   since we did so this time around  So I’m not quite sure how to place your description of what we   are doing here in that context because I think that there would certainly be overwhelming pressure   in another crisis of this magnitude to reestablish those swap lines  Then you would have the   difficulty of having to, as you say, renegotiate and set up the details, as you did this time  So I’m   wondering what you think about that as opposed to the idea that we are pulling back and we’re   maybe implicitly saying that we may not reestablish with, say, South Korea or other countries like   that in the future  What’s your thinking on that?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to follow up and echo the   points that President Yellen was just making  We have talked a lot here about swaps, and it has   always been a very intuitive thing about what countries are included and which are not and why   not I think what we need is to lay out a policy for why countries are in and why countries are   out, and then we would have something to say when Singapore comes to us as to why we are   making the decision that we are making  I understand it is wrapped up with other sorts of   geopolitical considerations But there should be some sort of basic criteria that will delineate   why certain countries—I can imagine Asian countries being moderately upset that the Swiss are                        November 3–4, 2009 53 of 201  in, for instance When I say Swiss, “It’s a small country, come on  This is an old club that you   guys have been fostering for years”  And “You just don’t like us because we’re in Asia”  I can   imagine that that is sort of the attitude  So if we could delineate a clearer policy about why we   are doing this, that would also help us a lot on the Mexican situation and Canada, which has been   inherited from the NAFA treaty But you guys all know this  It is all very sensitive because of   the difficulties of assessing country risk and really saying, “Hey, your economy is not up to this”    So that is where I think we should go      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy has generally   performed better than the US economy as a whole during the last two years  Payroll employment   nationally has declined about 54 percent since 2007, since the recession began  In the District, for   16 metropolitan statistical areas, payroll employment has declined only about 37 percent—bad to   be sure but considerably better than the nation as a whole  This generally extends across two-digit   SIC codes  One exception is education and health, which has actually grown 37 percent nationally   during the same time period but has grown only 28 percent in the District metropolitan statistical   areas Very recent data on employment in the District, however, have been worse than in the nation   as a whole, and we’re watching this very closely  But the District data tend to be more volatile, as   you might expect, and it is not clear at this point how meaningful they are, but I will report on that   in the future Eighth District unemployment is just over 9 percent in our sixteen MSAs  Anecdotal   reports indicate—as many of you have noted and, I’m sure, will note—that commercial real estate is   a key concern  The near-term outlook for this area is quite grim indeed  Businesses are very   reluctant to hire, and we are in an environment of continued business caution and continued caution   on capital expenditures, in particular                                    November 3–4, 2009 72 of 201  Nationally, I thought it was heartening to see the positive GDP growth number after four   consecutive declines I have actually seen only two positive numbers since joining the Committee    [Laughter]  I have seen four negative ones  So I hope that this is one in a long string here  I was   also heartened I take this as hard evidence that the recession is ending and that we are in a position   to recover from this very deep and very severe recession  We certainly had an equity market rally   through the spring and summer, but that was based on an expectation of actually better performance   in the fall of 2009 and, I think, also the marking down of the probability of a very severe   depression-like outcome during the spring  That was an expectation of good numbers coming in    So it was heartening to see a good number actually come in  I expect that the economy will   continue to grow in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2010 and that the probability of   returning to recession at this point is small  I think history shows that the double-dip recession is   actually not that common an outcome  It could happen, but it is not that common   Based on both business contacts and models, I expect that labor market outcomes will   continue to lag behind the rest of the economy, and I continue to be encouraged by growth globally,   on the whole  I was one who was very worried about the global nature of this downturn  I thought   we might get stuck in a new reality that we did not understand completely and that we had not faced   in the postwar era  That has turned out to be unwarranted  We have a lot of growth globally, and I   find that very encouraging    I continue to believe that there is a near-term deflation risk and a medium-term risk of   higher-than-desired inflation, and that is how I have continued to describe the inflation outlook  I   do think the near-term deflation risk is fading  I am not quite ready to give it up completely; maybe   if we make it all the way into 2010  For instance, year-over-year CPI headline inflation is actually   still negative So I am still a little worried that, if we got some bad data over the winter, you could                    November 3–4, 2009 73 of 201  get into a deflationary scenario  But the risk of that is fading  The medium term—say, two-to­  three-year—inflation risk is rising because of large fiscal deficits and a very accommodative   monetary policy, which may, in fact, overwhelm all other considerations   Inflation expectations are relatively stable, indeed; but in my opinion, it is a bit of an   illusion I think expectations are more at risk of becoming unmoored today than at any time in the   25 years prior to this crisis  If we were a smaller, emerging-market type of economy pursuing the   policies we are pursuing today, we would not do very well  Investment would flee our country, and   our currency would depreciate a lot  We do not see those outcomes in the United States partly   because we’re the big kid on the block  We have a lot of size, and we have a reservoir of credibility   on our side  But those advantages do not guarantee success and should not lull us into complacency   about the types of outcomes that can materialize when you put these types of policies in place   The Greenbook policy path for the fed funds rate seems unlikely to me  I think we may be   forced into a tightening action well before 2012, even though the 2012 date is actually consistent   with the past behavior of this Committee  In the past the Committee has not started a tightening   cycle until two and a half to three years after the recession was over  That was the case in 1994 and   again in 2004  Our quantitative easing program as envisioned in the Greenbook looks suboptimal to   me  It is unclear to me why we should take a large position in agency MBS arguing that it   influences long-term interest rates and then not adjust on that margin in reaction to incoming data on   the economy  This is a tool that we can and should use to carry out stabilization policy for the   United States during the period when our preferred short-term interest rate instrument is near zero    The Greenbook does not do this so far, as the key assumption is buy and hold for agency MBS with   no change in purchases beyond those currently scheduled  That sounds to me like a suboptimal                           November 3–4, 2009 74 of 201  policy  It should be a state-contingent policy, and I would like to see more along these lines  But I   will reserve the rest of my comments on policy for tomorrow  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to focus my remarks on a suggested   handling of the asset-purchase program going forward versus exclusive focus on interest rate   movements as the next important policy choice for this Committee  I have been disappointed by an   overemphasis on interest rates in the markets versus discussion of the quantitative easing program  I   think that this reflects a hangover from a long period of time, 25 years or longer, when interest rate   movements defined what this Committee was doing with regard to monetary policy, and that   markets have not really fully adjusted to the fact that we have other tools in place that we can adjust   to try to implement a stabilization policy  Then at the end, I’ll turn to a few comments on issues   about the statement and alternative B   A broad description of monetary policy over the last year to my mind would go like this  In   December 2008, almost one year ago, we adopted our near-zero interest rate policy  In January   2009, we naturally switched to a quantitative easing program focused primarily on agency MBS,   which if I’m not mistaken, the Chairman has described as relatively standard now around the world   for many central banks  And in March 2009, we made a dramatic expansion of that commitment,   which we’re still living up to and which will not be completed until the first quarter of 2010  The                                       November 3–4, 2009 150 of 201  quantitative easing program has been considered successful, and we saw some estimates yesterday    I think we all understand that there’s a lot of uncertainty around those estimates; nevertheless, I   think it is generally considered to have been an effective program   When I talk about monetary policy, I try to exclude liquidity programs that I regard as   lender-of-last resort responses to the crisis, such as swaps, the TAF, and commercial paper  All   those facilities that are now running down; they reached a peak of almost $15 trillion, but now are   all winding down So I consider those separately, and I consider the asset-purchase program to be   the hallmark of our quantitative easing program  This description suggests a certain logic, believe it   or not, to current policy, which is to pursue interest rate targeting in normal times and to switch to   quantitative easing if the zero bound is encountered  And that suggests that the tightening sequence   should go the other way  gradually remove the quantitative easing and then raise rates later as   appropriate, given the information that comes in on the economy   Now, I think one of the key problems from the point of view of the way the Committee is   thinking right now is that we do not currently view our quantitative easing program in feedback rule   form There is some talk about it, but we don’t really think in terms of adjusting the quantitative   easing program one way or another in response to incoming data  We more or less have the idea   that we’re going to go to our limit that we set in March of last year and then we’re going to stay   there and let it run off the balance sheet  I do not think that that is an optimal policy  We should   begin to adjust that program going forward in 2010, and in particular, possibly sell some MBS as   the first indication of a tightening move   So what are the advantages of proceeding in this direction? I see this as a softer way to   tighten policy than making a funds rate move or even than changing the “extended period” language   as described in the extra section in the Bluebook this time  If we make any moves on the funds rate                     November 3–4, 2009 151 of 201  target or really interest on reserves—a phrase that used to be used around here was “ringing the   gong”—we’re really making a loud statement that we’re now embarked on a tightening program    People will immediately extrapolate a whole sequence of moves, and that will be a big event when   it occurs Maybe it’s a long way away, as Governor Kohn just said, but that would be a big move    So if we did it this other way, which says, “Okay, we’re going to gradually sell off some of the   MBS,” that would be softer  That’s one point     I also think it allows some optionality during our current period of near-zero interest rates    We can adjust the quantitative easing program in response to incoming information Possibly, very   possibly, the news will not be good, and we might need to adjust in an upward direction  Several   people here have remarked about all the uncertainty  I think we all have to keep in mind that there’s   just a giant amount of uncertainty around any forecast  It could come in very badly next year, or it   could come in very positively  We don’t know  There are a lot of possibilities out there   Let me say I agree with President Yeltsin–Yeltsin?  [Laughter]  You told that story, and I   was going to avoid that  I agree with President Yellen that we should defend our inflation target on   the low side as well as on the high side  Just because the history of the last 25 years was all about   ratcheting down inflation, that’s not really the environment that we are in today  Inflation is very   low and maybe threatens to go lower, and we have to keep that in mind and be aggressive and   attentive on that   Also, what I’m suggesting would take some of the unusual assets off our balance sheet, and   I think that that would be helpful  This institution has not normally held assets like this in the past    It would be better for the institution and better for Fed independence to get out of the business if we   could and if we could do it in a way that would support recovery going forward and would also   mitigate interest rate risk problems that may accrue later as rates rise  Of course, we could also                                 November 3–4, 2009 152 of 201  combine asset sales or any kind of asset adjustments with a higher funds rate if that became   necessary  So that would also be on the table  In particular, if the news came in particularly strong   over the next year to 18 months, we’d still have that option on the table   So I want to think of the quantitative easing program in terms of fed funds rate equivalence    When the zero bound is encountered, then you switch to the quantitative policy, which has,   according to our estimates, some stimulative impact  You can think about some kind of mapping   that translates that across to—if you could lower the fed funds rate further, how much impact would   that have That’s what you’re getting out of the quantitative easing program, and that’s how you   should think about it Then we would be gradually reducing that accommodation going forward    For today, I favor alternative B  I don’t have a lot of comments about the text itself, but I do   think, as a general comment, that we tend to overemphasize arguments concerning resource slack    I’m not saying that we should put zero emphasis on them, but I think we overemphasize them as   causal for inflation  I know that we’re going to discuss these issues in more detail at the December   meeting, and I think we should just wait until then to get further into those comments  I like one   aspect of alternative C that President Plosser mentioned, which is paragraph 2  It more accurately   reflects that we think inflation is going to stay close to target because we think we’re going to take   the actions that are going to keep inflation close to target  Instead of leaving us subject to the whims   of how the economy is developing going forward, that would better reflect the situation with respect   to inflation  So I like that aspect  I don’t expect us to adopt it today, but that’s something to think   about going forward  So thanks very much    "
8672,2009-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I just wanted to make sure I   understand exhibits 19 and 20 and the effects of tapering  We’re tapering now, and we’ve gotten   some distance along that path I guess these charts right below are meant to say that the effects   have been minor, or there haven’t been any effects, even though people in the market said, “Oh,   you’re going to back up these rates”  Is that a fair assessment?    Okay But, nevertheless, they think if we keep going, then you’re   going to get a big effect at some point in the future?    Okay So they’re sticking to their story  [Laughter]    And we’re going to watch it, because we’re going to be tapering for   another 90 days or so                    December 15–16, 2009 27 of 247   Okay So I have just one question on the survey  You say, “selling   assets” Well, what do you mean “selling assets?”  If you say you’re going to dump $1 trillion   worth of MBS onto the market, yes, that’s going to have a big effect  But if you sell it in some   measured way that makes sense, then it seems like these are the right pictures to be thinking   about—a first pass at how that would happen    Thank you              December 15–16, 2009 28 of 247   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question on the term deposit   facility One of the provisions is “no early withdrawal,” but another provision is “you can be   pledged as collateral at the window” Those seem to be in conflict    Well, you might turn that around and say, “Then, why have a ‘no early   withdrawal’ provision?”    Is this the comment period for the Committee?                 December 15–16, 2009 35 of 247   Okay One of the aspects of the TDF is, “well, now we’re going to   drain reserves” How meaningful is it to say that I’ve got an overnight deposit at the central   bank versus I’ve got a 30-day deposit at the central bank, one of which I’m going to count as   reserves and in the monetary base, and the other of which I’m not going to count in that?  It   seems to me the macroeconomic difference is very slight    There’s a question about how liquid it really is, but it seems that it’s   very substitutable I can wait 30 days and take it out    There’s variable liquidity among various assets, and you should have   metrics about the degree of liquidity, and then get your measure of how much liquidity is out   there, instead of arbitrarily saying certain assets are liquid and others are not               December 15–16, 2009 36 of 247   Do we expect the interest rates in this facility to be anything other than   the expected interest rate on reserves over the six months?  Plus a term premium    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District business conditions are   showing modest improvement, according to many business contacts  However, business leaders   remain very cautious about the outlook for the economy  This is affecting business behavior   with respect to capital expenditure plans for 2010, and it is also having a big effect on hiring        December 15–16, 2009 49 of 247  plans The cautious mood is typically attributed to three factors  One is weak demand for final   products, although that aspect is improving modestly  The second is uncertainty over the scope   and nature of national policy changes, as often cited by business contacts  One contact said in a   meeting, “Tell me what the rules are; tell me what the tax rates are—I will proceed with business   planning then and only then” The third factor is a residual pessimism concerning the direction   of the economy over the next two years, worries that the economy simply will not recover as it   has in the past—the idea is that something fundamental has changed in the economy and may not   be in the process of repair   Energy firms in the Eighth District report weak conditions in the US  Low energy usage   and high levels of inventory accumulation are leading to continued cuts in hours in employment   in that sector In Asia, in contrast, the energy sector is very robust as we heard earlier in our   report on the international conditions   Large transportation firms in the District report increasing volumes for the first time in a   long time, as well as increasing revenues  These firms have been surprised on the upside   regarding Christmas activity  They’ve had to scramble to meet transportation demands,   especially from Asia, in recent weeks   Banking conditions are generally weak in the Eighth District, as I’m sure they are across   the country Commercial real estate remains a huge concern  Bankers generally felt that the   FDIC does not have the resources or a plan to close banks as rapidly as necessary in the current   environment  Many contacts are worried, in addition, about a looming crisis in state-level   financing I have heard earfuls about that problem   On the national outlook, it looks as if we remain on track for a strengthening economy in   2010 I was encouraged by the strength of the November employment report  Despite the drop        December 15–16, 2009 50 of 247  in jobs, it was much less than expected  I think it’s reasonable to expect positive payrolls in the   first months of 2010  Positive GDP growth in the third quarter, and apparently now in the fourth   quarter, suggests the recession has ended in terms of rule-of-thumb metrics  But I want to   remind the Committee, because employment is only now turning the corner, the actual recession   end date may be closer to the end of 2009, as opposed to mid-2009  This issue has an arbitrary   flavor to it, but it does affect popular perceptions of the state of the economy, as well as both   consumer and business expectations   Financial market stress continues to abate  It’s important to remember that some stress   does remain  If we were comparing January 2007, a pre-crisis date, to today, without the   intervening period, we would be amazed at how much financial market stress was out there  We   would be saying that financial market stress is well above normal compared to that benchmark    It’s only because that stress was so high last fall that it seems relatively less painful today  Still,   I’m encouraged by the improvements that we’ve seen, and I expect further improvement in the   first half of 2010 in financial markets   I think an important question for the Committee, and for the outlook, is  Could financial   market turmoil somehow reemerge?  We’ve seen a little bit of trepidation in the intermeeting   period with events in the Middle East I think it could reemerge, although the levels of   government guarantees worldwide that were implemented during 2008 and 2009 suggest that   markets are unlikely to panic as they did in 2008  But I don’t think that risk is completely down   to zero   On the inflation side, I think inflation risks remain confined to the medium-term,   anywhere from two to five years from now  Actions we take today and through 2010 will shape   those risks I would stress again that current policy is completely unprecedented in the postwar           December 15–16, 2009 51 of 247  US period Uncertainty is high, both around this table and in financial markets, on what the   effects of our policies will be Econometric analysis using data from the last 25 years is unlikely   to provide a completely reliable guide to possible outcomes in this situation   On balance sheet issues, as I have said before, I still prefer that the Committee take a   more active stance on managing the balance sheet going forward  I thought the memo from the   Desk and Brian Sack’s discussion today on runoff issues for the balance sheet made it clear that   there is nothing optimal about pursuing any of the passive strategies  These are just possible   strategies that we could pursue, but an optimal strategy would somehow talk about how we were   going to react to the incoming information on the economy during the period of zero interest   rates, which, according to the Greenbook, will still be most of—or all of—the next two years   The idea of taking a completely passive approach to balance sheet issues is very much   counter to all that we have learned about optimal monetary policy over the last 25 years  The   asset-purchase program, at least according to the analysis by staff, is thought to have an   important real effect on the economy  So my question is  Why ignore these effects when   developing plans to get the balance sheet back to normal size over some time horizon?  If the   economy performs better than expected, we may want to normalize the balance sheet sooner than   2016, or later, as would happen under a passive policy  If the economy performs worse than   expected—suppose we are back in recession next fall—it seems clear that we would want to   expand purchases further   And let me reiterate the amount of uncertainty that is inherent in any forecast  If you just   look at the staff estimates of uncertainty, for instance, 6 percent real GDP growth in 2011 is   actually within the Greenbook’s 70 percent confidence interval  So that’s one possible outcome,   and it is not an outlandish outcome  When you get nine months, a year, 18 months down the        December 15–16, 2009 52 of 247  line, the economy may look very different from what it looks like today  And we have to have   policies in place to be ready for those types of possible outcomes   Announcing the end of the asset-purchase program in the first quarter of 2010 is not as   transparent as I would like, because it suggests that we would not take further actions, when in   fact we would in certain states of the world, as long as interest rates remain near zero  So it   would also be helpful to be able to make smaller adjustments meeting by meeting as information   arrives on the state of the economy, as we would with our interest rate instrument   Finally, if we can, we would like to move the unsavory assets that have caused us some   trouble off the balance sheet faster than current projections envision, but in a way that would still   support recovery We could do that in one of two ways  We could replace them with Treasuries,   which was discussed a little bit earlier, or we could just sell them outright, as appropriate, but in   a way that would not upset financial markets and cause a backup in rates  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support alternative B, but with one   change I would agree with President Plosser that the inflation paragraph from alternative C is   the more appropriate one  The inflation paragraph in alternative C says the following  “Longer­  term inflation expectations have been stable, and the Committee expects that, with appropriate   monetary policy adjustments, inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability”  I   think that’s a better statement of what we’re up to here at the FOMC  It takes ownership of the   inflation outcomes, which I think is appropriate for the Committee, and I also think that   statement does not preclude any factors that might influence inflation  We look at many things    We look at all the indicators that we can, both in the US and globally, and the factors that might   influence inflation  But it does claim responsibility that at the end of the day it’s up to us to   maintain low and stable inflation           December 15–16, 2009 118 of 247  Future statements may have to reconsider what we’re saying about the federal funds rate    I think this is an issue that we need to think about  Is the federal funds rate really the primary   interest rate instrument going forward?  I thought Brian Sack’s report highlighted issues about   federal funds rate control in the environment in the next few years, maybe longer  It seems to me   that might have implications for credibility and communication for the Committee, and so I think   we need to think about that issue  In particular, is the interest rate on reserves being viewed as   the primary policy rate going forward, and is that sensible, and does that work in our models?   The next meeting will be an important one for thinking about how to play the asset   purchase program going forward  We can discuss it in more detail at that time, but, as I said   yesterday, I would prefer that we think carefully about how to actively manage the return of the   balance sheet both to normal levels, as one concern, and to an appropriate mix of assets as   another concern With the very large size, we’re going to have to do that over a period of years,   so we need a strategy about how we’re going to get there so that we don’t have to make   adjustments in any sudden fashion   Again, as we all agree, I think interest rates may remain near zero according to the   Greenbook over the next two years The Committee needs a clear plan for how to react to   incoming data during that period  Otherwise, what’s going to happen is that, at the end of the   first quarter?  We’re going to be perceived as going on hold and perhaps staying on hold for a   long time, but information is going to roll in about the performance of the economy  We may   want to adjust policy during that period, especially if the news is particularly strong or   particularly weak, which can easily happen, according to the estimates of uncertainty around our   forecast        December 15–16, 2009 119 of 247  Our asset purchase program has been considered successful, according to staff analysis    We could use that program to adjust policy going forward, as we remain at the near-zero policy   rate I would see the asset purchase program as a substitute for the policy easing we would have   undertaken had we been able to do so  It seems logical to me that we would gradually withdraw   some of the policy accommodation coming from the asset-purchase program as the economy   improves  That would substitute for tightening that we would not be willing to do with the rise   in rates Also, we should stand ready to do more with the asset-purchase program should   information on the economy come in weaker than expected  Again, as many have pointed out,   there’s plenty of downside risk as well as upside risk  I think the former Chairman of this   Committee said that uncertainty isn’t just a fact of life, it’s a defining feature of how we have to   deal with policy   I agree with President Kocherlakota’s suggestion on holdings in the third paragraph  I   thought that was a good suggestion I support that I also support President Fisher’s suggestion   in paragraph 1, perhaps as modified by Governor Kohn, but I thought that was a good point, too    And I agree with the comments that have been made about the final paragraph  I support the   final paragraph as written Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I really enjoyed this discussion and the   papers I thought they were really good  I’m going to review three things I said earlier on this   issue and see if any of my views have changed, given those priors that I laid down before the   discussion   One of the things I said earlier in a memo was that theoretical conceptions are hotly   contested—that’s just the state of play in the macro world  I’m actually happy to see a debate   between the Philadelphia conception, the DSGE model, and the Chicago conception—it lays out   explicitly “Here’s what the assumptions are,” and I’m sorry it’s complicated, but there are lots of   issues there  And that’s where we are But there’s also the question of moving between models   where you can pin down what the output gap is—a clear theoretical conception versus the   traditional concept of an output gap  There you don’t know what the mapping is back to the   people you’re trying to help with your policy, and I think that’s harder to swallow  And           December 15–16, 2009 173 of 247  estimates, given any concept, are subject to difficult measurement issues, and we understand   that   The second thing I said was, “Okay, forget about theory, you don’t care about theory,   blah, blah, blah You just want to find an object that will help you predict inflation, and you’re   happy to use whatever this object is”  I think that, controlling for expectations, a gap is only a   marginal contributor to movements in inflation  I would say in the Fuhrer et al work, one   interpretation of the empirical relationships that you see is precisely that monetary policy did not   react sufficiently strongly to offset whatever shock hit the economy to keep you close to the   inflation target   One of the themes I’ve come back to over and again is that if we’re doing inflation   targeting or some kind of quasi-inflation targeting—if that’s what we’re doing— if you run it   really well and your tools are pretty effective, you should be able pretty much to offset all of the   shocks and keep inflation really close to target  You go back to run your regressions later and   see what the relationships are It’s only going to look like inflation is related to the target or a   constant So I think that is an issue for the empirical work—for those who want to throw away   the theory and just find variables that are going to help you predict inflation  I think, frankly,   that inflation targeting, or quasi-inflation targeting, has worked pretty well over the last 15 years   or so in the United States   The third point I made—a point on which the papers were particularly uninformative—is   how gaps are related to bubbles, and that, I think, is uncharted territory  A lot of our rhetoric   says this is a housing bubble, the housing bubble somehow collapsed, and that’s what’s going on   in this economy I don’t see models that have those kinds of bubbles in them  To me, a bubble   has to mean something about an equilibrium that is not the fundamental equilibrium—there’s                 December 15–16, 2009 174 of 247  this fundamental equilibrium in the economy, but somehow actual prices and actual expectations   are up somewhere far away from that fundamental  And then, that collapses on you, and you   come back to the fundamental  What does that mean?  Does that mean that you’re back at your   trend and you shouldn’t try to reinflate the bubble, or what?  I think the Chairman has said that   bubbles are one of the really tough issues of the decade for monetary policy, and I agree   completely with that   The thing I was worried about for policy is that we might be overemphasizing output   gaps in our policy discussions when we say blanket-type things like, “Well, it looks like gaps are   big”, or “It looks like resource utilization is really low compared with some conception of where   we think it should be, and, therefore, there can’t be any inflation in the near term or the medium   term”  I think that might be an over-interpretation of what both the theoretical and the empirical   literature tell us   I had comments on all of the papers—I’m going to shorten this up  I just want to talk   about the global slack hypothesis a little bit  We’ve been talking in the profession about   globalization for years and years and years I have to say that the conventional wisdom, the   hallway discussion that you get on this, is that you can treat the US like a closed economy and it   is okay I actually think that that has not been that bad an approach over the past 25 years, but   we may be at an inflection point where that is not the right thing to do going forward If you’re   going to look at empirical evidence that’s collected over the past 25 years, you’re going to get   weak relationships with respect to the global output gaps or the global economy  That may not   be the right way to think of things going forward   I have also been concerned with the question of optimal policy in open economy settings,   which I think has generally been deemphasized around the table here, for the reason I just gave,              December 15–16, 2009 175 of 247  for years, but that may not be the thing to do going forward  In the fledgling literature on   optimal policy and open economy models, you have always got a situation where you’ve got   some domestic prices, you’ve got import prices, and then you’re going to construct a price index   that includes both Should you be reacting to those import prices?  That’s the question  The   models tell you “no” The models say you should have some conception of domestic prices or   whatever the sticky prices are in your economy and you should react to those  The foreign   central bank is already reacting to those prices in the foreign economy  So when you react to the   import prices, you are sort of doubly reacting, because foreign monetary policy is already trying   to control those prices So the fact that you’re reacting back and forth then can create problems   in the global equilibrium—a bubble, if you like  I worry about that, and I don’t think that that   has been thought about carefully enough, and I think it will become more and more important as   we go forward, especially with the rise of Asia   Let me talk about the Fuhrer et al paper for just a second  He has got backward-looking   expectations, a theme to which I am very sympathetic  You’re thinking about trying to measure   this perfectly forward-looking component during the Great Moderation, or during the past   15 years, a period where it may not be that important, because, in some sense, nothing happened   during that period But the question would be  If you get to special times, is that really the way   to think about expectations, as purely extrapolating from the past?  There’s a famous paper in   macroeconomics—some of you will know it—called “The Ends of Four Big Inflations” by Tom   Sargent He describes hyperinflations after World War I, when prices were going up like crazy    The government makes a credible commitment on a day, and the hyperinflation ends at noon on   that day—it’s just amazing  So there’s an example  It is a hugely stressed situation, but rational   expectations come in with a vengeance  Are we in a highly stressed situation?  Maybe We        December 15–16, 2009 176 of 247  avoided Depression 20 You might interpret that as a very special situation relative to the past   25 years That’s what has got me a little worried about a backward-looking approach to   expectations I think the threats of sharp movements in this kind of environment are very real    We have to be careful about them  Will they occur?  Maybe not  But we need to be very careful   in this situation So that’s just a comment on the Fuhrer approach  Thank you  "
8701,2010-01-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, you spent a lot of time on the   survey results, and I guess my question about that is, What do you see as the repercussions of   this?  I mean, a lot of this to me reads as though I asked financial market participants what they   expected us to do, and they said, “Well, we are not really sure what the Fed is going to do, but   we’ll fill in some answers”  I guess the key question would be, Is there anything that is   precluding us from saying, “Okay  We are going to adopt what we think is the optimal policy,”   inform the markets, and then they will fall into line  Then if you redid the survey, they would   come out at whatever the Committee said     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just have one question about the “early   reserve drain” strategy, which is on page 8 in the middle  I guess my question about this, and a   lot of the discussion about this, is that under this scenario you’d be doing the reserve-draining   operations considerably before you’d be trying to raise overnight rates  But in order to do that,   you are really putting upward pressure on short-term interest rates anyway, say, 30-day rates or   other short-term rates  So in a macroeconomic sense, how much difference is there really?    January 26–27, 2010 46 of 260    Aren’t you really saying that you’re raising one type of very short term interest rate so that you   don’t have to raise another type of very short term interest rate?  Most of what we look at   macroeconomically speaking is at a quarterly level anyway  So, how much difference is there   really?  If I vote for this strategy, am I not just voting for higher short-term interest rates?     Oh, no, no, no, no  You have a 30-day Treasury out there, and now   you’re saying that I’m going to give banks an option to deposit at the Fed at some rate  So   suppose you have to go to 75 or 100 basis points on your term deposit in order to get it to attract   enough reserves in there  Isn’t that an alternative for the bank as opposed to going and buying   the 30-day Treasury?  So you’re putting upward pressure on rates no matter how you cut it    Forget about the overnight rate  No one is trading at the overnight rate  And the   macroeconomics for that, if you’re writing papers about it, you would not worry about     The magnitude of the increase in the overnight rate?     I’m saying tightening is tightening is tightening      You have a spectrum of rates  Okay, and I can see there’s a sort of   term structure at these very short rates, but these are funding options for banks, and you’re   putting upward pressure on that, and that is inducing them to possibly keep funds on deposit as   opposed to lending them out     Well, there’s very little trading going on at that, and we know there are   special factors there because of the GSEs  So in a macroeconomic sense, how important is that?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start off with the primary credit issue    It sounds as though there is a lot of consensus on that, but I also think we should begin to normalize    January 26–27, 2010 66 of 260    A lot of the things that we are signaling are that the financial crisis is ending or tapering off, so I see   this as another step toward saying that is what we think   I support the staff recommendations on the TAF  I also think communications have to be   very clear that it is not the Committee’s intention to have a general increase in interest rates   associated with this move  As to when to do it, I agree with Governor Kohn that it might be better   to do it in February and separate it a little from monetary policy because that’s the big issue here    February is the time when we are ending a lot of our 13(3) programs, and possibly we could, after it   has been properly vetted publicly, make that move in February   On asset sales, I think they should be state-contingent, including purchases  I agree with   President Plosser  If we did get into a position in which the economy did not perform well and we   had to or desired to purchase more, I think it would probably have to be Treasuries at this point,   given the description of how the MBS market is operating at this time  But, again, I just want to   remind everyone that we have to keep in mind how volatile the economy can be and how   unpredictable it can be, and we may well be a year from now and it is not really where we thought it   was going to be  So that’s one reason I think we should keep our options open on that  It may help   a lot to have a baseline plan in mind like the one suggested by President Kocherlakota  I would   support something like that  But still committing or having in our head that we’re completely   committing to a particular path without seeing how the economy actually progresses is not optimal,   and I think what really everyone around the table says is that we would make adjustments if the   economy came in in a substantially different fashion from what we are seeing at the time  I think   we should make that clear then to markets—and we do to some extent, but we could surely make it   clearer to markets—that we would take action if we felt the situation demanded it   January 26–27, 2010 67 of 260    Sales, some have said here, are the only permanent way to reduce reserve levels  I think that   is something to keep in mind  I do think there has been something of an overemphasis on interest   on excess reserves as our main policy tool going forward  At some level, interest on reserves,   reverse repos, and term deposits are all ways to make transfers to banks  At the levels of excess   reserves that we are talking about, these transfers may be substantial  The Congress opposed   interest on reserves for decades for exactly this reason, and it may not be wise to rely on this policy   tool in the circumstances given that history  One issue with asset sales is that of large effects of a   selloff  I don’t find that very convincing  I think the better way to think about this is that we would   be gradually reversing some of the effects that we think have occurred over the past year during our   purchase program  We would be unwinding those effects slowly over some period of time with   some sales  I see no reason to think that we are intending to dump onto the market, and we are   certainly not, and we can certainly communicate that  But that’s a communications issue   On redemptions during 2010, the redemptions policy sets a baseline balance sheet policy,   but it is a passive one that is not based on an evaluation of economic conditions  So I would not   regard the adoption of a particular redemption policy as a substitute for the evaluation that should   occur and that should accompany that decision  I think the current policy is okay for now, which is   to redeem all MBS and agency debt but not Treasuries  I would be open to adding in Treasuries on   that redemption if we wanted to get a little faster downward movement there for the size of the   balance sheet  But generally speaking, I think we should manage our balance sheet   On sequencing between reverse repos, terms deposits, and interest on reserves, as I was   saying earlier, I think all of these put upward pressure on short-term interest rates in one way or   another  We should think of them as altogether part of a decision to raise short-term interest rates    So I guess my position would be close to the concurrent or nearly concurrent option for deploying   January 26–27, 2010 68 of 260    all of these tools  There are a lot of questions about exactly how this is going to work and what the   macroeconomic effects really are  There seems to be the idea around the table that, by increasing   certain types of short-term rates but not other types of short-term rates, the macroeconomic effects   are going to be different, and I don’t really think that is borne out by the models that I know of  So   from this viewpoint, I do not think that term deposits or reverse repos far ahead of time would make   too much sense  You would be signaling, or really you would be increasing interest rates way   ahead of the point at which you are trying to make a decision to increase interest rates  So I would   not want to go in that direction   All right  Just a few other comments and I will finish up here  On balance sheet structure, I   think I prefer the historical structure  It allows us to influence broad economic conditions without   political risk  So that would be an all-Treasuries policy  On the question of the federal funds rate as   the operating target, I think eventually we would like to transition to a channel system with the   federal funds rate, a market rate, as the targeted rate, and I do think it is important to determine, as   President Yellen said, to say something about the longer-run operating framework far in advance,   and that’s really going to have some impact on how we think of all these questions right now  So I   think it would help us a lot to have a better idea of where we are going to go in the next few years as   far as implementation of monetary policy in the wake of our still new ability to pay interest on   reserves  Thanks very much     I just have one question on this last exhibit, and maybe it is a question   for the Committee  Is there any discipline on us to prevent us from saying that uncertainty is   always higher than average?     My experience in the Fed over all these years has been that   policymakers are always describing the current environment as a very uncertain one, which is   true at some level, but you can’t have above-average uncertainty all the time     Well, I’m just wondering how useful it might really be if we are   always going to be describing things as very uncertain     Okay     Just one follow-up on that  This help-wanted index, you do have these   Internet problems, and they make comparability to the past recessions before the last two, which   were jobless recoveries, pretty problematic  So I would be a little worried about relying too   much on that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall economic conditions in the Eighth   District remain weaker than one year ago, but declines in activity have leveled off and activity   has begun to improve in some areas  District manufacturing activity continues to decline, albeit   at a slower pace than previously  District services activity continues to improve in most areas    Holiday retail sales were mostly positive, with a slight increase over last year  Current estimates   suggest that District employment in 16 metropolitan statistical areas is down about 35 percent   since the beginning of the recession compared with a national number of about 5 percent over the   same period  So on this dimension, the recession in the Eighth Federal Reserve District has been   less severe than in the nation as a whole, but it is still bad, to be sure  Employment increased   during the second half of 2009 in key District service sectors, including finance, insurance and   real estate, professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality    District contacts during the fall expressed some concern that momentum from the second half of   January 26–27, 2010 116 of 260    2009 may not carry over into the first quarter of 2010  However, very recent data from large   firms in the District seem to indicate that such fears were unfounded  If anything, business   activity for these firms has continued to strengthen so far in the first quarter  I found this   encouraging, and for some of these firms, the international component of their business has led   the way   Nationally, my sense is that the economic recovery remains on track and that the real   GDP growth rate for the first half of the year will be at or above the long-run average rate for the   US economy in the postwar era  I do think we may be at a juncture in the process today as we   speak and over the next few weeks, as markets are reassessing the global policy response to the   worldwide recession  But presuming that that goes okay, I think we are on track  The pace of   recovery that I am projecting is not particularly strong by historical standards, as we have noted   here  Thus, I think that there is some upside potential that the economy may recover more   rapidly, better in line with historical experience  I have hedged my bets on this outcome because   I view the shock that hit the economy as one that is largely without historical precedent and   because I put some weight on the evidence suggesting that downturns associated with financial   crises tend to last longer   Inflation risks in my view are low for the near term but high for the medium term  I think   we have now avoided the deflationary risk that we faced in 2009  The TIPS-based expected   inflation rates are now all very near 2 percent or higher, depending on whether you look the   5 year, the 5-year forward, the 10 year, or the 20 year  I think one reason these have continued to   rise is that people have started to put less and less probability on a deflationary outcome, and I   expect that, as the recovery remains on track during 2010, we will see these continue to move up    I believe that these medium-term inflation risks are manageable but that it will require careful   January 26–27, 2010 117 of 260    policymaking in the year ahead  For this reason, I have suggested that the Committee do more to   keep options open now so that actions that may become desirable can be taken later in the year   without surprising or confusing financial markets  Thank you, Mr Chairman     This time I mean it, right?  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will make just a few brief comments  I   support alternative B with certain changes  One caveat would be this holdings issue  I would   support substituting “holdings” for “purchases”  I think it is a more accurate description of   where we are in the cycle here  We are almost done with our purchases, and to have the   statement say that we are continuing to evaluate our purchases makes it sound as though maybe   we would extend our purchases further, or something like that, which I don’t think reflects the   intention of the Committee here  We do intend to end this program, and we do intend to then   evaluate our holdings  So I think that that would be a better way to go   As I have in previous meetings, I support paragraph 2 from alternative C, as President   Plosser did, which gives more-direct control over medium-term inflation as a result of what the   Committee does as opposed to external factors, and that is why I like that type of statement   better   In the fourth paragraph, on the question of the TAF, I would support including the   language “twenty-eight-day credit at the final auction on March 8,” and delete the rest of the   sentence, because that also seems to reflect the sentiment of the Committee  And that would tie   up our liquidity programs all more or less at the same time, which I think is helpful to us  We   are saying that financial conditions have improved markedly and therefore we don’t need the   special programs that we had before, although of course we stand prepared, if turmoil should   return, to implement those programs again in the future   January 26–27, 2010 185 of 260    Yesterday’s discussion suggested consensus on returning to an all-Treasuries balance   sheet at some point  I think there are definitely issues around the table about how fast and when   to start on that project  There was a lot of discussion also about asset sales at some point to help   with this process, and I garnered a sense from many members—and I think—that redemptions   alone are just going to be too slow  It is going to leave too many MBS on our balance sheet for   too long a period  So I think we should do more in future statements to reflect the outcome of   that discussion, and that is something we should work on at the next meeting and going forward,   because that needs to be communicated accurately to financial markets   I also think there is more state-contingency in our plans around the table than what is   perceived in financial markets, and I think we could do more to communicate that as well  I do   think that we could achieve something closer to optimum monetary policy by adjusting our   balance sheet program in response to economic developments  Some people expressed the   concern that we would be adjusting all the time in response to maybe what some would think of   as small developments with respect to the economy  But when it’s interest rate policy, we make   a judgment at every meeting about what direction we want to go  And we do try to give   guidance to the markets about our future direction with respect to interest rate policy  I see no   reason that we can’t do something similar with balance sheet policy  We have a baseline in   place  We project out a baseline  We communicate that to markets, but we adjust it going   forward, which I think is what actually most people have in mind, except that most people seem   to want to have a high bar with respect to any adjustments or any changes   For you nerds here, I am not quite sure why our optimal balance sheet policy is analogous   to an sS-type inventory control policy  I mean, why not adjust small amounts?  We do small   word changes and so on at each meeting  I don’t see why policy couldn’t be tweaked, stretched   January 26–27, 2010 186 of 260    out, moved up, faster purchases or faster sales, depending on the situation  Sticking to a   mechanistic approach to balance sheet adjustment is okay, but I also think that it puts a lot of   pressure on the expected date of the return to traditional interest rate targeting, so the main way   that we would have impact on policy over the next year or year and a half is that we would start   talking about that developments were positive in the intermeeting period and, therefore,   probabilistically speaking, we would be moving up the date of the return to traditional interest   rate targeting  Or if the data were bad, then, probabilistically speaking, we would be moving   back the date of the first move   I am not quite sure what impact that really has, and I think that it is not that clear a way to   run policy during the period over the next eighteen months or so before whenever we do get to   the date when we want to raise rates  That, in my view, is not the best way to conduct policy  I   don’t think it’s particularly clear  And I think going the mechanistic route undermines our claim   that quantitative easing has been effective  If it has been effective, then it should also be   effective as a tool going forward, and it’s not clear to me why the Committee wants to forgo the   use of that tool in this particular circumstance  Thank you     I just have one comment on “holdings” versus “purchases”  I agree   with you that we want to try to keep a status quo type of statement, and we might be   January 26–27, 2010 208 of 260    communicating too much by changing it  But the way it’s written it says that we are evaluating   purchases, and I don’t think we are evaluating purchases anymore  It is not as though we are   going to change our purchases or anything  Maybe markets understand that, but it’s not really—     Actually, at that point, we might want a larger reworking of this   portion of the statement that more accurately reflects what—  "
8729,2010-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, if we do it that way, then, sometimes press will come   up and ask about this issue, and so we should just say we are not looking at it, or we should say   that we are looking at some mechanisms to push the fed funds rate up?     I actually just meant on this GSE issue, because we have some bright   people in the markets, and so, if they’re talking in markets then it might come up     Okay  So I’ll just say that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The level of economic activity in the   Eighth District is slowly improving, although reports remain mixed as manufacturing activity has   increased in these months and firms continue to report that they are reluctant to hire  Contacts   indicated that the level of retail sales in the District was lower in January and early February   when compared with one year ago  However, most retailers were optimistic for March and   April  Residential real estate markets in the District continue to be weak, but appear to have   stabilized  The pace of home sales, for instance, remains about the same as it was one year ago    Commercial and industrial real estate markets continue to struggle  Contacts in the District’s   transportation industry were generally positive, reporting volume increases that suggest a   sustained recovery and strengthening across categories, regions, and internationally   My sense is that the economic recovery remains on track  Nationally, business capital   spending continues to trend upward, as discussed earlier, which I find encouraging  Households   seem to be returning slowly to more normal consumption patterns  I expect the US labor   markets to show improvement soon, very soon, I hope  Failure to see job creation in the next   few months would be a significant worry  We’ve waited a long time and had a long stretch of   negative numbers; I would expect that to turn around this spring  Continuing expansion in Asia   seems to be helping US firms, including many in the Eighth District  One risk to the forecast is   possible derailment of that expansion  China, in particular, may be susceptible to a crisis event    It’s a concern to me, and I think we should be prepared to adjust policy should that scenario   unfold in the next year or so  The pace of projected growth in Europe seems very slow to me   March 16, 2010 42 of 146    relative to the US, and, certainly compared with Asia, momentum seems very weak  A stagnant   Europe also seems like a risk to the broader recovery in my view   US inflation trends are subdued  Risks to inflation in the US in the medium term rest   on how finely calibrated our ultra-easy monetary policy is in reaction to a very severe recession,   and I’m not sure how good our calibration really is  TIPS-based expected inflation measures fell   modestly during the past week  I interpret this as markets pricing in some probability of a return   to more volatile financial markets in response to sovereign debt issues around the globe   I put a low probability on the scenario that renewed financial market turmoil will   materialize near the levels of the last 18 months  As I see it, for better or worse, governments   have shown that they’re willing to back the largest financial institutions internationally and,   therefore, I think we’re not susceptible to the same type of turmoil that we saw a little more than   a year ago  Those government guarantees remain in place   I’m concerned about the influence of the shelter component in measures of inflation    Prices in this area are more reflective of excess supply conditions in housing markets than they   are of underlying inflation trends  They are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future  The   core CPI inflation rate without shelter is running at about 3 percent, measuring from one year   ago  Of course, it’s completely arbitrary to throw out components of the price index, but,   unfortunately, we do it all the time  Our core measures of inflation exclude food and energy,   which gives shelter a large role in the story on inflation at this time  A better approach, in my   view, is simply to use the headline price index, which, I admit, can be volatile  These are the   prices that people actually have to pay  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B with some   modifications and my modifications are so substantial that we may not recognize it  [Laughter]    In paragraph 1, I actually like the “however” sentence, which qualifies our description of the   economy  I also like the “however” sentence from alternative A actually, which is “investment   in nonresidential structures is still contracting, housing activity continues to be sluggish, and   employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls”  I think this employer reluctance to add to   payrolls is a key feature of the economic situation, maybe we should acknowledge that   In paragraph 2, I’m still in favor of substituting paragraph 2 from alternative C and C′—  they’re identical  I like that language better on this dimension  As I’ve said many times in our   debates here, I feel that there’s an overemphasis on the slack term in alternative B, and it puts   more weight on the idea that there’s a lockstep statistical relationship between slack and inflation   than I think is warranted  I also have a thought about the issue that the statement should combine   monetary policy with resource utilization when we talk about inflation  A second best would be   to include the bracketed sentence in alternative B2 “The Committee expects that over time and   with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will run at rates consistent with price stability”  But I   prefer the language from all of paragraph 2 of alternative C and C′   Concerning the “extended period” language, I’m increasingly concerned that we are   telegraphing a time-dependent policy with this wording  I don’t think we mean it that way, but   it’s being interpreted that way  I don’t think we’re in a position to alter this today  I think the   March 16, 2010 102 of 146    best course of action on this would be to switch to a completely new and different and hopefully   more explicitly state-contingent wording  The markets will then have to adjust to this new   wording, but it will set out and convey what the Committee has in mind  I think it might knock   the markets off the idea that a rate hike is imminent this fall, which is too early according to our   staff analysis, as several people have noted  There’s hardly any scenario, according to the staff   analysis, that would lead to making that kind of adjustment in the fall  I am concerned about the   mismatch between market expectations and staff analysis and to some extent Committee views    I think better aligning these expectations might improve prospects for the economy today   Alternative B does not give forward guidance for the asset-purchase program  My   question is  Why not?  Why give forward guidance for one aspect of our policy and not for   another?  I’m not going to go into too much here, but just in terms of the statement, I think   passive approaches to the balance sheet runoff strike me as being far from optimal policy    Expectations of the future of quantitative easing policy are important for economic performance    Markets will build in expectations whether we shape them or not  So we should go ahead and try   to shape them   One way to offer some guidance for the asset-purchase program would be to include   paragraph 4 from C′  C′ has Treasuries rolling off the balance sheet and includes language   saying that the Committee is evaluating asset sales, which I think is an accurate description of   the situation  I do not like the C version, which unnecessarily locks us into a timing protocol for   our exit  That kind of protocol is to drain reserves with term deposits and possibly reverse repos,   raise the interest rate on excess reserves, and then sell assets later, maybe much later  I prefer a   timing protocol which would remove quantitative easing as appropriate as the economy improves   and then raise rates later, possibly much later, and possibly in conjunction with the use of term   March 16, 2010 103 of 146    deposits and reverse repos  That’s a last-in first-out policy  I think that would take some   pressure off the interest rate move that was dominating market reactions to this Committee   I think it’s far from clear that a protocol of raising interest rates first is the optimum one    Arguably, the reserve-draining that may accompany the interest rate move takes back much of   the quantitative easing in conjunction with the increase in interest rates  Not to put too fine a   point on it, but that could be a 1937-type mistake, and I think we should analyze that very   carefully  It may make more sense to withdraw quantitative easing at an appropriate pace and   then focus on short-term interest rates later   I also agree with President Fisher’s concerns about the possibility of selling MBS at some   later date with higher interest rates  Suppose that we do get into the situation where we have   caused a lot of inflation  We don’t expect that we’ll cause a lot of inflation, but now interest   rates are higher and we’re reluctant to sell our MBS because of capital losses  That’s a “train   wreck” scenario that we have to take pretty seriously  So I appreciate President Fisher’s bringing   that up  Thank you  "
8752,2010-04-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to commend the staff  The memos   by Brian Madigan and Bill Nelson, Ihrig, et al, Carpenter et al, were excellent, really excellent,   and I really appreciate them—all very well done, all very useful   I’m going to speak in support of option 3 in the memos  I’m going to make five   comments, so if you lose track of what I’m saying, here’s what the comments are  First, I think   we’ve had a lot of success in removing emergency measures one by one  Second, I think there   are a lot of advantages to conditionality  Third, I think we have two tools, and we should use   both tools to get the optimal policy  Fourth, I’m going to make some comments on   communication; I think concerns about communication can be overdone  And, fifth, I’m going   to make some comments about the problem with staying on our option 1 path   Let me begin with number 1, which is the success of removing emergency measures one   by one  I think this has worked very well for the Committee  Over the last six months or longer,   it has sent clear signals to the market that extraordinary conditions have passed  Markets have   clearly adapted to and understood this policy, and I see asset sales as an extension of this   strategy  We built up our balance sheet after we encountered the zero lower bound, and we’d be   saying that now we plan to unwind that action gradually over time, as the economy improves    So I see this as a natural next step, which starts before moving off of the near zero interest rate   policy  Removing extraordinary measures one by one—the LIFO policy, last in first out—has   worked very well for the Committee, and I advocate that   Let me talk for a minute about the advantages of conditionality  I think conditionality not   only manages the risk of shocks, but it also allows the Committee to return to a more normal   balance sheet in a reasonable amount of time  I prefer this to some of the more rigid alternatives   April 27–28, 2010 24 of 206                   that were mapped out in the memos  The optimal policy should specify fairly clearly that the   Committee plans to respond to economic developments by adjusting the sales program, possibly   even purchasing in extremely adverse conditions  There’s nothing optimal, in my mind, about   the rigid programs that lay out a particular path as in, say, option 1 or option 5  It’s true that you   would create certainty in markets, but that’s sort of creating certainty at the expense of adopting   a suboptimal policy  You could call this “the Titanic policy”  They set the optimal path to New   York City, but then did not adjust—[laughter]—to the shocks as they occurred   My third point is that we have two instruments, so we should use both to try to map out   an optimal policy  The other instrument is conventional interest rate policy  But with the federal   funds rate near zero, of course, it’s hard to make adjustments along that dimension, except by   varying the expected date of a rate increase  So I think it’s reasonable to use both tools—asset   sales and the expected date of the rate increase  We can offset the macroeconomic effects of   sales—which, I agree with President Lacker, look minor, certainly well within all of the   uncertainty around these estimates; if you put confidence bounds around these estimates, they’d   be very wide—by moving back the expected date of conventional tightening if that were   something the Committee desired to do  Financial markets are currently expecting an earlier   date of conventional tightening than our staff model seemed to indicate, so this might actually   better align those market expectations with what our staff analysis, and possibly our Committee   as well, desires   Some say that the relative uncertainty of the effects of the two instruments is a key   consideration, perhaps citing Brainard’s famous 1967 paper  I don’t think this is right    Comparing the LSAP program with conventional interest rate policy, we certainly know a lot   more about conventional interest rate policy, in the sense that there have been lots of data and   April 27–28, 2010 25 of 206                   lots of studies on it over time  But conventional interest rate policy is not really on the table at   this point  What we have instead is the adjustment of the date of moving off the lower bound   and what effects that might have on the economy  And I would submit to you that we know very   little about the macroeconomic effects of that  I would say that the effects of adjusting that date   are about as uncertain as the effects of a managed balance sheet policy  So you have two tools   on the table  The effects of both are equally uncertain  Because they’re both uncertain, I think   that counsels a “go slow” approach, tracking what is happening, and adjusting as you go along   Let me make some comments on communication, the fourth area I wanted to comment   on  Communication is certainly a challenge, but the challenge can be overstated  The spirit   should be  identify the optimal policy first, then figure out how to communicate it  There is,   believe it or not, learning in financial markets  Any initial communication problems may cause   some disturbances, but eventually those would be unwound as markets come to understand the   policy, and the Committee would then obtain the benefits of adopting the optimal policy  The   alternative is to adopt a suboptimal policy on the grounds that it’s easy to communicate, even   though it’s suboptimal  That seems unpalatable to me, so I think we should choose the optimal   policy first, then think about ways to communicate it   My final comment concerns the problems with option 1  I think the main risk here is that   we don’t know what the effects of the large balance sheet really are  Certainly, the large balance   sheet looks inflationary by conventional monetary theory  And I’m sure if Milton Friedman   were still alive he’d be warning us that inflation is just around the corner  I think we should put   some weight on that possible outcome  If inflation and inflation expectations begin to get out of   control, we may be forced to sell at a time when we would have to realize substantial capital   losses  That would be very damaging to the Fed  Alternatively, we can pay billions of dollars in   April 27–28, 2010 26 of 206                   interest on reserves, term deposits, and reverse repos  I find that also unpalatable in the current   environment  So, for this reason, I think we should begin to return to a more normal balance   sheet very soon  Thank you, Mr Chairman     He was?     I’m a little ambivalent on Treasury redemptions  I’m going to talk   tomorrow in favor of it, but I’m not strongly in favor     I have a question for Nathan Sheets  You said that the Greece   situation is on the verge of metastasizing  Can you give the Committee a sense of how you think   events might unfold between now and the next meeting?  It seems to me that if we did get to the   point where the Europeans were willing to say that there has to be a restructuring, it would be a   real bombshell, even globally     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy appears to   have been one of the weaker Districts in the most recent Beige Book survey  We intend to watch   this closely to see to what extent this is an aberration or the start of a longer-term development    The District has, however, experienced some signs of life after the most recent recession  There   has been a turnaround in new private building permits, for instance, and we have seen   employment gains in a few sectors  District firms are increasing capital expenditures, even while   they say they are reluctant to add to payrolls  For several years, it has appeared that the Eighth   District labor market performed somewhat better than the nation as a whole  We recently   received benchmark revisions for the last several years, which now suggest that the nation and   the District are more alike than we thought, with District employment declines during the   April 27–28, 2010 110 of 206                   recession only slightly better than the nation as a whole  Large transportation firms in the   District indicate that business is recovering dramatically  I interpret this as a very positive sign   for the economy going forward   Nationally, the economic recovery remains largely on track  I expect a reasonable pace   of economic growth over the next two years and beyond  I think that the growth will be strong   enough to encourage gradual improvement in US labor markets  While firms continue to stress   that they are reluctant to hire—we’ve heard several comments like that again today—I think that   these firms will be inclined to add workers as the economy continues to improve   Inflation, indeed, remains subdued  I think that core inflation will continue to be   importantly affected by developments in rental markets  Behavior in rental markets is likely to   be distorted for the next several years relative to the behavior of the last 20 years  We should at   least monitor the core index without the shelter component  Discarding the shelter component is   not really right, but neither is discarding the food and energy components   One common argument for continued focus on core inflation is that it is a good predictor   of headline inflation  My sense, based on some St Louis staff analysis, is that the empirical   relationship on this dimension breaks down if we use data from the mid-1990s to the present;   that is, core inflation is not such a good predictor of headline inflation over the last 15 years  We   will probably do better over the next several years, given the distortion in housing markets, to   focus on headline inflation and simply admit that prices are more volatile than we would ideally   prefer, but there is not much that we can do about that volatility given the nature of the shocks to   the global macroeconomy  I expect medium- and longer-run inflation expectations to continue to   edge higher during the remainder of 2010, as the economy continues to improve   April 27–28, 2010 111 of 206                   I see the Greek sovereign debt situation as a growing risk—and I wrote this before the   news this morning—to the outlook  An unhappy ending there, which is looking increasingly   likely, could feed continuing sovereign debt problems in several other countries, adding to   financial stress worldwide  Should a larger country follow Greece and lead to a loss of   confidence in fiscal rectitude, speculation about the US could follow  Speculation of this type   may not be entirely rational  Longer-term rates could, nevertheless, rise, even in the US, and   complicate monetary policy decisions going forward  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I start, I want to say a few words   on the comparison of Taylor rule prescriptions that was handed out  I would just stress that the   Taylor rule was estimated over a period where interest rate policy was the only policy on the   table, and during this period we’ve had our quantitative easing policy in tandem with interest rate   policy, so I’m not quite sure what to make of graphs like this  Presumably, to some extent, our   quantitative easing has been substituting for the fact that we couldn’t move our short-term   interest rate below zero  So it seems to me that would have implications for when you would   move off zero as well—you would try to use both instruments to do that  I know you also   warned that one probably shouldn’t take simple prescriptions like this as more than just a visual   impression   I support alternative B, Mr Chairman, with many changes, so it’s going to be, as it was   last time, an unrecognizable alternative B     On Treasury redemptions, I agree with your judgment, Mr Chairman, and with the Vice   Chairman, that we should not make any announcement on Treasury redemption policy at this   juncture  It could be disruptive, given what’s going on in markets  We could do that in June  I   see no problem with that and with getting further analysis  I look forward to seeing that analysis,   but I do think the issues are clear and that it’s mostly up to us to decide how we want to weight   various objectives  As I said yesterday, I think we should give substantial consideration to the   idea of state-contingent MBS adjustments to manage macroeconomic shocks during the extended   period of a near-zero policy rate  We’ve had a lot of success in removing emergency measures   April 27–28, 2010 151 of 206                   one by one  Surely the quantitative easing policy is a special action undertaken only because of   the very large shocks sustained by the US economy  We have two tools on the table  As I was   just mentioning, we should use both of them to engineer the best outcomes we can relative to our   dual mandate   Concerns about communication are overstated, in my view  Markets will have little   difficulty understanding what we are doing  Temporary dustups in markets because of   communications issues should not drive policy decisions  We are trying to do what’s best for the   American people, not what is best for financial markets   Now let me turn to the long list of changes I have to alternative B  In paragraph 2 on   inflation, I would change that, as I’ve been advocating for several meetings, to a version of   paragraph 2 from alternative C  The paragraph in alternative C has the Committee taking   responsibility for inflation in the medium term, which I think is important  Expectations of   inflation are stable today but may not remain so, given high fiscal deficits and the super-easy   monetary policy that we are pursuing  The statement in alternative C asserts that we intend to   take action to keep inflation near target, both if inflation is too low or if it is too high relative to   the Committee’s views of the appropriate long-term level  I like this language because it gets rid   of the idea that the Committee is a passive observer concerning medium-term inflation   developments   In paragraph 3, I propose that we take the conditionality from alternative A and omit the   “extended period” language  The language would go like this  “…maintain the target range for   the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until economic conditions, such as,” and then list the   three conditions, “warrant a less accommodative policy”  I like that because it makes it even   clearer to markets that this depends on how the data come in and on how the recovery proceeds    April 27–28, 2010 152 of 206                   We do want the recovery to be on firmer footing than it is right now before we take a tightening   action, and this would emphasize that and get us out of the “extended period” language   Let me suggest some food for thought at this point  Many members have expressed   reservations about asset bubbles and what to do about asset bubbles in the future  We may want   to include some kind of language in this list of conditions that would at least vaguely refer to the   possibility that we might take action because we thought that some type of bubble had developed   that was posing a lot of risk to the macroeconomy  I think there’s a lot more sentiment around   the table than there once was that in some conceivable circumstances we might take an action   like that  So that’s just some food for thought about the possibility of putting that kind of   language in the statement   Next, replace paragraph 4 in alternative B with paragraph 4 from alternative C  This   paragraph addresses asset sales and reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing Treasuries  Of   course, I’m not completely happy with that paragraph either, so I have some suggestions  First,   if we actually did this we would have to omit the second sentence which refers to Treasury   redemptions  The third sentence refers to asset sales  I would replace the language “will soon   begin” with “may soon begin”  It gives us a little more leeway to react to developments as they   come in   I’d replace “gradual” with “very gradual” to help assuage concerns that are apparently   popular in financial markets about whether we would do this slowly enough or whether we might   somehow sell too much of the portfolio all at once  The state-contingency is appropriate in the   next sentence on the timing and pace  The last sentence would then be redundant, which is what   I’ve suggested for paragraph 3  That’s my unrecognizable alternative  Thank you  "
8777,2010-05-09,"  These are international agreements, so you would have to get   agreement from the foreign central bank     Just to come in with an unpleasant comment—the probability of the   ECB not surviving has probably moved off of zero to some small positive probability that it   would actually unravel  So, in the debate about this, I think people will not be hesitant to   speculate on the future of the euro and the future of the ECB  I think it’s something to consider   when we’re trying to present this  I think our best point is to say that we’ve been through this   before, that it worked great before, so we can do it again, and we expect it to work well again   this time  But I don’t want to be naïve about the idea that the ECB is forever, because that’s   exactly what this crisis is about     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m generally supportive of reactivating   the swap lines with major central banks around the world to respond to this crisis  When I heard   Jean-Claude Trichet talking a few months ago about the recent crisis, he called the swaps   “decisive” in dealing with it   May 9, 2010 34 of 42             I think there will possibly be heavy political pushback  I would caution everyone that the   bailout debate is not really a rational debate about what has actually happened—people are   confusing the Treasury and the Fed, they’re confusing everything with everything else  So the   political environment may be very difficult  It may require all of us to talk to whomever we can   to try to get information out  If we do not get information out, other people define us and take   over the debate  I think that’s an important consideration   Our best point is that the swaps worked quite well the last time around with the penalty   rate, and that they are a backstop mechanism  I agree with the unlimited size idea  I would   expect that, if the crisis worsens, we would see a swelling of this similar to the one we saw last   time—probably not as bad as the last time—but then that would eventually go away as the   situation improved   I think we can also make some progress on this by emphasizing that there are still a lot of   government guarantees in place at major financial institutions around the world  It’s a little bit   irrational at this point for markets to be worried about the backing of financial institutions, when   countries around the world have said repeatedly that they’re going to back these institutions,   come hell or high water  I think if we can emphasize that, it will get some of the irrational   expectations out of the market   I do think there is a non-zero risk of euro disintegration in this process and that we have   to track that very carefully  I don’t think it’s very likely at this point, but the probability has   clearly moved off zero, and sometimes, in a crisis like this, things can happen very rapidly  You   may get a country that unilaterally, say, decides to withdraw and the entire agreement falls apart   I’m not actually that big a fan of announcing a lot of coordinated actions all at once  I   think that that confuses markets  I would prefer to dribble out good news one bit at a time, but I   May 9, 2010 35 of 42             know I’m probably in the minority on that  For that reason, I think that it may be that   reactivation of the swap lines is not the main news story, and that actually might be helpful in   this case  But my preference would be to announce various actions one a time as they happen    Those are my comments  Thank you, Mr Chairman     On the Bank of Canada, it just occurred to me that we, of course, have   a swap line with Canada already, and we also have one with Mexico, and I wonder if there would   be any considerations about that situation     So we’re intentionally leaving Mexico out of this list, I guess     Intentionally?  Should you say something like, “The existing swap   lines will remain in place,” or something like that?  I don’t know  "
8800,2010-06-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the Treasury redemption and   reinvestment policy, I just wanted to say I found the memo on this topic from Brian Madigan and   Brian Sack very helpful  So thanks a lot to you and to everyone who worked on that   I prefer the status quo policy for today, which is to continue to reinvest according to long-  standing practice without any additional attempt to shorten the maturity structure  Mainly I   agree with many others here that we probably should not try to send a signal on monetary policy   today  We could move to that policy later  I don’t think it would have a big effect at the time   that we decide to do that   On the full redemption policy, while I have some sympathy for that, I think that would   move the Committee away from the desired ultimate asset composition, which is Treasuries-  only  I think that would send a confusing signal and might be confusing to us as well about what   we’re trying to do here  We can achieve much more by simply selling agency MBS at the   appropriate pace and at the appropriate time so as to reassure markets that the FOMC remains   June 22–23, 2010 48 of 213             committed to achieving low and stable inflation outcomes  I think there’s some good news,   namely, that the MBS are actually in demand—that’s encouraging  I’m also fine with the swaps   for the 55 fails  The main concern I’d have there is whether we’re doing anything unusual or   anything that would look like a favor to those that have failed to deliver  As I understand it, I   don’t think that we’re doing that—we’re using normal market procedures here  But I would be   concerned about anything that would smack of somehow letting people out of a contract or   something  But I don’t get the sense that that’s what we’re doing here   On asset sales, I still advocate the LIFO policy—last in, first out—which would put asset   sales before the first increase in short-term interest rates  I think it makes sense to take back the   quantitative easing at the appropriate time—not today, but at the appropriate time—without tying   it to short-term interest rate increases I actually am quite concerned about the policy that seems   to be gelling around the table here—raising short-term interest rates and simultaneously   signaling the end of the quantitative easing policy—because that is an “everything at once”   policy, and we’re not taking advantage of the fact that we have two instruments  One could   interpret the policy of raising rates, or even hinting that we’re going to raise rates by changing   the language, as simultaneously signaling two things  that we’re going to raise rates and that,   within some short period of time, we’ll start to end the quantitative easing policy  That might be   more tightening than is desired at that moment   I think the better way to play this is to say that we would take back the quantitative   easing, which is the last thing we did, without necessarily signaling anything about what we’re   going to do with interest rates; we even could extend the “extended period” language and say we   might wait on interest rate policy, and we’ll get the balance sheet back to a more normal size and   a more normal composition in a reasonable amount of time   June 22–23, 2010 49 of 213             I am very concerned about this “everything at once” policy, and I think I’ll remain an   advocate for the LIFO policy for now  Thank you     I am, indeed, ready  Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance,   economic conditions in the Eighth District have improved modestly since the previous FOMC   meeting  Eighth District employment growth has been slightly stronger than that of the nation as   a whole  Manufacturing activity in the District has increased  Retail sales, including autos, have   improved  In addition, retailers are optimistic about summer sales  Most housing markets in the   District have experienced an increase in home sales  All report a significant increase in new   private building permits  Commercial and industrial real estate markets continue to be weak, and   contacts report that commercial and industrial construction is not expected to pick up until 2011    Leading transportation firms in the District continue to report that business activity is improving,   and, in some cases, the improvement is very robust   The US economy as a whole appears to have expanded modestly over the intermeeting   period  Although the May employment report was unexpectedly weak, it was still positive in   some respects  This certainly bears careful monitoring, but this report is just one month’s   number  Readings from outside the labor market have generally been stronger   One of the key risks to the US and global economic recovery is the sovereign debt crisis   in Europe  My contacts in Europe during the intermeeting period were as nervous and   pessimistic as I’ve ever experienced  In order for the sovereign debt crisis to derail the global   recovery, it would have to morph into a global uncertainty shock on the order of the Lehman-  AIG episode during the fall of 2008  A scenario like this is described on page 70 of the   Tealbook  This could certainly happen  For example, countries could unilaterally withdraw   June 22–23, 2010 93 of 213             from the euro on the grounds that the Maastricht Treaty has been badly violated  This would be   a major event with unpredictable consequences globally  In particular, if enough uncertainty   were generated globally, the Asian recovery, which has been very strong, could be derailed,   sending the global economy back into recession as it was in 2009   I do not think this scenario will play out  The Europeans, despite the politics, remain   firmly committed to the euro project They have bought time for fiscal consolidation through the   creation of new lending facilities  They also remain committed to backstopping their largest   financial institutions, so contagion through that channel seems unlikely  For these reasons, I   expect the effects on the US to be more benign than the Tealbook baseline forecast  There are   four key factors  US equity prices, longer-dated Treasury yields, oil prices, and the dollar  US   equity prices declined precipitously during the intermeeting period, but I see this as temporary   and subject to reversal if it becomes clear during the summer that the European sovereign debt   crisis will remain in Europe  The flight-to-safety effect on US Treasury yields, on the other   hand, may be more persistent, as worries about the euro as a safe haven have increased   dramatically and will subside only very slowly—so I see the positive effect through this channel   as being more persistent  The dollar has strengthened against the euro, and this will also be a   persistent effect, but I see the European trade channel as weaker and more uncertain for US   GDP  Oil prices will likely retrace somewhat, but may be subdued because of slower growth in   parts of Europe     Altogether I see muted downside risk for the US outlook, barring a global uncertainty   shock  The US may even benefit as a bystander to the crisis, as it did during the Asian currency   crisis, through the safe-haven effect  I would not count the crisis in Europe as a good reason to   alter the course of monetary policy at this time, especially by suggesting that the Committee   June 22–23, 2010 94 of 213             might be more patient in moving policy away from its current extraordinarily easy stance  The   more prudent course is to wait to see what the effects are in the US during the summer and   make a decision later in the year  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B with some   modifications  Just as a general comment, this statement doesn’t mention the quantitative easing   program  I don’t think it’s wise not to mention the program in some capacity—I don’t have   language to do this—because we’re thinking that we might have to adjust the program one way   or another in the future  If we leave it out, then it looks as if the program isn’t a tool  You   wouldn’t leave the interest rate out of the statement, so why would you leave the quantitative   easing program out?   In paragraph 2, we use the phrase “substantial resource slack”  As I’ve said before, I   think this puts too much emphasis on this factor  My reading of the literature is that the   empirical evidence is very mixed on this question  The relationship between inflation and slack   is tenuous at best  Elevating this to a key policymaking pillar, which is what we’re doing by   continually putting it in the statement, is a misrepresentation of what we know  Slack can   certainly be a factor, but there are many factors in a large economy that affect inflation    Overemphasis on this factor did not serve the Committee well in the 1970s or in the 1990s, and I   think it may not help this time either  The UK is a current example of a country with   substantial slack by conventional measures, but which, nevertheless, has inflation above desired   levels  So I’m just reiterating that I’d prefer not to put so much emphasis on this in our   statements   I have one broader comment  As we’ve been saying, the European sovereign debt crisis   is one of the most serious threats to global recovery since the fall of 2008  I was somewhat   June 22–23, 2010 144 of 213             alarmed to see that the adjustment of the date of tightening in terms of the interest rate on excess   reserves in Tealbook B moved to 2013  That sounds way too long to me and creates a   substantial risk that we’ll follow Japan, and possibly Europe, into a very long, near-zero interest   rate era   If we think that the outlook has actually weakened that much—I’m not sure I do—then   we should think about and analyze actions we can take through our quantitative easing program    So I agree with President Dudley and others on this dimension  If we do have to take further   action, I would prefer not to go the MBS route, which I think we’ve exhausted at this point  We   can buy additional Treasuries  I’m fairly convinced that that would increase inflation   expectations and put upward pressure on inflation, if the concern is that inflation is below target,   and it also would be stimulative for the real economy  I don’t think we should take that action   today, but if we were to see an additional adverse shock in the future, then, we should have a   method of addressing it other than indefinite delay of the date of IOER rate increases   And I for one question the effectiveness of further delays in the increase in the interest   rate on excess reserves in stimulating real activity and in keeping inflation near target  In   models, that kind of thing works well, and it has, obviously, been recommended from the New   Keynesian literature, namely, that policymakers should promise to stay at zero for a longer time    But I’d question whether markets understand it that way and whether it’s having any impact at   all on real activity  I am doubtful that, in the event of further adverse shocks, stretching out the   time before rates are increased will have any effect  Quantitative easing, on the other hand, at   least according to our staff analysis so far, does have an impact, so we should use that in a state-  contingent way, either on the upside or the downside, as shocks come into the economy   June 22–23, 2010 145 of 213             Let me just elaborate a bit further on this  In the New Keynesian model of Mike   Woodford and others, which is the leading theory in this area, it is very important to take action   continually in response to shocks that hit the economy  The worst policy in that analysis, if you   believe it—and there are a lot of assumptions—is the “no response” policy, no reaction to   shocks  In the model, that’s the interest rate peg policy—policymakers just leave the interest rate   at some level, and, as shocks come into the economy, they don’t react; it’s a passive policy   Why is it the worst policy, according to the model?  Because it’s the one that allows   multiple equilibria, which means that many possible sets of prices and expectations can clear   markets  So you get this “anything can happen” result in the model if you follow this passive   policy and you don’t react to the shocks  To me, staying at zero for such a long time sounds a lot   like the passive policy, where you do not react to shocks at all  And if you’re also going to put   quantitative easing on hold, then you would really not be reacting as shocks come into the   economy  People in policy circles have talked about this, namely, that such a passive policy   somehow has been generating the kinds of bubbles that we’ve observed in the 1990s, and   especially in this decade  To avoid that outcome, the recommendation would be to maintain an   active policy through the quantitative easing program and to react in a state-contingent way to   the shocks that come into the economy   I have one final comment on a separate issue  The Chairman pointed out that, in our   forecasts, everyone expects inflation to be low and unemployment to be high for the foreseeable   future  I will just point out that those forecasts are done under an assumption of appropriate   policy  I always feel constrained not to say that I think inflation is going to be very high in the   future, because I’m supposed to be making a forecast under the appropriate policy, and I think   under the appropriate policy we should be able to hit whatever our inflation target is in the   June 22–23, 2010 146 of 213             medium term  I don’t want to turn in a forecast that’s going to betray a lack of confidence in the   rest of the Committee to follow the appropriate policy that’s going to help us hit inflation  So   I’m not sure you can read off the forecasts that that there aren’t a lot of worries around the table   about what inflation is going to be in the future  But I think everyone is saying that if you follow   their policy or you follow the appropriate policy, you’ll get the inflation outcome that they want   in the medium term  That’s the last point  Thank you, Mr Chairman       On this issue of mentioning quantitative easing somehow in the   statement, you do have paragraph 4 in alternative A, which is slightly different from paragraph 4   in alternative B, and it makes a little more reference to the fact that we will evaluate the balance   sheet going forward     Why is that?  It just says evaluate the holdings of securities  "
8827,2010-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, economic conditions in the Eighth   District have improved slightly during the intermeeting period  Estimates indicate that Eighth   District employment was about flat between April and June, but the level of employment   remains higher than earlier in the year  Residential construction and real estate markets in the   District have improved  All major metropolitan areas, ie, MSAs, experienced growth in home   sales compared with the same period last year  Commercial and industrial real estate markets   continue to struggle, and reports indicate that the near-term outlook for these sectors is dim    Contacts at large firms, especially those with significant global businesses, seem to be cautiously   optimistic about the second half of 2010  They do not expect, however, to add workers to any   significant degree  Smaller businesses tend to be less optimistic  Their sales and profitability   have improved but generally remain less than satisfactory   In the national outlook, I concur with the Tealbook that data have been suggestive of a   somewhat weaker economy in recent weeks  I think that the most likely outcome is that the   current period weakness will turn out to be merely unevenness in the pace of recovery, but at this   juncture we cannot be sure  We face increased risk of further deceleration  We are more   susceptible to a negative shock than we were earlier this year  An important bright spot is that   the financial market turmoil in Europe seems to have abated  One indicator of this is the Federal   Reserve Bank of St Louis financial stress index, which has moved off its highs and to lower   levels recently   Inflation is expected to remain low  Core CPI inflation measured from one year ago is   about 90 basis points  The trimmed mean version from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland   August 10, 2010 27 of 160             is about 80 basis points  The core chained CPI is about 60 basis points  Core PCE inflation   measured from one year ago is higher, at 14 percent, but the core market-based PCE inflation   rate measured from one year ago is 11 percent, and the trimmed mean version of that from the   Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is 1 percent  In addition, the Tealbook, page 32, has core PCE   inflation running at about 1 percent each year through 2013—in other words, for the next three   and a half years   I conclude that many core measures of inflation are running at about 1 percent or less    This is not alarming by itself, but it does mean that we remain susceptible to further negative   shocks that could drive inflation and inflation expectations lower  If this Committee remains   with the near-zero interest rate policy and simultaneously core inflation runs at a pace less than   50 basis points, the possibility of entering a Japan-like situation would become very real indeed    If we can recognize that risk ahead of time and put a policy in place to deal with it, that outcome   will be avoided   Inflation expectations have also fallen recently  Survey measures tend to convey   considerable stability on this dimension, but, in my view, these measures are not sufficiently   sensitive to market events to be useful  By the time these measures move either higher or lower,   it will be too late  TIPS-based expected inflation has fallen in recent months, presumably in   response to the European sovereign debt crisis  The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, which   is receiving high marks in my comments here, publishes measures based on research by Joe   Haubrich, George Pennacchi, and Peter Ritchken  They try to make appropriate adjustments to   the TIPS data to extract inflation expectations, so it’s a more sophisticated reading of the TIPS   data than you would normally get  Their latest reading suggests that expected inflation has fallen   at all horizons, and it ranges from a one-year level of about 90 basis points to a 10-year level of   August 10, 2010 28 of 160             about 170 basis points  So the whole spectrum of expected inflation from one year out to ten   years—they can do every year in their analysis—has fallen  That curve is upward-sloping,   which is encouraging, because it means that markets believe that inflation will eventually return   to target  But that return is quite a ways in the future, and even at ten years, that’s 170 basis   points  If that curve should invert, I would be very concerned  It’s not inverted at this point  In   any event, that whole curve has fallen substantially from earlier levels   A key problem that we face is that conventional interest rate policies could become   passive  Under current policy, when a negative shock is encountered, we cannot react by   lowering the policy rate, and we can only react by altering the length of time financial markets   expect that we will remain with a near-zero rate policy  This tool has some theoretical backing,   but it is suspect from a practical perspective  We are talking about extending promises to stay at   zero many quarters or years in the future, depending on how the economy performs  The   effectiveness of such a tool depends on the foresight of the private sector, our own credibility,   and the length of the horizon  I submit that the effectiveness of this tool is questionable at this   point  It’s okay with me to try to manipulate these expectations, but I think we should   supplement that policy with a more tangible policy  The policy to stay at near-zero rates for a   long time can also be counterproductive  That policy is also consistent with a mildly   deflationary steady state like Japan’s  Escape from that type of outcome is problematic   My bottom line is that meeting future negative shocks solely with promises to stay low   for longer may not be sufficient to avoid the deflationary trap  For this reason, I think the best   alternative policy, on balance and considering everything that we could do, is to signal that we   may adopt additional quantitative easing measures  I will discuss this further in my comments   during the policy go-round   August 10, 2010 29 of 160               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I just want to say   that we do have a policy tool—one that has theoretical support, and one that we’re all talking   about—and that tool is shifts in the promise to stay low for longer  We can promise to stay low   for a year or for 18 months or for two years, and, at least in the theoretical world, that’s supposed   to work just fine as a policy tool   My view is that we should not continue to react to negative shocks solely by promising to   delay the date of policy rate normalization  My argument is that such a policy, as useful as it   might be, also has some severe drawbacks, which I outlined in my paper  I advocate augmenting   the near-zero rate policy with an enhanced quantitative easing policy, and I see alternative B as a   August 10, 2010 115 of 160             way to signal our intentions to defend our implicit inflation target on the low side and to avoid   getting too close to a Japanese-type outcome here in the US  I think we need to send that signal   at this juncture  We may not need to do more—I actually think the most likely outcome is that   this turns out to be a rough patch in the recovery and that we do get better levels of economic   activity going forward  But that remains to be seen   I support paragraph 4 with the longer-term Treasuries provision  I think going with the   MBS reinvestments would not be very effective at this point  Buying longer-dated Treasuries is   likely to keep inflation and inflation expectations closer to target, even if the Committee is   unlucky enough to face a new round of negative shocks  Also, a decision to go with Treasuries   moves us closer to our longer-run goal of having a Treasuries-only portfolio  I think paragraph 4   indicates that we are willing to use balance sheet policy in a more state-contingent way,   something that I have advocated repeatedly at these meetings  Also, if the recovery proceeds at a   stronger pace than we currently anticipate, I think the reinvestment policy can simply be changed   back to one that allows runoff or even outright asset sales, should inflation and inflation   expectations pick up appreciably   In paragraph 2, regarding the clause “at levels lower than are desirable in the long run,” I   appreciate Governor Kohn’s explanation, but I actually read this a little differently  I would not   include this  I think our action today has the potential, I hope, to move inflation and inflation   expectations closer to target  This wording sort of suggests that our policy won’t be effective in   doing that, so it’s a little counterproductive, possibly  But maybe I’m reading too much into it  I   don’t have really strong feelings on this   Let me make one last point, and then I’ll finish  Let me stress that I do not advocate a   shock-and-awe policy, that is, a large purchase of Treasury securities all at once  That’s the kind   August 10, 2010 116 of 160             of thing that you should only do in a crisis environment, because a large purchase strategy is very   risky—it can fall flat and end up damaging our credibility  My view is that the crisis atmosphere   for that type of move has passed  Instead, I would advocate adopting a firm and determined   asset purchase response, commensurate with risk levels as we judge them around the table, and   then we can adjust our policy as appropriate going forward, both on the positive and the negative   side  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Let me just reiterate that I think it hints that we really think inflation is   going to stay pretty low, but what we’re really hoping for is that this action will move inflation   and inflation expectations somewhat higher     You might create more worries about deflation than we really think is   warranted     Yes  "
8852,2010-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to follow up on that, Brian, there’s a   certain amount of new issuance that goes on, and sometimes if the central bank is viewed as   buying up all the new issuance, then that would be considered interfering with market   functioning—matching bid and asked, as Governor Warsh was saying  Does that have any   bearing on this?  And how much is new issuance monthly at the current pace?     $100 billion a month     Let me sharpen this up a little  Suppose you said, “Well, we’re going   to buy all of the new cars that come out”  And that’s okay, because there’s a vast market for   used cars out there, and cars are being traded all the time  Still, I think you’re going to have a   big impact in the market for cars if you decide you’re going to buy up all the new cars  I would   think the same is true of Treasury issuance  Sure, it’s a vast market, but a lot of those decisions   have been made—they all really want to hold these securities at their current values, and they’re   not in the market, really, at all, at current prices     Well, for market functioning     Aside from policy concerns, just market functioning     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy showed signs   of slowing in the summer  District auto dealers and general retailers reported mixed results  The   back-to-school season in particular was middling, according to one major retailer  Optimism is   limited for the remainder of the year  Employment in the District has resumed tracking the same   trends as the national data  District agriculture is a bright spot, as many areas in the region seem   poised to enjoy bumper harvests and relatively strong prices  Residential sales in construction,   on the other hand, have weakened over the summer  The promising signs from the spring have   largely disappeared  Commercial and industrial real estate markets remain weak, and   commercial lending remains stagnant   Contacts in the transportation industry seem to be optimistic about business prospects    While there has been some slowing during the summer, in general volumes and revenues   continue to improve  One contact noted that the intermodal shipping business remains   particularly strong, seemingly suggesting that imports remain on track during the third quarter    Large businesses with a presence in or connection to Asia continue to do well  Business   uncertainty is important and is affecting capital expenditure decisions   Turning to the national economy, I concur with much of the Tealbook analysis, which   suggests that the economy is working through a softer phase of the recovery and will likely   improve toward a more rapid pace of growth in 2011  During this softer phase, we are   September 21, 2010 30 of 151             susceptible to negative shocks that could derail the recovery, but, so far, I do not think we have   encountered such a shock, so I think it is reasonable to base policy on the projection that the   economic recovery will continue and, in fact, gather steam next year  It would not be at all   unusual to experience an uneven recovery  In fact, the unusual case would be one where   economic recovery is perfectly smooth  Also, the current recovery process is in response to a   very large shock, and the shock was associated with a financial crisis  Both the size of the shock   and the fact that it was associated with a financial crisis suggest that, according to the empirical   evidence on these matters, the recovery process will be a long one  In addition, further shocks   will hit the economy during this process   I want to comment for just a minute on the nature of optimal policy  What does the   economy look like under an optimal monetary policy?  We have talked repeatedly about being   away from the dual mandate on two dimensions, both inflation and employment  It is far from   clear that this is a good way to think about whether policy is optimal or not  In some simple   models of stabilization policy, shocks buffeting the economy can be offset perfectly, so that key   variables, such as output, employment, and inflation, never deviate from their steady-state   values  Monetary policy in that case completely smoothes the business cycle  This is surely not   the world that we live in  The empirical evidence of which I am aware indicates that monetary   policy can only mitigate a fraction, and a rather small fraction at that, of the variance of key   quantities in the economy  This is an important job, to be sure, and we should strive to carry out   the optimal policy, but we should not expect that that policy will completely or even largely   stabilize the fluctuations induced by shocks  And for an extremely large shock, such as the one   to which we are trying to adjust, it would not surprise me if the trajectories of output, inflation,   and employment appeared to be one-sided for a time, even under the optimal policy   September 21, 2010 31 of 151             I’m going to give you the geeky version of this, so you can check your BlackBerrys while   I—[laughter]  The geeky version would be that you are at steady-state unemployment and   inflation, and now you hit the economy with a large demand shock, so unemployment goes way   up and inflation goes below target for a long time  You then look at any slice of that, at any   point in time, and you say, “We’re missing the mandate on both dimensions”  But even in that   model, with optimal monetary policy, this is not an indication of anything, really, except that you   got hit by a large shock  So that’s my story on that   Let me turn to inflation and inflation expectations  Inflation measured from one year ago   continues to be about 1 percent by a variety of measures  Inflation expectations measured by   market-based TIPS break-even inflation rates seem to be moving somewhat lower  The five-year   TIPS break-even inflation rate is about 12 percent, somewhat low for a horizon like this, and   down substantially from earlier this year  The September expected inflation yield curve   produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland indicated a shift down in the entire curve   from the August level  The whole curve is significantly lower than it was earlier this year  The   Cleveland measures adjust for many factors in these data  This curve remains upward-sloping   but is rather low  A decline in inflation expectations of this amount is not severe enough at this   point to warrant an argument that we are slipping into a Japanese-style deflationary regime    Still, we remain susceptible to negative shocks, and it’s not outside the realm of possibility that   such an outcome could occur   I have argued that we should be prepared to take action, should we encounter further   negative shocks that raises the risk of such an outcome  One difficulty of deciding monetary   policy in this environment is that our largely linear models are not easily adapted to study this   issue  Models we use have never heard of an unintended steady state with near zero nominal   September 21, 2010 32 of 151             interest rates and a slight deflation  In some private-sector analyses, probabilities of 025 or 03   are put on the Japan-like scenario  But our models do not admit such a possibility, leaving us   policymakers with a judgment call on this issue  Even some of the most extensive analysis in   this area—Evans, Guse, and Honkapohja, in particular—does not even get the convergence to   the trapped steady state to match the Japanese and the US data appropriately   One might be tempted to argue that policy should be extremely aggressive in order to   avoid the unintended Japan-style steady state, and because we are missing our mandate on two   dimensions  I have argued that the mandates argument is not necessarily right, as the economy is   adjusting back to normal following a very large shock  Even under optimal monetary policy, one   might observe low inflation and high unemployment for a long time   As for avoiding the Japanese-style steady state, I have seen no analysis that suggests   “shock and awe” would work or even that it would be helpful  Large policy moves are normally   to be avoided expressly because they can be destabilizing  For instance, a very aggressive   Treasury purchase program could be viewed as the beginning of a process of competitive   devaluation, weakening the dollar and leading to a reaction worldwide  This would likely be   counterproductive with respect to our goals   In this situation, without models that are complete enough, I think we need to rely on   what we have learned about optimal monetary policy over the last 25 years  First, optimal policy   is state-contingent—it adjusts as information arrives  Second, we adjust in relatively small   amounts, because the impact comes not from the adjustment itself, but from the expected policy   path out into the infinite future  And, three, rule-like behavior, to the extent possible, is very   desirable to keep expectations well anchored  I think following those principles is very   important  We are obviously in uncharted territory, but these lessons transfer from the earlier   September 21, 2010 33 of 151             experience with interest rate targeting, and we should heed them going forward   Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B for today  I do not   think the macroeconomic situation has changed sufficiently to warrant further policy action at   this juncture  I have a few suggested modifications  In paragraph 2 of alternative B concerning   the inflation outlook, I think the language is good, but the language in alternative A1 is better    Alternative A1 says that, “Inflation is now running below the level of 2 percent or less,” and then   continues from there  I think that language may be very successful in helping to anchor inflation   expectations more firmly and, thus, to prevent the types of drift to disinflation and eventual   deflation than I am concerned about  The language in alternative B, however, is also good in this   regard, but not quite as explicit   In paragraph 3 concerning policy, the sentence on reinvestment, I think, is very   important, and I just wanted to point out that that statement is itself state-contingent  I guess it   September 21, 2010 97 of 151             sort of implies that we are going to revisit this at each meeting  I’m not sure what to think about   that  I just wanted to point that out   In paragraph 4 in alternative B, we have the sentence “is prepared to provide additional   accommodation as needed to support economic recovery and to return inflation over time to   levels consistent with its mandate”  I think this sentence will be taken as implying that new   action is imminent at the next meeting  I’m not sure I would recommend that for today  I think   it might be more prudent for the Committee to keep options open on this dimension  Stating   things flatly, as this sentence does, has its disadvantages  It is basically saying the Committee is   going to do something, but what?  And the markets will wonder, “Well, what is this action going   to be?  Is it going to be a large action?  Is it going to be a small action?  Is it going to be some   kind of quasi-policy rule?”  Also, we may face a situation where the data come in much more   strongly than expected during the coming weeks and months, at which point we would want to   pull back a little bit from that type of announcement  So I’m going to make a suggestion, and I   am more serious about this one  I suggest replacing paragraph 4 in alternative B with the   language from A2 paragraph 5, the alternative  We would end with the word “developments”   period, in alternative B paragraph 4, and then we would start with this language from paragraph   5, the alternative in alternative A2  “The Committee will determine, each time it meets, whether   an adjustment—either upward or downward—to its holdings of securities is needed to foster   maximum employment and price stability”   I think that if we use that we will still be taken as basically indicating that policy change   is very possible and very soon  But it won’t be quite as one-sided as saying that we are going to   take action at the next meeting, and it might damp down the market speculation about what that   action might be  Doing it this way basically states that balance sheet policy is going to be the   September 21, 2010 98 of 151             main margin for adjustment going forward, without completely committing, at this point, to   further action  I don’t think there will be much mistake in the markets about what this means,   but, still, I think it is a little bit better than what is in the current alternative B  It also sets up the   Committee to withdraw accommodation in this dimension in the future, if necessary  That isn’t   where we’re going right now, but it does indicate that it’s not just a one-sided policy where we   are going to add to the balance sheet, but we wouldn’t adjust the other way on this dimension if   the time comes and the economy is very robust and things are going swimmingly   That’s my main substantive comment  I have several other smaller comments  In   alternatives A1 and A2, we have language like “$500 billion over six months”  I do not think   this language is helpful  Instead, I would prefer to say some smaller amount, say $200 billion,   and we will review this at the next meeting  I think that, by doing it this way, we can still set up   expectations that we will continue to add to the balance sheet at future meetings, but that we will   review it and that the Committee maintains its prerogative to see how the data come in, to see   how we are going to adjust policy going forward  One thing I think we have to keep in mind is   that we are talking about possible action on top of an already very large quantitative easing   program and on top of a very large balance sheet, which up to now we have considered as being   a risky  and unprecedented endeavor  I would encourage everybody to remember that a sequence   of smaller moves can in fact add up to a large move, but only if justified by data developments as   they come in  One main disadvantage of a flat amount that spans a series of meetings is that it   effectively takes away the Committee’s ability to react to incoming information going forward   and, thus, sends signals to the private sector about how our judgments are changing about how   the economy is improving or not improving  Of course, you can add bigger amounts going   forward if you feel that the economy is deteriorating further  I think that that is suboptimal   September 21, 2010 99 of 151             policy, no matter how you cut it in any kind of model of monetary policy that I have understood   in the last 25 years   Now, just for contrast, consider this  Suppose you’re following your normal interest rate   targeting policy, and you’re going to take this $500 billion approach over several meetings  If   that were interest rate targeting, then the analogy would be that we were going to raise the   federal funds rate 150 basis points over a sequence of meetings  If you state it that way, it   doesn’t make any sense  Of course, we make smaller moves in the interest rate, understanding   that we might follow that with moves at subsequent meetings  So it’s the path that matters  You   do want to set up the path  There should be a state-contingent path, and the Committee should   have the ability to adjust as it goes along   I have some other comments  I do think quantitative easing is effective in altering   longer-dated yields on Treasury securities  I think part of the decline in yields we’ve observed   recently is due to the anticipation of possible Fed action, as Brian Sack discussed this morning    And I do want to comment that I agree with others around the table that price level targeting is a   real possibility  It would be a game-changer, and it would be difficult  And I do think it needs   further study  I do welcome President Evans’ very next memo on this   I think there are some key issues for the Committee—and we have talked about them   before  One is whether we could possibly lose credibility on inflation targeting altogether if we   tried to switch to price level targeting, which is sort of inflation targeting squared or something    The markets may wonder whether we’re changing horses in midstream to try to adopt a policy   like that in a difficult situation  Those have been some of the considerations that have been   expressed in the Committee before, and I think they would come up again if we tried to go in this   direction  I am sympathetic, though, and this does have a lot of theoretical support  It’s optimal   September 21, 2010 100 of 151             in many theories, and, if it really is optimal, and we have a lot of faith in it, then we should find a   way to get it done  So this remains a very interesting area for further discussion, and I thank   President Evans for his memo  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, let me see if I can get a groundswell going for “if”  I   think it would help soften it a little bit  I think estimates of the probabilities that we’re going to   take action at the next meeting with this statement are a little low  I think they’re going to go to   09 or 095 or something  Maybe that’s okay, but the Committee sounds a little more tentative   than that—I think President Dudley was about right, in that we’re thinking two-thirds or   something   So I do think it’s still a little too strong  Maybe “if” would help mitigate it a little   bit—it probably doesn’t make too much difference—but I’d support that  "
8874,2010-10-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to address the four questions that   you outlined—frameworks for specifying objectives, whether I favor additional LSAPs, methods of   adjustment, and how to communicate, including sample statements    Before I start, I want to say thanks very much for the staff memos  I thought they were very   informative, especially the memo by Kiley, Meyer, Levin, and Nelson  I don’t agree with every   single thing in them, but I appreciate them nonetheless   I think the good news is that we are not far from a viable framework that will work for the   Committee and for the economy  I’m going to give you an overview of what I’m going to say, then   I’m going to go into a few details, and then I’ll conclude   In the big picture, as far as objectives are concerned, I think we have successfully said that   price stability provides the best backdrop for maximum sustainable economic growth and   employment  This language was born of the experience in the 1970s, when we had high and   volatile inflation, which caused substantial turmoil in the US and global economies  My view is   that, at this juncture, I wouldn’t mess with the success that we’ve had by using this language,   because I think it’s true and I think it works fairly well  I’ll come back to that in a minute   On tools, I would prefer just asset purchases, not large-scale asset purchases  I think they do   provide our best choice at the current juncture  I do think they would be effective  I would note that   inflation expectations have been rising as we’ve been discussing the possibility of additional   quantitative easing during the autumn; for example, the five-year TIPS expected inflation rate is up   to about 164 basis points today from a low of about 120   Regarding strategy, as all of you know, I’m in favor of smaller state-contingent purchases   with a twist—I’m going to suggest that we provide guidance for future meetings  I’d prefer   numbers in the range of $100 to $150 billion for an intermeeting move—I’d say that that should be   October 15, 2010 13 of 62             the basic unit that we talk about  That corresponds roughly to the amount of new issuance and, in   fact, to many numbers that were discussed in the memos that were distributed  Then, as part of the   future guidance, we could also include a promise to continue purchases at the next meeting with   language that would sound like the following  “The Committee anticipates that this pace of   purchases is very likely to be/is likely to be/could be/may not be/is unlikely to be reaffirmed at the   next meeting subject to an assessment of economic conditions at that time”  This would be an open-  ended approach  There would be no long-term level mentioned  I think any mention of the long-  term target is inconsistent with the idea that you want a state-dependent policy  You’re essentially   committing to go to a certain level of the balance sheet, regardless of what the data tell you  The   data could come in much stronger or much weaker than you thought, and you should be able to   adjust in the meantime   Starting with a smaller but realistic amount, one that’s consistent with what’s in the memos,   and then giving some forward guidance will set up expectations of a path of purchases, and it will   give the Committee a chance to review the policy at each meeting and make adjustments  Later,   maybe much later, when it’s time to reduce the size of the balance sheet, you can reduce it in the   same way by saying that we’re going to move the balance sheet to a smaller level in an effort to get   back to normal, and we’re going to reassess that at each meeting, and we are going to give forward   guidance on that as well  This kind of approach would correspond most closely to draft statement 1,   and I’ll have more to say on that as I go through these remarks in more detail   To address these issues in more detail, let me come back to the frameworks for specifying   objectives  Let me just reiterate, as I have many times, that I do support inflation targeting and an   explicit numerical inflation goal  Even so, I’m not sure that we should try to make that maneuver   right at this juncture  I’m not completely opposed to it—you might be able to talk me into it—but   October 15, 2010 14 of 62             this may not be the right moment to try to force that into the discussion  We do have an implicit   inflation target emanating from our quarterly forecast exercise, and I think that’s satisfactory for   now, and it does work fairly well for us  A lot of issues arise if we want to mention specific   numbers—for example, what price index to use and whether to target a core inflation measure   versus an overall inflation measure  I think the latter is a difficult issue and one that has not been   faced up to well by the Committee or by the macroeconomic literature  There’s an issue about time   horizons  There are issues about biases and inflation measures that haven’t been revisited very   much since they were heavily discussed in the 1990s  So I don’t think we’ve really set up a process   to come to an agreement on these types of issues, and maybe it’s not the right juncture to try to force   this into the process  Also, what matters is the credibility of the target, not the fact that you name a   target at all  Even if you name a target, people may not believe you, at least initially, and it may   take time to work out that credibility   Again, we’ve long said that promoting price stability is the best contribution the Fed can   make to maximum sustainable economic growth and employment  I really do believe that  I think   that’s supported by overwhelming evidence of the experience in the 1970s and the experience since   1984 up until the current financial crisis  The current crisis is certainly extremely serious, but this   was born of financial instability and poorly functioning financial markets, and inflation wouldn’t fix   that problem  So I’m saying  Why mess with success?  Let’s just keep our normal description of   the importance of low and stable inflation to our dual mandate   I think it’s especially dangerous to tie monetary policy too closely to unemployment  Even   though we care a lot about obtaining better labor market performance, persistently high   unemployment rates can and do occur in the industrialized countries  Let me give you some   examples  Germany has been above 7 percent unemployment since 1993  Canada was below 7   October 15, 2010 15 of 62             percent for only two months between 1977 and 2005  Spain averaged 19 percent unemployment   over a period of 25 years; today Spain is over 20 percent again  These persistently high   unemployment rates can be driven by factors that are not well understood, in my view, and that   have to do with demographics, labor market structure, unemployment insurance policy, policies   relating to hiring and firing workers; that is, they’re due to real factors that are outside the central   bank’s control  So, if you tie monetary policy too closely to unemployment, even though we   obviously have our eye on unemployment, this can pull inflation policy far off course and lead to   disaster for everyone involved  I would put the US in the 1970s as an example of that   Let me turn to methods of adjustment and how to proceed  Again, I’m for smaller state-  contingent purchases with forward guidance  And, again, I think this will set up expectations of a   whole policy path  At the same time, as data come in and the economic situation evolves, this will   allow both the FOMC to adjust policy and the markets to adjust their expectations about policy   going forward  Again, $100 to $150 billion is the unit of purchases  It could be adjusted if desired,   although I wouldn’t anticipate that we’d want to get into arguments about small changes in these   numbers  One thing I like about this kind of a unit is that we’re sort of purchasing all of the new   issuance  That might be controversial in itself, but it gives us a metric for where we need to be or   where we’d like to be on our purchases  It will add up to a substantial move over time, but only if   it’s supported by the data as they come in  For example, you could easily get much bigger numbers   with this approach, but you wouldn’t just announce the number up front; instead, you would   announce a policy that would lead to a path, and that path could end up being a large amount    Markets will immediately pencil in some expectations and then refine those expectations going   forward as the data come in about how much the Fed is eventually going to do with this policy, and   I think that’s exactly what we would like them to do   October 15, 2010 16 of 62             The forward guidance also helps set this path of expectations  For example, we might say   that the Committee anticipates that the pace of purchases “is very likely to be” reaffirmed at the next   meeting subject to an assessment of economic conditions  If the data came in stronger, you could   give that guidance less emphasis by changing the wording to just “is likely to be” or “could be”  If   there was instead more doubt about the pace of the recovery, we could change these words around   and change the extent of forward guidance  Of course, we would relate qualitatively, as in draft   statement 1, to progress toward price stability and maximum sustainable employment  I think the   open-ended nature of what I’m suggesting gives us plenty of size, even though we’re starting off   with a small amount, $100 billion  Some people might think that’s not enough to have an influence,   but it’s the whole path that matters, not just the initial number  And, again, we’d sell off in the same   way, that is, in a state-contingent way   The best analogue for this approach is interest rate targeting  When we’re in normal times   and we’re targeting interest rates, we would say we’re going to move in increments of 25 basis   points, even in an environment where we might eventually expect to move interest rates much   higher or much lower  I think markets will immediately see that this approach is analogous to   interest rate targeting and Taylor-type policy rules, and that will help us communicate so that our   policy is well understood going forward   Regarding draft statements, I’m closest to draft statement 1 with a few tweaks—for instance,   there would be no mention of a date like May 2011  What I like about draft statement 1 is that, even   though this is a momentous decision for this Committee, it represents the least change from existing   policy, so I think it will be the most reassuring and gain the most acceptance in the economy and in   financial markets  If we went ahead with this, we’d be causing no more turmoil than necessary,   even though we’re adopting an unconventional policy   October 15, 2010 17 of 62             On “shock and awe,” I’ve often said that “shock and awe” is not likely to be an optimal   policy  I thought there was a good discussion of (S,s) policies in this memo  (S,s) is going to be   optimal only if there are fixed costs of policy actions—I didn’t see very much talk about what the   fixed costs of policy actions would be  Again, we do not normally operate this way  Furthermore,   (S,s) policy has a large range of inaction—you don’t do anything in the middle, because you don’t   want to pay the fixed cost, and, if you get to one of the borders, then you do take action, and it’s a   fairly large action  Also, even if you follow an (S,s)-type policy, the markets are still going to form   expectations about when you might hit one of the boundaries and when you might take further   action, so it’s still a dynamic process  It’s actually very difficult to figure out completely optimal   policies under this kind of approach  But I think probably the bigger point is that the 2008–2009   period has passed—we’re not in free fall, we’re not in as dire a situation as we were then—so I   think it’s time for a more disciplined approach to quantitative easing   I think that the memo did a good job of saying that a “shock and awe” policy could fall flat,   or it could cause dramatic instability  Those also are reasons why we don’t normally behave that   way  In addition, consider what a “shock and awe” policy would have looked like in, say, the   summer of 2004, when we were on the brink of starting tightening actions—we would have   announced in June 2004 that we were planning to raise the federal funds rate by 400 basis points by   June of 2006  We just don’t operate that way  Instead, we said, “We’re going to go up 25 basis   points, and we’re going to review further moves in the future”  But we didn’t give forward   guidance that we probably would continue to raise rates if the economy continued to improve   I have just two other issues to cover  On targeting longer-term rates, I am sympathetic to   this, but I don’t think it would be a good move at this juncture  I’d like to see a lot more analysis on   this—I think this is a great topic for research  On price-level targeting, I’m also sympathetic to it   October 15, 2010 18 of 62             and would like to see more work on it, but I also would not adopt it at this juncture  Price-level   targeting is something that might be a possibility if the situation deteriorated substantially from what   it is now and if we felt that we had to take further and more dramatic action, but, for now, I don’t   think it’s the right move  I know I rambled on a little bit  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8894,2010-11-02,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to refer to exhibit 3, panel 17, the   implied volatility of longer-term rates, and, in particular, I guess the implied volatility of a   10-year rate three years ahead  You argued that this volatility has been declining  Just in   looking at this picture, I wonder whether this really does predict volatility three years out very   well  For example, the picture says that in 2006 and 2007 this market would not have expected   very much volatility, which has turned out to be completely wrong     So what’s the forecasting record of this?     Okay—if this measure doesn’t have that good a track record, then we   can’t really rely on it to give us any indication     Fair enough   November 2–3, 2010 25 of 238               Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is for Nathan Sheets  I just wanted to   see if I could clarify something  You said that, regarding the emerging market economies, you   saw no first-order risks  Is that correct?     So, even though we’re hearing a lot about dollar depreciation and the   consternation that is causing in the rest of the world, you’re not really seeing too much danger   there?  Is that correct?     Would you extend that analysis to Japan, where the yen has been a lot   stronger in the last few weeks and months?     Okay  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy appears to be   expanding at a slow pace  Business contacts tend to be mildly optimistic concerning prospects   for the holiday season and for 2011  The District unemployment rate, calculated based on   18 metropolitan statistical areas, is 91 percent according to the most recent data, somewhat   below the national rate  The foreclosure rate is about 1 percentage point lower in the Eighth   District compared with the nation as a whole, according to data from lender processing services    The delinquency rate, however, is about the same as the national rate  District employment   growth has lagged a bit behind the national employment growth rate according to the most recent   readings  Larger District businesses continue to report strong sales revenue and profitability    They remain reluctant to add to payrolls  Expansion plans are often centered in Asia, which,   according to these contacts, continues to boom  A large District car rental company reports brisk   sales and the clear return of the business traveler  For smaller businesses, however, the outlook   is more mixed  District agribusiness income is expected to be very strong this year   For the US as a whole, it appears that prospects for a return to recession, never all that   high, have diminished in recent weeks  I envision the pace of expansion increasing through the   remainder of 2010 and through 2011  Any macroeconomic forecast, however, is clouded by   November 2–3, 2010 63 of 238             uncertainty, and we policymakers have to be prepared to respond should actual events deviate   from the expected path   I expect labor markets will continue to lag, as they did following the 1990–1991   recession and again following the 2001 recession  It seems likely that there was a structural   break in US labor market dynamics sometime in the 1980s  Before the break, labor markets   recovered relatively rapidly following recessions  But since that time, labor market recovery has   been much slower and more tenuous following recessions  Understanding the nature of this   structural break is an important area for research in the Federal Reserve System   Globally, booming Asia continues to be the most important factor  A slowdown or   mismanagement there could have significant implications for the US and for Europe  A   possibly weaker Japanese economy is also a risk  In Europe, I see the sovereign debt crisis   continuing to play out during the next two years, as countries try to establish credibility in   international markets for their fiscal retrenchment programs  I see the ECB as unlikely to match   a US quantitative easing program   I think the likely return of asset purchases here in the US has largely been priced into   markets already  During the fall, 5- and 10-year TIPS break-even inflation expectations moved   up fairly sharply  As Brian Sack pointed out, as a result, real yields at the 5-year horizon   declined by as much as 50 basis points  Under most conventional macroeconomic theory, this is   an appropriate stabilization policy  Other effects of the policy have been entirely conventional as   well, with equity market valuations rising and the dollar depreciating during the intermeeting   period  Because these price movements have already occurred, I do not expect significant   movements in response to any announcement we may make tomorrow   November 2–3, 2010 64 of 238             I have argued that the FOMC’s near-zero interest rate policy, by itself, is insufficient to   keep the US economy out of trouble  This is because zero rates are also consistent with   expectations of a permanent, mild deflation, such as the one experienced in Japan over the last   decade  Movement toward a regime like that would exacerbate problems in the US housing   sector, where nominal contracting based on expectations of approximately 2 percent inflation is   the norm  One way to avoid such an outcome is to supplement the near-zero interest rate policy   with another program, a quantitative easing program  Such a program needs to be managed   carefully, as it would possibly run out of control  However, I think that program can be very   effective with the appropriate risk management  I see this as a better alternative than simply   remaining at the near-zero federal funds rate target for several years, possibly allowing inflation   and inflation expectations to drift lower and lower, as they have during much of 2010, according   to many 12-month inflation measures and according to the TIPS measures of inflation   expectations   I remain opposed to “shock and awe” approaches to monetary policy  I see little purpose   in naming large numbers in order to impact financial markets on a particular day  One can   always surprise markets by taking an unexpected action, but this has very little to do with the   effectiveness or the degree of optimality of the policy  The policy is the entire expected   sequence of actions that the Committee intends to take in response to the state of the economy   and to the shocks encountered by the economy  An action on a particular day is not a policy in   this sense  Unusual, large, unexpected actions tend to confuse the issue, because they set up   expectations of similar unusual, large, unexpected actions in the future  This dynamic is   destabilizing and counterproductive  This is why I have tried to advocate something much closer   to the way we have successfully implemented interest rate targeting policy over the last   November 2–3, 2010 65 of 238             25 years—small moves, which then set up expectations of future moves contingent on the   behavior of the economy  I hope we can make progress towards this type of policy at this   meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Can I just clarify?     I just said that merely saying that unemployment is high and inflation   is very low doesn’t tell you anything one way or the other about the quality of the policy, so   that’s consistent with what you’re saying  It could be that we are following completely horrible   policy, but we can argue that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B generally  I   support the suggestions just made by President Kocherlakota to switch to the word   “disappointingly” instead of “unacceptably,” and to include the phrase “about the rate of   progress” in paragraph 5  I also support the suggestions made by President Fisher to add “up to”   in various places in the statement of alternative B   I distributed a memo that outlined my preferred approach to alternative B, which I’ll   briefly recap here  My preferred approach would be a threefold modification to paragraph 2    The first sentence of the paragraph would be unchanged  Let me stress that I think the goal here   is more satisfactory progress toward price stability and maximum sustainable employment, so I   don’t think there’s very much doubt about what the goal is  The first change would be in the   next sentence, where I would suggest announcing the pace of purchases, which is $75 billion per   month  Then I would include a sentence that has some forward guidance, namely, “The   Committee judges that, based on the current economic outlook, this pace of purchases will   continue through the second quarter of 2011”  What I especially like about that is the phrase   “based on the current economic outlook”  So we would be saying that, yes, we think this pace of   purchases will continue on for a while, but we’re also aware that the error bands around our   forecast are gigantic and lots of things can happen in the interim, not to mention the program   could go badly, and we may want to reconsider   November 2–3, 2010 168 of 238             If we did it this way, we would let the markets do the math and get away from the idea of   putting a big number in the statement, which I do not like  The markets are certainly good at   math—better than I am—and they will substitute their own numbers, and they will also   substitute their own forecasts for how they think the economy is going to evolve over the coming   eight or nine months and make an assessment themselves of what they think the Committee will   do going forward  I think that’s the kind of dynamic we’d like to have, namely, the private   sector assessing how they think the economy is going to evolve and, therefore, what they think   the policy reaction will be  In the meantime, we’d be making statements about how we see the   economy evolving and how we see policy evolving going forward  That’s the normal monetary   policy dynamic that I think would be useful in this situation   Finally, I would move the state-contingent sentence from the very end of paragraph 5 up   to paragraph 3 immediately after the sentence I just discussed  That sentence says “the   Committee will regularly review…” and so on  So right after providing the forward guidance, it   would say the Committee will regularly review this decision  This emphasizes the fact that   everything depends on the data, and it might change going forward  I see the tool statement in   paragraph 5, “the Committee will employ its policy tools as necessary,” as reminding markets   that we can and will use alternative tools if necessary, so I think it’s a bit out of place to put the   sentence about the regular review in that paragraph  I thought that paragraph was intended to   remind people that we’ve been very innovative during the whole crisis over the last three years,   and we certainly remain determined to be innovative in the future should conditions deteriorate   further  So I see the first sentence in paragraph 5 as not the state-contingent idea that I wanted to   get across  I would prefer that state-contingent idea to be in paragraph 3  These edits are all   minor, I would say, but that would be my preferred way to go ahead   November 2–3, 2010 169 of 238             Let me comment on a few other issues  On the question of so-called “LSAP” versus   “quantitative easing,” I do not like the “large-scale” part of “large-scale asset purchase”  I think   that smacks of a desire to surprise markets, which is hardly ever optimal policy  Unless you   think that we’re in some kind of dire situation, I would not recommend that  The policy is a   systematic response to shocks and to the state of the economy, so I prefer simply “asset-purchase   program”  I don’t think it would be possible to get off the “quantitative easing” language, nor is   it really necessary to do so  We can probably shape that language and define it as we wish  I   think that, as it stands now in markets, “quantitative easing” connotes an inflationary policy,   frankly, and I think that works fine for our current purposes  The Committee, in my view, is   defending its implicit inflation target because we are on the low side of it  I also see inflation   expectations as the primary determinant of actual inflation  So, to the extent that we’re able to   push inflation expectations higher, I would expect that to have an effect on actual inflation; as   the staff has emphasized repeatedly in the Tealbook, inflation expectations are acting as an   anchor balancing slack effects that are in that model   I see the policy, more broadly speaking, as preventing us from falling into a deflationary-  trap steady state like the one that Japan has been stuck in for some time  I have argued that near-  zero rates alone allow a disinflationary drift in expectations  With near-zero rates for several   years, which is what we’re looking at in all likelihood, and no other policy moves to supplement   the zero interest rate policy, the Fisher relation—that’s Irving Fisher, not Richard Fisher   [laughter]—dictates expectations of a mild deflation  As I see it, this is exactly what has   happened in Japan, and, even though we’ve been talking about it for a long time around this   table, I’ve seen very little to dissuade me from this view  I think we should take this theory more   seriously than we already have  It’s a very general argument that spans many different models    November 2–3, 2010 170 of 238             It requires only an inflation target, a Taylor rule, and a Fisher equation  You can put any other   favorite features that you want in your model, but, once you do that, you’ll still have a second   steady state that looks exactly like what has happened in Japan  For the US to move toward   that type of steady state is a serious risk  As I argued yesterday, nominal contracting in the US   means that those contracts were set up based on an implicit inflation target of 2 percent  If we   went to minus 1 percent inflation, there would have to be some transition to that kind of a steady   state  That would further disrupt housing markets, in particular  Also, I think that if the US   went into that kind of a steady state, there would be global implications  You might also get   Europe into that steady state—Japan is already there—and then you’d be in a very difficult   policy situation for a long period of time   Therefore, I think it’s important to take preemptive action to avoid that outcome  So far,   what we’ve done ahead of this meeting suggests that this policy seems to be working, but I   would be cautious and withhold judgment on that—it’s unclear at this point, and we don’t know   how well it will work going forward  If we are able to get past this risk, we will face new   challenges  I’m very cognizant of those, and many voices around the table, including President   Lacker, President Plosser, President Fisher, President Hoenig, President Kocherlakota, and   others, have aptly articulated them     Let me talk about just a couple more issues and I’ll be done  On the issue of fed funds   rate equivalence, I think I’ve come to the conclusion that this is probably not the right way to   think about our QE policy  I think that those calculations are too linear and too local  They’re   estimates around a particular point which are then extrapolated out for very large purchases  I   think nonlinearities are probably quite important in our policies  These very linear, very local   estimates of the effects of asset purchases tend to indicate that buying the entire outstanding   November 2–3, 2010 171 of 238             stock of Treasuries would have small effects  I think that’s indefensible and surely not the right   analysis  So we need something better than what we’ve got on this dimension   On rationalizing missing both sides of our mandate, I’ve argued previously and a little bit   this morning that this is not a good argument by itself  The fact that unemployment is high and   inflation is low is nothing more than the impulse response that you would expect from a very   large shock to the economy  Furthermore, if we take our model forecast seriously, we’re going   to continue to have high unemployment and inflation below target—it takes a long time to return   to steady state, especially when the recession is associated with a financial crisis  I think   President Lacker had exactly the right take on this  It’s all about the pace of returning to the   steady state—President Kocherlakota, also raised this—it’s not about the levels or the mere   citing of the fact that unemployment is high and inflation is low   On the risks to our policy, I agree with yesterday’s statement by the Chairman  So I’m   going to skip over any further comments on that   Regarding the challenges going forward, I see three in addition to the many others that   have been talked about here  I actually think our policy may be fairly successful on the inflation   side—maybe too successful—and we may end up overshooting our implicit 2 percent inflation   target  I think we have to think about how we might react to that situation in the coming   quarters  Unemployment will probably remain quite high, and, in that case, there could be a   national discussion about stagflation—with inflation moving up and unemployment not moving   very much—so we have to be prepared to confront that argument  The UK has that situation, to   some extent, and the language they use in response says that their forecast is predicting a return   of inflation toward target  As it stands right now, I’m not sure we’re in a good position to make   that argument   November 2–3, 2010 172 of 238             I think it’s also possible that this pace of purchases will prove to be a little heavy-handed,   based on Brian Sack’s presentation earlier, and pushing the Desk to capacity in some sense  We   may have to be prepared to back off a little bit from that pace if we get market functioning   problems  I think we ran into some of that with the MBS purchases, especially late in that   program, and especially with agency debt  I’d want to be careful that that kind of thing is not   then interpreted as a backing off of monetary policy   Finally, let me just say that it has become a lot more popular now to talk about mandate-  consistency around the table  This was an issue that I thought had been settled long ago, but   maybe it’s an appropriate time to revisit it  It’s making me a little bit nervous  I think we could   unintentionally ignite a debate on price stability that may not be wise  I think this Committee has   come to the conclusion, mostly in the 1990s, that something like 2 percent was a reasonable   number, and we could call that price stability  But it’s very reasonable to say that that isn’t really   price stability  Price stability must mean zero inflation, so I think it’s a little bit tricky to   reemphasize these mandate issues that have long been settled  We felt that providing price   stability, as we think about it, is the best backdrop toward full employment, and I think we   should probably stick with that and not stir up that debate again  But I’d like to hear others’   views on that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     What are we proposing?     I support that     Mr Chairman, we would be letting the markets do the math under   Kevin’s approach  "
8920,2010-12-14,"  Brian, I’m actually more concerned about chart 4, which has the   implied federal funds rate path  I didn’t think we were doing anything that stepped away from   the “extended period” language, and I would have expected the message to be that we’re just as   committed to “extended period” as we ever were, and in addition, we’re doing quantitative   easing, and in some ways we’re strengthening our commitment to stay low for longer  What do   you think is going on in chart 4?     Do you think the private sector is more optimistic than we are about   prospects for the economy, and that’s why this curve shifted up?     Is there some regular cycle on which we normally review this?  I know   at one time it was annually     So if we do six months, it’s kind of in a cycle     Like normal business     Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business contacts in the Eighth District are   cautiously optimistic about prospects for 2011 on balance  Early reports on holiday retail sales   are positive, and I hope that the coming year will produce a relatively good outcome for   consumer spending  The positive holiday reports extend from smaller retailers operating in the   Eighth District to national and global retailers that are based in the District  So, on this   dimension, I agree wholeheartedly with President Fisher  Large transportation companies in the   Eighth District report brisk business across regions of the United States and globally  In many   cases, this is consistent with the improving outlook for US consumption   I convened a Health Care Industry Council in recent weeks, composed of a variety of   participants in the industry in the Eighth District  The general view is that there is a high level of   uncertainty, even inside the industry, about how health-care reform will play out and what the   implications will be for the nature of the industry going forward  This seemed to be consistent   with the views of business contacts outside of health care who claim that without more clarity in   this dimension they are cautious about significant investments and additional hiring   December 14, 2010 40 of 127             Turning to the national outlook, my view is that it has improved somewhat  I hope that   2011 will be a little stronger than may have seemed likely even a few months ago  I agree with   President Rosengren and many others here that one of the key risks going forward is the ongoing   sovereign debt crisis in Europe  I’m not very confident that the contagion will end when the next   country on the block is Spain  I think markets will test European resolve severely at that   juncture  I think the Europeans do have significant resolve to meet the challenge and some tools   that can be deployed, including ECB purchases of sovereign government debt, but in general the   situation seems very shaky to me   Another key risk for 2011 is the level of federal debt and fiscal deficits here in the United   States  The decision of the President and the Congress to add to, rather than to subtract from, the   level of US debt outstanding gives me pause  US debt and deficit numbers are not much   different from those of the very countries that are in trouble today in Europe  We, as a nation,   are pushing very hard on our credibility in international markets  It could go badly and derail   further US recovery prospects   I want to make a few remarks on the effectiveness of asset purchases so far  My view is   that these purchases were very effective, in the sense that in the run-up to the November decision   we observed classic monetary easing effects in financial markets  So, between the Chairman’s   speech on August 27 at Jackson Hole and the decision at the last FOMC meeting on   November 3, we saw real yields decline significantly—the five-year TIPS yield hit minus   50 basis points at one point  We saw an increase in inflation expectations that was significant    Inflation expectations, according to five-year TIPS yields, were about 120 basis points during the   summer; today they’re around 160 basis points, so that’s a 40 basis point increase in inflation   expectations  I prefer the TIPS measures of inflation expectations to the survey measures  I   December 14, 2010 41 of 127             don’t think the survey measures are significantly sensitive to market events  We saw an increase   in US equity prices, broadly speaking, which continues to this day  And we saw a decline in   the dollar, which I would regard as a normal side effect of policy easing, given all else is held   approximately constant in the rest of the world   I think these effects were fairly clearly due to the anticipation of further asset purchases    Surely, there are other things going on in the world, but if you follow financial markets, then it   was pretty clear that they were focusing on the actions of this Committee  These effects are   about as classic as it gets for financial market effects of an easing of monetary policy  It was as   if we had lowered the federal funds rate by, say, 50 basis points or we were anticipating lowering   the federal funds rate by 50 basis points  After the November 2–3 meeting, as often happens in   financial markets, attention goes forward and adjusts  So we saw an increase in longer-term   nominal yields   I thought the Tealbook summary of this issue was very good, but I’m just going to make   a few comments  There are, of course, many factors that are affecting nominal yields  I think   the real outlook for 2011 has improved  That has increased real rates, perhaps substantially, and   led to some increase in inflation expectations, although that probably is a little bit more minor    There has been a reassessment of possible policy paths that could be followed by the Committee   in the first half of 2011, and there has been an announcement of a major fiscal package, perhaps   against all odds, and that had a big effect on nominal yields as well   An increase in nominal rates would also be associated with the success of asset   purchases  If we’re successful, we expect to have some influence on the real economy, which   would cause real rates to rise, and they could rise in anticipation of those effects  And we expect   and hope—or I hope—that inflation expectations will increase, not decrease and continue to go   December 14, 2010 42 of 127             down towards zero or below zero  Thus, the very success of the program would put upward   pressure on nominal rates   What do we conclude from this?  A couple of things  First, I don’t think asset purchases   of this type are completely neutral, as is suggested by some theories  Going through these events   over the last six months has shown that, whatever else is going on, these purchases do have   major effects in financial markets  Second, the asset purchase program does put downward   pressure on nominal yields  I don’t think it could be any other way for purchases of this size    We are a major player in this market  But we are not targeting a particular rate or set of rates as   we would under normal interest rate targeting  So, because we’re not setting a target, and   because there are many other factors that influence nominal yields, other things can happen    And the success of the asset purchase program will indeed put upward pressure on nominal   yields, even as purchases put downward pressure on those yields  There’s an old saying in   monetary policy that looking at nominal yields alone is insufficient for evaluating the impact of   monetary policy, and I think we have a classic case of that here  I’ll stop there  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have argued that the financial market   effects of asset purchases were substantial prior to the November meeting  I expect that the   effects on real variables, such as consumption and investment, will follow with a lag of one-half   to one year  This would be similar to the real effects of monetary policy easing estimated, for   instance, by Frank Smets and Raf Wouters, or possibly Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans  The   2011 outlook is indeed improving, but it’s too early to come to any policy conclusion based on   that  Inflation expectations have increased, according to the five-year TIPS measures, as many   December 14, 2010 88 of 127             have discussed in the run-up to the November meeting, and remain higher today than they were   during the summer  One thing about the five-year measure is that I think we should be able to hit   our implicit inflation target over a period as long as five years—that has usually been a goal of   the Committee, so I think that’s a reasonable expectation   Still, actual core inflation measures are low, as many have pointed out—measured from   one year ago, nearly all inflation measures are below 1 percent  This is a concern to me—I   would like to see this disinflation trend turn around  Until it does, I would advise remaining with   the current course of asset purchases  Therefore, for today I support alternative B  I suggest one   minor change  I would omit, as I have argued before, explicit reference to the $600 billion   figure  We could interpret the $600 billion as a form of forward guidance based on current   forecasts of the Committee, but I think it’s an inferior way to give forward guidance and   unnecessary  I think that a big figure like that lumps us in with other types of stimulus programs   that have been enacted over the last couple of years, when, in fact, this is ordinary monetary   policy, the purchase and sale of Treasury securities  So instead I would simply state that the   pace of purchases would be at $75 billion per month and that we are likely to continue this pace   of purchases through the second quarter of 2011, and then I would let the financial markets do   the math—they’re supposedly good at doing the math   In a way, that would be no real change, but it would have, to me anyway, some   advantages going forward  We can and probably will adjust the program on the dimension of the   pace of purchases, that is, we might slow or increase the pace of purchases, and we might adjust   the program along the dimension of its length, so that we could say, for example, that we’re   going to continue through the third quarter or only through April or something like that  So   those are the two dimensions we’re likely to change, and we can do so without putting the big   December 14, 2010 89 of 127             number in the statement  I think that might be a bit helpful at this juncture  I think it would also   help to reinforce that the program is, indeed, adjustable and state-contingent and, above all, that   monetary policy is a continuous process, not a series of temporary actions  I think it would also   help to eliminate the talk of QE3 and QE4 that is reverberating around financial markets and   instead get markets to think in terms of a policy rule for the Committee  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
8944,2011-01-25,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought this was very nice work and a   very nice presentation—I really enjoyed it and found it a pleasure to read  I’m going to make a   couple of comments, and I think they’re going to dovetail with the previous discussion here   I’d say that the takeaway from these ten memos is that the research on this question, as   good as it is, is not yet able to provide a satisfactory answer  I’m going to suggest that, to make   progress, we have to move away from the partial equilibrium analysis emphasized here and   toward more general equilibrium analysis with monetary policy explicitly included  I’m going to   give you a rundown of what I think that means and what I have in mind, because there is   literature on this   The question is  Should we analyze the labor market by itself or in the context of a fully   articulated macroeconomic model with monetary policy included?  I think the answer is that   you’ve got to have the fully articulated model in order to get the answer to the question that we   face around this table, namely  How much impact can monetary policy have on unemployment?   Work in this direction does exist, although it was not stressed in these memos, so I am   going to stress it here  The literature began in the 1990s with papers by David Andolfatto in the   American Economic Review, and Monika Merz in the Journal of Monetary Economics  They   used a very basic idea, namely, to take Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides labor search theory and   merge it into otherwise standard business cycle models  If you go through all the pain of doing   that, the model will produce a business cycle, but then there will be frictional search-theoretic   unemployment, which will also fluctuate in response to shocks to the economy  The   unemployment in that model is an equilibrium unemployment rate, and it is bouncing around all   the time as the economy gets hit by shocks  But there are no other frictions in those models, and   January 25–26, 2011 41 of 282              there’s no monetary policy at all  I would say that those papers were moderately successful and   surely pointed the way for future research—these authors were writing before the modern era of   New Keynesian macroeconomics really got started   Since the publication of those articles, there have been a lot of contributions, in   particular, the sticky-price New Keynesian macro models associated with Mike Woodford and   others  Therefore, the natural question would be, if you took that kind of a monetary policy   model, but with no unemployment, could you put Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides into it and get   a sensible answer to these kinds of questions?  The answer, actually, is “yes,” and it has been   done  One example I know of is Mark Gertler, Luca Sala, and Antonella Trigari recently in the   Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking  What do they do?  They take the same kind of exercise   as in Andolfatto and Merz, but they put it in Woodford’s model of monetary policy  In this   model, then, there’s labor search-theoretic unemployment, and the level of unemployment is   going to be fluctuating in response to shocks to this economy, so you might very naturally call   this the natural rate of unemployment or the equilibrium rate of unemployment  But in this   model, because of sticky prices, the unemployment rate that you actually observe will not be   equal to this frictionless or search-theoretic unemployment rate  And, because there is a gap   between those two unemployment rates, it is going to be the natural variable of focus for   monetary policy  It is what you would be trying to determine, and it is what you would be trying   to reduce in the model   Gertler, Sala, and Trigari actually do calculate this, and, for those of you who have stayed   with me this far and are interested, you can check their figure 7, which actually plots it pre-crisis,   which is when they wrote the paper  You could calculate it post-crisis—it’s an exact analogue of   the New Keynesian output gap    January 25–26, 2011 42 of 282              I think this is the most promising way to think about this issue  Of course, these   calculations are complicated; furthermore, I think we heard Dave Reifschneider saying earlier   that he doesn’t really trust these models yet, which is very sensible  But, at the same time,   conceptually, this is definitely the way to go  We’ve got to get busy and work on this and go   forward  I think it is important to pursue this line of research and try to make further progress in   this area   What is the bottom line intuition?  I think it works this way  The economy is hit by a   large shock, which generates a lot of unemployment, but that would happen whether prices were   sticky or flexible  So the relevant variable for monetary policy would be the difference between   the sticky-price and the flexible-price levels of unemployment  This difference is likely to be   small, so I would look at the high level of unemployment as not being very informative for   monetary policy at this point  Also, there would be a great deal of uncertainty about the size of   this gap  If we do further research, we might be able to pin this down better—we might be able   to reduce that uncertainty, and we might be able to change the intuition, because maybe the   intuition is wrong  That’s what research is for, and the assessment remains to be seen  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy continues to   improve at a moderate pace  Many businesses report stronger revenue, better profitability, and   improved household consumption  Holiday retail sales were quite robust  Some businesses plan   to boost capital expenditures during 2011, and there are a few tentative indications that firms in   the District may be more inclined to hire new workers this year  This is the first time that I have   heard even tentative indications of that   Residential real estate in the District remains weak  Some parts of the District, in fact,   seemed to experience renewed deterioration in conditions during the second half of 2010    Agribusiness in the District continues to be characterized by optimism for 2011, driven in part by   higher prices for many of its products  There seems to be increasing anecdotal evidence of land   prices accelerating beyond what seems to be supported by fundamentals  That’s something I’ll   be keeping an eye on in 2011   Large businesses headquartered in the District continue to report brisk business and   remain optimistic for this year  Booming Asia continues to be an outsized factor for many of   these firms, but most are also reporting good results for domestic business  Europe, so far,   remains a steady source of business for these firms  I did not detect problems in the EU, at this   point, from the perspective of these businesses   January 25–26, 2011 117 of 282              Nationally, prospects for the economy seem to have improved rather markedly relative to   last summer  I attribute part of the improvement to this Committee’s asset purchase program  I   think that this program did four things  It put downward pressure on short-term real yields, it put   upward pressure on expected inflation as measured by market-based TIPS, it contributed to a   rally in equity markets, and it contributed to downward pressure on the trade-weighted value of   the dollar  In my view, these are classic signs of monetary policy easing  They are exactly what   you’d expect to observe had we been able to lower the funds rate substantially in reaction to   weaker signs from the economy  So, to me, this recent experience shows that the asset purchase   policy can be used effectively to substitute for ordinary monetary policy, although, whether the   Committee wishes to use this tool is, of course, dependent on the judgment of the members   I would also say that the asset purchase program has been very successful in getting the   focus off of the federal funds rate and how long it will be at zero and moving the focus on to   balance sheet policy instead  So I think the signaling aspect has been extremely valuable to the   Committee  It is, of course, too early to make a complete assessment of the program  In   particular, most measures of actual core inflation from one year ago remain below 1 percent  I   would like these to move higher before I feel completely comfortable that the downside risk on   inflation has been mitigated effectively, but we will have to see how these measures evolve   during 2011  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B for today  I would   counsel that we wait a meeting before adopting something like paragraph 1 from alternative C    Although I am sympathetic to that, I wouldn’t do it at this meeting  I also think that the   “continued its practice of regularly reviewing” clause is fine  Basically, I think it is too early to   consider deviating from our November decision at this juncture  I would urge the Committee to   take the idea that the program is reviewable and changeable very seriously, and I want to   advocate that adjustments could be made in either direction, depending on the performance of   the economy, and remind everyone that the economy does tend to be uncooperative with our best   forecasts  Adjustments could be very slight  For instance, the pace of purchases could be   slowed while simultaneously moving back the end date of the program, keeping the total amount   of purchases unchanged  This might be viewed as giving the Committee more time to assess the   strength of the economy during 2011, if that was considered desirable   I agree with President Plosser that the March/April time frame will be the appropriate   period to consider any changes to the course of action agreed to in November and, hopefully, to   set, or at least to sketch out, an appropriate policy course for the second half of 2011   I would also stress that monetary policy is an ongoing process, and not a series of one-  time actions  I would implore all of you to stay away from the idea that there is such a thing as   QE3  There is a continuing process of balance sheet policy  Management of the balance sheet   will remain important for some time, and I encourage the Committee to think in terms of active   management, either higher or lower, for the foreseeable future   I think commodity prices bear watching, and I want to comment on President Evans’s   notion of commodity prices  President Evans said, “Maybe they don’t matter, because they do   not seem to enter a regression once the regression has lagged inflation”  My comment is as   January 25–26, 2011 172 of 282              follows  A good inflation-targeting central bank, which I, of course, think that we are, will find   that only the inflation target matters  You keep taking actions to keep inflation close to target,   and then, when you run a regression, you find that it is only lagged inflation that matters, because   the policymaker is taking appropriate action to keep inflation near target  But that seems to me   to be different from saying that you shouldn’t take the signals that the economy is sending you as   a reason to take action   I also now think that the rise in commodity prices in the spring of 2008 badly damaged   the US economy, at least in retrospect, and exacerbated problems that already existed in   financial markets, eventually leading to the collapse of many of the nation’s largest financial   houses  So we have to be very much on guard about this commodity price issue this time   around  I also agree with you, Mr Chairman, that global interactions are a key concern going   forward  I have written on this  I have strong opinions on this, but I am going to spare all of you   my comments on this and save that for another day  Thank you     Let me give an impassioned speech for keeping it in     I feel very strongly that this $600 billion number really hurt us,   because it put us in the same category as a lot of others’ policy actions, and it got us away from   the idea that this is ordinary monetary policy  And I think the pace of purchases gets closer to   saying it’s ordinary monetary policy   I’m a little miffed that we’re not at $75 billion  It’s up to the Desk to keep us at $75   billion—I know there are technical factors involved  I would very much like to keep it in  And I   January 25–26, 2011 194 of 282              saw the fact that we had the pace of purchases and the total amount as a compromise, and now   we’d be pulling back from that, in my view     Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thanks to the subcommittee for doing   all of the fine work on this  I have to agree with President Hoenig  My experience being around   the Fed was that I thought we were already doing most of this, and I thought there was a code    So maybe it’s a matter of reviewing that code   I’m going to make some general comments that may go in a different direction  My view   is that our discussions of communication tend to be very negative and very risk averse—in fact, I   would say they exhibit extreme forms of risk aversion  There is too much worry that something   might be said to someone that might be inappropriate—and certainly we need to worry about   January 25–26, 2011 203 of 282              that—but that should not be the primary concern of our communication policy  Our   communication policy should be a positive statement of what we are trying to accomplish with   communications, and we should think in terms of broad strategic communication policy from   this Committee  Ideally, I would go so far as to adopt metrics about whether or not we are   accomplishing our goals through our communication policy  I think the general judgment over   the last three years is probably that we are not accomplishing what we want to accomplish as a   Committee   My feeling is that our existing strategy has too often allowed others to define the Fed and   to define this Committee, and we need to have strategies and ideas about how to get our ideas out   there  To put everything in a narrow framework about whether somebody will make a misstep at   some point is not helping that  I think that, because we have this view, and it is a longstanding   view around the Fed, it has allowed public relations problems and misinformation to fester, and I   am very worried that this might do lasting damage to the institution   I do not think that rules can be written that encompass every situation in which we might   find ourselves, and I also think that anyone we talk to, in principle, could profit from anything   that we say  So I don’t think you can have a prescriptive thing that maps out every single   situation  I don’t think that’s a good way to go   One general policy would be to convey the same messages in all forums and never reveal   confidential information about what is going on in the Committee itself  I think pretty much   everybody adheres to that  In general, I think that active engagement with all audiences should   be encouraged  That should be something that we are trying to do and trying to get done  By   “all audiences,” I mean financial markets, business leaders, the general public, and, in fact, I   would greatly expand our contacts  I would try to think about whether we’re doing enough and   January 25–26, 2011 204 of 282              whether we’re communicating with certain audiences  Obviously, we’re missing certain groups   of people, and they’re going off and developing their own ideas about what we’re about and   what we’re doing  To put limits on that is going to impair our ability to get messages across and   may damage the institution   So I would prefer a positive statement that emphasizes engagement with all audiences    We certainly do not want people to profit from what we’re doing, but, in some sense, any time   you utter a word, I suppose somebody can trade on it  I would, however, dispute the claim that   you can trade successfully on very much of what anybody says around here—I certainly think   not, but maybe people think that they can  We’re giving our own views about where we think   policy should go, but each of us is just one voice on a big Committee  Certainly, the Chairman is   different  The Chairman has a huge megaphone, but the Chairman’s interactions are more   prescribed, probably, than are those of the rest of us   Also, many of us talk to a variety of councils that come into the Banks  Are we going to   say that that guy on the council might turn around and profit?  I think this is just a very difficult   thing  So you have to follow this code where you say, “I’m giving you my own positions”  I say   the same things all the time  I have the same messages all the time  And I’m happy to try to   communicate those messages  But I don’t think that you can prescribe that such-and-such   situation is out of bounds     Well, like everything else, I think it’s a judgment that has to be made   January 25–26, 2011 205 of 282                It’s possible that the audience is so large—I did one that was   400 people, and it was basically the whole financial community in the town     In that case, you could insist that members of the public be allowed    Or, if media are there, then your comments are going to get reported anyway  Also, we put our   speeches and the Q&A on the web after the event  So, given that, are you imparting special   information to a select group?  I don’t really think so  Are you giving the same messages you   always give?  Do you want to communicate with this group?  Yes, you probably want to get   certain messages across to this group     Okay, but we do something much worse than that—we meet with   Goldman Sachs in private right now     I think we do     I had one comment on Vice Chairman Dudley’s remarks  I thought   that the most out of bounds thing that you could do is to talk to a board of directors, especially of   a financial institution  I was taught in the Fed that that was the most out of bounds  And you, in   contrast, have the idea that, if that same bank has its clients in with a big group, that’s what’s out   of bounds  I think that difference shows how murky this is  When you talk to the bank directors,   January 25–26, 2011 221 of 282              you’re going right into the bank, and that could be perceived as giving inside information   directly to the financial institution     That’s different     To talk on supervisory matters  "
8975,2011-03-15,"  If it gets reported here, is it not FOMC material?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just want to follow up on the tapering   issue  I was a little surprised that it has become the default that we would end abruptly, and I   thought that, as you described, the end of the MBS purchase program was successfully tapered    There was a lot of market talk at the time that if the Committee didn’t continue MBS purchases,   mortgage rates would go up sharply  That was effectively mitigated by our tapering program,   March 15, 2011 12 of 165              and not too much happened when we pulled out of that market  I thought that the default would   be that we would do something similar  I understand the arguments that you just made, but why   not do something similar, because otherwise you are exposed to adverse events that would occur   in the first two weeks of July, and then would be blamed on the Committee, and then the   Committee would be under pressure to reinstitute purchases in order to get those yields to move   in the way that markets thought they should move  So I thought that that tapering would be the   default, but it seems like it has gone the other way     I just have a couple of questions, Mr Chairman  We often say with   the Michigan survey that it is very sensitive to gas prices  So what is the correlation between   gasoline prices and the movements in those expectations?  Do we know?     Yes  I’ve said this myself many times, so I’m very familiar with it    But does it matter?  One of the things that we often say about movements in key prices is that it   might feed through to expectations and more general price increases, and this is the danger, and   this is what we’re worried about  Should we be dismissing that, or should we be taking that on   board as an important indicator?     Okay  My other question is  Is slack large in Europe, and is that   going to temper inflation developments in Europe?     I just wanted to ask a follow-up question  Is regional variability in   unemployment in Europe different than it is in the United States?  There is regional variability in   the United States, with significant differences     Maybe not at the state level, but probably at the county level—very   high unemployment     And Liechtenstein   March 15, 2011 26 of 165                I’m not sure what the numbers are      I just have one more question, Mr Chairman  In your discussion,   Nathan, you talked about weather disturbances and food prices  Do we have independent   evidence that global weather patterns have been particularly different from other years, other   than looking at just prices of food products and so on?     I thought that there are a lot of data on this, and we could actually   check that independently instead of just relying on the stories that are told in financial markets     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy continues to   expand at a moderate pace  District business contacts remain optimistic for 2011, but possibly   slightly less so than at the time of the last FOMC meeting  District employment growth was not   as strong as the nation as a whole during the October to December time frame, but District   unemployment for 16 metropolitan statistical areas has been running somewhat below the   national unemployment rate  Foreclosure rates are rising in the District, but remain well below   national levels  Some businesses are clearly planning on hiring new workers in significant   numbers during 2011  This is especially so for large businesses with sizable cash holdings    These businesses have been profitable and are looking for ways to introduce new products and   expand market share   Commodity price movements are a clear cause for concern in the District  I, as others   here, received an earful about that during the intermeeting period  Industrial businesses and   agricultural firms worry about input costs and profitability  Retailers worry about pullback by   households  One convenience store retailer reported that gasoline volume growth had slowed but   had not yet turned negative despite the sharp rise in prices in the last few weeks   The combination of an improved outlook for 2011 along with rising input costs has many   business leaders uneasy about price increases  Some intend and expect to push through price   March 15, 2011 56 of 165              increases in their own product lines this year or very soon  Many think a bout of inflation may   be brewing   In the national context, the US economy continues to have reasonably good prospects   for 2011  I continue to expect above-trend growth for the year, along with an attendant   improvement in labor markets  As always, there are risks  developments in North Africa and the   Middle East are one; the European sovereign debt crisis remains as another; possibly the   recovery from natural disaster in Japan, as news comes in on that; and certainly, the US fiscal   situation as well  In each case more negative developments would have to transpire before   material threats to the US economy would be realized  In particular, in my view, oil prices   would have to go higher persistently before they’d really threaten the US recovery, or   Europeans would have to fail to reach agreement on the sovereign debt situation  Again, I was   encouraged by the developments last Friday on that dimension   On oil prices, I would stress that this is not a “Hamilton” oil shock, at least not yet  Jim   Hamilton is well known for being the guru of oil price shocks  He has a special way that he   wants to measure that variable  The current rise in oil prices is nothing like what you’d need on   that metric  Of course, you could say, “I don’t like his variable,” but he constructed that variable   in order to get empirical significance and to tell the story that you’d like to tell about oil price   movements and the effects on the US economy  I think everything that’s going on with oil   depends on what happens going forward, and it is not as large as other oil price movements, at   least not yet   In the absence of further developments, the outlook remains decidedly improved from   last autumn, and that’s why I think we should be contemplating, but only contemplating, the long   journey back to a more normal monetary policy this summer and fall  In my view, quantitative   March 15, 2011 57 of 165              easing has been quite successful in that it convinced markets that this Committee is unwilling to   allow the United States to slide into the zero-nominal-interest-rate, mildly deflationary   equilibrium that was potentially on the horizon last summer and that Japan has experienced over   the last 15 years   Since we embarked on QE2, many measures of inflation have bottomed out and turned   higher, and market-based measures of expected inflation have definitely turned up  The five-  year TIPS expected inflation rate was 120 basis points and falling during the summer  It has   recently been as high as 230 basis points  Indeed, according to the recent TIPS market, this   Committee is set to miss its implicit inflation target of 2 percent or so on the high side at any   horizon  2 years; 5 years; 10 years; or 5-year, 5-year forwards  I take this as a measure of   success at this juncture, but I would not want to overstay our welcome and allow these   expectations to go higher  Let me stress, then, that I do not regard the TIPS expected inflation   measures as unacceptably high at this point  But they have been rising and will probably   continue to rise this year if the economy performs as well as we forecast it will and if there are   no further downside shocks that materialize in the meantime  Of course, all bets would be off if   that occurs   The following combination gives me pause  one, a relatively strong outlook for the US   economic growth; two, rising inflation expectations beyond our implicit inflation target; and   three, an ultra-easy monetary policy that will take a long time to normalize  This combination   could potentially lead us to be behind the curve if we’re not very careful going forward    Two recent developments also give me pause  One is that the ECB looks set to tighten   this spring  This took me by surprise  Euro-area harmonized unemployment is 99 percent, a full   percentage point higher than what we have  Now, to be clear, the low on that measure over the   March 15, 2011 58 of 165              last 10 years was 72 percent, and over the last 18 years or so, it’s almost always been above   8 percent  Still, it seems like there’s a lot of slack in Europe  Also, the HICP, the Harmonized   Index of Consumer Prices, the ECB’s preferred price measure, is just slightly above 2 percent   year on year  With inflation more or less at target and quite a bit of slack in the economy, it did   take me by surprise that they’re planning on tightening  But my reading is that the ECB is   saying that it is taking a step toward normalizing policy with the understanding that policy will   still be very accommodative even after it takes a move in that direction   The other recent development is associated with the Middle East turmoil and the dollar    We did not see the flight-to-safety effect as strongly as I would have expected coming from the   Middle East turmoil  So this is the dog that didn’t bark  I wouldn’t make too much of it at this   point, although I thought it was a little suggestive that the United States has used up some   credibility on inflation   These two developments suggest to me that we should be prepared to signal markets   through concrete action that we are willing to begin the process of removing policy   accommodation  I wouldn’t do it now, but in the meetings ahead  Even if we begin to remove   accommodation policy, it will remain ultra-easy  As I’ve said many times before, I don’t think   the first move should be on rates  I regard that as unnecessary given our balance sheet policy    Instead, I think we should take steps to shrink the balance sheet first  One way to do that would   be to pull up a little bit short with QE2—not at this meeting, but at the next meeting   Let me make a very brief comment on President Evans’s fine memo  I thought it was   very nicely done, and I really appreciate the work  I think it helps make the debates here more   transparent  I thought it was exceptionally clear  It helped me think about the issue of the   appropriate policy response to an increase in commodity policies  As it says in the memo, I still   March 15, 2011 59 of 165              think we need a more structural framework to get to the bottom of this issue, and I will try to   provide a few comments on this through the SDS comment process going forward here   Let me make one further comment, and I will be done  It’s on core versus headline  A   lot of the discussion here, I think, makes core be an end in itself  I think that that is problematic   for the Committee  We only care about the prices that households actually have to pay at the end   of the day  So core can only be a vehicle to an end, it can’t be an end in itself  Let me stress that   since the year 2000, core and headline price indexes have actually diverged  Headline inflation   since 2000 has been about 25 percent  This is either PCE or CPI  Core inflation, since the year   2000, has been about 215 percent  It’s 25 percent versus 215 percent, a 3½ percent difference   in the levels of those indexes over that 11-year period  Too much focus on core is telling the   median household that they are richer than they are by 3½ percent  The households   unfortunately are not fooled  They have to pay those prices, and they know that they’re not   3½ percent richer than we’re saying that they are  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief  I generally support   alternative B for today, with an eye toward a version of alternative C at a future meeting  I   would not change the extended period language as it is changed in alternative C any time soon  I   think as soon as we do that, it will signal imminent rate hikes  So I think we want to be very   careful about that  I counsel patience for today because I’d like to gather more information on   developments in the Middle East and North Africa, and I would like to get past the late March   period, which is supposed to produce a deal in Europe  So I’d like to get more information on   both of those situations  Hopefully, those situations will not develop into full-fledged global   macroeconomic shocks, and we’ll be able to assess the situation at our next meeting   I have a few comments on alternative B  In paragraph 2, the phrase “limited pass-  through to underlying inflation” makes it seem as though core inflation is a goal in itself    However, President Kocherlakota has conveniently eliminated my concerns here  So I fully   support what he has suggested  He gets exactly to the ideas that I wanted to get through, which   are that what we want to convey is that we think this is temporary, and we’re going to watch the   situation closely, which I think is what the change does   I would like the pace of $80 billion, which is down in paragraph 3, to be included in the   statement  I think that could be done here with little fanfare  That would give us a dimension on   which we can adjust going forward  So I’d like that in there  Please insert sufficient passion   with that part of my speech  [Laughter]   March 15, 2011 106 of 165              On tapering, my colleagues are wrong on this  You should be tapering  So I’ll be the   excessively fussy guy  I think it’s just prudent policy to engineer a smooth transition  I see little   merit in an abrupt stop  Either nothing will happen, which is what you are all saying, or rates   will jump up in that window and we’ll get blamed for it  So I don’t see any reason to do that  It   should be easy to taper, and why not do it?  It will take that risk off the table   I do appreciate the sudden conversion of the Committee to rational expectations   macroeconomics, but it’s not the right policy at this juncture     Well, if we’re going to say it’s $80 billion now, we can adjust it if   we’re going to taper, I think     I think it’s a great idea, and I think we’re catching up with other   central banks on this dimension  So I think that’s very good  I’m not sure I have strong views   about the blackout  I think we behave strangely after the meeting because most organizations,   once they have something to say, they would send everybody out to go say it, and we don’t do   that  We let others spin ours  We let financial markets spin what we have to say, and I don’t   think that that’s a great thing to do  This press conference will help mitigate that  Also, just   from scheduling, I like the Friday because a lot of times that’s where the conflict is  But other   than that, it won’t make any difference to me  "
8998,2011-04-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am looking at figure 24, “Expected   Spread between IOER Rate and Federal Funds Rate”  If I’m reading this correctly, IOER goes   up and the spread gets larger  Why is that?  I would think the arbitrage would be the arbitrage,   given the fees that are in the market  So why does the spread go up?     Okay  That makes sense, but then the zero bound is still a factor, I   guess, between, say, 1 and 2 percent on the IOER?     Okay  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will try to be provocative  I am   moderately worried about the Committee’s approach to exit strategy so far  Let me give you one   of the main ideas I’m going to expound on here and then I will go into the rest of my remarks   I am concerned about the moment in the exit strategy when we plan to potentially drain   very substantial amounts of reserves and simultaneously raise rates  This part seems risky to me   because two types of accommodation are being removed at the same time, and, combined with   negative economic developments, that could send the economy back into recession right at that   juncture  I see that as a possible policy mistake  I’m going to call that the 1937 scenario, and   my comments are directed toward getting something a little more continuous, prudent, and   potentially reversible as the baseline exit strategy   April 26–27, 2011 29 of 244              Accordingly, I’m going to recommend a version of option 2 from the English–Nelson–  Sack memo  I’ll give you a defense of the LIFO policy, the last in–first out policy, in my   remarks here  I would probably put less emphasis on quickly normalizing the balance sheet than   the memo does  The speed, in my view, should be dictated by economic events, not an artificial   desire to get back to normal  I have one background remark before I give you my defense of the   LIFO policy, and that is that I think QE2 was quite successful by conventional metrics on   monetary policy easing  I think any reading of financial market developments since last fall   would tell you that real interest rates on safe assets declined, expected inflation increased   according to TIPS markets, the dollar depreciated fairly substantially, and equity markets rallied   fairly substantially  That’s about as classic as you can get in this business for what is supposed   to happen around the time of monetary policy easing  I think QE2 was quite successful in that   sense, and it is very apparent if you listen to financial markets  I think it helped us considerably   in avoiding a scenario like the one observed in Japan over the last 15 years, and now we are   somewhat beyond that point   Now, you might ask, “Why was it successful?  How did it work?”  I think probably the   best explanation of that is that the large balance sheet is a way for the Committee to threaten   higher inflation with some probability  With policy rates near zero, higher expected inflation   drives real interest rates lower and has all the effects that I just described  This has the same net   effect as conventional monetary policy—that is, interest rate targeting  Because the policy had   important financial market effects, reversing the policy will undo some of those effects, and I   think that we have to be very cognizant of that  We want to be careful, therefore, in reducing the   size of the balance sheet, and we want to do it in a prudent way   April 26–27, 2011 30 of 244              Let me give you the defense of the LIFO policy  last in, first out  I think this policy has   five important attributes, which I’m going to discuss here in turn  One is simplicity  You’re just   turning around and starting to go back on the same path that got you to this point  I think that’s   very easy for everyone to understand and very easy to communicate, so I like the simplicity of   the policy  I think it has better reversibility properties  It’s easier to pause or even reverse   course if necessary, and I’ll talk about that  The economy doesn’t always cooperate with our   best-laid plans  I think it’s prudent  As I described, the effects of QE have been pretty   substantial  It doesn’t really come through in our models in the way it seemed to in reality, so I   think we should be very careful about removing accommodation along this line  It’s   complementary to the future use of IOER and the federal funds rate  You’re setting up a   situation where you have a lower level of reserves in the system  That’s going to help us going   forward  And finally, it is politically alert  It avoids unnecessary overreliance on the IOER and   the criticism that will naturally flow to the Fed from the overreliance on that mechanism   Let me take each of these in turn  First, simplicity  The last easing action we took was to   build up the balance sheet  The first natural step toward removing accommodation would be to   reverse that  I think that’s very easy to explain and easy to understand in the context of the most   recent FOMC policy actions  When we think about previous tightening cycles, of course, we   didn’t have this balance sheet policy out there, but now that we do, I think this is the most natural   way to proceed  Other sequencing, in my view, is arguably far more complicated and more   convoluted to try to explain, for example, why you are going to do step 1 versus step 4  I think   allowing balance sheet runoff is an example of this simplicity  It is a very easy thing to do; it   reverses a policy change that we made in August  However, I do have one complaint about that   aspect, which is that the autopilot route is not optimal under almost any analysis I’m aware of    April 26–27, 2011 31 of 244              It’s a bureaucratic response  I can imagine that we might do it to get to a compromise policy on   the Committee, but I do not think we should use that as an excuse for not following what would   be the optimal strategy   The second attribute that I said was useful is this reversibility aspect  Unfortunately, the   economy does not always cooperate with our best-laid plans, and I think this normalization   process, if we can get started on it, will take a long time because we’ve got an ultra-easy policy    It’s going to take quite a while  There are going to be moments during that process when   negative shocks hit the economy, and we are going to have to be ready and able to adjust in that   circumstance  So the process of reducing the balance sheet through asset sales can proceed at a   faster or slower pace as needed  You can go on pause or even increase the balance sheet—you   have some flexibility there—and it’s reversible if necessary  Again, I think the reason why this   policy worked is that it is a way to threaten higher inflation, get higher inflation expectations,   and lower real rates in a zero nominal interest rate environment  Draining the reserves all at one   time takes that threat away all at once, plus you would increase interest rates  So that would be   one view of option 1, and at that point, that sounds a little discontinuous to me and possibly a   policy mistake à la 1937  Instead, I would gradually remove the threat of higher inflation by   gradually reducing the balance sheet at a pace dictated by events, and then at some point,   probably when reserve levels are lower, we will still have to drain the remaining reserves and   raise the IOER and the federal funds rate  But we can do that when reserve levels are lower and   not when they are at really high levels, as they are today   The third aspect, I think, is that it’s a prudent policy  Again, our baseline models,   Tealbook and otherwise, are not well equipped to analyze the current situation  We have little   experience here and little historical data on which to base that analysis  We do the best we can,   April 26–27, 2011 32 of 244              but I do not think we should rely too heavily on these models to make policy decisions at this   juncture  Again, QE2 had substantial effects—take some of that back slowly, keeping inflation   and expected inflation close to target   The fourth attribute is that it is a complementary policy to eventually raising interest   rates  Every step along the path of reducing reserves at a pace that respects developments in the   economy brings us closer to the normalization of monetary policy that we eventually want to get   to   Finally, the LIFO policy is politically alert  LIFO avoids the unnecessary overreliance on   the interest rate on excess reserves  I think a policy of very large reserve balances at large banks,   combined with higher IOER, will unfortunately be viewed very negatively across the political   spectrum  It is an explosive issue for this Committee  more money to the banks  You’re forcing   them to hold reserves, then you’re paying them more on it   Obviously, I don’t care what people think very much  If it was an optimal policy, then   we can and should defend it and we should just say that’s the optimal policy  But I think it’s not   the optimal policy, and it’s unnecessary to exit in that particular way  And, therefore, that policy   will be difficult to defend  People will be able to say—legitimately, I think—“There are other   ways to do this  You didn’t have to do it this way”  So, I think it is better to at least begin to   reduce reserves via asset sales before we get to the point where we have to pay substantial   interest on whatever reserves are remaining  This LIFO idea is simple, reversible if needed,   prudent, complementary to the eventual raising of the federal funds rate, and politically alert   I’m looking forward to the discussion today  I think it will be important, a great   discussion  We probably cannot solve everything at a meeting like this, and in any case, no   April 26–27, 2011 33 of 244              matter what we decide or think we decide, we will probably have to remain flexible down the   line   Let me come to the questions that were asked by the Chairman that will be easy to   answer here  As a first step, should we stop the reinvestment policy?  I would say to that, okay,   but again, autopilot is not optimal   Should we actively manage the balance sheet?  I have been a proponent of that for a long   time, so the answer there is yes   Should we sell assets before raising the federal funds rate?  I think the answer to that is   yes  That’s been the gist of my comments here, and again, I would let economic conditions   dictate the pace of sales   And on four, which is a set of true–false–uncertain statements  Should we shrink the   SOMA to the size necessary to implement monetary policy on a lower reserve base?  I think, yes,   we should do that  I think that is what normalization of monetary policy means for the United   States, and that’s how people will understand it  I think it facilitates an eventual transition to a   corridor system; at least my understanding of where many members of the Committee are is that   we eventually want to be in a corridor system   Do we want an all-Treasuries portfolio?  I say yes to that  And should we adjust sales in   response to economic events?  I would say yes to that, too   So that’s my insertion of a speech defending the asset-sales-first policy  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     On the capital losses issue, I think we have repeatedly and effectively   said that we don’t make policy here based on capital gains or losses  So I think we have been   pretty effective on that, and we can defend that part   On the speed issue, I think, again, you have this large balance sheet because this is a way   to threaten higher inflation in an environment in which you have zero policy rates, and you can   reduce it at a pace that keeps inflation and inflation expectations close to target  So it seems as if   that could be dictated by events  If you can go faster, you can go faster  I appreciate that there   might also be considerations about absorption  And, again, even if you aggressively followed   my kind of policy, I think you would get to some point where you said, “Okay  We’re going to   have to drain the remaining reserves and start to move the funds rate up because it’s just not   enough”     Yes     Well, it would be a version of option 2, so I’d wait as long as I could, I   suppose     I’d definitely keep an eye on inflation and inflation expectations  It is   possible you could start reducing the balance sheet and you’re really not getting enough bang for   your buck out of that, and then you might say, “Okay, we’re going to have to drain reserves,”   and bring out the big gun and raise the funds rate     Mr Chairman, could I make a comment on that issue?  Again, I don’t   think our models are a great guide in this kind of environment  So I think what you should do is   experiment with it and then see, in particular, where inflation and inflation expectations go and   that would help dictate the pace     I do think you’re summarizing the disparate views of the Committee   fairly well, but I think this issue about redemptions being a lot different from asset sales is   potentially confusing  In a sense we are starting with the balance sheet if you went by the   sequence, but we’re going to start in a certain way with the balance sheet     And it’s just that the Committee seems to be reluctant to go as far as I   would in wanting to adjust that     Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy continues to   expand at a moderate pace  Businesses associated with agriculture, in particular, seem to be   doing quite well  This may be affected by recent wet weather in the District, but we’ll have to   see on that  Land sales, as I have reported before, seem to suggest pretty rich valuations    Commodity price increases are a key concern, as they are all around the table here  Gas prices   are nearing levels which might importantly influence household behavior but don’t seem to have   done so quite yet  I agree with Presidents Fisher and Lacker that many CEOs view higher   commodity prices as forcing price increases for other goods, and in particular, for their own   goods  That seems to be a very prevalent view and much on the minds of business leaders   Reports on housing and commercial real estate in the District were mixed  Foreclosure   rates in the District remain lower than for the nation as a whole by a substantial margin    Anecdotal reports in the District seem to indicate moderate improvement in labor markets—more   ideas about hiring from more firms  Banks continue to report relatively weak loan demand, and I   think we should all keep in mind, there’s an awful lot of banks out there that are in pretty weak   condition still, and we’ve got a long way to go on that dimension   Transportation businesses in the Eighth District seem to indicate moderate to strong   growth ahead  They are worried about energy prices possibly increasing further from here, but   they seem to be okay for now  Most of these firms make surcharges to cover energy price   changes  They do worry about that cutting into demand eventually, but for now, things seem   April 26–27, 2011 136 of 244              pretty robust  There is some shifting that is occurring in the industry to lower-cost, slower   transportation and away from the higher-priced products and the faster products  Technology   businesses also report robust activity—in fact, incredibly robust activity  There is something of a   boom in certain technology labor markets  Competition for talent is fierce  The comment I got   from a major technology firm was, “It’s like 1998 when it comes to hunting for talent in this   area”   Nationally, it appears that the first quarter will be weaker than was once expected, and   weaker than I expected late last year and early this year  But I agree with the Tealbook   assessment that the second quarter and the second half of this year is likely to be stronger than   the first quarter  Part of that is based on somewhat stronger labor market performance over the   last six months than expected  I also agree with President Lockhart that anecdotal evidence that I   have heard seems to be at odds with the pretty soft Q1 numbers  To me, that suggests that there   are special factors driving the first-quarter number  We will see what it is; we haven’t actually   seen the first-quarter number yet   We obviously face substantial risks in the economy, and the ones I am going to list here   are the same ones cited by President Williams  I do worry about all of them  First and foremost   is oil prices and continuing turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa  My main comment on   that is that it does not appear to be a so-called Hamilton shock so far  Jim Hamilton is a leading   researcher on this topic  For him, the price would have to go quite a bit above the moving   average of the price over the past three years, so that would be actually a very large number on   West Texas Intermediate  I’m not sure quite what to think about that, but I do think that   households are maybe a bit better equipped to handle high energy prices than they were in 2008   when it really was a shock  One of the things that happened in 2008 was that we went through   April 26–27, 2011 137 of 244              $100 a barrel oil for the first time in March 2008, and then it went up almost 50 percent from   there in the next three months  People started to wonder, is the world coming unhinged?  And I   think that really changed household behavior  I’m not quite sure what we’ll get this time around,   but obviously it bears very close watching   On Japan, I just don’t see the situation getting worse from here  I see it slowly getting   better  There are anecdotal reports in the Eighth District about plant shutdown or slowdown, so   that is affecting manufacturing, as we heard in the staff reports  That is important, but I see those   as temporary factors  It may be a little bit more persistent than I would have thought over the   past couple of weeks   On Europe, I was in Europe  I do see renewed tension there  I do see some potential for   continuing problems  I got two views in Europe  The private-sector view seems to see bad math   for Portugal, Greece, and Ireland  They see trouble ahead  I saw a public-sector view that sees   delay as a strategy  I didn’t think this is a good mix  The private sector seems to smell blood in   the water, and I’m a little worried that this is going to get away from the Europeans  They have   been very good about addressing problems  Hopefully, they’ll come through again this time, but   I am a little worried about that situation  The problems there are not really resolved  It continues   to be a risk from our perspective   The US fiscal situation—your guess is as good as mine  Outcomes remain unclear  It is   still a wild card, in my view  Despite these risks, though, the best bet is, all of these will be   resolved in a reasonable way and that the outlook for the US economy is still reasonably good   for 2011   I’m going to turn now to remarks on core versus headline inflation, because this is a key   topic for us, and I have several remarks  First of all, in my view, control of headline inflation   April 26–27, 2011 138 of 244              over the medium term is the policy goal  These are the prices that people actually pay, and so   this is the index that we have to work with  Core is not the policy goal, though I think it   sometimes seems to be, because we refer to core so often and use it so much in our analysis  It’s   true that headline inflation is generally more volatile, but so what?  That is the policy problem   that we face, and that’s our job  It is not really our job to make our policy problem simpler than   it really is There are stories that take the view that if we adjusted policy in reaction to the   volatile consumer price index, or PCE inflation index, we would get an unstable feedback loop   and cause havoc in the economy  Stories about unstable feedback are unproven, in my view    There’s very little research on this  And, anyway, you’d have to adjust your policy rule so that   you adjust in an appropriate way given the volatility of the inflation rate that you are looking at   One reason to look at core, obviously, is as an indicator of future headline inflation  I am   not convinced by this argument, and I have five remarks on it  The statement that core predicts   future headline is usually associated with univariate forecast models  That is, inflation as a   function of past inflation alone, appropriately measured, without other variables  This is not how   we normally forecast inflation as a Committee; we include other variables such as inflation   expectations and slack variables, as was just being discussed  One example would be Stock and   Watson at the Jackson Hole conference last year, but there are many other examples   A second remark is, in my view, core has little theory behind it  It comes to us from the   1970s where we just threw out certain prices because they were inconvenient to look at  It has a   long and venerable tradition around the table, but it doesn’t have much to commend it from any   statistical perspective or any theoretical perspective   One might think that what we’re doing is throwing out the components of inflation that   have the highest signal-to-noise ratio for the various components  If you look at simple measures   April 26–27, 2011 139 of 244              of the signal-to-noise ratio, energy indeed has the lowest signal-to-noise ratio, so it would make   sense, if you want to pick one off, to throw out energy  Food is actually not the second-lowest   signal-to-noise ratio in the inflation index, and in fact food actually has a relatively high signal-  to-noise ratio  So the food part doesn’t make very much sense  Results like this, and all the   things I am going to talk about, are also very dependent on the sample considered; that is always   a problem when we are looking at issues like this   You may not care about theory as much as I do, so let’s just think about empirics alone    But the empirics are also weak  In the paper by Julie Smith, which is sometimes cited on this   topic—forecasting future headline inflation with some measure of core inflation, including a   traditional core inflation measure—the traditional core inflation measure actually has the highest   root mean square error in predicting future headline inflation  So other types of core measures   do better in that particular paper  Results, again, are sensitive to the sample period for all   measures  And as is typical of empirical work in this area, it’s going to be very sensitive to what   time period you are going to look at  It is hard to get really clean results that warrant the kind of   emphasis that we put on it around the table here   Now, a very legitimate issue for the Committee is  What subset of prices, if any, could   be the central bank target?  If you don’t want to target the overall measure of inflation, there may   be reasonable ways to think about some subset of prices that are the prices that you want to   emphasize and that you want to target and talk about  There is a literature on this question, and   that literature does have the potential to rationalize a focus on a subset of prices instead of the   overall price index  But so far, this literature seems to have very little influence at the FOMC,   and this may be because the typical recommendations that come out of the literature are almost   nothing like what we typically talk about here at the table   April 26–27, 2011 140 of 244              One result from the literature is that you should focus on the sticky-price sector; that   comes from Woodford and his coauthors  You would arrange the prices by the ones that are the   most sticky, you would create an index of that, and then you would target that  That would be an   argument for looking at some subset of prices instead of the overall prices  We don’t do   anything like that as far as I know  Another result, if you look at it in an international context   with sticky prices, comes from Clarida, Galí and Gertler who have a multicountry model  In that   model you would focus on the domestic sticky prices and forget about the import prices  We   don’t seem to do anything like that   Even though these are not popular conclusions—and maybe they shouldn’t be, maybe   they are not established enough in the literature—it may be fruitful to think more carefully about   why we might wish to focus on a subset of prices, or, otherwise, just abandon that, and say we   are going to focus on the overall price index  Then we could better rationalize what we do than   what we do now   Now, if you don’t care anything about that, then let’s just talk about practical concerns on   core versus headline  Obviously, it is a problem for us to refer to core measures because people   say that they have to pay the other prices  That always happens when commodity prices are   rising in the US economy  So I think we should certainly deemphasize core inflation as an   ultimate goal, and, indeed, some of our rhetoric has moved away from talking so much about   core inflation to talk about headline inflation as the medium-term policy goal  I would go so far   as to possibly take core PCE inflation out of the FOMC projections  I think it gives it too high of   a status  And, as I’m arguing here, it doesn’t have enough credibility to warrant that status   Temporary headline inflation movements can just simply be called “temporary”  We can   just say, yes, inflation is high right now, but we don’t think it’s going to continue to be high, and   April 26–27, 2011 141 of 244              that’s the way it is  We don’t have to refer to core to make that argument  And we can do other   things to smooth out data measurements  We can look at inflation movements from one year   ago, for instance, as a way to smooth out movements in inflation as opposed to excluding certain   categories of prices   One final practical consideration on commodity prices  We often say that the increases in   commodity prices are due to global demand, evidently outstripping global supply  I have made   this argument many times myself, and presumably China and India are key drivers in this   argument—that is, they are key drivers of the global demand in commodities markets  But then   we turn around and we say that we think the situation is temporary, but the situation with China   and India is not a temporary situation  This is going to go on for decades  I think that citing the   global factors that you know are going to continue for decades gets us in a bit of a trap when we   turn around later and say, “I think these are going to be temporary factors”  Even though I’ve   done it myself, I’m not sure that that is always the best argument   The bottom line is that I think core versus headline inflation is a long-standing issue for   the FOMC  It’s certainly a hot topic right now, and I’m sure it will continue to be in the future    Maybe now is the time to deemphasize core inflation  If you want a less volatile measure, use   one that is perhaps more defensible, something that we can point to and say that we’ve got a   better rationale for it, other than that it has been used for decades here  I think that might be   helpful to the Committee going forward  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Committee decision on asset   purchases obviously was made at the November meeting  We said that that decision is subject to   review, depending on developments in the economy  Today, the economic outlook is generally   better than what was expected at the time of the November decision  In addition, the inflation   outlook is somewhat less benign than it was at the time of the November decision  First-quarter   GDP will probably come in weaker than what was expected earlier this year, but, as the   April 26–27, 2011 187 of 244              economic go-round yesterday indicated, many believe that the outlook for the remainder of 2011   remains relatively robust  Also, many comments suggested that the Q1 GDP weakness seems   inconsistent with other measures of the strength of the economy  So, the November decision was   considered reviewable  We’ve got a stronger economy than we had thought at the time, and   we’ve got a little bit higher inflation and inflation expectations than we thought at the time  This   suggests to me making a small move to adjust the policy, and in this respect I would agree with   some of the comments made by President Kocherlakota   Now, I know that there are objections around the table to making small moves, and so   I’m going to disabuse you of those objections  [Laughter]  Many of the comments yesterday all   around the table suggest that we set a high bar for this type of policy action—a high bar  I want   to argue that this is the wrong intuition for Committee behavior  It is bureaucratically convenient   but unlikely to be optimal policy   The high-bar argument suggests not taking action unless it is absolutely called for  So   there is a bias toward inaction  This is known in engineering and elsewhere as an Ss policy    You only act when certain limits are met on the high side or the low side  If you behave this   way, this will create a range of inaction; you’ll take no action in the middle, and you will take   one action if you go above the high limit and one action if you go below the low limit  If the   limits are extreme, which they might be for a Committee like this, the range of inaction is   actually quite large  The example would be driving a car and steering and trying to stay in your   lane  When we’re driving our car, we are making small adjustments all the time as we are   steering, but if you had an Ss policy, you might say, “I am only going to adjust the steering when   the car actually goes to the very edge of the lane, and then I will make the adjustment to come   back to the center”  You have a range of inaction  You don’t adjust the steering wheel at all   April 26–27, 2011 188 of 244              until you actually hit the limit, then you come back to the middle  If you drove like that, you   would have a more volatile path down the highway than you do when you are making small   adjustments all the time  In the car example, the cost to action is very small, so you might as   well make adjustments all the time  This keeps you in the middle of the lane, and you throw out   the Ss policy  It wouldn’t be the right thing to do  The Ss policy is not optimal unless there are   some significant fixed costs to action  But for a Committee like this, I think there are no real   costs of this type  We can make small adjustments if we want  Creating this range of inaction   through a de facto Ss policy is less than optimal for this Committee  I also think this creates   confusion in markets, because in many circumstances where the economy has changed we don’t   actually do anything in the range of inaction  This just leaves a big question mark out there in   the private sector  They’re saying, “Well, what are these guys doing?  They’re not doing   anything”  The private sector doesn’t get any signal when we are sitting in the range of inaction    And you might say, “Well, we are always talking”  I don’t think talking matters  What they care   about is whether or not we taking concrete action  The communication can only help explain the   actions that you actually take or plan to take  It can’t be a substitute for actually making the   decision to take concrete action   So with that, I am going to support option B with the caveat of completing $500 billion of   asset purchases instead of the $600 billion  I think that the situation that we are in is that the   FOMC apparently intends to go on hold at the end of June  Going on hold to me would mean   that we keep the near-zero policy rate, we keep the “extended period” language, we keep the size   of the balance sheet held constant, and we create a bit of a presumption, because we’re going on   pause, that the next policy move would be to remove accommodation without really committing   to that and waiting for more information to come in  And all of that seems entirely sensible to   April 26–27, 2011 189 of 244              me  But I think finishing our asset purchases just a bit short of where we said in November   would still be planning to go on hold in June in the same way I just described, but with a slightly   smaller balance sheet  This would help send a signal to markets that we are paying attention to   recent developments  We’d still be going on hold in June, but there would not be quite as much   accommodation through the asset purchase program as what we initially planned  Also, doing it   this way wouldn’t signal the next move, except that the next move is presumably, since you’re   going on pause, to remove accommodation, if the economy continues to perform as expected    Many of you have noted the risks out there, and those could, of course, move against us  I think   that doing something like this might help us  I have no illusions about adopting this, but I think   if we played it this way, this might help the FOMC during the May–June time frame   And on that, I want to make some remarks on Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments   yesterday, which I thought were very helpful in this regard  We do face an environment of rising   inflation expectations  It’s not terrible, but further increases along this dimension would be   unwelcome; we’ve got two months to go before the June meeting  The fiscal stalemate is not   helpful to us and is hurting inflation expectations in this regard  The dollar is weakening pretty   substantially, and I am a little concerned that the dollar, even though there are a lot of crises   around the world, is not really viewed as a very good safe haven in the last few months    Investors are flocking to traditional inflation hedges  A lot of that doesn’t make any sense to me,   but I think it is some investor behavior to pay attention to  You’ve got the ECB tightening with   us not really signaling that we are going to follow anytime soon   All of this is very manageable, but July 1 is a long way away, and I’m a little worried that   things could get a little bit away from us during the intermeeting period, and signaling a little bit   toward less accommodation might be a bit helpful  I think that another problem for us is that   April 26–27, 2011 190 of 244              June will not be a good moment to act, because in June our asset purchases will be wrapped up    The way the discussion is going now—and depending on how the economy performs—we’re   evidently planning to end the program there and go on hold, so that won’t be a good meeting to   take any other action  I think the meeting to do this is now   Let me comment for just a minute on our uber-easy monetary policy  It is very easy in   absolute terms  It’s also appropriately easy, conditional on the state of the economy  I do agree   with this, although Taylor rule calculations can be sensitive to details, as our Tealbook shows,   and as the literature certainly shows   The main idea about describing our policy as very easy is that it is going to take a long   time to normalize policy  You’ve got zero rates, and you’ve got a large balance sheet  Those   things take a long time to normalize  It may be prudent for the Committee to get started at some   point, so that policy adjustment can be more gradual, and we can adjust the pace of removing   accommodation according to events  We can take pauses at some point  Then the Committee   may not have to move as aggressively later  So I think there is something to consider in the fact   that policy is very easy in absolute terms   I just want to caution everybody that these Taylor rules also are calibrated using data   from the Great Moderation time frame which had relatively small shocks to the economy,   certainly a different situation than what we have today  So we may want to supplement those   calculations with some judgment about how the situation has changed versus, say, the 1990s or   the 2000s  I agree with President Plosser on difference rules, which get rid of the gap-type   problem and let you calibrate policy without having to know what the gap measure is  Those   rules are all subject to many technical qualifications, but I think they are important   April 26–27, 2011 191 of 244              Also, I want to stress that the 2004 to 2006 tightening is certainly questionable  Many   view it as having been too slow, too mechanical, and possibly having allowed bubbles which   caused problems  These are some of the points that have been repeatedly stressed here by   President Hoenig and for which I have some sympathy  That kind of bubble argument doesn’t   come into—and the Chairman mentioned this yesterday—the normal Taylor-rule calculation,   because it’s just not part of the model  So we have to pay a lot of attention to that going forward   The bottom line is that there is plenty to mull in this unprecedented situation for   monetary policy, and I just wanted to make a few of these points during my chance for the policy   discussion here  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman?     I just have one question for President Evans on monetizing the debt    Some of the options that we look at actually do talk about just leaving the balance sheet larger   and operating under a different operating system  So if we did that, would you consider that   monetizing the debt, since that would be a permanent increase in the size of the balance sheet?  "
9023,2011-06-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to commend the staff for excellent   work here on the DSGE framework, and, of course, I’m a big champion of this kind of work  I   think DSGE models are very useful for organizing our thinking on important aspects of   macroeconomic behavior  The best and most valuable feature is that everything has to add up in   the model  Equilibrium conditions and budget constraints are respected, expectations are treated   consistently, and businesses and households are viewed as doing the best they can, given the   environment and the prices that they face  In some sense, DSGE is the only game in town, so it’s   really just economic models   The key use is to investigate pet theories  We policymakers often have a few   fundamental driving factors in our minds when thinking about how to interpret macroeconomic   events  One can build a DSGE model with those factors in play, and then see what the   implications would be for key macroeconomic variables  That is very much what is going on   June 21–22, 2011 19 of 282              here in this set of papers  Often, perhaps very often, the proposed explanation for the event will   not match some key facts  I do not regard that as a failure so much as a key piece of information    It is very informative because it suggests where the theory is right and where it needs   improvement, and it helps modify our thinking relative to our priors that are embodied in our pet   theories  So at its best, this process can be extremely valuable in making the types of judgments   that have to be made around this table   One remark that I do have, and I want to get your comment on, is that I do not think   forecasting is necessarily a good metric for models like this  Macroeconomic systems have a   certain amount of ambient noise in them  Because of this noise, there will always be clear limits   to how well we can forecast  We do not really forecast the economy at all  We really track the   economy in an engineering sense  And when we have to predict, we naturally predict that the   variables that are away from their means will simply return to their means  So better forecasting   may not be a reasonable expectation for this class of models, or really for any models, that we   might write down  The goal, instead, is better policy  An alternative policy may deliver   dramatically better outcomes for households, even though the forecastability of the economy has   not improved at all  That is, under policy A, we would obtain one equilibrium outcome, and   under policy B, a different equilibrium outcome, and one of these two possibilities may be   strongly preferred to the other  But the forecastability is the same in both cases due to the   ambient noise, and due to the fact that a good forecast will actually change behavior in the   economy—we are talking about forward-looking businesses and households in the economy—  and that will reduce forecastability  There are going to be limits to how well you are going to be   able to forecast in a macroeconomic system  DSGE models, at their best, can be very useful in   June 21–22, 2011 20 of 282              identifying better policy interventions, even when there is no improvement in forecastability  I   don’t know what you think about that     Mr Chairman, I think if we went to the minimum size of the balance   sheet, then there would be no difference between the two systems  Is that right, or very little   difference?  There’s a point of continuity there     Okay  I’ll also be brief  I’ll agree with President Rosengren and   President Fisher that it’s not so clear why we want to tie this down  At the time that we make   such a decision, we’ll want to assess economic conditions and give an indication that the   Committee currently anticipates a certain timing  That seems to me to be the way the Committee   has operated in the past, and it would make a lot of sense in this circumstance     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not very comfortable with this timing   sequence  As you know, I prefer a more explicit LIFO or last in–first out exit strategy than the   one outlined in this “Exit Strategy Principles” document  The principles do call for a balance   sheet–first strategy in that the first step is to cease or reduce reinvestment  I would follow that   step with asset sales and manage the balance sheet down in a state-contingent manner   My judgment is that the recent asset purchases and the associated buildup of the size of   the balance sheet had a fairly clear effect on expected inflation in the United States  This policy   helped us avoid the mildly deflationary outcome that Japan has experienced over the past decade   or more  Inflation has moved higher and more quickly than would have been predicted without   the asset purchases  I do not think that these purchases were neutral, and I do not expect asset   sales to be neutral  I think it would be a bit more prudent to sell assets first and in relatively   small amounts and then gauge the effects in a state-contingent manner  This would be a balance   sheet tightening as opposed to what we’ve got in the exit principles  We could then change   language and raise rates somewhat later in the process if we did it this way  I think this would   keep expectations in check while rates continue to remain at zero  It would also dovetail with the   June 21–22, 2011 48 of 282              reserve reduction in the System that will help us on the day when we want to actually raise rates    The outlined strategy puts sales essentially on an autopilot basis  As I see it, there’s not very   much that’s optimal about that     That’s a no     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Back to exhibit 2 and these charts   comparing the recessions of ’73, ’81, and ’07  I’ve looked at charts like this myself, and my   comment is that the ’70s was a really volatile period in the US economy, and the economy   behaved very differently after 1984  It’s true that these are the previous two recessions that are   the most severe, but on the other hand, the economy doesn’t seem to have behaved this way for   25 years, so I’m not quite sure that’s the right comparison  What I try to look at instead is the   period coming out of the 2001 recession and the ’90–’91 recession, even though those recessions   weren’t as deep  And there the current recovery looks roughly similar  Although there are some   differences, it does look more similar to those cases  In this recession there was a huge drop-off,   which I would interpret as a bursting of a housing bubble, and then the recovery has been very   similar to the last two  So that gives you a very different perspective on how to think about this   recovery as opposed to looking back to the 1970s  But again, we haven’t really experienced that   for 25 years     I’m just saying, from a recovery perspective, I’d welcome a theory of   why those recoveries look different in the earlier era than they look in the modern era   June 21–22, 2011 91 of 282                Okay  Let me put it a little more strongly  You’re pining for   something that hasn’t happened in a quarter-century     For those of you that are interested, I’ll put out our advertisement  All   of these kinds of charts are plotted on the St Louis website, not just for the United States, but   also for other countries, monthly and quarterly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy is showing   some signs of a slowdown consistent with recent developments in the national economy    However, the June data, where available, do seem to indicate better business conditions going   forward  Transportation companies in particular reported good business in the first weeks of   June  Large firms remain lean and profitable, with plenty of cash  They are looking for   opportunities to expand to take advantage of the continuing boom in Asia  The agricultural   June 21–22, 2011 121 of 282              industry in the District has been slowed by a wet spring, but poor weather has not so far been   enough to hamper the outlook for agribusiness income in 2011  The recent pullback in   commodity prices is likely to be helpful for many District businesses, as it means more   disposable income for households  It appears that the recent experience with $4 per gallon   gasoline did not significantly dent volumes at a major convenience store retail chain   The District experience with consumer behavior and response to gas prices provides a   small piece of evidence that Hamilton is right  Jim Hamilton, from the University of California–  San Diego, has argued over many years that an oil price shock must send the price of oil   significantly higher than recently experienced in order to really alter household behavior in a   large enough way to send the economy into a prolonged downturn  And $4 per gallon gas has   reduced disposable income for other purchases, to be sure, but does not appear to have caused a   wholesale change in household behavior as it did in 2008  Partly because of this, it seems   reasonable to me to look through the recent weakness in US data toward better prospects for the   second half of this year   The US economic outlook has been weighed down during the spring because of four   global events, any one of which could develop into a significant global macroeconomic shock  I   think none of the four will actually become a shock large enough to put the United States into   recession  However, we have worked our way through only two and one-half of these events    The events are Japan, oil price increases due to disruptions in supply coming from the Middle   East, the European sovereign debt crisis, and the US fiscal situation  The effects of the disaster   in Japan, while more significant than I had originally through, are now fading and are projected   to be temporary  Commodity prices are retreating, as we sit here at this meeting  Europe is in   the process of trying to resolve its way through the latest hurdle, but remains worrying as several,   June 21–22, 2011 122 of 282              including Vice Chairman Dudley, have commented already  There are certainly worrying   questions about the willingness of Greece to repay under any conditions  There’s no real longer-  term solution on the table  I think restructuring will eventually be necessary  I think it can be   carried off effectively, but right now it seems quite difficult to do without causing a global crisis   or further crisis in Europe  Despite all this, I think a temporary solution is likely and will push   this off to some future date  On the US fiscal situation, I think a deal is possible and likely, but   that event lies a little bit ahead of where we sit today  All in all, I think this assessment augurs   for looking through the current weakness  The slowdown that we have seen so far in the United   States this year does not strike me as being as severe as the one last summer that led to further   easing by this Committee   The prognosis for a second-half resurgence and a resolution of remaining key risks   requires patience on the part of the Committee  We will have to wait and see whether stronger   data materialize or are confirmed before we can evaluate the situation further  That puts the   Committee in a “wait and see” mode for the time being  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I counsel patience at this juncture  I think   alternative B puts the Committee in a good position to wait and see how the data come in over   the summer  My expectation is that key risks will be resolved in the next weeks and months, and   June 21–22, 2011 172 of 282              that we’ll see stronger data in the coming months and quarters  But we are going to have to get   confirmation on that before we can make further decisions  So I think it’s a good point to pause   I just have one other comment  I have been an advocate of state-contingent policy    Today we are ending a QE2 program in the midst of a weakening outlook; that puts the   Committee and the Chairman in a difficult position  It would be nice to end a program like this   when the data say so and not when the calendar says so  That’s the key advantage of a state-  contingent approach, and I hope we will adopt more of that going forward  But I think this   situation nicely illustrates the dangers of putting calendar dates on things  If the economy   doesn’t cooperate with you, it puts you in a bit of an awkward position  Not that we can’t handle   it, and not that we can’t get through it, but it is a bit awkward  If we were in a normal interest   rate targeting environment, that is what we would do  We would make adjustments more on a   meeting-by-meeting basis in response to events in the economy and not on a calendar basis    Thank you, Mr Chairman     I also appreciate the work of the subcommittee on what I think is a   very difficult topic  I have some concerns that I’ve discussed previously with Governor Yellen   and President Fisher  I think there are a lot of gray areas here, and I think this cannot really be   helped when you write down a document like this, but it does set up some problems of   interpretation, in my view, especially for our staff  I’m concerned that this document could be   over-interpreted far beyond what is intended by this communications subcommittee, and that this   June 21–22, 2011 204 of 282              could inhibit what we now consider normal staff activities  This type of over-interpretation, just   based on a reading of a vague document, can often happen in a large bureaucracy like the Fed   I’ll give you one example  The New York Fed has recently put out an innovative   approach to communication, the Liberty Street Blog  A very good researcher in the System,   Gauti Eggertsson, put something on the blog based on his research in which he argues that the   current FOMC will not repeat the mistake of 1937 for reasons that he exposits on the blog  I   would consider something like this a very normal staff activity  In fact, I would consider robust   and active debate of this type as an important contribution to high-quality monetary policy  But   when I read the document here, it says, “Staff should refrain from publicly expressing their own   personal views regarding prospective monetary policy decisions,” which could put an end to that   kind of a blog  So a literal reading of the staff portion of the memo might circumscribe Gauti’s   behavior     He thinks we won’t because he thinks we’ll look through commodity   prices and we won’t make that mistake     If this interpretation takes hold, I would view that as a very negative development in the   Federal Reserve System  It would be the opposite of the open debate that I think is most   appropriate and helpful for monetary policy  Unless you think that it can’t happen here, I will   remind you that there was a time in the Federal Reserve System when staff behavior was tightly   circumscribed and people were, in fact, fired inside the System for their views, and it was a   serious situation  That has a chilling effect on the staff  The staff does not want to work on   pressing issues that face this Committee for fear of running afoul of vague rules  They can   June 21–22, 2011 205 of 282              decide to do other activities, work on something else, and not address the key concerns of the   Committee  So my suggestion would be to reconsider the staff portion of this memo  I   appreciate that Governor Yellen has suggested that we ask the research directors to look at it and   see what they think, but I want it to be on the record here that if that’s the direction the   interpretation goes, I would be very much opposed to that   My second concern is that the off-the-record interview is not addressed in this document    To the extent that we have noncollegial behavior on this Committee—and I don’t think that we   really do to a large extent, but to the extent that we do—it comes through the off-the-record   interview  And what are the rules about those interviews?  Do all of these rules apply to those   situations?   My third concern, which is far more minor, is that the idea of a blackout only applies to   speeches or appearances that concern monetary policy or macroeconomic developments  But the   current blackout, the one that we’re in right now, if I count it correctly, had four appearances,   one op-ed, and three appearances by FOMC members  All of them were excellent  They were   not policy related, but I think it’s a very slippery slope to start having lots of presentations,   especially when you have any kind of Q&A or anything during a blackout period  Even if you   say, “I’m not going to talk about policy issues,” it can be, “Okay, I’m not talking directly about   monetary policy, but I’m going to go to a conference on commodity prices, and I’m going to   characterize my views about commodity prices”  And then you say, “Well, that was not a   monetary policy discussion  It was a commodity prices discussion,” but yes, it impinges on what   our views on policy would be  So I think it’s a very slippery slope to get into the business of   doing a lot of presentations and appearances during a blackout in which you’re going to define   what macroeconomics is and what macroeconomics is not  The system could break down if we   June 21–22, 2011 206 of 282              allowed too much of that to go on  But that’s more of a minor concern  I think most of the   things that we do are very reasonable on the blackout  For all of us, it gives us something of a   respite—that is, a reason that you can turn down invitations because you’re going to go on a   blackout  I think it generally works pretty well, but I think that part is a slippery slope   My main concern, then, is the impact of the vague document on the staff and the possible   chilling effect of open discussion within the Federal Reserve System  Second, I do have   concerns about the off-the-record interview because it is not addressed in this document  And   third, the application of the blackout  Thank you     Okay  You write a paper, and the paper says what the Committee   should do is switch to monetary targeting  You’re saying, “I did some research, and my research   says you should switch to monetary targeting”     It’s vague     Okay  I guess I think we all basically have an understanding of what   we have in mind here, and I do think there’s a bit of a risk of over-interpretation in the future,   you could say  And then you’re working as a staff person, and you’re not sure how the rules are   going to come down  All of a sudden somebody is really mad at you because you did something,   and you thought that this was okay  That’s the danger of having a vague set of rules at the top     Indeed they do, and there was a time when all papers in the System   were vetted through channels, and we spent a lot of time reading each other’s’ papers and vetting   them and circling sentences that we thought were referring to the dollar and all kinds of stuff like   that  And we got rid of that because it was unproductive, it was useless, and it didn’t promote   the open discussion that I think we’ve achieved  My only point is that I’d be loath to turn that   June 21–22, 2011 212 of 282              tide back and go in a different direction  And I appreciate what’s being done here  I think there   is understanding around the table  I wanted to have this discussion so that we don’t go in the   wrong direction     I am opposed  "
9053,2011-08-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My remarks are fairly general  I agree   with President Kocherlakota’s memo that a time of government default is a time when price   stability is at acute risk  Any indication that the central bank may be willing to mitigate the   situation through debt monetization could ignite inflation expectations and lead to a catastrophic   outcome  Inflation expectations could be explosive in such a situation, and the crisis could be   made quite a bit worse than it would otherwise be  In effect, the explicit default by the Treasury   and the US government could be exacerbated by the threat of further implicit default through   higher-than-expected inflation  This could send yields to very high levels and create a very   difficult situation, with some similarities to some of the countries in the European periphery   Given this scenario, I think we would have to be extraordinarily cautious in taking any   actions that could be interpreted as debt monetization  The crisis environment would likely be   one where any move by this Committee or the Desk would be scrutinized very closely  The past   several years have shown how powerful the expectations effect can be in a crisis situation  I   August 1, 2011 35 of 53              think options 9 and 10 would probably feed such expectations and, therefore, that the Committee   should probably stay away from these policy actions in the event of a crisis of this type   More generally, I think the tone of the English–Sack memo assumes more orderly market   functioning than might actually occur in a crisis with defaulted US Treasury securities  I could   imagine little or no market for defaulted securities  Even if that might seem like an extreme   market response, the securities might become toxic  We certainly saw examples of this in the   last go-round in 2008 and 2009  The lack of a clear price might make many of the procedures   outlined in the memo somewhat problematic, as most of the discussion assumes that a clear   market price exists   Be that as it may, it now appears that the US Treasury has ultimately decided to   prioritize principal and interest payments even in the event of a binding debt ceiling  This would   presumably eliminate the need to plan for a state of affairs in which defaulted securities are   trading—or not—in the market  However, one caveat to that is that that could change in an   actual crisis situation  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9075,2011-08-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just have a brief question on exhibit 1,   panel 1, which is “Implied Federal Funds Rate Path”  I just want to make sure I understand this    If I’m reading this correctly, the market expects no action until June, certainly summer of 2013    And the other part I want to ask about is, why is this light blue line going down to zero at one   year, whereas it’s above that today?  That seems odd to me     I thought in the past, when we’ve looked at these, we’ve looked at the   modal prediction, not the mean     Okay  Suppose you made a promise, then, to 2013  Would it back up   from what the modal expectation is?  The modal expectation is beyond that   August 9, 2011 13 of 162                Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a question for Mike Leahy about   the international work  Your description suggested that expansion of the European Financial   Stabilization Facility was a key issue  Stories that I’ve heard out of Europe are that that was not   expanded on the grounds that it might incite panic  Perhaps that was unwise, but can the fund be   expanded?  If it is, would that solve the problem or not?  And what should we expect as a   Committee going forward on that issue?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy continues to   grow at a moderate pace  The general tone from business contacts is that business is broadly   satisfactory, but there is also substantial anxiety concerning macroeconomic developments  A   August 9, 2011 54 of 162              few business contacts reported hard data confirming a slower economy during the May/June/July   period, but not consistently, and the overall tone was actually mixed  The Eighth District   unemployment rate, for 16 District metropolitan statistical areas, increased during the spring   from 85 percent to 89 percent  Residential real estate markets continue to look very weak    Market participants were hopeful for 2011, but better results have not materialized  Reports   from around the District seem to confirm that automobile production will return to full strength   sooner than previously anticipated   The national economy is in the middle of what may become a severe dislocation  My   view is that four uncertainties have held back growth during the first half of 2011  First, Japan    But reports now seem to indicate a faster-than-expected return to full production  This seems   bullish for the second half of the year  Second, energy and commodity prices  This was possibly   the largest concern in the first half of the year, but oil prices in particular have retreated   substantially from their highs earlier this year, so I think this is another bullish factor for the   second half of the year  Third, the US fiscal situation  This is not a new issue  From a   macroeconomic perspective, there is very little news here and really no surprises in the way the   debt deal was finally put together  However, the long debate focused attention on the political   intractability of the situation  Still, so far, Treasury yields have remained extremely low  There   may be a crisis of confidence in US governance, but it is not showing up in yields to date  The   real problem, in my view, is the fourth uncertainty, which is Europe  The key news during the   intermeeting period has been the blowout in Italian and Spanish debt yields  This seems to   indicate exactly the type of contagion that could turn the sovereign debt crisis into a global   macroeconomic shock  The most recent euro zone agreement is proving insufficient for the   European policymakers to stay ahead of the curve  I conclude that the risks from Europe remain   August 9, 2011 55 of 162              substantial and are a key driver of the global selloff in equities  If this is the main disturbance, I   do not think we have a natural policy response  I would expect US Treasury yields to remain   low on flight-to-safety grounds, which is exactly what seems to be happening   One additional factor, which has been mentioned many times already this morning, is the   second-quarter GDP report, which showed very sluggish first-half growth and substantial   downward revisions to earlier data  In my opinion, this is causing many to rethink US potential   growth going forward  Lower potential growth may reasonably imply a lower value for US   equity markets, which seems to be happening  It also makes the US fiscal situation so much   worse  However, as President Plosser was just emphasizing, lower potential growth is not a   problem that monetary policy can fix  I will have one side remark on the GDP report  Anecdotal   reports from around this table from the first half of 2011 did not seem to indicate an economy at   stall speed  I would not be surprised if further revisions again changed the picture of the first   half of 2011   Current monetary policy remains extremely accommodative and has ratcheted up   inflation expectations over the past year  With the policy rate at zero, higher inflation   expectations translate into lower real interest rates, the very definition of easier monetary policy    The real five-year rate, calculated from the TIPS market, is negative 67 basis points as of   Friday—that’s a five-year rate—substantially lower, by approximately 100 basis points, than last   summer  So this Committee has done a lot, and I think further balance sheet policy is the most   potent tool that we have  It also carries with it substantial inflation risk, as has been repeatedly   emphasized around the table   Our goal today, in my view, is to effectively acknowledge the slower economy and the   difficult situation in financial markets and to remain prepared for action in the event that the   August 9, 2011 56 of 162              anticipated strengthening in the second half does not materialize  I counsel against taking direct   policy actions today for two reasons  Any action today with respect to further asset purchases,   number one, would be viewed as helping the Congress with fiscal problems that weren’t solved   and, number two, would solidify the notion that there is a so-called Greenspan–Bernanke put in   the equity markets  Still, despite not taking action today, it’s completely reasonable to plan for   further action if necessary, given the very volatile markets of the past few days  Any policy   action we take going forward should be appropriately tied to specific outcomes in the   macroeconomy and not to the calendar  We have been burned twice by tying the end dates of   key policy moves to the calendar, only to have the data contradict our decisions  This occurred   in March 2010; we had to reconsider our policy in August 2010  It now happened again in June   2011, and we are back here contemplating further action today  We should adopt an approach   closer to our interest rate policy, in which we make adjustments meeting by meeting in response   to incoming data   Other policy approaches, besides balance sheet policy, do not sound like they will be   effective to me  The new Twist policy, in my view, would have questionable effects that would   complicate our exit strategy  Also, rates are puzzlingly low already out on the yield curve, so   I’m not sure how much impact it would have there  Also, the effects of that are not on expected   inflation, which I think is the key variable from our perspective  I think that an explicit promise   into 2013 has many problems  It’s not state contingent, which I have just emphasized  I don’t   think it’s credible to make promises that far out into the future, and I think there’s a substantial   probability that a promise like that could backfire  As I’ve emphasized before here, instead of   generating higher inflation expectations by promising to keep rates at zero, we may get deflation    Markets might take the promise of low rates as a signal that potential growth is actually very   August 9, 2011 57 of 162              low  They’d come to expect zero policy rates for a very long time, which is only consistent with   a mild deflation in the long run  In addition, following that kind of path, as inflation expectations   fall, policy actually gets tighter, not easier  So I think there are a lot of problems with the   explicit promise into 2013  On targeting rates, we can talk about that more during the policy   round, but I think the main issue there is the possibility that we would lose control of the balance   sheet if we tried to target rates  Those are my comments for now, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B for today  As I said   earlier, our goal is to acknowledge the reality of slower-than-expected economic growth and the   difficult situation in financial markets and to remain prepared for a policy move in the event that   the expected rebound in the second half does not materialize  More aggressive action than that   today, in my view, could be counterproductive  Number one, it will be viewed as trying to   compensate for a failure of the Congress to effectively address medium- and longer-term fiscal   uncertainties  Number two, stronger action today will definitely emphasize the idea, already   popular in financial markets, that there is a Greenspan–Bernanke put on the equity markets    Both of these will be damaging to our credibility, in my view, and credibility is our most   valuable asset  Markets are not expecting much action at this meeting  So I think we’ll be   consistent with those market expectations if that’s the way we play this  This does not prohibit   us from having meetings during the intermeeting period if we think that the situation is   deteriorating further or that we’re simply going to have to take action   August 9, 2011 104 of 162              Now, on the extended period through 2013, as I said earlier, I do not think we would be   wise to tie policy action to the calendar  We’ve already been burned by this twice, and if we do   it today, we’ll be headed down for a third time  The data have a way of contradicting what you   expect  If you track the macroeconomy for a long time, you know that there are wide bands of   uncertainty, and the economy could be in a completely different place from what you expect two   years out  The 90 percent confidence intervals are so wide as to be laughable  So I do not think   you should tie it to a calendar date  It will look very political to delay any rate hikes until after   the election  I think that will also damage our credibility  I also doubt that we can credibly   promise what this Committee may or may not do two years from now  So I don’t think it’s all   that meaningful  I think that going with the 2013 language will put us in a box that we may not   want to be in going forward  Further, as I emphasized earlier, this move could backfire badly    This would keep policy rates at zero for at least four and a half years, unless we decide to renege,   which will cost us some credibility chips if we want to do that  Japan has been at zero for a   decade and a half, and that policy has definitely not produced price stability  Instead, they got   mild deflation  There are good theoretical reasons for why they would get that and why that has   occurred  I think we have to be more cognizant of this than we are around this table  Worse, if   we do get on that kind of a track and inflation expectations start to drift down because of this   policy, monetary policy will actually be getting tighter, not easier, exactly at the point where   we’re trying to provide stimulus  I also agree with President Rosengren that to be effective, a   move of this type has to go beyond what markets already expect, and I think that we’ve   established at this meeting that the markets are expecting the policy rate, given the recent data, to   be at zero through 2013  So this would only ratify market expectations  It wouldn’t have any   August 9, 2011 105 of 162              stimulative impact of the types emphasized by authors like Gauti Eggertsson and Mike   Woodford   I also disagree with the Chairman on the QE3  I do not think we will be able to avoid a   discussion of QE3 going forward, as much as many of us may like to  This is our most potent   weapon, and it’s more promising as having effects on the economy—and we can debate what   those effects are—than any of the other tools in our toolbox  This is because the QE program   influences inflation expectations and therefore has potential to drive real interest rates lower if   that is what the Committee desires  The most important aspect of a further QE program would   be to purchase or sell securities in response to economic conditions instead of according to   calendar dates  If we had this program in place as of today, we could simply announce a certain   amount of purchases today, and that would be a much simpler way to react to events than what   we’re forced to contemplate, which are alternative policy actions  We could behave much more   as we would in an interest rate environment where we would lower the policy rate in reaction to   worse-than-expected economic data   The new language suggested by Governor Yellen to tie the fed funds rate move to a   75 percent unemployment rate sounds super risky to me  I might remind the Committee that   Europe has not seen 7½ percent unemployment, except on rare occasions, over the past two   decades  We really have no idea where the unemployment rate may or may not be going as we   go forward in time because we have that little of an understanding of what causes and   perpetuates high unemployment  The European example is one that should give us pause about   tying anything to a specific number  To me, that would be a very large move with very little   thought behind it at this juncture  I would certainly like to see a lot more study on that before we   would tie it to a specific number  Thank you, Mr Chairman   August 9, 2011 106 of 162                I called it risky, so let me clarify what I meant  I think there’s a large   literature that says, as I interpret it, that we don’t understand why unemployment is very high in   some countries and states—there’s hysteresis in unemployment, and there are all these papers   about comparing US with European unemployment  That tells me that unemployment is a   difficult variable to understand, and I wouldn’t want to tie policy numerically to it  Of course,   we’re all very concerned about unemployment  And I’m very concerned as well, but I wouldn’t   want to tie policy numerically to unemployment for that reason, because I think it’s one of the   least-well-understood variables of all the variables that we look at   August 9, 2011 113 of 162                Sure  Having said what I said about the literature, I’ll also say that I   agree with President Plosser that making it state contingent in that way is something we could   study and look at, and I’d be willing to look at it further     I just wanted to make a small suggestion in an effort to try to round up   some consensus  Instead of “2013,” could we change “an extended period” to “a period   substantially longer than previously envisioned”?  [Laughter]     First of all, I agree very much with what Governor Tarullo said about   saying that we had discussed a lot of options  That’s very helpful, I think  The other thing is to   get rid of the “2013,” how about something very simple?  Instead of “for an extended period”—  “for a very substantial period”?     I think if you move off the “extended period” language and switch it to   something else, you’ll get a lot of market attention, and they will see that as a further   commitment  "
9100,2011-09-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two comments on exhibit 3,   “Forward Guidance”  I think one aspect of these simulations is that the announcement inside the   model to keep rates low for longer is assumed to be a credible announcement, as you note here,   and I’m not sure that that’s really the right way to think about this  You’re talking about a   central bank that has never done this in the past and an unprecedented situation  You make an   announcement far out into the future—say, for 2015—and my baseline would be that the   market’s not initially going to believe that you’re going to be able to carry through on that   commitment far out into the future  That is, when you actually get to 2015, you’ll be tempted to   revert to normal Committee behavior as it has evolved over many years  And so my sense is that   because of this assumption, these effects are probably overstated in the simulations, and that you   should allow the guys in the model to gradually learn that the Committee is actually going to   come around and actually carry through on this, even if the data may come in somewhat   differently than anticipated at the time of the announcement   The other area—obviously I’ve been an advocate of this—was that I was disappointed to   see that simulations like this don’t take into account the possibility that you would just get stuck   at a zero nominal interest rate equilibrium and you’d end up at zero nominal interest rates for a   September 20–21, 2011 27 of 290              very long period of time  Japan has been at zero for about 15 years  I think you have to have   that also in the simulation so that you can say with some confidence, “You take on this action,   and you’ll be able to move off zero at some point in the future,” instead of eliciting expectations   that are going to actually keep you at zero for a very long period of time  Those are two aspects   of the simulations I was disappointed with     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin by addressing the question of   the nature of further monetary easing should it be considered desirable by the Committee  And   first of all, I think it is very appropriate for the Committee to consider ways in which it might   ease policy further if necessary, just as we have made reasonably careful plans concerning exit   from our extraordinary policy at the appropriate time  With the policy rate at near zero for two   more years and possibly longer, the Committee badly needs a way to conduct a purposeful,   systematic, countercyclical monetary policy  We need to be able to adjust policy on a meeting-  by-meeting basis as data on the state of economic performance are received, knowing that we   will be unable to adjust the policy rate for some time   I see a maturity extension program as a one-time policy, which is constrained by the   nature of the balance sheet, much as President Kocherlakota just mentioned  I do not think this   policy can be used regularly and effectively as part of the policy process over the next two years   or more  Lowering the IOER, as contemplated, also seems to be a one-time move  I think this   meeting is a good opportunity to discard one-time policy changes with fixed end dates  It is   counterproductive and unnecessary to reinvent the policy response each time the economy   changes direction  Indeed, it damages our credibility and hurts our ability to function effectively   I think it’s reasonably clear that asset purchases are the Committee’s most natural policy   tool  Purchases tend to drive up inflation expectations and drive down real interest rates  This is   conventional, accommodative monetary policy  I stress that last year at this time, the inflation   rate was low and expected to remain low due to the degree of slack in the economy  Even   September 20–21, 2011 41 of 290              though the real economy gave a worse-than-expected performance over the past year, inflation   actually increased both on a headline and a core basis during that period  That sounds like a   clear fact of monetary policy to me  If the goal was to move inflation higher and real rates   lower, we certainly accomplished that   As you know, I prefer a meeting-by-meeting, state-contingent asset purchase program  I   think it would be appropriate to vote on an amount to purchase between now and the next   meeting  In the statement language, we can suggest that purchases will likely continue,   conditional on the state of the economy  This continuation value, or bias, will set up private-  sector expectations of further purchases, just as an interest rate move, coupled with a bias, sets   up expectations of future interest rate moves in ordinary times  This private-sector expectation   of future purchases would provide the so-called stock effect, as the impact would be pulled   forward by financial markets  The expectation would also change in response to incoming   economic data  This approach would prevent the Committee from being awkwardly committed   to stopping purchases or any other program at a date certain independently of the state of the   economy at that date  We will, of course, be criticized from all sides no matter what we do    However, an announcement of this type would be of a smaller total at a particular meeting and, I   think, would mitigate criticism in that regard  But I think the effect would be the same because   of the continuation value—and possibly even larger depending on what markets would expect   going forward for the state of the economy  So this is a clear case where less is more   Let me turn now to monetary policy communications as a policy tool, as an alternative, as   the Chairman just laid out  The literature following Michael Woodford often suggests that   longer and longer commitments by the central bank to keep the policy rate near zero can have a   stimulative impact today  This is indeed true under specific circumstances inside some models   September 20–21, 2011 42 of 290              in which credibility is perfect  But I caution that we should be exceedingly careful in attempting   to apply this doctrine to our actual policy situation  The key problem is that the literature has not   come to grips effectively with the work of Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe, at least not in a   convincing way for me   Benhabib et al suggested that the macroeconomy could become stuck in an undesirable   steady state in which the nominal interest rate remains zero forever  Japan, in fact, seems to be   in this situation  Simply announcing that the policy rate will remain near zero for a long time   can feed into the steady state identified by Benhabib et al  As it stands now, we’re at four and a   half years of expected zero policy rates  I think if we go longer, we’ll increase the risk that we   get stuck in this situation  Indeed, some of the reaction to the Committee’s most recent   announcement had this flavor  Some financial market participants saw it as stimulative in the   conventional Woodford sense, but others saw it as increasing the probability of a Japanese-style   outcome for the United States  They marked down their potential growth and their interest rate   forecasts for a long time   In Woodford’s most recent Financial Times editorial, he notes that a permanent increase   in the level of reserves in the banking system, not offset by an increase in IOER, would cause a   permanent change in the price level—that is, would increase inflation—even in his framework,   which tends to downplay this possibility  Indeed, I believe it is a fact that markets attach some   positive probability to this outcome—that is, that some of the increase in the reserves in the   system would be permanent and allowed to flow through to the price level  It is exactly that   positive probability that increases both inflation expectations and actual inflation coming from   balance sheet policy  The Committee has made no explicit statements about that other than to   reiterate that we intend to take the large level of reserves back down to a more normal level at   September 20–21, 2011 43 of 290              some point in the future  However, I think the private sector puts only a large probability, not   100 percent probability, on that  To the extent the Committee wishes to ease further, I prefer this   method, the balance sheet method, to the one that simply promises near-zero rates for a very long   time, because in my view, the asset purchase method does not have the potential drawback of   becoming trapped at the near-zero rate indefinitely  The outcome in Benhabib et al occurs   because of overemphasis on nominal interest rates as the only policy tool   The Committee can also consider more fully describing the circumstances under which it   would move off of the zero-rate policy, as suggested in the recent memos by the Board staff  I’ll   now turn to commenting on that  Generally speaking, I think it is not a good idea to explicitly   commit US monetary policy to a quantitative reaction function  This is the sort of commitment   that might work well inside a macroeconomic model  Inside the model, we understand exactly   how everything works, and therefore we can specify exactly how policy should be conducted in   order to achieve the optimal allocation of resources  However, in an actual economy, we do not   know enough to commit in a specific, quantitative way to a particular reaction function  I   certainly think we can learn a lot by studying models and the quantitative reaction functions they   recommend  We can employ those reaction functions informally in making judgments   concerning monetary policy, but I would stop short of actually adopting a quantitative reaction   function for US monetary policy, as it could easily turn out to be an inappropriate choice  In   short, we should not adopt this course because of model uncertainty  I think we’re better off   committing to goals than to instrument reaction functions     It would be particularly questionable to tie US monetary policy directly to the behavior   of unemployment  I sent a memo to the Committee on this topic, and let me just touch on a few   of the points here  I think the conventional wisdom has been that unemployment, empirically   September 20–21, 2011 44 of 290              speaking, moves in ways that are difficult to understand, which means that tying monetary policy   directly and specifically to this variable is risky  The leading example is European   unemployment over the past 30 years  Unemployment is importantly affected by labor market   policies  So we could be subordinating monetary policy effectively to the labor market policies   that are really the prime determinants of the unemployment rate in the medium to long term  I   would also note—and this is a geeky point, I know—that available research does not give us   much guidance on monetary policy and unemployment  The standard New Keynesian model,   for instance, has no unemployment  You can read all of Woodford’s book, and you will see no   reference to unemployment  This is because it’s all about output and consumption; actually,   investment is not in there either  But to get to the unemployment issues, you have to go to search   models, and search models tend to be very difficult to meld with other types of general-  equilibrium macro models  Where that leaves us as policymakers is that we don’t have a lot of   available guidance  Newer models do have unemployment—there are some papers—and they   do have the search frictions coming from the Diamond, Mortensen, and Pissarides tradition  I   think the main take-away from that literature is that it is the difference between the flexible and   the sticky price level of unemployment to which monetary policy should react  That’s a very   different conception of what’s typically talked about around this table  Furthermore, to the   extent we have research on this question, it says that wrong choices can throw the economy far   off course  So this may be playing with fire in a way that we don’t want to play with it  Models   do have sharp predictions on employment, certainly equally as interesting a variable  Our   mandate actually refers to employment, so I think it makes a lot more sense to think about   employment than unemployment in this regard   September 20–21, 2011 45 of 290              The final issue is—I’m not sure if we’re discussing it at this meeting, but I guess some   people are, so I’ll discuss it, too—forward guidance on the federal funds rate  Generally   speaking, I think this is an interesting idea  Other central banks have done it as detailed in the   staff memo  I would make two comments on this  First, I think there’s considerable confusion   in our SEP process over the provision that forecasts are made under appropriate monetary policy   versus an unconditional forecast that’s simply trying to predict what will actually happen    Members understandably don’t want to be predicting what their colleagues may or may not do    We may understand the difference and the subtleties of that, but the forecasts, I think, are   generally interpreted as unconditional forecasts  Most of the studies that you see looking at past   forecasts of the Committee just examine how accurate the forecasts are and compare the   accuracy  One implication of our forecasts is that they never suggest that inflation will get out of   control, because there is always the appropriate policy that keeps inflation under control   Second, I’m unsure whether putting out 17 interest rate forecasts is really a good idea    This may be more confusing instead of less confusing  I’ll make a different suggestion  I think   what the Committee needs is something like an Inflation Report, which is put out by the   Monetary Policy Committee in the United Kingdom  One option would be to simply publish the   Tealbook or a variant of the Tealbook  What I like about that is that it would give a nuanced   view of the likely path of policy and the likely path of the economy  It would put some pressure   on the staff, which has been discussed in the past, but other central banks do it, and I don’t see   why we couldn’t do it  I think this nuanced view would serve the Committee very well  It   avoids trying to boil down the mass of information we have to a few words or phrases or to a few   numbers  This approach would also allow Committee members to agree or disagree with   particular aspects of the Tealbook view without having to disagree with the general thrust of the   September 20–21, 2011 46 of 290              entire analysis  I think this would be a helpful compromise on this issue  It would be a way to   communicate to the public effectively in a nuanced way without trying to boil everything down   to a particular number  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman?     Maybe we should just try to clarify this here  I thought if you put your   stuff in your Taylor rule, then usually you said you’re targeting those things  Now, here we   don’t have a Taylor rule, but you have this threshold for action that seems very close to me  So I   September 20–21, 2011 53 of 290              don’t know  I think that there maybe is some confusion over the targets versus—I’m not sure   what it is if it’s not a target     Right  I’m recalling long papers by Lars Svensson that are defining all   these things, and I don’t think it was very clear     You have a conflict of interest     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, economic conditions in the Eighth   District have improved slightly during the intermeeting period  District employment rose   somewhat during the spring  Business contacts who have daily data on sales revenue and   volumes generally indicated that business remained reasonably stable during August and may   have improved somewhat in the early weeks of September  However, these contacts were   intensely alert to the possibility of a looming slowdown  Some businesses saw signs that the   upcoming holiday season may be weaker than last year, although it may be too early to make a   judgment on that  In particular, should a recession not develop, many retailers may then have to   scramble to provide a sufficient level of product for the fourth quarter  Because most of us are   projecting slow growth with no recession, this might be a likely outcome as we go through the   fall here  Businesses associated with agriculture are generally doing quite well  Businesses   associated with information technology also tend to report continuing strong sales in a rapidly   changing environment  Energy-related businesses continue to prosper and sometimes report that   bottlenecks or technological problems have caused shortages in some areas of the business    However, in that area, much of the strongest activity is located in Asia  Looming cost   containment in the health-care sector seems to suggest that this will not be an area of job creation   over the next several years, even though it has been a source of strength in the past  District real   estate continues to struggle, as it does elsewhere in the country  For instance, 90-day-plus   delinquencies have increased slightly in recent months   September 20–21, 2011 149 of 290              Based on the July 29 revisions to GDP over the past several years, I think the US   economy is at considerably more risk of a period of prolonged slow economic growth  As   markets digested this report, they tended to mark down potential growth for the US going   forward and revalue US corporate equities downward  The “very slow growth” view may well   turn out to be the correct one, if history is any guide to the pace of recovery following severe   financial crises   On inflation, I agree with several of the comments around the table so far  I’ve been   dismayed that during the past year, measures of production and income surprised to the   downside, yet inflation surprised to the upside  As I understand the forecast last fall, we were   not likely to see this much inflation, even if the economy had grown at the projected rates of   3½ to 4 percent  This is lowering my confidence that we can accurately predict likely inflation   outcomes going forward  Our models may not appropriately accommodate the effects of policies   we have adopted since encountering the zero lower bound in December 2008   As many of you noted—and I’ll just mention—the European sovereign debt crisis   remains an acute risk to US economic growth and global growth prospects  Our likely response   should that crisis become more severe is an important preoccupation for this Committee  It   seems to me that this crisis has the potential to deliver a powerful macroeconomic shock to   global markets in the coming months   I want to comment for just a minute on flexible inflation targeting  I’m very encouraged   to find that many on the Committee spoke highly today concerning the virtues of flexible   inflation targeting  I’ve been an advocate of this form of inflation targeting since I joined the   Committee more than three years ago  The FRB St Louis has sponsored numerous conferences   on the merits and demerits of inflation targeting over the past two decades  If the proposal on the   September 20–21, 2011 150 of 290              table is to adopt flexible inflation targeting as practiced by some of the central banks that have   led the effort in this area, then I am in full support of that  In fact, I would suggest that we   simply adopt most of the practices of the flexible-inflation-targeting countries wholesale  The   first step in that process means adopting a specific numerical inflation target  But in addition, as   has been pointed out, the Committee would have to communicate more effectively by publishing   something more like a Monetary Policy Report or an Inflation Report at a quarterly frequency    The United States has been a laggard in this area  It would substantially improve US monetary   policy to go in this direction, in my view   I want to make some comments on communication as a one-time tool  We’ve been   talking about the balance sheet policy or the lowering of the interest rate on reserves as being a   one-time effect  I think communication challenges also have this one-time aspect  The exercises   that illustrate the effects of communicating that monetary policy will remain at the zero bound   for a longer-than-expected period also have a one-time flavor to them  In the experiments, the   policymaker announces, with perfect credibility, that the policy of zero rates will last longer than   currently anticipated  The experiment is to then trace out the effects of this announcement,   assuming no further shocks to the economy  But especially considering the time scales   involved—and you’re talking about years here—further shocks will undoubtedly occur in the   meantime as you’re waiting to get to the period of extra time at the zero bound  Real-world   policy has to be able to react to current economic developments in this situation  There is little   guidance offered from the literature or in the simulations of the staff as to how the policymakers   should react in this situation  In particular, a positive shock would move the desired date of   takeoff sooner, but the policymaker cannot move the commitment in that direction without   contradicting the original purpose of extending the horizon   September 20–21, 2011 151 of 290              I want to make a last comment here on the paper by Ravenna and Walsh  President   Evans said he did not like some of the assumptions in Ravenna and Walsh  I can appreciate that    One advantage of a DSGE model is that the assumptions are laid bare for examination; then we   can debate what the appropriate framework is for analyzing a particular economic phenomenon    I do not think it is a good reaction to revert to a model in which such questions cannot be asked   and to claim that that is a better model from which to take policy advice  In any event, my point   was in part that we have a dearth of models on which to base policy opinions that have both   monetary policy in them and a serious model of unemployment  If Ravenna and Walsh is   discarded, then we have zero papers on the topic  Thank you     Mr Chairman?     Can I just ask one question of Vice Chairman Dudley?  I thought the   whisper on the EFSF was that, yes, they’re going to expand it to €1 trillion, but they don’t want   to do that because it will take the pressure off the Spanish and Italian governments  Is that a   reasonable assumption, or do you think that that’s broken down some?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my comments, I will generally support   alternative B and talk about alternative B  Let me start with paragraph 1, the last sentence  I,   too, thought that the phrase, “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy   and some commodities have declined from their peaks,” was a little bit strong  I think it has   September 20–21, 2011 206 of 290              been an improvement to eliminate the confusing references to underlying inflation, and I would   take it that our basic measure of inflation, when we say “inflation,” is PCE inflation measured   from a year ago  I’m looking at page 23 of the data sheets here, which has all our data on   consumer prices  This is what is presented to the Committee  There are six charts here, with a   lot of upward sloping charts in 2011, so I think it might be a little bit strong to say this  I have a   suggestion that I think more accurately will reflect your view, Mr Chairman, which is that   instead of using “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year,” we could say “Inflation is   expected to moderate as prices of energy and some commodities have declined”   The new first part of the very last sentence in paragraph 1 would be “Inflation is expected   to moderate”  It would mean that, indeed, we think headline inflation is going to come down    Yes, it is kind of high right now if you look at these charts, but we think it is going to come   down  That very much reflects the staff view and the view that you expressed earlier in your   comments     There are an awful lot of upward moving lines here  It is true that   these three-month averages show little blips down, but that might be a little bit of a thin reed to   hang your hat on     “Appears to have moderated”   September 20–21, 2011 207 of 290                What is wrong with just “expected to moderate”?  I think that’s fine     I don’t mind the story that it is expected to moderate  I just don’t want   people to look at this picture and say, “Well, what is the Committee thinking?”  PCE inflation   measured from a year ago is up close to 3 percent, and core inflation has also gone up quite a bit   and is still on an upward slope  Just say “is expected to moderate”     Moving on—  In paragraph 3, I want to make a few remarks on the   attitude of the Committee since the onset of near-zero policy rates  As I said many times, I do   not think it is desirable or necessary to have large, fixed total amounts in the statement  The   Committee, in the past, would never contemplate announcing a bundle of interest rate moves to   be executed over a fixed time period  Instead, the Committee would make an interest rate move   September 20–21, 2011 208 of 290              at a given meeting and offer a suggestion, a bias, or a continuation value about future moves, but   reserving the right to review incoming data  This type of policy was later rationalized in a slew   of economic research as being close to optimal in certain types of macroeconomic models  Even   though that sort of policy was considered close to optimal, in the near-zero rate era we have   thrown this idea out the window, and I think this is a mistake   As many of you know, there is a substantial amount of stimulus fatigue in the US, which   is feeding into unwarranted and unnecessary criticism of the Fed, which is in turn harming our   credibility and our ability to carry out effective policy  What is happening, in my view, is that   those less familiar with the intricacies of central banking simply seize on the $400 billion   number and run with it  But this grand misunderstanding is completely unnecessary  The   financial market participants who understand our duration program will have no difficulty   discerning the Committee’s intent and forming expectations appropriately  Any announcement   effect will actually be exactly the same size because the rational expectations of markets will be   exactly the same  I am arguing in favor of 3′, then, instead of in favor of 3, and solely on the   basis that you get rid of the big number in this statement   Paragraph 4 is about the MBS  I am going to counsel against this for today  I’m not   saying forever, but just for today  I do not think that the Committee has seen a very substantial   analysis on this question, in particular, on what is the source of the increased spread in MBS   markets and what would be our expected effects now going back into MBS markets after having   once left them  I think we could get some more analysis on this—that would be one thing to do    I see this also as running against the Committee’s widely agreed goal of returning to an all-  Treasuries portfolio—which was part of the earlier discussion about MBS versus Treasuries—  and this would be going in the opposite direction  I would want to be careful that we are   September 20–21, 2011 209 of 290              thinking about that before we make a commitment to do so  I counsel that we watch   developments here carefully and consider this at a future meeting   I do also think that regarding the heuristic argument that Vice Chairman Dudley just gave   on refinancing, there are going to be distributional effects that are important  The people who   don’t have high income, are unemployed, or are under water in their house are not going to be   able to take advantage of a low mortgage rate  That is already happening today, and that will   continue to happen, so you are not really helping that group of people  You are helping the   relatively high-income people whose value of their house hasn’t fallen as substantially  It is not   clear that is exactly the policy we want to pursue, although I would be open to hearing more   about it  But for today, I think this needs a little more analysis  This is not an issue that has to be   decided in the next 24 hours  We could probably wait a little bit on this   Let me talk just a little bit about a few more issues, and then I will be done  On the risk   to alternative B, I do think there are some risks in this announcement that will come out today    Longer-term rates could as easily rise as fall in the coming months, coming weeks even  Given   the volatility in markets and the fact that yields are exceptionally low right now, I think this will   probably stimulate an intense debate, about whether this is an effective program or not  We have   to be prepared to carry that debate, and a good way to do that is to talk about the effects of the   program in the run-up to this announcement, not in the aftermath of it  I also agree with   President Williams that if the economy is as weak as many here think it may be, we may soon be   forced to take more-aggressive action  I’m not exactly sure that we are really ready to do that,   but we probably need even more intense contingency planning than we have done even at this   meeting   September 20–21, 2011 210 of 290              Let me comment on option A  I do not think these communications options are ready for   prime time based on the discussion yesterday  However, I am encouraged by several outcomes   of that discussion  I think that we may be able to use the SEP to help better communicate the   Committee’s intent going forward, and we may be able to revise and expand that process  That   would be a great development  We should go ahead and adopt a flexible inflation-targeting   program like the ones used in some of the leading countries on this issue  Some of the Nordic   countries are good models, but there may be others  I think that would be a perfectly fine thing   to do  We could adopt many of the practices that they have already implemented and tested  As   the Chairman noted, we are essentially in a flexible inflation-targeting regime right now, but it is   a bit of a clandestine one  We may as well get the full benefits of going ahead with the program    Thanks very much     I’m happy with it, too   September 20–21, 2011 251 of 290             "
9126,2011-11-01,"  Let the record show—     Thank you, sir  And a great World Series it was     A six-pack of the local brew     Bud Light, Busch     Thank you, Mr Chairman  And thank you, Michael, for the   presentation and the analysis  I love this kind of stuff; I am a big fan   I have a couple of comments  One is, when we talk about price-level targeting, I thought   it got a little jumbled, because I guess you are talking about what I would call strict price-level   targeting  When I think back to the original Svensson paper on this, he took this objective that   had the output gap and inflation in it, and he replaced inflation with price-level targeting  The   output gap was still there, so to me, when we went to the price-level-targeting argument, it was   all there, and so there wasn’t anything that indicated that price-level targeting means that you are   going to ignore the real side of the economy  There wasn’t anything like that  To have price-  level targeting get a bad name from this memo, which is what is happening, I think is a little   unfair to the approach  The price level was supposed to substitute for the commitment that   wasn’t there when you had the inflation rates there  That was a pretty good insight and has been   verified in subsequent models   You can go to nominal income targeting instead, but you could also go to flexible price-  level targeting  What is the difference between those two is really the question  What is the   November 1–2, 2011 18 of 282              difference between flexible price-level targeting, as I would see it originally envisioned by   Svensson, and nominal income targeting?     Okay  Thank you  One thing about this memo that I thought was not   addressed—from the perspective of this Committee—is, what are we really worried about?  We   are worried that you are playing with fire, and you might replay a really bad scenario in which   inflation goes up a lot, and you really get into a lot of trouble   What would it take in this kind of framework to get into that kind of hot water?  The   answer might be there is no scenario under which that can happen, but the ’70s did happen  I   think you have to have something in the model that goes too far and really generates a lot of   November 1–2, 2011 19 of 282              problems  Otherwise, the question would be, why don’t you just commit to zero rates out to   2030, if it is all beneficial?     I just have one more comment, which President Lacker has already   brought up, which is, how fair is it to characterize what the Committee does now as a   discretionary policy?  In some sense, if you have a Taylor rule, maybe it is a simple Taylor rule,   maybe it is not the optimal one, but you can pick the coefficients to be as good as they can be for   that particular Taylor rule  That will probably get you pretty close to the optimal outcome  You   are committing to the rule, you always behave like the rule, so in a sense there is a lot of   commitment already there  How much can you really improve on that, as opposed to the   literature, which says that you are always choosing the discretionary solution at every point in   time?   November 1–2, 2011 20 of 282                Thank you, Mr Chairman  I apologize if I’m not completely coherent   here  I’ve been enjoying some of the fruits of the Cardinal victory  [Laughter]   As you know, I laid out a number of comments on the Erceg, Kiley, and Lopez-Salido   memo, which was excellent, in my communication to the FOMC on October 27  I will review   and amplify some of those comments here   In general, I think we’re moving in the right direction in giving serious consideration to   these approaches to policy and to the DSGE models from which they are derived  However,   some of the difficulties seem to me to be very vexing and could lead to very different outcomes   from those envisioned in the memo  As the authors emphasize, policy moves like the ones being   described here put credibility front and center  These are pure expectations plays in which the   Committee promises to behave differently not today but several years in the future  If the private   sector believes this promise, a boom occurs today  However, the future Committee will have   clear incentives to renege on the promise since at that point, according to the model, all will be   November 1–2, 2011 50 of 282              going well  Both output and inflation will be relatively high  Today’s private sector seeing this   will not believe the initial promise  As a consequence nothing happens at all  The policy move   falls flat  This is actually my main concern  You go through a lot of gyrations here; you make   the announcement and nothing happens at all  Could there be partial credibility for the promise?    The memo argues that perhaps if you made the promise, the private sector will put a 50–50   chance on it coming true  I don’t think this is the right way to think about this   The Committee has repeatedly reassured financial markets over several decades that   interest rates will be raised at an appropriate time in order to keep inflation low and stable    You’d be coming into a couple decades of that environment and saying that you are now   departing from that policy, rather opportunistically as has been emphasized here, and you are not   doing anything different today, but you will do something different five years in the future or   several years in the future  This would surely not be believed, initially  Credibility would have   to be earned through action  It would be very similar to Chairman Volcker coming in when   inflation is running very high and deciding to change the policy framework  Initially, he is not   believed  He has to earn credibility for that change in policy  The same thing would have to   happen here  Credibility would have to be earned  The way the memo does it, which just   assumes you could make a credible announcement and get something to happen today, is a little   farfetched, but possibly you could earn credibility   Now, how would you be able to earn credibility?  I think we have pretty good ideas about   how this would work  The private sector initially holds a belief that the Committee will never   deviate from its implicit Taylor-type rule  Let’s just suppose that’s a good description of the   behavior of the Committee and the belief of the private sector  The private sector will begin to   adjust its perception of the Committee when the Committee takes actions that deviate from the   November 1–2, 2011 51 of 282              prescriptions of that rule  It’s at that point that they’ll start to believe that maybe something   different is going on with the Committee  That change occurs when the Taylor-type rules   suggest raising the policy rate, but the Committee doesn’t raise the rate and instead leaves the   rate near zero  I could imagine some scenario in the future where we’re looking at the Tealbook   and there’s a whole bunch of Taylor rules in there  They’re all saying we’re supposed to be at a   higher interest rate, but the Committee stays at zero  At that point you would get a boom and a   change in private-sector behavior, because they would at that point learn that the Committee   actually had changed behavior from what was previously believed to be dominating the thinking     But unfortunately, that sort of event in the scenario we’re talking about here only occurs several   years in the future when Taylor rules are saying we’re supposed to be raising rates and we’re not   raising rates  The boom occurs, but only several years in the future—not today  In short,   learning about the policy by the private sector would dramatically alter the timing of the effects    In some ways it defeats the purpose of the announcement    In part because of these considerations, I’ve repeatedly favored balance sheet policies as   a way to ease policy by creating expectations of higher inflation  With balance sheet policies,   clear action is being taken today, which in my view, can influence and has influenced private-  sector expectations of Committee behavior     I agree with President Evans  The question is how to get the expected inflation that the   Committee so desires higher  The question is how to make that happen  One way would be to   make this promise out there in the future  I’m arguing that that would fall flat  I’m saying that   the additional commitment strategy wouldn’t be effective, and therefore, you’re probably better   off with balance sheet policy  That’s as much as I have to say on time consistency   November 1–2, 2011 52 of 282              As you all know, I remain concerned that we are not putting enough weight on the   possibility that committing to near zero rates for a very long time will simply produce zero rates   for decades  The memo contemplates very long times at a policy rate of zero  It really begins to   sound like we would be creating the worst outcome of all and the importing of the Japanese   situation to the US  We should be thinking about the tradeoff between possibly creating a   replication of the Japanese situation in the US versus the relatively minor and uncertain benefits   of promising longer and longer times at a policy rate of zero in the hopes that that would raise   inflation expectations today  In short, and there is a literature on this, it’s going to be Schmitt-  Grohé and Uribe, not Eggertson–Woodford that’s the relevant framework here  Eggertson–  Woodford does not deal effectively with this issue  According to Benhabib et al, commitment to   low nominal interest rates actually creates the problem   As I discuss in my memo, I did not find the results on price-level targeting very   convincing  This should be close to the fully optimal policy in models of this type  Partly I   agree, based on the earlier comment, that this is because this is a form of strict price-level   targeting, which isn’t what I think of as typically discussed in the literature  The whole idea   behind price-level targeting is that it changes the policymaker objective function in a way that   helps substitute for the missing ability to commit what Peter Howitt once called the “Zen archer”   approach to policy  I’m not quite sure what that meant, but it sounded neat  [Laughter]  The   policymaker maximizes an objective that’s a little bit different from the one that the household   would maximize in order to get part of the commitment that the household doesn’t have, and so   you get a little bit better policy through that   The notion that nominal income targeting respects the dual mandate while price-level   targeting does not seems an odd way to describe the state of affairs to me  The literature is   November 1–2, 2011 53 of 282              talking about models with micro foundations  Households live in the model  They have utility   functions defined over consumption and labor supply  A fully optimal policy maximizes the   utility of these households  As President Lacker was saying, you’ve got the households there—   ask them what they want  Ask them what the optimal policy is  Why come in with other   objectives that we’re imposing from the outside unless you don’t believe your model, in which   case I say go build your model the way you want to build it and get to a different objective  We   cannot do any better than this, maximizing the utility of the households in the model, and   household labor supply is very much part of the story  So it is very much about maximum   employment if you want to talk in those terms   For both nominal income targeting and price-level targeting, the starting point for   drawing the baseline path is important, as several people have stressed  Many of us have   described the past decade as a housing bubble that burst  I think it is inappropriate to project that   bubble out into the indefinite future and then claim that it’s up to monetary policy to reestablish   the unsustainable path the economy was once on  Fundamental potential output growth was   probably somewhat lower than it appears during the past decade  Embracing this view would   give a more realistic description of the likely outcomes the FOMC would be able to achieve   through an appropriate policy   So as a bottom line, let me give several brief answers to the questions that were listed on   the exam  Flexible inflation targeting, yes, I’m very much in favor of it  I think we should name   an inflation target to get started  Lots of countries have done this  We’re a laggard on this issue,   and we should go ahead and do that  I would not give the extreme interpretations that President   Rosengren alluded to earlier where you put just a minimal weight  You should put an   appropriate weight on the real side of the economy when you do this   November 1–2, 2011 54 of 282              The thresholds are intriguing, but I don’t see them popping out as an optimal policy   response in any of the models I’m aware of  I’d be willing to look at ones where they do, and   I’ve argued in previous memos that unemployment as a threshold is problematic  It has behaved   badly as a variable in the G-7 over the past couple of decades and especially in Europe  It   wanders around, and we don’t have good theories of why that happened  We know that other   policies affect the level of unemployment—other labor market policies  I’m not against thinking   about unemployment  I’m against tying monetary policy explicitly, numerically to the level of   the unemployment rate because that would possibly throw monetary policy off for a very long   time if that rate doesn’t behave in the nice, cyclical fashion that we think that it should and   instead wanders off into uncharted territory   On price-level targeting or nominal income targeting, I’d be worried that if you went this   way, not too much would happen  It would fall flat, and that’s why I’m advocating a balance   sheet policy instead  That being said, they’re actually not too different from Taylor-type policy   rules  In some ways it’s hard to see why you get much of an announcement effect at all because   it would be hard for the private sector to distinguish between existing policy and the new policy    But my main concern is that if you try to make these commitments out there in the future, it   doesn’t look credible to me, and it’s going to fall flat  I would do balance sheet policy instead    You’re taking clear actions today that markets understand very well   On the issue of should we publish more information, I would again advocate that we’re   struggling too much with trying to condense a lot of information about our views about the US   economy into terse statements that just have a few words or a few numbers  I think the way to   get around that is to go ahead and publish the Tealbook or some version of the Tealbook that you   thought was appropriate, perhaps a quarterly report on the state of the US economy  If you did   November 1–2, 2011 55 of 282              it that way, you could have a long document that could put in lots of information and contain   many of the subtleties  You could comment on a lot of the issues that are facing the economy in   a way that you can’t in shorter statements  I’d be an advocate of thinking about going in that   direction, and that will clear up many of our issues about communication  Other countries have   done this, and I think it would be a sensible way to go  Thank you, Mr Chairman     The problem in the model is that you’re fully committed to the Taylor-  type policy rules     Well, I guess in the memos there is a—     —certain type of policy rule  If that policy rule is going to tell you   that you’ll never move off zero until certain conditions are met, then the public starts to think,   okay, you’re never going to meet those conditions, so you’re going to stay at zero  One of the   conditions is that inflation is near target, but because of the Fisher relation, inflation expectations   November 1–2, 2011 56 of 282              are low, and so you’re just permanently below the target  That’s what happened in Japan, where   they’ve had mild deflation for 15 years     I can give you a stock answer in one sentence     It’s fair to say—I wrote it down in my model—that the one   equilibrium is the one that’s the natural one to focus on, but you’ve got a country that’s stuck at   the other equilibrium  Your theory has to tell you why you’re going to be at one equilibrium   versus the other     Well, they were at zero  We’ve been at zero for a long time     Three left     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On MF Global—it became a primary   dealer this year, is that correct?     Are we happy with our expanded criteria for primary dealers?  And   does this give you any pause about that new, more expansive definition?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to follow up on that  There   is literature that looks at the forecasts by the group here  They treat them as unconditional   forecasts, and they look at whether it’s accurate or not  They forget all about the “appropriate   policy” assumption, and so I think there are a lot of subtle issues here  If you think the   Committee is off on the wrong path, you might forecast that inflation is going to go way down or   way up—way far away from target, for instance  And do you want that?     Other central banks have wrestled with this  They’ve done the projection based on the   market expectation, which is a reasonable compromise  Or they’ve allowed the staff forecast to   November 1–2, 2011 136 of 282              go out and have let the principals just comment on the staff forecast  So I’m not sure—this is a   difficult issue, I think     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eighth District economy continues to   expand at a modest pace  The Eighth District unemployment rate based on 16 metropolitan   November 1–2, 2011 158 of 282              statistical areas is somewhat lower than the national rate, at 87 percent  Payroll employment in   the District was approximately flat during the most recent reporting period   Large firms in the District remain optimistic and plan to expand in some cases    Profitability remains strong  Cash holdings are high  Many large firms have a strong presence in   Asia, and in almost every case, the growth strategy is based on Asian demand  In this sense, the   European sovereign debt crisis is not upsetting business planning or entering corporate thinking   as anything more than a general risk factor, and Asian growth is still considered mostly   unassailable at this juncture   District agriculture continues to do well  Relatively high prices, even with higher input   prices, mean farm income will likely remain strong this year  As an indicator, some farm   equipment dealers are reportedly sold out through the spring of 2012   Commercial real estate conditions are variable across the District  Residential real estate   continues to be lackluster in many areas  Banks continue to report very weak loan demand   The national economy now appears to have avoided the recession scare that gripped   financial markets during the August time frame, even though the level of global financial stress   remains high  If a recession was developing during the September–October time frame, the hard   data would have been considerably worse than they were  My sense is that market expectations   outran actual economic developments  As it stands, I expect moderate growth during the   remainder of 2011, with reasonably good prospects for improved growth during 2012, provided   that significant financial stress can be mitigated   The types of risk events that occurred during the past several months have apparently not   been of a variety that might cause households and businesses to pull back spending sharply and   set off a recessionary event  For households, the European sovereign debt crisis is worrying but   November 1–2, 2011 159 of 282              too distant to cause immediate changes in spending patterns  For large businesses, the EU crisis   is, again, very worrying, but much of their growth strategy is in Asia so that both growth and   profitability remain on track for them  For both businesses and households, the debt ceiling   debate only confirmed the political realities in the US concerning the difficulty of dealing with   medium- and longer-term fiscal issues  Despite the contentiousness of the debate, there was no   real news about the US fiscal situation   The July 29 revisions to GDP, as we have noted here on several occasions, were indeed   significant and did lead to legitimate worry of a further slowdown or outright recession  But the   Q3 hard data did not confirm this view, so now I think we’re in a position to expect reasonable   but not stellar growth going forward   In the meantime, headline and core inflation have not subsided to the extent that one   might have predicted based on the estimated size of the output gap  One reasonable   interpretation is that the output gap is not nearly as large as suggested by conventional analysis    Reverse engineering the output gap using the method of Laubach and Williams—our colleague   just to my left here—for instance, suggests that movements in core inflation are indicating a gap   of about 2 to 3 percent, much smaller than suggested by other metrics  This makes a lot of sense   if one is willing to attribute some of the growth in the past decade not to fundamental factors but   to an unsustainable bubble in housing and real estate more generally  Indeed, this fits with our   rhetoric about the past decade very well  I think this hypothesis bears careful watching during   the coming quarters and years  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief  I support alternative B  The   data have been somewhat stronger than expected  The recession scare that was around during   the August time frame has been mitigated, at least for now   It’s true that sentiment is down at both the household level and the firm level  I consider   this a headline phenomenon for right now  There is very real risk to the US from Europe, but   it’s only a risk at this point, and it’s not enough to change household behavior or business   behavior for a couple of reasons  The households, I think, see themselves as too far removed   from Europe to actually change behavior, despite the fact that they’re reporting bad feelings  For   the large businesses, they’re also worried about developments in Europe, but they are also   profitable and cash rich  Their business growth strategies are not centered in Europe but in Asia,   and Asian growth is projected to continue unabated  These are two good reasons to think that the   sentiment numbers are not affecting actual household and business behavior in the US at this   point, and so I think that that helps explain why we’re not getting significant downturn based on   sentiment alone   November 1–2, 2011 215 of 282              The Committee has taken easing actions at the August and September meetings,   strengthening the commitment to maintain the policy rate near zero and undertaking Operation   Twist  Both of these are operating today  Given the improved hard data on the economy, I   counsel patience at this point   I also counsel against the use of the word “significant” in paragraph 2 of alternative B    The tradition of central bankers is to be appropriately fair but understated to avoid frightening   the financial markets  It’s a serious problem  They think that we know something that they   don’t know, and we have to be very careful about sending any signals of that nature  I think it’s   fine as originally written  “Moreover, there are downside risks to the economic outlook,   including strains in global financial markets”  Certainly there are  Everyone knows what we’re   talking about  Putting “significant” in there may otherwise create more problems than it solves    So I would use the original wording in paragraph 2   If the Committee wishes to ease aggressively at future meetings, I suggest that asset   purchases are the most potent tool available to the Committee  Partly based on the discussion   yesterday, I would recommend the incremental balance sheet policies, such as those described in   the excellent memo of October 24 by Dave Reifschneider, John Roberts, and Jae Sim  We   haven’t discussed that memo very much at this meeting, but I thought it was very good, and I   recommend that we take a look at it  I’ve also described my own views on this issue in previous   discussions with the Committee  An incremental approach would have a great advantage of   allowing the Committee to make decisions in a manner analogous to interest rate decisions in   ordinary times  Also, the open-ended nature of this approach potentially promises substantial   additional easing while still giving the Committee the ability to pause or reverse the policy as the   macroeconomic situation changes  I counsel purchasing Treasuries versus MBS   November 1–2, 2011 216 of 282              Other methods of easing did not strike me as being nearly as effective as they are   sometimes portrayed, partly for the reasons I outlined yesterday  The trigger strategy approach   seems questionable to me  I do not see why this is a good way to commit to longer periods of   zero rates relative to other methods of committing to longer periods of zero rates  I do not think   much would happen initially if we took this approach, and it might complicate our strategies   down the line if either or both of the thresholds were violated  Furthermore, trying to tie   monetary policy directly to unemployment strikes me as very questionable given the state of   knowledge of hysteresis in unemployment as experienced in Europe in recent decades  It’s not   that we shouldn’t think about unemployment—we should think about unemployment  The   question is, should you tie the policy lever directly to a number that we probably don’t   understand as well as we would like to understand?  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, I agree—we could just keep it the way it was  Let me just say,   though, that as a matter of style, you always want to be understated as a central bank  People are   imputing that we have some really detailed knowledge about what’s going to happen or that we   have a special crystal ball, and they’re imputing the probability of disaster to be higher than it   otherwise is       I’m happy to leave the sentence the way it is, but let me just say, the   Wall Street Journal is a master of understatement  They have the small headlines  It says,   “Nixon Resigns; Ford Takes the Oath of Office”  They don’t blare it at you the way the other   newspapers do  I think that’s the style that we should have in describing the situation     I would caution against “humongous”  "
9154,2011-11-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’d advise against this  I think that,   basically, theatrics are important in a situation like this, and coordinated central bank action   would more or less send a panic signal without doing very much to actually help the situation    We had the 100 basis point policy in place all the way through 2008 and 2009  It actually   worked quite well in that instance and did a lot to chase borrowers out to the market once   conditions returned to a more normal status  I like the 100 basis point penalty that we had   before, and given that it is battle tested, I don’t really see a good reason to change it here  I also   think the 50 basis point backstop would be unlikely to address any stigma issues  If there are   stigma issues, there’s stigma  And, as you point out, 100 basis points is already in the money   right now, and it doesn’t seem to me that things would change that much if we moved that to   50 basis points  We’re going to be under a lot of pressure and a lot of criticism that we’re   somehow bailing out the Europeans  That’s a very dangerous situation for the organization    Also, I think that in Europe, the recent discussions of enforcing fiscal austerity at the EU level   are the first serious signs I’ve seen of some kind of significant reform that would actually address   the problem instead of piling debt on top of existing debt problems  So I’d be very reluctant to   take the pressure off the politicians in Europe on that process, however mild that might be,   because we’re a long way away and this is relatively minor policy on that   November 28, 2011 19 of 40              On the extension, I would prefer to extend in some kind of regularly scheduled meeting,   preferably the January meeting  Then you could review swap lines every year in January and not   review them in the heat of the crisis when you’re actually sending a signal in conjunction with   the review of the swap lines  I think we’ve often been reviewing these in the heat of the   moment, and I’d prefer to review them at regularly scheduled times that do not contribute to the   problem  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On expected usage, I understood Vice   Chairman Dudley to argue that usage would probably be up substantially because of the   deleveraging in Europe, but I understood you to say that you didn’t think these swap lines would   be used that much  So I think we should try to get some clarity on where we really think usage is   likely to go  I’d also say that under the 100 basis point policy, we didn’t seem to have any   trouble getting people to use the facility during 2008 and 2009  So I’m wondering what’s   changed this time  And I’m a little concerned that at 50 basis points, if the dollar funding   remains in the money, then you could end up with the addicted banking system in Europe that   wants the dollar funding over the long term, and then we don’t really get out of the swap lines   the way we did in 2008 and 2009  The 100 basis point policy was very useful from that point of   view, and you got those banks to seek other sources during that time   As far as the signaling goes, I disagree with the way the other central banks see this    They want to send a united signal, which I would interpret mostly as they want to get the Fed on   board, but I don’t think that this is the way to go in this crisis  What you’ve got are governments   that are counting on central banks to bail them out, and you need to keep pressure on those   governments to get the fiscal austerity that they need  They’ve borrowed way too much, and   they’re certainly hoping that central banks will somehow bail them out, so we’re sending exactly   the wrong signal  I can believe other central banks want to do it, but I don’t think it’s a good   idea, and I don’t think it’s a good way to manage a crisis  Again, I would prefer to review swap   November 28, 2011 27 of 40              lines at regular junctures, not at particular moments of intense turmoil in markets  That’s a better   way to go, and then you get rid of the signaling problem of a panic mode and a signal that the   central banks are all coming to the governments’ rescue  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9169,2011-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have several questions here  I am going   to proceed from the simplest to the most complex  The simplest one is For real GDP we don’t   have a confidence bound, is that intentional or is that a misprint?     I see  So you are hiding an unseemly—[Laughter]     Part of the story that you told is that some of the inflation   developments earlier this year were temporary  You said that some of the energy and food price   movements fed through to the core prices  In the past, we have always told the story that when   those kinds of prices go up, they do not feed through to the core, and so this is not something that   we need to worry about  Is this a change in the view of the staff about the pass-through to core   inflation when energy prices, in particular, go up?     —non-energy import prices—     Well, those are core prices, so it’s not really pass-through from energy   to core  They’re import core, that’s what you’re saying     And that is going to moderate?     We were talking earlier about foreign real GDP growth, and I would   like to hear more about the role of the dollar in that kind of calculation  We said foreign real   GDP would decelerate from a high rate to a somewhat lower rate  Is that a PPP calculation?  Is   that a current exchange rate calculation?  How much difference would it make if the various   exchange rates go in different directions from the ones that you have talked about?     Thank you  And, finally, on these regime-switching models on page 1   of the handout, the bottom right has an estimated stall probability of about 50 percent right now    My sense of this is that there are a lot of regime-switching models that try to estimate recession   probabilities  All of the ones I have seen have much lower probabilities than this one  Of all the   models that you could present to the Committee, you have chosen the one that has the very   highest probability  What is it about this model that says that it is a better model than the   10 others that are out there that have been published and have established track records?     I’m sure you can construct one     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  By the way, Happy Birthday, Mr   Chairman     I hope you are having a fun day     The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a modest pace   according to many District contacts  Retail sales seem to have been reasonably robust during the   first portion of the holiday season  I was impressed that even smaller stores in relatively remote   locations report an unexpected upswing in sales  Retail contacts have expressed a fair amount of   optimism for the season as a whole  Larger retailers also seem to be doing well, but expressed   more caution in interpreting the data collected so far  While major retailers are up this year,   some are down or flat as opposed to last year at this point when all major retailers were   experiencing increased sales on a year-over-year basis  Still, cautious optimism prevails among   this group as well  Transportation industry contacts seem to, likewise, feel that the business   associated with the holiday season is brisk, although perhaps not showing the large gains   experienced in 2010  Some slowdown from Asia has been noted, although an important fraction   of that may be due to year-over-year comparisons  Capital spending plans for 2012 remain on   track  District land prices are up substantially from last year  Farmers are using land as   collateral to buy new equipment  Demand for new equipment remains very strong   Turning to the national economy, I found the Tealbook overly pessimistic on the   prospects for the US  It is more downbeat than most private-sector forecasts  Certainly, the   risks from Europe are real and substantial, but those are still overweighted in my view  I do not   expect clear resolution in Europe, but I think the probability of outright meltdown is low  The   December 13, 2011 44 of 198              EU will ultimately stand behind its financial system, and the banks in particular  They will   nationalize banks if necessary, but will not do so unless forced to  On the question of outright   debt default by European nations, markets have already factored in a significant probability of   debt restructuring for some countries, and I don’t think it would be a surprise to see some   restructuring going forward as this event plays out  I do not think that either of the scenarios that   were mentioned by the staff, either that a major bank fails in Europe or that a major debt   restructuring surprises markets in a way that causes global markets to freeze up, are that likely  I   admit that there is some probability there, and it is an uncertain situation, but I still think the   probability of outright meltdown is low   The much more likely scenario is a long period of tumbling along and trying to create   better policy responses than have been put together so far  Accordingly, a reasonable forecast   would call for above-trend growth in the US next year, noting the downside risk given the   situation in Europe  But above-trend growth need not be rapid growth  The Tealbook has   marked down the estimate of potential growth, but not nearly far enough, in my view, given the   recent experience in the United States  I will call your attention, in particular, to the figure in the   middle of page 22 in the Tealbook A, “Potential and Actual Real GDP”  Because you don’t have   it in front of you, I will describe it for you  It has a potential growth line that goes through the   peak of 2007Q4 and extends the trend that existed at that time out into the indefinite future, and   it has actual real GDP growth falling below that trend and remaining below that trend out to the   end of the forecast period  I think that this is an unreasonable interpretation of the US data  It   is unreasonable to interpret the peak of the housing bubble as an economy just at potential, and   that everything that has happened since then is a falling off from that level of output  In   December 13, 2011 45 of 198              particular, it was a housing bubble  Surely this means that there was some notion of an artificial   element to the growth that occurred, especially in the 2006 to 2007 time frame   Instead, we should interpret the peak of the housing bubble as well above trend growth   and, therefore, mark down our estimates of potential growth going forward to more reasonable   levels  This is what will happen over the coming years if growth remains as slow as it is   projected to be around this table  Economists’ estimates of potential growth will be slowly   ratcheted down until they better conform with reality and move through the middle of the black   line in this picture instead of always above the black line in this picture   In the meantime, both unemployment and inflation during the last year have moved in   ways that seem inconsistent with the notion of an output gap as large as suggested by the   Tealbook estimates  As the Tealbook notes, while unemployment remains very high, it has come   down more rapidly than expected in the past year  One benchmark for thinking about this is the   behavior of unemployment following the most recent two recessions in the United States  I   would not look at earlier recessions  Those occurred 30 or more years ago—too long to provide   meaningful comparisons given the extensive changes in the labor market in the past three   decades  What happened after the 1990–91 recession and the 2001 recession regarding   unemployment?  Both of these were viewed as jobless recoveries at the time and still are today    In both cases, essentially no progress at all was made on unemployment during the first two and   a half years following the end of the recession  That is, the unemployment rate two and a half   years after the end of the recession was essentially the same—within one-tenth of 1 percentage   point—as the unemployment rate at the end of the recession   We are currently two and a half years past the end of the 2008–09 recession    Unemployment has dropped almost a full percentage point despite what we perceive to be a very   December 13, 2011 46 of 198              large output gap  This should not be happening, according to conventional models, especially   given the experience following the 1990–91 and 2001 recessions, which indicated major   structural change in the labor market relative to the earlier era   Inflation over the last year tells a similar story  Last year at this time inflation readings   were low and appeared to be falling further  Market measures of expected inflation were also   low and projected inflation to remain low  Our asset purchase program changed expectations   and sent actual inflation higher  Both core and headline inflation today are running at higher   rates year over year, closer to target or above our implicit inflation target in some cases  Again,   this should not have happened according to conventional models based on a very large output   gap   I conclude that we should consider revising our estimates of potential growth downward   more aggressively  The overly generous gap measures are distorting our view of the economy   and what is most likely to happen going forward  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, and I apologize for not being clear enough on that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I recommend adopting a wait-and-see   posture for this meeting, and, accordingly, I advocate adoption of Alternative B  The data on the   US economy have generally been stronger than had been expected during the August–  September time frame  While a recession in the US seemed possible at that juncture,   subsequent events have not confirmed that possibility  As a result, US economic prospects   appear to be on firmer footing for now   The European situation remains worrisome  But given the Committee’s past easing   actions, it seems prudent to gather more information on the likely path of events there and the   possible effects on the US  I am also a bit concerned that we do not inadvertently send a signal   that there is some kind of dramatic Fed–ECB action pending as part of some kind of quid pro   quo for governments in Europe trying to get their fiscal house in order  The markets are very   sensitive to any kind of indication in that direction, and I would be concerned that we not send a   signal, because I think there is no such plan   December 13, 2011 95 of 198              Because of the time-consistency problems I discussed at the last meeting, I do not think   further easing of monetary conditions can be achieved through mere announcements of policy   intentions far in the future  For this reason, I think that any additional policy moves have to   come through the balance sheet, and I do not recommend changing anything on that dimension at   this meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, appreciate the work of the   communications subcommittee on this issue  I generally favor increased transparency, but I   continue to harbor considerable doubts about whether this is the best way, or even a good way, to   provide increased transparency with respect to the likely future path of policy  I am referring to   the SEP enhancements here   I tend to agree with many of the points raised by President Fisher on this matter in his   memo to the Committee, and let me outline just a couple of my thoughts  While the SEP is fine   as far as it goes, when it comes to policy projections, it may be advisable for the Committee to   provide a more detailed assessment of the state of the economy  This could be done through a   US version of a quarterly inflation report as is done, for instance, in the United Kingdom  Such   a report would give a view of the many elements in the economy and the many factors that come   into making a forecast of future economic conditions  Such a forecast should be based upon the   market perception of future policy at that juncture  This is what other major central banks do  It   seems sensible to me  I see this as an appropriate way to give a complete, technical assessment   of the economy for public use at regular intervals  I say technical assessment in the sense that   you have a lot of data there, a lot of numbers on charts, as opposed to speeches and interviews   that we do, which are more qualitative   One advantage of such an approach is that the Committee could describe the future path   of policy on many dimensions, as opposed to only the funds rate path  In particular, balance   sheet policy could be described in full  This seems particularly important during the next few   years as the policy rate seems likely to remain near zero  This is an important element of what   we’re doing here, putting more emphasis back onto the funds rate just at the time when we can’t   December 13, 2011 143 of 198              really do very much with the funds rate and we are looking for other policy levers to move  That   aspect of it is a bit counterproductive   One element of President Fisher’s memo is that the policy rate forecast, as envisioned,   may not provide a reliable guide as to what the Committee will actually end up doing  For the   countries that have tried this type of policy projection approach, my understanding from the   available literature is that the path of future short-term interest rates has been no more   forecastable under the regime of releasing policy projections than it was under the regime of not   releasing policy projections   This causes me to wonder about the efficacy of this effort  We have a chart that we   sometimes pass around in St Louis  It is a chart of the Riksbank policy path  I should have   brought it with me, but I didn’t, but I’ll tell you what it is  It shows the actual policy path as it   has moved, and it shows all of the projections at each date, which look like branches on a vine,   because they are all going off at orthogonal directions from where the actual policy path went    When you use data like that and then try to figure out whether this is really enhanced   transparency about short-term interest rates in Sweden, the answer comes back from the   econometrics that it hasn’t really enhanced or changed anything, because the policy path keeps   changing in response to economic events, which is exactly what you would like it to do  Given   these considerations, my preference would be to consider this matter further before going ahead    Again, I am not against transparency, I am just not sure that this is a good way to go about   providing more transparency   On the statement of longer-run goals, I support this statement as written, and we should   go ahead and adopt it at the January meeting  This statement seems very much like the type of   statement that might appear in Chairman Bernanke’s textbook, which I regard as very much   December 13, 2011 144 of 198              reflective of the conventional wisdom or the mainstream view on these matters  In this regard, I   do not expect the statement to be particularly controversial  I know that the Chairman has been   working on adopting an appropriately flexible inflation targeting framework for some time, and I   think the adoption of this statement of longer-run goals would be an important step toward   establishing flexible inflation targeting in the US  The US is a laggard on this issue within the   central banking community internationally   One of the questions is  Should this be a living, breathing document?  I would take the   constitutional view on this, which is that you would want to make changes only with the broadest   possible support of the Committee  I would do that only once a year and with very strong   support, and change it only at that type of juncture and not be tinkering with it continually    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9194,2013-10-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  To weigh in on the communications issue   a little bit, I think markets are making assumptions about what we will do anyway, whether we   announce something or not  And so I think that’s where it becomes a little bit odd to say, “Well,   we are not going to communicate about something where markets have clear assumptions about   what we do anyway,” because all that’s doing is putting a cloud of uncertainty around what   might actually happen in the case of a default  I would say also that the Treasury has long had   the policy of not wanting to talk about this issue publicly  But there again, markets are making   assumptions about what the Treasury will do, and in particular that they will prioritize principal   and interest payments, which has really been something Treasury secretaries for a long time have   said  So I think that this idea about not communicating ahead of the crisis because you might   bring the crisis on maybe isn’t the best way to think about this, if you start thinking about the fact   that private-sector guys are making assumptions anyway  All the Treasury is doing is putting a   cloud of uncertainty about what it might do in the case of a crisis, so if we actually got into the   crisis, it would make things much worse than they would otherwise have to be  I think there is   room for some change in thinking on this if we get past this particular round so that you could at   least have some contingency planning and some statements on the table, frankly, both by the   Treasury and by the Fed here—if we could get the Treasury to come around to that view, which   it probably won’t  Then when we actually got into the crisis we would be able to mitigate it   further, or better than we otherwise would be able to  And this would be an important   component of meeting our price stability goals  This probably dovetails a little bit with President   Kocherlakota’s leading comments earlier in this meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On option 7, I do think we should consider   this as part of our toolkit  However, if we made a decision like that, it could be a momentous   decision for the Committee—arguing that we would possibly be targeting repo in the future   instead of fed funds  That’s a decision that should be made by the Committee and not by a crisis   or by the Chairman alone  So I would say that the Committee should authorize that if we get to   that  I doubt that there would be a situation that would be so dramatic that we would have to go   ahead with a decision of that magnitude without consulting the Committee   October 16, 2013 48 of 50    The other options I think we should put in our pocket for now, and just table them for the   time being  "
