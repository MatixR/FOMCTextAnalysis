844,1978-08-15,MORIARTY,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our figures come out to be very similar to  those we've heard already and for many of the same reasons  We believe the economy is slowing  but pretty balanced  Our particular figures would reflect an inflation rate of 7 percent to slightly  higher, real output at about 3 percent, and the unemployment rate at about 62      We would generally agree with all of the sentiment, too With the rates  moving up, it's an excellent time to move down on M1 because we are getting the flak one way so  let's obtain some benefit  So we would agree with the 5 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2  On the fed funds  rate 7-3/4 to 8-1/2 seems good  We would suggest maybe a move to 8 to 8-1/8  The reason for the  extra quarter above most of the [other ranges suggested] is our concern for having a little more  elbow room should the situation tighten up a little bit    "
