 Yes    Our overall outlook for foreign economic activity is little  changed from the outlook we had at the November FOMC meeting  We see  continued weakness in the near term, with a recovery taking hold during the  course of next year In 2003, foreign growth is projected at about 3-1/2 percent   Our forecast reflects importantly the projected US recovery, monetary easing  already put in place by several key foreign central banks, an assumed absence  of significant spillovers from Argentina’s troubles, and stable conditions in the  oil market  The Greenbook forecast was finalized on Wednesday, but economic  developments, of course, have continued to unfold, including in two areas that  are important to our view of the global economy   On Friday, December 7, the Japanese authorities announced that real GDP  in the third quarter fell 22 percent, at an annual rate, about what we had  estimated in the Greenbook  The decline in the third quarter was led by a large     12/11/01 13    drop in private consumption expenditures, suggesting that the household sector  is weaker than has been widely believed  Private investment held up  surprisingly well in the third quarter, but recent monthly indicators point to  sharp declines in the next few quarters  The third-quarter report and the  revisions to back data that were released at the same time have not caused us to  alter our forecast of Japanese economic activity  They have, however,  confirmed our pessimism about Japan’s prospects   Argentina’s long-running economic and financial difficulties continue  On  December 1, the Argentine authorities announced a series of measures intended  to slow the drain of funds from the banking system and from the country’s  foreign exchange reserves while the government conducts a restructuring of its  debts These measures include limits on cash withdrawals from banks and  controls on transfers of funds abroad  Late last Wednesday, the IMF  determined that Argentina had not made sufficient progress in its adjustment  program to be eligible for the $1-1/4 billion loan tranche that Argentina had  been counting on as a means of funding some upcoming debt payments   Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo countered with talk of  suspending payments on debts  Subsequent discussions between Argentine  officials and the IMF reportedly have produced an agreement on an additional  $4 billion in fiscal restraint in 2002 Cavallo, of course, has to deliver, and he is  likely to face considerable political opposition  Details of the new fiscal plans  are expected to be released today or tomorrow   Financial markets so far have taken these developments more or less in  stride Argentine spreads rose about 100 basis points between last Wednesday  and this morning  More important, at least from the point of view of the staff’s  forecast, Brazilian and Mexican spreads actually edged down during that same  period Equity markets in Brazil and Mexico have been firm   There are many reasons to believe that Argentina’s financial troubles will  be relatively contained There has been a very long run-up to this crisis, and  indications are that investors have anticipated it, have diversified their risks, and  are now--and have been for a while--differentiating among emerging market  economies  Moreover, most important emerging market economies now have  somewhat flexible exchange rate regimes, which eliminates one area of  vulnerability  There are, of course, many reasons to worry as well  Emerging  market economies have a history of crises; policies in these economies are far  from perfect; and, given the current delicate state of global economic  conditions, emerging market economies at the moment would seem to be  particularly susceptible to adverse shocks to confidence    I think it’s safe to say that it is a major risk  We have the Japanese   economy coming back a bit toward the end of the period, mainly because world economic growth   picks up The Japanese do not yet appear to be fully ready to take the kinds of measures that need to   be taken to remedy their problems  We see the problems sort of simmering there for the indefinite   future I’m afraid, and certainly through the forecast period
