 [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we won't know for sure what the second quarter looked like even in next week's numbers At this point, the incoming expenditure flow numbers don't point clearly to an upward or a downward revision For the third quarter, I suppose if we were to recalculate today, our best guess is that our number would be fractionally higher; I would say that it would not necessarily differ significantly from the second quarter But, just on the basis of the retail sales data, we could see a number that would be closer to 3 percent   Well, if we dissect the forecast, the deceleration is primarily in the consumption area and, in part, that reflects better food prices, as I noted And, unless something goes seriously awry, the increase in energy prices in the second half will be distinctly slower than in the first half We may get a little    8/18/87  bulge in the near term, but for the second half as a whole, we are expecting considerable slowing Also, we have been moderately encouraged by the trend in the non-energy services area for consumer expenditures; it seems to have decelerated a bit over the last 6-12 months, so that has carried through for a little while longer in our forecast   Of course, part of that surge in consumption expenditures--and certainly a large part--is in the automobile area where, to get that surge, they're going to have to give some concessions in the way of lower interest rates or a more generous rebate program   Well, I did try to highlight some of the geographic disparities in the chart show [presentation to the Committee] last month, where I showed that, regionally, the unemployment rates are substantially different and we have been seeing different wage trends Clearly, the Northeast is the area where the average unemployment rate has been distinctly lower, and we have not been seeing the wage deceleration, judging by the employment cost index, for example, over the past couple of years Historically, obviously, the economy has never been perfectly level We try to compress this into one statistic, but there are always disparities in unemployment rate levels At the present time, the disparity might be a little greater than it typically has been But, when you get into the question of where the pressure points are going to be, this is hard to say Clearly, there is some slack in some of the prime heavy industry areas of the country On the other hand, some of the industries that may benefit from the improvement in trade are located in areas of the country where the labor markets are a little tighter For example, some industries in the Northeast will probably be benefitting from increased competitiveness We approach this question with a degree of humility We can't state precisely what the natural rate of unemployment is; we assign a fairly broad band, and we recognize that the question of bottlenecks or fortuitous precise matching of the increase in demand to the areas that have the most slack could create some variation in those spots Basically, though,    8/18/87  we think the anecdotal evidence is there It's sort of a Sports Illustrated story Once you're on the cover, it's the kiss of death The Business Week type of headline that we are now in a crunch is overblown a bit We have a sense that the labor market has tightened, though we have not seen the pressures on wages in--   I think if we were to identify the areas in which we would be most likely to get some upside surprises, that is one Our forecast for this year for nominal business fixed investment continues to be below what the surveys were indicating a few months ago, and it's clear that orders are picking up Basically, we have a    8/18/87  forecast, though, that seems in line with historical patterns, giving consideration to the cost of capital and what presumably would be a rather modest accelerator effect here We don't have output growth on the whole as all that strong, so we have a moderate increase in fixed investment But that certainly is one of the areas where a surprise would be less shocking to us   If I may turn briefly to Mr Morris' question, one thing that we've had in our minds as a sort of cautionary note on these orders figures and so on, is that we can't tell how much of that might be potential exports; so, at this point those numbers need to be read cautiously Our view on the oil situation, as I tried to suggest, is that we could see a downside risk Evidently, there has been a considerable move to stockpile oil If we get into another one of these swings where there's a movement toward destocking, and the OPEC swing producers don't cut back promptly enough, we could see at least a temporary drop in crude oil prices, maybe to an even lower level than you've suggested But, basically, we think we have perceived, since the end of last year, a reasonable enough coherence in the OPEC countries in containing production within levels that enable them to sustain prices at their target level So we tend to think that any crunch is likely to be relatively short-lived and would, perhaps, introduce some [unintelligible] in prices of final products, petroleum products But we would be quite surprised to see something that was permanent enough to produce a significantly lower trend in energy prices over the forecast horizon   Mr Chairman, of course, [unintelligible] Governor Seger, if you wanted to adjust your thinking on this in terms of our rule--   But in terms of our rule-of-thumb, $5 a barrel is worth something like a percentage point on the CPI over the course of the year, and significantly less than that, obviously, in GNP prices, in domestic output prices   Effectively   That's the key factor   Well, maybe we didn't successfully answer this, but the productivity numbers are being bounced around by our expectation of what the timing of Labor Day will do to the hours numbers in September We feel that this is a sound enough arithmetic point, in terms of our understanding of how the data have run over the years We have a very low September level in these numbers, which affects the average level of hours in the fourth quarter; so we have this gyration of 2 percent growth in productivity in the third quarter going down to 1/2 percent in the fourth On the compensation side, we have the beginnings of an acceleration in compensation over the second half of this year, but there isn't a big third- to fourth-quarter jump; the big jump there is in the first quarter next year when higher payroll taxes take effect   Well, I'm not sure what kind of analysis you have in mind It's clear that it has been a very significant factor For the year as a whole, we have energy prices contributing 2-1/4 percent, roughly, to the acceleration in the prices of consumption and investment goods It's clear, though, that the first-half acceleration in consumer prices is largely in energy prices; food prices haven't done so well, but that's a rather small contributor to the first-half acceleration; it's primarily energy prices   Short- and intermediate-term business credit?   Well, part of it, we think, is the move to longer-term financing after we had an interruption of the flow, so to speak, when rates backed up earlier this spring The rates came down a little, and maybe [unintelligible] corporate treasurers began to think that they shouldn't be waiting for still more decline They seem to have come to market in significant size As best we can sort these things out, that's the one thing we can put our finger on that the data would seem to support very clearly We don't see it as reflecting a sudden drop-off in inventory accumulation, for example; the data just don't show that   I haven't had an opportunity to commit all this to memory yet You're focusing on which year?   Basically, we assumed, in addition to some Congressional action that has already occurred, that something akin to their program will be adopted--an action which gives you on the order of $35 billion in deficit reduction That's on a par with the Congressional budget resolution number as well The outlay number for 1988 that they have now is $8 billion a month above their January estimate Obviously, the revenue is the other thing, and the receipts number is $7-1/2 billion below the January estimate That's largely a reflection of the downward revision in their forecast of corporate income tax receipts That's the major [unintelligible] On the outlay side, they have had to respond to the higher interest rates they have seen They're expecting somewhat higher interest payments and they're also responding to the higher inflation that we've had, which will feed through to a larger cost-of-living adjustment for social security recipients and federal pension recipients These are the major features of the changes of the baseline for the 1988 budget number   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I can be relatively brief this morning [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the greater strength is clearly on the export side As we go out through the forecast period to the end of next year, we have very modest increases in imports; indeed, we would expect that real merchandise imports, not only [nominal] merchandise imports, will be going down slightly, largely in response to the past and prospective depreciation of the dollar We are also anticipating, of course, that domestic spending--consumption, in particular--will be growing rather slowly, so we won't be sucking in great volumes of imports because of the continuation of the kind of demands we have seen previously   That's very difficult to get a handle on The anecdotal evidence--or if you want to characterize it in more solid terms than that, the kinds of survey information that are gathered by McGraw Hill and others--suggests that vis-a-vis historical experience, a distinctly above-average percentage of this planned spending is designated as being for replacement, modernization, and so on Clearly, in many industries there is plenty of capacity; in others there is less And one can identify some areas of significant expansion of capacity, with additional plants being built But, generally, as we are looking at it, the major thrust will be on continuing to reduce costs, to modernize product line, and so on   For materials, the lead times have been lengthening I think, implicit in your comment, is the question of whether they have increased to levels that are not comfortable, and I suspect that the strategy in many firms has been to run with a little tighter capacity than they might have in the past And they may not be uncomfortable with what they are seeing In the capital goods area, average lead times don't seem to have lengthened much yet; and that is probably consonant with the evidence that the capacity utilization in equipment producing industries is not especially high-- not what one sees in some nondurable material areas, for example   I take it you are going to zero on the deficit reduction action with that   I think that is probably a little higher than our normal econometric results would give us, but it is clearly the direction in which we would go At this point, the $25 billion looks like a reasonable ballpark figure, given what is being discussed currently in a compromise--a Gramm-Rudman revision that would be something like $23 billion, with no loan sales or that sort of thing But I suppose there are still some risks that it would be less than what we have and the result might well be somewhere in between that zero and the $25 billion that we have   Well, the forecast isn't generated by a model, per se As we go through and estimate the income flows, we definitely do take account of the interest rate path that we've assumed and projected And we do have substantial growth in personal interest income over the projection period   I guess I wasn't clear The assumption is that the dollar will decline further over the forecast period For our purposes, we put in a straight line path that averages about 10 percent, at an annual rate   It isn't necessary that there be a precise course We put in a smooth trajectory that moves the federal funds rate, for example, into the 8 to 8-1/2 percent range by next spring   We would be approaching it by the end of the first quarter I don't want to be too precise about this If there were flatness over the next few months and more increase later on, we wouldn't be able to distinguish the economic effects in the forecast for the period as a whole But we do have a gradual rise here   There's a difference in our forecast between the deflator and the fixed-weight GNP measure In the fixed-weight index, we have 3-1/4 percent for the third quarter and 3-1/2 percent for the fourth, whereas there's a deceleration from 3-1/4 percent in the third quarter down to 2-1/2 percent in the deflator The difference there is the peculiarities of weighting shifts that occur in the GNP deflator; and the decrease in oil imports, which have a relatively low weight in the deflator, actually tends to depress the GNP deflator relative to the fixed-weight measure Basically, we have a fairly steady second-half inflation, as we see it; it's lower than in the first half, in large part because of lower food and energy price inflation   In some underlying sense, there is a fairly stable picture between the first and second half, but that's in this game of stripping away food and energy prices, which obviously are affected by special nonmacroeconomic influences in the short run Of course, there are peculiar things that affect other sectors, as well But, basically we have a fairly stabilized underlying trend, and some increase next year in the rate of price inflation   Some people would take that as an indicator of the underlying rate of inflation And yes, we do, as compensation accelerates significantly next year In that sense, the underlying trend is picking up   It's purely conjectural at this point Various econometric models would suggest that, over the relevant horizon here, you are probably dealing with an interest rate elasticity of about 1 We have a rise in mortgage rates from around 10-1/2 percent to something in the high 11's, [an increase of] roughly 10 percent We have roughly a 10 percent decline in housing starts, from 16 million to something around the 145 million area In that sense, it's well in line with the historical patterns The other thing that provides some comfort--   Well, I'm looking at it in the aggregate clearly, they are both to be affected by the change in interest rates Looking at it from another angle, mortgage rates are back up to levels we saw in 1985, and we had considerably higher housing starts then--in the 17 million area Now, we've probably gone through some catchup period in home ownership, but that number seems fairly reasonable to us, looking at the response we've seen just so far to the substantial increase in mortgage rates It hasn't made the market fall apart entirely We may not have it quite right, but this is a stab at what we think is a normal response   Well, clearly, we felt that we would be seeing much of that response by this summer, before we even elevated our rate forecast beyond what we had earlier We only had a modest further decline below the 16 million level in our previous forecast As we have taken the mortgage rates up more, we have lowered the housing starts further It's very difficult to say As you noted, there are other influences at work, and there may still be some adjustment to the tax law changes There are still some problems of high vacancy rates in home rental properties in various parts of the country Again, when you look at house prices, there too, the evidence suggests that, at least in many markets, there's still a pretty robust demand at these interest rates And there is just no anecdotal evidence to suggest to us that we are way off the mark in our assessment of demand positions Even the survey information suggests pretty high numbers  -10-    9/22/87  of people whose attitude is that this is a good time to buy a house That may be surprising, but that seems to be the pattern   One of the main comforts we can find in the numbers is that it looks to us like the trend in real exports has been quite strong thus far And based on our exchange rate projection and the assumption that there are probably still lags in the order and delivery process, that means that some of the improvement in exports is still not fully evident We think that we are forecasting, basically, a continuation of patterns that are already perceptible In some respects, I think a greater concern, given our outlook, would be that we get both the improvement in the net exports somehow, and also get greater domestic demand growth That puts still greater pressures on resources than some people would have thought in the past We have two years now, in our forecast, of consumption growth that is really subpar historically So, in a sense, we have these things put together in a way that gives you a rather smooth adjustment to the picture   That's what characterizes our outlook and I think some of the comments around the table suggest that there is a hopeful aspect of this--that everything falls nicely into place   In other words, the dollar--I wasn't clear what--   Well, it's difficult to dissect this precisely, but I think we are dealing mostly with a process that looks at the real first, infers from that the pressures on resources, which then feed back through a short-run Phillips curve relation to the wage and price side That's a stylistic characterization   I might just note that, while industrial production is growing much more rapidly than we think GNP is growing this quarter--and the IP numbers must be regarded as still quite tentative--that growth is well within the range of variation in that relationship And for the year as a whole, the gap is rather moderate So, at this point, we don't see a big disparity in the signals coming from the industrial sector or industrial production estimates and GNP, particularly when you start [unintelligible] GNP goods output that most reasonably can be compared in industrial production  -14-    9/22/87   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, both of them were down The Michigan survey's sentiment index was down, as President Morris noted, in the period after October 19th Basically, they had about a third of their month's sample in that period and they looked at that group alone Obviously, the statistical reliability is less, but they felt that the sharp drop was statistically significant That put the level well below the plateau we have been at, and that is the clear distinction from the picture that one gets in looking at the very limited poll that the Conference Board did after October 19th That showed a drop, but it was only a small departure from a very strong uptrend in the last several months; it seems to have reflected people's perceptions that the job opportunities were very good, and that propels that index directly in a way that the Michigan index doesn't reflect   Clearly, one of the things in our forecast that all along has been a key factor affecting the pattern of output growth happened we believe, in large part, because of the exchange rate depreciation Partly because of the oil price movements earlier, we believed that we would have some erosion of real disposable income  -11-    11/3/87  growth and thus some damping of consumer demand, which would release the resources to support the substantial improvement in real net exports I might just say that the pattern we are projecting is not a departure from what we have been seeing over the past year or so Rather consistently, PCE prices have been rising faster than GNP prices in a period in which real disposable income growth has been considerably slower than real GNP growth We have a continuing decline of the dollar in our forecast and we have a continuation of this pattern of relative price movements We looked at the historical record We think there are perceptible relative price movements that can be seen during a period of the dollar's appreciation--an interruption of a previous trend We have seen this ratio of PCE prices to GNP prices rising rather markedly over the past year and we expect that to continue Clearly, if somehow this didn't occur, there would be implications for income shares and output patterns that could significantly affect the outlook We think this really has been a perceptible trend recently and that the conditions that brought that about will be prevailing still in the future   If I could just cite some figures Going back to the third quarter of 1986, the PCE fixed-weight price measure rose 1 percentage point faster than the GNP prices; in the fourth quarter it was 07 faster; in the first quarter of 1987 it was 12 percentage points faster; in the second quarter it was 11 faster; and in the third quarter it was 08 faster We have a more moderate relative movement in the forecast than we have been experiencing We also have looked at outside forecasts and, generally, they have this relative movement in a similar range; some of them have it less than ours, some of them have it considerably more than ours When we look at the fixed investment prices and what might be going on there, there may be some wrinkles in terms of the construction of the index As I understand it, that is constructed largely out of PPI data, which would be the domestically produced goods You might not have the direct kind of import price measurement in the way these numbers are    11/3/87  constructed as you do with consumer goods, which would sample imports directly as well That's a minor factor   We would certainly be happy to consult further with your staff In the second half of last year, energy prices in PCE were falling rapidly   Well, I guess we differ on this We have had some discussion with your staff who raised the question with us and--   Obviously, as you know, it's a confluence of two things One is how fast industrial output is growing, which is quite sensitive to the mix of output in the economy; and the improvement in trade is reflected in growth of industrial production and a manufacturing component that is stronger than overall GNP growth by a point or more next year The other component in this calculation, obviously, is an assessment of capacity growth Business fixed investment, which had been weak for a while, rebounded in the last couple of quarters; some of this rebound reflected a spurt in automobile sales which presumably will not be sustained Of course, it takes a little while for growth in PDE to feed through the substantial increases in the stock of capital goods We have a relatively weak investment outlook, so from that side of things we wouldn't see tremendous additions to capacity over the coming year We have a relatively moderate growth in capacity--about 3 percent or a bit below--   It's higher than GNP but it is in line with the growth of industrial output and slightly below the manufacturing growth rate So we get this very slight inching up--it probably should not be called inching but milimetering up--of the capacity utilization rate Assessing capacity utilization is always difficult As you know, we recently put out our annual revisions; the revisions didn't really adjust the overall level very much but there were noticeable changes in some of the industries We have to be alert to  -13-    11/3/87  whatever we can pick up on what is going on in actual capacity The linkage between investment and actual capacity is not all that tight   Well, I hope so Of course, to the extent that they are currently lean and have not been hoarding extra labor, as there are dips in output, there is not going to be as much room to reduce employment Of course, once we have determined how aggressive they are, then we would [know more about] how persistent the effect of weakness will be We have distinctly slower employment growth in our forecast than we have been experiencing; and we do have the unemployment rate going up, read literally here, 04 of a point over the next couple of quarters from the 59 percent level we saw in the past month It's hard to say how far this would go once the process is underway; but our forecast is one in which we have only a brief interruption of the recent growth path And under those circumstances, we presume they would not have unloaded tremendous amounts of [unintelligible] labor   Many of them clearly have more flexibility than in the past because of their use of workers who were not strictly on their payrolls but were hired through temporary help firms So, those workers probably would be laid off during--   Mr Corrigan has probably perceived one of the sharpest jumps in unemployment   Well, it's very difficult to assess precisely what the demand and production adjustments are going to be in this short period of time As I suggested in my remarks, we built in a fairly prompt response of consumption and we also built in a fairly prompt response of production The inventory accumulation we have is a combination of the automobile inventory rebuilding that is occurring as sales have dropped off after the special incentive period, and the automakers' having moved up their production a bit from the very low third-quarter level We also, though, have some significant accumulation outside that sector Some of that is involuntary but, going into the early part of this quarter, some is still voluntary in the manufacturing sector where it appeared that inventories were very lean and that there was some desire to at least keep the stocks in line with sales So, I think it's a mixture of voluntary and involuntary elements that leads to some adjustment early next year in production But, we have assumed a relatively smooth path for developments in the next several months   Apart from the auto situation   Well, we don't rely totally on our econometric models, of course Sometimes we depend on them very little when the circumstances suggest that there are just tremendous departures from the historical norms--shocks that would disturb recent trends But, I guess in this case I'd say that they are reasonably supportive of this kind of view It's clear, though, that there are downside risks in this forecast, should the stock market have a more dramatic effect than we have gauged it to have at this point   I did try to highlight the fact that this might have greater shock value than it otherwise would have, if that's possible   I think the amount of courage that is required is far less for the staff than for the policymakers   [Statement--see Appendix]   Mr Chairman, I might just apprise the Committee of the data made available this morning One is the leading indicators series, which shows an increase of 9 percent in February, compared with a 11 percent decline the previous month We also have new home sales which were up 20 percent in February, but to a level that's just around the fourth-quarter average That's consistent with the other housing data we see   It wasn't significant, but it was 3   The current number for the fourth quarter on nonfarm inventories is $57-1/2 billion, at an annual rate We had $53-1/2 billion in the Greenbook, which went out before the GNP release It's not very much different; there's a slightly different level of auto inventories primarily In our forecast, the rate of inventory accumulation declines by $20 billion in the first quarter to around $34-1/2 billion That is, in a sense, a significant drag on output growth in the first quarter, and it occurred basically in the auto industry We had, essentially, a $20 billion dollar swing in the rate of inventory investment in the auto industry and that accounted for something on the order of a percentage point on GNP But the surprise for us--as the data look at this point, and that's what we're building into our forecast--is that outside of automobiles the rate of inventory accumulation does not seem to have slowed in the first quarter In the last forecast, I think we put in something on the order of a $10 billion decline in the rate of non-auto inventory accumulation So, in that sense, to the extent that businesses weren't as anxious to reduce stocks, you could view that as something of a plus for the economy in the first quarter relative to our expectation   I think we feel we are in a zone where there is considerable uncertainty The capacity utilization rates are not even across industries We already have seen price pressures in some industries that we think are a function not just of the dollar decline but of actual pressures on capacity, with a backlog in orders that has built up There are many manufacturers who have their customers on allocation They seem to have been rather restrained, to date, in their pricing In fact, in some cases, they could probably be more aggressive but don't seem to be moving that way because of longer-run considerations, such as their customer relationships and so on But the kind of increase we've had in capacity utilization doesn't signal to us a major change in that picture At this point, we think there are risks If we were to write down a still higher number, our degree of discomfort, or our worry about pressures, could materially change   That's a hypothesis I don't want to test!   I think that's what is suggested by our forecast, but there is uncertainty about many elements of this One is on the labor markets side As I suggested, our work to date has failed to find convincing evidence that the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is lower than we currently are The range of our estimates is from around where we are to a higher level Others have looked at these things differently and have come up with conclusions that may give us a bit more room on the downside So, for the labor market side, maybe it isn't quite the razor's edge that this kind of forecast suggests On the capacity side, [unintelligible] just how things turn out in the mix of demands and how rapidly expansion of capacity occurs in the particular industries where demand is strongest So, I would characterize the picture as being a little mushier than these precise numbers suggest; but we do think that we're pretty close in our bottom line assessment   In the models, it generally would be constructed with some discontinuity on this, so when you get there, then things emerge But we also know we can't pinpoint it Looking at different variations on structural models and different estimating periods and so on, we can get a very broad range of estimates   For last year, it's a matter of interpretation to some degree To put it in mathematical terms, there are other terms in those equations One of them would be expectations about prices, and that could have given us the surprise we had last year, as opposed to the natural rate being different than we anticipated in our models That is something we have taken into account in our forecast, in that individuals may not be setting their expectations as high as the recent inflation experience would suggest is necessary to maintain real wages, because they are fearful about losing their jobs in the very competitive international marketplace particularly   It could look that way   It depends on which terms you want to adjust here, and it's not entirely clear That's one way In fact, if you back out the natural rate from our recent experience it suggests that what we built into our forecast--if you take the price expectations being developed in the usual way--could be a natural rate that is around 4 - 45 percent That is the calculation; but we don't really think that the natural rate is that low So, we think there is something else going on in terms of the expectations of labor and management at this stage [unintelligible] consistent with our forecast   I guess it's a question of whether the glass is half empty or half full--how much of these price increases you see coming in materials and so on that you view as part of a broader phenomenon or as one-time relative price adjustments But the list of items that purchasing managers report in short supply has lengthened considerably; and there seem to be lots of reports of supplies being tight and various materials and components [unintelligible]   They don't seem to be terribly anxious about getting goods They're not ordering very much farther in advance than a quarter So, your bottom line of there being some areas where we should look at this carefully is, I think, [right] We think things have tightened up, but it's not clear to us that there is imminent danger of broad acceleration   What we do see is a mixture of things We have capacity utilization at the point where product markets have gotten tighter; there is more pricing discretion on the part of many manufacturers If we do continue to get the effects on import prices from the decline of the dollar, if wages do begin to pick up as a lagged adjustment to the price increases that we have already seen and the lower rate of unemployment, that is an environment where I think pricing could firm considerably   Well, I guess we have the usual forecast We think that thrift earnings might be cyclical [unintelligible]--I'm sorry, I just don't have that   Do you mean April to July? Because we don't know--   Thank you, Mr Chairman Ted will be following me with some comments on this morning's trade data as well as some remarks on the implications of recent foreign exchange market developments  [Statement by Mr Prell--see Appendix]  [Statement by Mr Truman--see Appendix]   If we look at the next couple of quarters, real BFI accounts for a third of the GNP growth in the third and the fourth quarters Over the course of next year, it accounts for about 20 percent of the growth   It's clearly a key dynamic income-generated sector in this forecast   As I noted, we now are looking for inventories, at least over the second half of this year, to be positively contributing to GNP growth And we are looking for it to be significantly in the manufacturing area, related in part to this durable goods strength in business equipment in particular   It's the bulk of it--if not more than that if we are right in our forecast of negative nonresidential structures over the second half and essentially flat next year So the whole story is producers durable equipment And a large part of that story is our reading of the current trend in the computer and office equipment area, which has been growing very rapidly While we had it tailing off noticeably over the forecast period, it remains a strong element in the forecast   I think that would overstate the contribution that makes The PDE deflator is declining--   Indeed, but looking at the total PDE number--   The total PDE deflator is declining at something over 2 percent a year in this forecast Given that we have PDE rising at 14 percent this year and 6 percent next year, it isn't the whole story by any means   It's not so much I think the fixed-weight as the question of whether you want to really deflate those computer expenditures at that rate   I don't--   I think the other thing to consider is that, in a sense, your potential and actual growth would be lowered by the same token Your measured real growth would be slower and your potential real growth would be slower, but resource utilization quotations in the short run wouldn't be materially different So, I think we are getting distortions of some of the numbers, in effect, by this base- to-base year against which we are measuring PDE prices--computer prices in particular But I think the real crux of the matter is that no matter how you slice it, we are at levels of resource utilization much higher than they had been or than we had expected That's what's really driving our inflation forecast   Well, if you were to assert that GNP growth has been overstated by the use of these 1982 price deflators, then presumably potential GNP growth is also being commensurately overstated So it doesn't give you any more room to maneuver I think it's important to have some handle on what's happening with the  -10-    8/16/88  capital stock for one's assessment of productive potential But that's a much longer-horizon issue This is sort of like those other questions relating to the possible mismeasurement of output whether it's [unintelligible] or anything else that affects both actual and potential output [unintelligible] And it doesn't do much for the gap   Well, this gets into very complicated, almost metaphysical, issues I'm not sure that there really is a problem in the sense of overestimating   I'm not sure; it depends on the question   We've thought about that I must say the amount of quantitative work we have done to date on this is not as much as I think we want to do over time It's hard to get a fix on the household portfolio Our assessment is that probably the amount of what I might call rate-sensitive assets does not exceed the amount of rate-sensitive liabilities in quite the same proportion as it previously did But, on balance, an increase in interest rates tends  -11-    8/16/88  to augment household cash flow We don't think the changes that have occurred really would make a big difference in the responses of the household sector in the short run But it is a new ball game to some extent, and there are distributional questions that we don't have a real good fix on So I think it's something worth giving further thought and investigation to But our basic assessment is that it doesn't make a big difference   Well, there're two things I should say One, the quarterly pattern between now and the end of next year reflects in significant measure the quarterly pattern of food price increases, which are strong until next spring and then are tailing off toward the end of the year The second thing is that it reflects the particular pattern of oil prices and energy prices that we have assumed in this forecast And that is an element that contributes to inflation in the first part of next year, after having been essentially flat in the second half of this year So the bulge there is somewhat misleading More fundamentally, we think the trend is one of acceleration at least through much of next year, and then tending into 1990 with an ever so slight upward tilt to compensation and underlying price trends We assume that interest rates will continue to move up over the next couple of quarters and we essentially have that 9-1/2 percent area funds rate being reached by early next spring   Again, I express that we recognize the uncertainty about these things and wouldn't want to be excessively precise in our characterization of what is involved in this forecast But basically, we have the rates getting up to that level by the second quarter of next year and staying there   We've made only a modest downward revision in housing starts as we get out into 1989 some ways We've made some upward adjustment in the mortgage rate forecast Mortgage rates have been running a bit tighter to the Treasuries than they had previously We have mortgage rates getting up towards 12 percent in the second half and very possibly around 12 percent   Nominally, for the current quarter, we take the existing funds rate as given through the end of the--   Yes, but basically for the GNP forecast, we are more interested in the drift over the next several quarters  -30-    8/16/88   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   I might note that this morning the Commerce Department released revised second-quarter GNP figures where the second-quarter growth rate was revised down from 33 to 30 percent    9/20/88  That would still leave, after the drought effects, growth in the nonfarm economy in excess of 3-1/2 percent in the first half   Sure Both the deflator and the fixed-weight price index were revised upward The fixed-weight price measure was raised from a 47 percent to a 50 percent increase The deflator largely reflected this; it was up from 51 to 55 percent It's a little bit of an unfavorable mix shift   We don't have the full detail yet, and we haven't had a chance to talk to people about enough of the details We're flying a bit blind at this point   Yes There were, of course, small revisions in a number of categories The most dramatic revision in growth rate was in nonresidential structures As we had noted in the Greenbook, the construction-put-in-place showed a substantial revision in June So this isn't a shock There was a modest upward revision in consumer spending There was a small change in net exports There were just small changes sprinkled around   We still have the federal funds rate rising to something in the vicinity of 9-1/2 percent by next spring We have the long Treasury bond rate moving a bit above 10 percent   No, but our thought is that even after we have absorbed those, that we will not open up enough slack, so to speak, or reduce the pressures on the economy enough, to relieve the inflationary pressures Therefore, we need to hold growth below potential for a period of time What we have in our forecast is a very slight shortfall of actual growth from potential and very slight easing pressures on resources And we think that, given the underlying tendencies in the economy, we are going to need a bit more restraint to keep things under control over the last two or three quarters of 1989   I don't know that we have an optimum growth rate Basically, we sense that the pressures on resources are too great at this point to hold the inflation rate down to recent levels And we feel some easing [of those pressures] is necessary We believe the trend of real output growth is somewhere around 2-1/2 percent Therefore, we believe that we've got to grow something under that in order to ease those pressures We recognize the uncertainties about where the natural rate of unemployment is, if that's the operative concept We recognize that the composition of activity can make a difference of-- This is a rough judgment, ultimately; I don't want to get too precise about it, but basically we think we need some additional restraint to get the economy below potential, and we believe that that probably is necessary   I think I cited a number of 2-1/2 percent, Governor Angell, as what we believed potential GNP growth is Therefore, it depends how fast you want to get the inflation rate down If--   Well, you're asking me to make a policy judgment, a subjective judgment about the short-run costs and benefits of a policy you have in mind What we have tried to make is a positive statement That if you want to avert some acceleration of inflation, we need to reduce the pressures on resources The more that is done, the greater the chances are you will see no acceleration at all in the underlying inflation rate next year and that you will be able to tip it down noticeably in 1990 I think it will take more than we have built in here to make a decided move towards restoring a disinflationary trend by 1990   Again, I don't feel I'm in a position to declare the best adjustment I suspect, going around the table here, the policymakers would have some different views about the risks they would want to take and how rapidly they would want to move to bring down the inflation rate If I were to aim at the kind of inflation trajectory that you've outlined--declines of 1 percent a year in the inflation rate--I would suggest that you would need a substantially greater tightening You would need to bring growth down substantially from what we have in order to get back on that track I don't think we're on that track now, and I think you'd need substantially greater restraint--probably close to or even into recessionary conditions--in order by 1990 to have an inflation trend down to 3 percent at an annual rate   We're looking for around 9-1/2 percent Again, I don't want to be too precise   A significant increase from where we are   Just about   As you know, some of this extreme flattening is a very recent phenomenon Earlier in the year, you were getting more substantial increases in long rates as short rates rose I guess underlying this projection, at least in my mind, is a sense that the markets may have overdone things recently and that part of this may be the lack of long bond authority and unusual tightness in the long end of the market at this point But we do have what would be a fairly substantial rise in long rates along with the short rate increases in this forecast, partly on the presumption that the market will be surprised to some degree by what it takes in order to damp inflationary pressures They would come around more to our view; there's a strict internal consistency in these forecasts   If the rates don't rise--, they might not rise as much for a number of reasons One could be a change in inflationary expectations We may have had some of that recently, where the apparent willingness of the Fed to move earlier than some would have thought may have helped to hold down long-range inflation expectations To the extent that that's going on, you're perhaps not getting a significant real rate effect and thus the damping influence on demand If events transpire that cause real rates not to rise as much as we would anticipate in this forecast, then we might have a different outcome where investment demand may be sustained a bit more than we have [in the forecast] There are innumerable scenarios that one could draw where the movement in long rates would have different implications   You're saying that if the flattening occurs entirely because of reduced inflation expectations--   It would depend in the short run in part on whether it was a change in the long-run perception of what inflationary trends would be and in part on whether it was a reflection of a sense that the economy might be headed toward recession Clearly, in other historical experience we've seen a marked flattening of the yield curve just before downturns in the economy If we were to move up short rates as much as we're talking about here and the long rate didn't rise at all--that would be a very steep downward slope And I suspect it would only occur in    9/20/88  circumstances where people would perceive that there was a significant likelihood of a near-term weakening in the economy   That's basically what we're assuming It's very difficult to psych out the market at this point One can come up with a number of alternative hypotheses about why the market has behaved in just the way it has recently--in interpreting recent news and so on Another factor is the dollar situation, in terms of our longer-run external position and what we think ultimately we need to correct that That's probably a factor that's going to be less favorable as we move along in the projection period And, as I suggested, we're presuming that the market will perceive that a greater degree of restraint is necessary to rein in inflationary pressures than perhaps it currently is They will come around to [unintelligible]   Right   I hope I wasn't too persuasive because there is a range of uncertainty about our forecast For example, one of those areas of uncertainty obviously is the sensitivity of investment demand to what has already occurred in interest rate movements and the dollar There's been some perception already that the future competitiveness of some US industry will be less than people thought previously; perhaps the momentum of investment might not be as strong as we have in this forecast Fiscal policy we have interpreted as providing a degree of restraint on aggregate demand That is always difficult to interpret and it's conceivable that our underlying policy-action assumptions could turn out to be wrong And we could have a greater degree of restraint being applied, damping activity more than [unintelligible] Consumer spending has fairly consistently surprised us in this expansion by its strength, and as this has occurred, consumer debt levels have risen We've outlined for you what we think the cash flow consequences are of rising rates on households We feel this isn't a big problem, but again one would have to admit the possibilty of some surprise there The oil price situation is something imponderable and that's a very difficult    9/20/88  situation to sort out, because it has underlying aggregate demand effects if we were to get a change in the price from our assumption I feel reasonably comfortable with the inventory situation, but there too, there may be some pockets in the retail level that could exert more of a drag on output in coming months than we have [assumed] But I don't see that as a very great problem So, I think there are any number of areas across the economy where conceivably things might turn out weaker than we have   Well, I'm not sure that that recession would appear soon enough to greatly affect the discussions about the 1990 budget But it's conceivable that, in your hypothesis, the picture could change and then one has to make a political judgment There are many people, obviously, who would question the ability of the Congress to institute significant further deficit reduction measures if the economy appeared to be weakening And the actual budget deficit in those circumstances could become very large in 1990, which in effect would exacerbate the long-run problem by adding further to the level of debt So, it's a pretty dicey situation I think it's clear that they will have an easier time putting together a budgetary package that makes substantial ongoing progress in reducing the deficit in an environment where the economic outlook appears to be reasonably satisfactory   Basically, if we strip away farm and strip away autos, which are in good shape now--though there may be some accumulation over the remainder of the year But I think that's a sort of a separable situation Outside of that area, we're looking for a bit faster accumulation than we saw in the spring over the remainder of this year and then some slight tapering off It's not a dynamic factor in this projection And as the Chairman has pointed out, in an environment where business activity is fairly robust and capacity is getting tighter and prices are rising fairly rapidly for materials and so on, it's not inconceivable that at some point manufacturers will become more aggressive than we've put into this forecast We have manufacturers increasing their inventories over the coming months; but there could be an outside risk, as I noted in my    9/20/88  comments, that if things got out of hand on that score it could add perhaps to greater near-term strength in the economy But it would set us up perhaps for more of a shakeout later on in 1989   [Statement--see Appendix]   We wouldn't have expected the lower long rates that we've had to have any significant influence on recent economic performance So, I wouldn't want to connect those things quite the way I think you were suggesting It does appear to us that the decline in long rates reflects some reduced concerns about how robust aggregate demand will be and thus what the future pressures will be in credit markets Our assumption is that if things unfold as we are suggesting they will, there will be an element of surprise for the market They will, therefore, tend to raise their expectations somewhat about the future course of interest rates And with such expectations, we will get somewhat parallel increases in long rates as short rates move up We have trimmed a small fraction off our long- rate increase over the coming year, in part expecting that the better price performance will be extrapolated to some degree But basically we don't perceive that the real rate movements that have been implied by the recent nominal rate behavior are going to be imposing sufficient restraint over the coming year to keep the economy in check in the way that the markets may now be anticipating   Well, we don't expect housing to be as weak over the next quarter as we previously thought it would be But that's going to be the most visible effect   We think it will in the housing area and nominal rates may have some greater role there than they might in some other areas as opposed to real rates alone That's a possibility   Well, I think it's debatable what's happened to real rates We don't think real rates have changed a great deal basically, even over a lengthier period of time than the last few months We don't see that there has been a tremendous movement in real rates   Indeed  -25-    -26-   No, not necessarily What the norm is in the market here is hard to assess, but I guess we may be a bit less optimistic about what would happen with inflation if we maintained current levels of resource utilization in some markets There is also a considerable view in the market that we're going to have a recession in 1989-1990, that we will see rates coming down significantly Many of those people don't anticipate that it will occur with a further rate increase but just somehow will happen spontaneously Others think that small temporary further rate increases will trigger this Our view is that there is more underlying strength in the economy and that a small, further increase in rates would not have the effect of tipping the economy into recession It's a very difficult process of figuring out what various segments of the market population are thinking, and what they're thinking we will do, which is another element that affects the term structure If we devote more attention to the term structure and if that's our policy-making [tool], this would go back to the Lucas critique It changes the structure of expectations formation of the markets to mean that the term structure has different implications in terms of reflecting market expectations of the economy than it did previously So, we're in a very difficult expectations assessment   But if you look at a very long period though, you would see that long rates are [quite close to] cyclical lows, [while] short rates have moved up relative to their cyclical lows I think there is this recent phenomenon which probably has been exacerbated-- maybe more in my view than in Peter's and Don's--by questions about Treasury bond authority and the flight to quality from the recent LBO developments that may have proved somewhat more depressing for the Treasury bond rates than otherwise would have been the case   President Morris, can I just clarify? We're not projecting lower oil prices but we are no longer projecting an updrift in oil prices We're essentially saying they aren't going anywhere from the current level  -27-    11/1/88   Relative to greater--   Well, we do have a pickup in the fourth quarter which is largely the expectation that automobile stocks will increase somewhat with these higher assemblies Looking ahead, we're expecting to see some moderate accumulation in manufacturing and where inventories still look to be on hold very little We would expect to see some significant accumulation, not very large though, in the trade sector This, given the scale of the economy now, is not a tremendously high rate of inventory accumulation and it doesn't really result in any substantial change in inventory-sales relationships So we think this is easily consistent with the kind of overall growth and final demand we have, so long as it's perceived to be in an environment of sustained growth and businessmen don't begin to get as comforted by it So certainly there's always a risk on the inventory side from our current assessment where some bumping could go on, but it doesn't look like a very aggressive forecast and there are quite a few forecasts out there that would be higher and others that would be about $20 to $22 billion   Early next year Yes   We have them going up about the same amount   The events of recent days have pushed the Treasury bond rate to its current low, but if that rate is representative of the lower constellation of all rates or what's happened to other dealers on that track--and that I guess is what Governor Johnson was referring to--we have an essentially parallel movement of the rates   Well, we still think that business fixed investment, has a certain head of steam--not quite as [much] as earlier this year but still providing some forward thrust On the assumption that we will continue to see a softer dollar than we've seen earlier this year, we see some stimulus to domestic production from the trade side A basic point that I was trying to make was that there's no reason for an economy to gravitate to rates below normal in essence unless something is there to restrain it And while we see fiscal policy as mildly restrictive, it is not a big powerful force as you look out at the year ahead We don't see the inventory situation as being one that suggests there is going to be a retrenchment in orders and production imminently And so in this kind of environment, unless we assume that there was still some monetary restraint at work going out over the next few quarters to further damp things down, the tendency would be for the economy to tend to grow at or above potential And in this projection, if you want to turn the inflation trend back down again, you need to tip below that for a while and open up a little more slack in the economy All of that is conditioned on some assessment of what this level of resource utilization means for inflation pressures Basically, a crude reading of the experience over the past year would be that as capacity utilization rates have risen to their recent range and unemployment dropped below 6 and toward 5-1/2 percent, there was a general acceleration in wages and prices Basically, we're saying you've got to try to reverse that if you really do want by 1990 to be moving back down on the basic inflation rate trend   No, I talked about interest rates and I said--   I don't remember such a sentence But we have a somewhat lower rate of inflation in the near term overall because of the change in energy prices   I'm sorry, would you repeat it, please?   Well, I have a sentence here that says because energy prices will be damping inflation in the short run, we built a more gradual interest rate increase into our current forecast   You're welcome to I'm not--   I didn't say that, but the fact is that our inflation rate is lower than it was previously   I'm surprised, too Certainly, the fact is that because of the energy price change we have a lower rate of inflation in this forecast than we did previously What I suggested was if you stripped away that energy price effect, which presumably will be largely transitory [though] it could develop some momentum as it feeds through, but if it does it would serve to lower wages and so on But if you look excluding energy, prices rise more rapidly next year than this year And so in that sense, and looking at the compensation numbers as was noted earlier, there is a sense of a slight upward trend going through 1989 with a slight tightening and the economy growing at a slower pace   It changes and there's two rarts of the sentence  -30-    11/1/88  SPEAKER(?) Maybe you can help solve the problem by telling us what 1990 looks like; that way he'll have a trend   Well, for 1990 one needs to make some policy conjectures and so on We will present 1990 next time and basically we would at this point expect to show a forecast with rather slow growth in 1990, possibly some slight further edging up in unemployment [unintelligible] utilization, and some indication of a downward movement in excluding energy prices and compensation So, we're looking toward 1990 really in our thinking here about the interest rate path at this point of projecting   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Let me say first that it takes a period of below potential growth in order for some slack to open up in the labor market in particular But also, we'd expect to have some slack--   But, as you know, in our forecast that only brings the unemployment rate up to about 6 percent The maybe "worst case" interpretation of the events of the last two years is that that's only getting us back to the natural rate--if you want to use that framework for looking at this We have been implicitly a bit more optimistic in the sense that, as we move up to the 6 percent neighborhood and edge above it by the end of 1990, we are anticipating that we will begin to see some tendency toward moderation in the underlying inflation trend And thus in 1991, if the unemployment rate remained in the low 6 percent neighborhood, by bringing growth up to, say, the 2 percent range we would anticipate that we would begin to discern a very gradual deceleration of inflation But it would be measured in fractions of a percent for a year at that level   Well, to raise the unemployment rate you have to move below potential growth In recent years it has been very clear that on average the economy had to grow less than 2-1/2 percent in order to produce an upward movement in the unemployment rate   Our judgment is based on what we've seen in wage and price behavior All the anecdotal evidence over the past year or so suggests that in essence we have overshot a level of resource utilization that's consistent with stable inflation   Well, in 1991 we'd expect to see a fractional decline in the inflation rate barring any exogenous shocks that we obviously can't anticipate at this point   I don't think we're totally outside the spectrum of outside forecasters, but there continues to be some difference of opinion between the staff and that average in terms of how much weakness is likely to occur in aggregate demand as a consequence of the tightening that has occurred already I noticed in the article in The Wall Street Journal the other day on the difficulties in economic forecasting that one person commented that it appears that the business forecasters keep predicting recession about a year out and then moving it back as it doesn't materialize In essence, there's a large element of that a sense that we have had a long expansion; things have gotten tight; and it's more likely than not that we may have a downturn And they perceive it occurring by the end of this year, in many cases with interest rates moving down along with it They also tend to have a seemingly relatively rapid disinflation response to that softening--greater than we would anticipate And that's part of the difference in our views   And vice-versa  SPEAKER(?) One of you is making a mistake   Well, there's a lot of uncertainty on all aspects of the forecast   Well, we wouldn't want to be any fancier than that We just have a gradual further rise   I think what we have built into the remainder of this year is not very large In fact, I will venture to say that it might not be large enough, given the range of possibilities one can see here But to make distinctions on whether you've gained this increase of roughly a percentage point through a 3/4 point rise over the next three months and a 1/4 point rise thereafter versus 1/4 point and then 3/4 point I think is going well beyond anything that economic science can discriminate between   Well, I don't want to speak of models per se here The models we have been looking at have a longer history of price/wage behavior and would suggest that the natural rate is above 6 percent However, our interpretation of the errors those models have made recently and of recent evidence leads us to put together a forecast that, if you forced it into that kind of model, would imply a considerably lower natural rate So, we are in the vicinity of that implicit natural rate by the middle of next year   Well, there's hardly anyone who runs an unfettered model forecast You're always confronted with the fact that models have imprecisely predicted the recent past and you need to make some corrections in order to move forward in the forecast period Our models, for example--the quarterly model and the P* model--have tended to underpredict the strength of aggregate demand in the economy over the past year or so If you immediately eliminated that and had a pure model forecast moving forward it would suggest a sharper weakening than we have in the forecast But whether that's the most plausible assumption to make is a question Certainly, we [would] be inclined to make that kind of adjustment The basic question, though, is whether the outlook contains a significant risk of recession In this Greenbook we deviated from what we had done the last couple times--just to avoid needless repetition perhaps--but maybe it is useful to state again we are skirting zero growth here by a small margin in what we've written down And certainly a small hiccup in the economy in an adverse way could tip this into negative territory So I would say that with this kind of outlook there is a non- negligible risk of at least a mild downturn in the economy   It sounds like we're somewhere in between those two in our '90 forecast in nominal GNP   I'm sorry I didn't catch the change that you were referring to   Well, there are some special factors boosting the first quarter and some of those, like drought relief payments, won't recur in the second quarter The growth in the first quarter is also boosted by things like Social Security but that's a level adjustment, so to speak We are expecting a considerable slowing in employment growth and in hours in the months ahead And that plays a significant role in the outlook for income growth   I think it's fair to say that the recent data-- and as I indicated we've raised our forecast of the price indexes for the current quarter--leave us with the impression that the inflation pressures at these levels of resource utilization may be a little greater than we had anticipated But we haven't made a dramatic change here We have tried to read through some of the noise in these numbers And we've only passed through a modest bit of this surprise into the forecast for the next two years I characterized the situation last time as being one where we think this inflation forecast represents our best point estimate But if I were to draw the probability distribution, my sense is that the distribution has a longer tail on the up side than on the down side I could envision a percentage point more inflation more readily than I could envision a percentage point less inflation over the next year or so That doesn't mean that there's a strong likelihood of that happening; but in that sense I think the risks may be a bit on the up side   I can't slice this too finely; it's very hard to trace that In the Greenbook we referred to numbers where we've taken away the large corporate merger transactions that we can identify and gotten some additional information there There are so many corporate restructuring transactions going on that there may be a lot of other things going on in the numbers besides basic financing and capital expenditures and so on Our reading is that there has been some strength in short-term business credit apart from the RJR/Nabisco and other major merger transactions And that probably is reflective of the underlying need for funds and the deferral of long-term financing Some of the long bond issuance that Peter talked about earlier really isn't very long term; much of it has been swapped into floating rate obligations It just appears that businesses are not anxious to lock in these current long-term borrowing costs which, again, is consistent with the term structure picture and these forecasts of weakening in the economy and lower interest rates down the road   Well, to date, the effects on housing starts have been negligible I think housing starts were confounded a bit by the weather that boosted the January figure to such a high level February is in the area of more than 1-1/2 million Interest rates have already risen a good bit We don't have a gigantic further increase in mortgage rates in this forecast, so this kind of decline-- given the underlying demographic influences and so on--looks to us to  -18-    3/28/89  be fairly reasonable I don't think we are all that far off Given what other forecasters have been anticipating in terms of interest rate movements, I don't think we're that far off the beaten track on the housing starts outlook Perhaps we're being a little optimistic If we had a much larger mortgage rate increase it would obviously make a difference But it's not very large at this point   I think we've seen in some parts of the Northeast that this doesn't go on forever--that you get an affordability problem after a while because the mortgage payment just is unmanageable But it is a mixed picture regionally, and that's one of the problems in forecasting housing activity It clearly has been a problem in the last year We've had very divergent and changing market conditions We try to sort through all of that as well   I might just note one of the surprises recently we haven't gotten too excited about this yet, but we have been surprised by the firmness in the multifamily sector And we notice that there has been some downturn in vacancy rates in some locales We have a sense that there is a very old stock of apartment buildings out there and some demographic pressure It may be that there is some considerable resilience in the apartment part of the market   We haven't really made much of a change from our last projection Using the model--which I've already indicated is an imperfect predictor of these responses--if you took out the interest rate increase and just held the funds rate stable the model would take off maybe 1/3 of a percent in real growth this year and something over 1/2 a percent next year That means that we still would have a perceptible weakening in growth and likely some slight edging up in the unemployment rate   It only had one observation in 10 years You'd have to look back   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   With our baseline Greenbook forecast--extending it informally at this point into 1991 and assuming that growth isn't so rapid as to move the unemployment rate back down in that year but that it will stay in the 6 percent or so neighborhood--our expectation would be that in that environment we'd see a fractional decline in inflation in 1991 But the trend would be turning discernibly downward Using our quarterly model and not doing a particularly elaborate exercise but leveling out rates--or keeping the federal funds rate about where it is now--the result is that, in essence, we eliminate that downturn in inflation in 1991   In 1991 In our current forecast we're talking about, in the greater scheme of things, a rather small further rise in interest rates But it's enough to make a slight difference in output growth in the near term, building to something a little more noticeable in 1990 And we end up with a lower unemployment rate and eliminate most of that slack that would otherwise emerge    5/16/89   Yes, I think that's right And we're reading these numbers very finely That's probably the predicament that we face, in general, in interpreting the incoming information If we are on the kind of track that we have projected, I think every meeting here we're going to go through a sort of Chinese water torture in trying to judge whether the latest data are suggesting that we're moving up or moving down To use these econometric models to come up with some precise notion of whether we will go up a little or down a little on the inflation rate from the current level is probably pushing things I think the uncertainties are greater than that But running it through [the model] in a straightforward way, that's the kind of conclusion we get   Basically, we need to have a decline in order to see the kind of moderation in final demand that we feel is necessary, in essence, to diminish inflationary pressures Unless there is a substantial slowing in the rate of inventory accumulation, inventory/ sales ratios are going to move up With what we have been seeing we're going to get a growing imbalance In terms of structural changes I'm reasonably impressed by what I read and hear--particularly in the manufacturing sector but in the trade sector as well--about the kind of inventory management changes that have occurred It's clear that there are efforts underway and that manufacturing firms have been quite successful to date in reducing inventories relative to their shipments I think they will try to maintain those trends So in that sense, even a leveling out might imply in some cases some undesired accumulation relative to plans So, we feel we really need to see a substantial slowing here if we are to avoid an imbalance that will create the need for even bigger production adjustments in the [future]   Well, I think there is a diversity but the central tendency of the private forecasters, as I read it, is for a softening that is probably at least as great as what we have in this forecast My sense is that the disinflation payoff that is seen is fractionally greater than what we have I think many of those people as they look out into 1991 also see the likelihood of a pickup and, in essence, an impatience with any Federal Reserve [forecast] that looks like the possibility of a recession In a sense, we may have a smoother track in our forecast than some of them But I think we are, on balance, a little less optimistic about the inflation payoff of the slack that is predicted to emerge, and we're expecting interest rates to have to stay a bit higher   Indeed, that's really more an end of this year/ early 1990 story We feel that even if things did slow to a rate somewhat less than we have in the second half--barring some major inventory imbalance or something like that--we probably are not going to continue on a slow enough track to open up the kind of slack in the economy that we still think is necessary in order to really turn the inflation rate down   We're very close to recession in this forecast in the first part of 1990 So an error of that dimension, so to speak, could make that kind of difference as to the sign--whether we're in slightly positive territory or slightly negative territory I wouldn't want to suggest that we think we can predict these things with that precision We have tried to raise the flag repeatedly that we feel this is at least a growth recession In essence, we have a fine-tuned forecast Whether policy can be so finely tuned is another matter   Sure   We put the federal funds rate by the end of the year up to or approaching the 10-3/4 percent level   I said we had the federal funds rate somewhere in the 10-1/2 to 10-3/4 percent range   We're neutral   We're neutral at this meeting   The Greenbook doesn't slice it that thinly, but we didn't assume anything in the next few weeks   [Statement--see Appendix]   I must admit you know more about this from your conversations than I do Larry [Slifman], have you--?   I think the more important question is what effect this will have on the employment and hours numbers for August I suspect there will be considerable [doubt] when we see, on net, a very low employment growth number But we've also assumed that there isn't a lot of lost output with this [strike] There will be a few phones that won't have been installed and so on, but the calls are generally going through So this looks like something that won't have a large GNP effect  SPEAKER(?) On the payroll numbers themselves, we estimate that during that survey week of the 6th to the 12th of August about 150,000 telecommunications workers were on strike   We do think there will be an upward revision As best as we can do the arithmetic--making guesses where we need to about how BEA may interpret some of the data--we think an upward revision of about a point is in store Basically, our forecast is a [net] change forecast and thus isn't affected by this That means that the levels of some of these variables--if we were to redo the forecast with the revised second-quarter numbers--would look different But in terms of the GNP growth path, it wouldn't be a factor   It is true for inventories as well If inventories were revised up, inventory investment throughout the forecast, all other things equal, would be revised up That means it potentially affects inventory/sales ratios   To the extent, though, that we digest the incoming information and are aware of whatever surprises there are for BEA in the latest inventory data, for example, that conditions our thinking about whether inventory levels are too high or too low   This is an issue that we've debated many times In fact, recently, we have been debating whether we ought to anticipate changes in BEA's numbers and put down our guess instead of the last BEA number But there's a long tradition; this problem has been going on for decades here and we have been discussing how one ought to approach this issue   Well, a lot of those differences come from policy assumptions We think it is unlikely that this agreement is going to fall apart entirely; but if it did, then presumably we'd have somewhat stronger aggregate demand over the next year in this forecast and less restraint coming from the fiscal side Relative to GNP, I don't think that we're talking necessarily about numbers that are night and day differences; but they are potentially of some significance Let me just add one thing One of the reasons CBO is higher reflects their assumption that the thrift resolution expenditures in this fiscal year will be lower than the $20 billion that we've built in That's largely a paper shuffling transaction, as we've interpreted it, so that would be of no effect in--   Their report suggests that they are aware of some question here, but they've interpreted this as something that can be carried over and will show up as a budget outlay next year   You have your work cut out for you   We have in our forecast a $32 billion end-of-the- quarter cash balance, so there's [room]   As all of these revised data washed through, the revisions really didn't have much effect on our assessment of trend productivity growth Our guess about the trend growth in real potential GNP is still close to 2-1/2 percent, maybe 26 percent at this point   Yes, they came out; I must say that based on the data we have it's a little hard to interpret these things The overall durable goods orders were down almost 2 percent Nondefense capital goods orders were up 5 percent and June was revised up to 5 percent from about unchanged But there are--   Ex-aircraft it is down 10 percent But last month was revised up to 66 percent The big swing factors in the last couple of months seem to have been a category called ordinance, ship building, and tanks, which is part of nondefense--  -14-    8/22/89   So these numbers are pretty murky at this point It looks like there's a touch of weakness in orders for computers, and that doesn't come as a great surprise in light of the anecdotal evidence about what's going on in that industry On the whole, though, at this point I'd only venture the guess that this report doesn't suggest a very big departure from what we have been tracking here Overall, unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods continue to rise substantially month-by-month, really   The release indicates that the average revision for new orders is about 2 percentage points, so this constitutes a pretty healthy revision But this is a series that's very volatile, and on top of that you get these--   The market is going to be handicapped in interpreting this because some of the crucial detail isn't going to be available until the final release of manufacturers' orders and shipments next week   It's really difficult to sort through these numbers   We don't perceive this as a simple relationship Obviously, there is interaction here, and there are price surprises that could affect the inflation expectations that could in turn affect compensation And then this all cycles around Basically, it depends on what model you look at as to whether there has been a very big surprise in the behavior of wages If you refit your models through the recent experience and you capture all the data revisions that have occurred along the way and you select your price expectations variables correctly, you can pretty well capture what has been going on in compensation inflation over the past couple of years--not quarter-by-quarter, but the general drift   Percentage point lower?   No In fact, there hasn't been much change in our compensation forecast since last fall We have been projecting pretty much the same compensation increase this year as we have all along   My feeling is that it depends on which data you look at There's the compensation per hour series, which has been showing about 5-1/2 percent increases over the past year There is the employment cost index, which has been showing 4-1/2 percent or a little above that That number looks rather low against the kind of consumer price inflation we've been having in an environment where we think the unemployment rate is essentially in line with the natural rate--fairly tight labor markets Judgmentally, we would have expected to see that 12-month change in the ECI creeping up over the past year, and that hasn't occurred On the other hand, I think the basic tenet of this forecast is that there was an acceleration here We have not turned down, in terms of this trend; the labor market is remaining tight It is very difficult, barring some significant price shock, to see why we would go lower on wage inflation In light of the large increase in consumer prices over the past year, in particular over the past half year, we think there is going to be some pressure--self-inflicted or not--on employers to boost their wage increases a bit to keep their employees whole And we think we're going to see some slight further upward movement in compensation per hour over the next couple of quarters Then next year we have the hit from the legislative increases, which accounts for almost all of the further increase in 1990 So I'd say we are comfortable that we have assessed the risks properly and that it's most likely that we're going to see some edging up rather than stability or a downward movement  -16-    8/22/89   Well, but there could be a mix factor here   I don't think we can fully explain this; we're not entirely comfortable with this   There are possibilities One is, since the compensation per hour series doesn't collect the same kind of direct information on benefits, that it's missing something in that area We have seen significant revisions in the past as, with a considerable lag, they incorporate that information But it is a source of some discomfort Looking at the ECI, I suppose we might feel that there is some upside risk because of the low level of that increase over the past year or so against the kind of consumer price inflation we have had   Well, I must confess that in all likelihood there will be some decline in the inflation rate in 1991 in our forecast by design   Because we are assuming--   --that it is an objective of the Committee to make some progress in that direction, while avoiding recession The question is what kind of economic environment it will take If we assume that the dollar continues to appreciate, that argues all the more for our assuming that growth in 1991 will have to remain on the soft side That will be the kind of forecast we most likely will be presenting; and that's in line with what we presented in our previous simulation, for example, in the Chart Show   We have a very pronounced drop in the profits share in our forecast We think it is ongoing at this point; and by the end of 1990 in this forecast, the profit share is historically at a very low level That's one of the factors in our thinking about the investment outlook Overall cash flow will be constrained; the current profitability of businesses won't look so great So we think there is going to tend to be some drag on investments going out through 1990 It's very hard to get a handle on what is happening in the aggregate from the stories about these [unintelligible] on unadjusted earnings and so on But we think it is weak at this point   I'd rather not look at the quarter-by-quarter numbers that closely   As I look at it, the fourth-quarter number is up less than $1 billion   Right off the top of my head I'm hard pressed to identify all of the factors here that explain that But I think that is too fine a reading of these numbers   Yes Gyrations from quarter-to-quarter in the rate of output growth in productivity feeding through here can lead to some bounces But I think the real story here is that we are projecting a rather weak profits picture It may be that private analysts have come around more to this view than previously We felt we were much more pessimistic than most private forecasters previously I think there is a greater sense now that, in terms of economic profits, there's something going on from the effects of the 1986 tax law on depreciation allowances--that operating economic profits are going to be relatively weak as one looks ahead  -18-    8/22/89   Indeed   [Unintelligible]   In the very near term I think it is much affected by the revised retail sales data, which puts it on a distinctly different path than we were on earlier   It affects the growth rate of consumption in the third quarter because of the level [unintelligible] path and so on   We're at a much higher level and relative--   In a sense But beyond that, a month ago when we were looking at this before the GNP revision we were looking at a very steep drop in nondurables in the second quarter I think I suggested at the time that that looked really peculiar and that we wouldn't be surprised to see a revision When the GNP numbers came out they eliminated some of that decline; I think it went from minus 6 for nondurables to minus 4 Now, those numbers are going to go up still further There is still going to be a pattern of about three quarters where we're running at rather weak nondurables expenditures History suggests, statistically, that this sometimes occurs in the gasoline area when we've had a big run-up in gasoline prices and then you get a reversal as gasoline prices fall It may be merely a statistical measurement problem Be that as it may, the trend there just looks to be weaker than one would anticipate over time; so in the second half we do have, in effect, a bit of a catch up But looking at next year we only have a 1-1/2 percent nondurables increase; this year as a  -19-    8/22/89  whole we only have something in that vicinity, after the revisions for the second quarter So, the outlook is for a very modest growth of nondurables   [Unintelligible] be at something in excess of 3 percent So this is a fairly buoyant, as we characterized it, demand picture And it's only in small part an automobile story because, while we get a burst from the third quarter, in the fourth quarter we're expecting a pay-back So on net over that span it isn't an auto story In fact, in the GNP forecast the automobile assemblies are taking a fraction off of GNP growth in the third and fourth quarters   You take out the government Then, with the private domestic final purchases you're getting down to just consumption, residential investment, and business fixed investment   Well, for the single-family sector, the time differential between the permit and the start is very short Statistically you cannot find any lead-lag relationship in that data I think our permits tend to be less volatile from month-to-month   Statistically, [permits] in level terms [don't tend] to be all that far different from the starts story   Indeed But I think if you look at the new home and existing home sales in June, the housing starts for the last couple of months, the single-family number in July, and the anecdotal evidence in the press and elsewhere regarding builders' attitudes and consumer attitudes, all of these things point to some upturn And we have a modest upturn in residential construction beginning in this quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter   There wasn't much change, and they may not have declined much in real terms if you think there was some diminution in long-run inflation expectations   Well, I think I differ on that One, on the structure side, we really have discounted this If you just wanted to look at the data literally, there has been a considerable upturn in construction contracts in the last several months We think that's just a sporadic movement that is not likely to be sustained, but actually it has strengthened On the orders side it depends on how you want to look at the zigs and zags from month-to-month You can look at the zigs and zags for the past half year or so and say that--   --for computers it's no better than flat, and maybe has edged off some But remember, that nominal dollars there-- given the price declines--translate into a sizable real increase in expenditures So one needs to keep that in mind If you look outside of computers at the non-aircraft, non-computer component, either we have had a persistently strong uptrend or, looking at the zigs and zags in the least optimistic view, one would say it has been rather flat Somewhere in between is where we come out in interpreting this, particularly in light of the backlogs in that area So we think there is some further growth ahead   I don't want to get into a long debate, but let me refer you to the middle panel of the chart on page 16 of Part II of the Greenbook That is the chart to which I was alluding; that's other nondefense capital goods and the solid line is orders Last fall it looked like things were falling out of bed That orders figure turned down What we've had in the first half of this year is a tremendous increase in producers durable equipment outlays and pretty strong exports of equipment as well As you can see, the shipments just continued to rise In the first half of this year we zig-zagged on a flat path But one could easily do an optical  -21-    8/22/89  regression here and draw a trend line right through 1987-88 to the current numbers and say the trend is still intact It's a judgment--   As I said, the recent evidence has been rather mixed The anecdotal evidence--the reports that we are hearing from some of the producers of capital goods--doesn't sound all that great So, I don't want to make the case that this sector is unambiguously robust at this point   Indeed, but I think the history also tells us that one needs to be very careful   I'll try, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think we expect to see any dramatic interest rate effect in the trend of capital goods outlays The lags there are too long The [interest] elasticity is too low We didn't really think that was going to move that series around very much It's true that the orders trend, as I suggested, has not been especially strong of late If you start dissecting the data and you take account of declining computer prices and so on, I think there is a sound case for expecting relatively moderate growth in real equipment outlays And that's what we have in the forecast We don't have an acceleration; we have a deceleration in the forecast   I don't think it has had a large effect, no We haven't had a large enough change in interest rate levels to greatly alter businessmen's assessment of the profitability of investment over the long run On the housing side, we have lowered our third-quarter forecast for real construction outlays We were disappointed by the August housing starts While the average in the past couple of months has been up a bit, it hasn't been dramatic by any means A lot of that weakness has been in the multifamily sector; that's a very  -20-    10/3/89  volatile number But the single-family starts in August also were a shade on the weak side What we think is happening, though, is that we see some pickup in housing demand as manifested in existing home sales And in new homes sales, the information from surveys about consumers' perceptions of home buying conditions has moved in a favorable direction with the decline in interest rates We're expecting a modest boost to overall economic activity in the near term, this quarter, from residential construction But that's a small sector And despite the secondary effects that it can have on consumer expenditures and so forth we don't think it's going to provide a tremendous thrust to the economy We do look for a positive number, though, in the fourth quarter   I think that's the case If you had super rational people who perceive that all of a sudden monetary policy was on a track that was going to hold nominal aggregate demand expansion in line with the trend rate of real output growth, then expectations would change and wage bargaining would revolve around that kind of expectation You could have an instantaneous downward adjustment in the rate of inflation without any significant cost in real output Of course, there are contracts and other impediments so that even if expectations adjusted dramatically--   I think you'd have a hard task to bring nominal aggregate demand expansion down immediately to that noninflationary level I can't envision that happening without an enormous jolt to the system   But if there were no inflexibility in the form of contracts and so on and if you had absolute credibility--if you could announce today that you are pulling on to this track and everyone believed you--then presumably everything would flow through and real effects would be minimal   Well, I think you put your finger on the appropriate facets of the system here that impede that kind of frictionless movement toward lower inflation   At this point we feel the economy is, in a sense, overemployed In that kind of situation the competition for resources tends to put upward pressure on wages and prices And until we develop a bit more slack, we think that's the direction in which things are going to tend to drift We've been generous, in a sense, relative to what the models would tell us We have not really taken a hard view that we're below the natural rate and that there are tremendous acceleration forces here We have rather modest acceleration in the forecast But the historical evidence is reasonably compelling that in the short run there is this kind of trade-off and you don't get the frictional movement to lower inflation rates without any output loss   Right, precisely   Well, that's why we are being reasonably optimistic We think perhaps there is some greater flexibility We think there is also some residuum of fear here about loss of employment and so forth that may not have existed in earlier years, but that workers are aware of because of the turmoil in the '80s and the exposure to international trade,   Sure This is not something we feel we know absolutely But we're hard pressed to explain what we have been observing without some sense that, as the economy got tighter, that exerted some inflationary pressure You could play some games here in guessing what inflation expectations were at various times during the last several years and make that consistent with the pressures in the labor market in terms of the unemployment rate level not having been a substantial explanatory factor But it looks to us that, as we got down into the 5 to 6 percent unemployment rate range, there was some pressure on wages and prices  -22-    10/3/89   So the question is How do you unwind that? If you could bring about a sudden powerful expectational change, that might help to minimize the need for any loss of output in order to move the inflation rate back down But otherwise we think there are going to be some frictional costs here   You're talking about the fourth quarter, right?   Yes, the fourth-quarter inventory picture is muddled by the aircraft deliveries and gyrations in oil inventories that we inferred will occur because of a surge in oil imports recently So there are those technical considerations Basically, we have underlying that a rather moderate rate of inventory accumulation On third-quarter growth, 3 percent or 3-1/2 percent is certainly within our confidence interval At this point, looking at the labor input, a number in the two's looks like a better guess But I know there are others who have looked at the data and come up with higher numbers This is our best guess at this point with a lot of data missing   Right, and they were up $12 billion at an annual rate   It was $50 billion in July   You're ahead of me on that; I don't have those numbers   Right, there was a pretty broad--   Mr Chairman, the 18th is a Monday; there's a Board meeting I don't know what the agenda is to be--   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, for one thing, we actually did have interest rates rising through the first half of this year The surprise on the interest rate path has been essentially since the spring With the lags, one wouldn't have expected a very large deviation over the recent period As we look forward into the first part of 1990, we get the offsetting influence then of the lagged    11/14/89  effects of the dollar firmness on net exports Those are at least two things that come immediately to mind on how one might be able to explain this   Right, particularly [the funds rate]   They never rose very much; that's clear   As we look into early 1990 I think these are the two offsetting considerations affecting GNP growth in the first part of 1990 we have lower rates than we anticipated but we have a much higher dollar than we anticipated   I don't think there's any comparison Looking at the chart that we had in our pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, total nonfinancial corporate profits basically shot up in the early recovery phase and didn't really move much one way or the other through 1984 They began to give way toward the end of that year and have eased off since then almost continuously But there has been a very sharp drop recently Now, there are some rather peculiar things in the numbers because of the disasters; they eliminated some profits in the third quarter and we presume that BEA also will recognize the losses in insurance companies and so on in the fourth quarter So, that's giving us some one-time shocks But I don't think there's any comparison to that earlier period with what we're seeing now   I think we've had a very marked decline and we're getting to historically low levels of profitability relative to the scale of business   I guess I'm not clear how you're connecting the past two years with 1990    11/14/89   I don't think we're anticipating anything that is really extraordinary in that relationship We have personal consumption expenditures next year growing roughly in line with disposable income One might argue, looking at the rise in the wealth-to-income ratio that we have seen over the past year or more now, that you might tend to get a little stronger consumption growth than income We haven't put a great deal of weight on that argument But I don't think we have anything extraordinary, given our income path and that background on the wealth effects Looking at the gyrations and relationships over the past couple of years, one needs to be mindful of the short-run effects of increases or decreases in farm income--which probably don't feed through to consumption expenditures--and various other special features of the income composition But looking forward, I think we have a pretty steady relationship here between income and consumption   We're expecting rates of growth in those items that would look low by the standards of this expansion If you somehow felt that everything else was right about this forecast-- particularly looking into 1991 when, in our forecast, import prices become a significant factor in creating something of a wedge here in depressing growth of disposable income relative to growth of activity --then you get into questions about whether people are viewing these as transitory terms of trade changes or something more permanent In effect, we've assumed that people will take the permanent view and that they will reduce their consumption expenditures in line with that weaker disposable income growth If they persisted, then you would have a tension here, which I think is sort of in the vein of your question   This is a striking gap Larry [Slifman] can speak with expertise on this subject We have been around on this a number of times in the past and have argued with them about it; our raw judgment is that they don't really take a very careful view of the 10-day seasonals We have tried to, but that still leaves last month with a considerable gap between the monthly numbers    11/14/89   Given the recent numbers, I think we ought to go back and haggle with them about this some more   The product you get differs considerably   Looking at assembly schedules on our seasonal versus [theirs], on our seasonals you don't have this appearance of a significant gap Basically with [unintelligible] vendors implied significant inventory accumulation going on So it's an important question And this recent 10-day figure just amplifies this again We'll talk to them some more, but we've had many conversations with them and thought maybe--   I might say that in the past one of the things we have wrestled with BEA over is their willingness to adjust for the timing of model changeovers We have been a bit more flexible and adaptive on this than they have and that has created, in a number of years, some significant differences in pattern I don't know whether that's a continuing problem this year, where once again things were not necessarily perfectly aligned with the historical norms   That is the Boeing gyration It's depressing PDE in this quarter and increasing it in the next quarter; then you're back onto the trend of growth   Indeed, this is all assuming that the strike ends at the end of this month and then that production gradually gears up to full [speed] by the first of the year So, obviously, there is room for some significant short-run deviation   Offsets? At this point, since it appears that the suppliers are still providing materials and components to dealers, those are piling up You're not getting the value added of the assembly But that could change, too If the strike went on beyond our assumption, we would expect that to become a factor  -10-    11/14/89   We have a higher level gradually diminishing as we go out through 1990 But it is--   What we've got built in is not as much as the numbers that one hears--$5 billion or $8 billion that we're looking at in terms of damage and so on You don't know how much of that really will be replaced; you don't know in the short run how much will be squeezed out by that effort, to the extent that factors of production are reasonably totally utilized in an area The possibility of doing the repair work and still maintaining the other activity that would have occurred becomes a question So, I think there is some upside potential here from our forecast on the rebuilding   In productivity?   Basically, we have the stronger effect as the economy is decelerating And that's what one normally sees As labor is adjusted to lower levels of production, you get some bottoming out in the growth and some tendency toward slight acceleration--you move closer to the longer-run trend of productivity expansion   Something over 1-1/4 percent, maybe   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we've anticipated seasonally adjusted declines over the next couple of months in apparel prices, which would not have been the pattern with the customary introduction of seasonal apparel over the past couple of years So, in effect, the answer is that we are taking this as something of a special factor that should unwind over the next couple of months to some degree Indeed, we've lowered our forecast of the ex food and energy CPI increase for the second quarter from what we previously had But the cumulative effect of the last few months of data in this overall category--even though there are special things like transit charges and other items that seem to be one-time events--has been that the trend is a little higher It just seems to fit with the general circumstances of overall spending being stronger--knowing that that profit margin pressure was there, which businesses presumably would like to relieve to some degree [Unintelligible] the context of import prices turning upward, thus relieving a bit of the competitive pressure So it all seems to fit together in this direction We've raised [our forecast of] prices ex food and energy this year; they change Q4 to Q4 by 2 percent, a fairly modest change   That's by design of course I hope everyone--   Let me say first of all that in terms of the change in rate assumptions from last time, as you may recall, what we indicated at the February meeting was that we didn't anticipate any significant change but in terms of what we had written down in quantitative terms there was a modest upward drift in rates So the rate increase in this projection is not quite the 1 point and 1/2 point that I referred to It comes more quickly We had had rates just drifting up through the projection [period] pretty easily Whether or not one would characterize this as substantial could be debated Certainly, in terms of cyclical movements in interest rates that in the past have caused major changes in the direction of the economy, a 1 point change in the funds rate really wouldn't look all that dramatic Using our quarterly model and holding the funds rate at the current level throughout the forecast period, we would end up with a higher level of real GNP at the end of 1991 by about 7 percent And because of the long lag in the price effects, we probably would see an inflation rate next year only 1 or so higher than what we have in the forecast As we've emphasized many times, it takes some time for those inflation changes to reemerge One could--   We would have an unemploymnent rate about 1/4 of a point lower That's really not a very big difference, and I guess that's consistent with what I've said about the kind of shock that a 1 percentage point interest rate change at the short end imposes on the economy Clearly, if one wanted to move the inflation rate down, these can be applied in reverse You'd need a substantial rise in interest rates to make significant progress within 1991 to bring the unemployment rate up much more quickly and reduce capacity utilization The trajectory going into 1992, however, is an altogether different story If the unemployment rate were to go in excess of 6 percent next year, presumably we would begin to see some significant deceleration in prices in 1992, all other things equal   Well, last year was somewhat erratic; the course was generally in a downward direction even though interest rates came down in the latter half of the year I would say that we have had a very hard time getting the base level from recent months, given all the weather effects, so there is clearly a bit of guesswork there We've looked at the permits for the last couple of months, though, and they likely are not as affected by weather--particularly in the  -14-    3/27/90  single-family area where we haven't had the HUD effect Using that as some benchmark, we thought that something that had an underlying level roughly consistent with that pace would be appropriate for the coming months I don't expect some little payback for the faster starts of houses in January and February, but basically that's what guided us And we don't have very much interest rate movement this year So we're just assuming starts are going to be in that area This is the area where some of the other forecasters--mortgage bankers, the homebuilders, and others--are putting housing starts, so we have some company But, obviously, because of the construction loan issue, there's considerable uncertainty about these figures   I couldn't do that if it would make Ted's forecast wrong! I'd never hear the end of it! This is something we have to deal with every time we put together a forecast Essentially, we're trying to give some indication of how we think monetary policy probably will have to move in order to bring about what we discern to be your objectives One element in terms of how forceful an action we build in here is our assessment of whether the outcome we have would seem to be consistent with your objectives Obviously, you all have somewhat different objective functions to some degree; and I think the key feature of this is that as we get toward the end of 1991 we don't have a discernibly different inflation trend than we did in the prior forecast It's one where we feel the peak has been reached and things are turning toward a lower trend of inflation, but only very slowly Indeed, one might debate whether that is the proper objective and whether we caught that right  In terms of the timing of the interest rate increase, I suppose in this instance I've indulged in some effort to temper this somewhat with uncertainties that I've noted I've reached the judgment that, given that the real boost to domestic production is forecast not to occur until 1991, there was an interval here in which one could await some clarification of some of these uncertainties  -17-    3/27/90  before moving what I characterized as a fairly moderate amount If one felt you had to move 2 percentage points or 3 percentage points in order to rein things in, then whether it would make sense to have this all happening in about 3 or 4 months' time or to spread it out over a longer interval would have presented us with a different issue But in effect, we've tempered this in terms of timing on the basis of the many uncertainties that we think exist right now   We've always recognized that possibility I want to emphasize that matters of timing, given these small amounts, would not make a great difference in our projections That's maybe one argument for why we should always do something smoothly But we also try to capture the uncertainties and the policy realities that exist   Some of my colleagues would argue that we've been bold, in a sense, in not raising our wage forecast more than we have In that sense we have taken the lower unemployment rate and said it's not going to have a significant effect on the wage outlook because we've taken a fairly optimistic view of the incoming information And I suggested that that was a risk It's in essence saying we may be able to get by with a somewhat lower unemployment rate in the short run than we thought previously I tried to highlight that risk We mentioned it explicitly in the Greenbook And that's one reason why we didn't feel the compulsion to put in a more aggressive move in terms of timing on the--   We're always in this tough position and we try to be as neutral as possible, not injecting ourselves into the short-run tactical decisions   Well, I think we can look back to 1988-89 and see that the Committee really has moved significantly at times   Sometimes we have when it looked like you had to move a considerable amount within a short period of time in order to head things off Normally, we don't build things in immediately   But there have been times when we have   There are some sectors in manufacturing that one can identify as having suffered relatively more than others But it isn't only manufacturing where the profits have turned down One can see utilities and transportation, for example, as sectors where profits have turned down Within manufacturing it's a mixed bag, and we only have figures through the third quarter of last year Some of the areas that stick out are in the machinery and equipment area and, obviously, motor vehicles Chemicals seem to have peaked out Surprisingly, primary metals and fabricated metals held up fairly well last year So, there are many industries in which profits have been squeezed, but it's somewhat uneven   Well, we certainly have presented on several occasions specific alternative scenarios that will do more [on prices] We had the lengthy presentation in December about longer- range disinflation paths I think you--   Frankly, what we try to do is listen and hit as close to the middle of the Committee's expressed desires here in shaping our scenarios I certainly will listen to what I hear today and we will adjust accordingly As I said, my sense is that there are varying degrees of aggressiveness around the table with regard to going all out to bring down the inflation rate within the next year or so And I guess we felt that the highest priority was on establishing a trend, and that's simply what we've done But we can be more--   On the latter question, to the extent that you surprise people with your aggressiveness in responding to what might appear to be a stronger inflationary risk, then I think credibility is enhanced and maybe it does not take a large move but merely one that comes sooner than the market had expected So, I would certainly grant that point In terms of the surprise and what it would imply for prospective inflation, one aspect of the models would be that to the extent they have backward-looking expectations or lagged prices in their wage equations, that would tend to build the momentum in prospectively through markup models of prices In effect, in our case we didn't feed this through to wages Partly, it's quite conceivable that inflation expectations [unintelligible] a forward-looking expectations model in wage formation and that they really will not reflect the food and energy price bulges that presumably will unwind,  -20-    3/27/90  and we may not have as big a price expectation problem In terms of errors and so on, it isn't necessarily inherent in the models as to how one should translate that That's at the discretion of the model operator to decide whether to have negative or positive adjustments in future [unintelligible] to a surprise But as I suggested, we have taken a somewhat more optimistic view than models would of the recent experience And with [unintelligible] to prospects   You're not making my life easier! I badly feel [unintelligible] consensus here   We have only a few billion dollars of the--   Governor Seger, a clarification We have $8 billion of various tax [increases] in our '91 deficit reduction package   To add another two cents worth My own impression from talking to people who are with dealer firms and looking for some insight into what the business community is saying is that the traders and even the economists in many of these firms don't have all that much exposure to anecdotal evidence directly from the business community I have been disappointed regarding the paucity of such information, at least among economists in banks and industrial firms   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   No, we're thinking it's within a small fraction of 6-1/4 percent   Well, on the latter question, I'll offer a little anecdotal information on anecdotes I'll repeat one conversation I had with Bill Dunkelberg, who conducts the survey for the National Federation of Independent Business That survey has shown very mild, if any, changes in the credit picture for that constituency He related to me that he had been contacted by The Wall Street Journal before they published their lead story on the credit crunch and he had told them that If you look at that story, he wasn't quoted The reporter obviously thought it would be better to discuss the negative news than what Dunkelberg's survey suggested That isn't to say the Dunkelberg survey is absolutely reliable But I think one finds that sort of bad news orientation in the press reports One also needs to look carefully at the geographic detail and the sectoral detail that is being addressed Everything we have seen suggests that in the real estate area, particularly the construction side of the market as opposed to permanent financing of residential real estate, there has been a substantial change in the tenor of credit conditions And I don't see any conflict with the anecdotal information in that area As for small businesses, the senior loan officers opinion survey does suggest that there has been some tightening It hasn't been just recently; it has been going on for the last year or so perhaps And it's affecting small and medium size businesses, particularly in [unintelligible] It isn't showing up in rates; it isn't showing up as businesses not having any access to credit, at least not in terms of figures [unintelligible] cut back existing customers; but it's showing up in the standards that are being applied and the collateral that is being used The question is What does that all amount to in the end? In terms of GNP we think that the only significant effects are going to be in the construction area We would have had a marked weakening anyway in that sector, particularly in the commercial area, because of the overbuilding  On the inflation front, I don't want to repeat the entire presentation that we gave a few months ago, but this is basically consistent with that In fact, I'd say this could be regarded as a relatively favorable short-run sort of Phillips curve trade-off We are getting a lot of disinflation for what we perceive to be the gap relative to the natural rate It does presume that history is telling us that we can get there gradually, but the effects are not linear In a sense, you have to get sharp absolute declines in activity in order to get these effects, but we can do it gradually over a period of time I don't think we have historical episodes to go back to and say "Yes, we had periods where the economy moved slowly, the unemployment rate was perhaps slightly above the full-employment rate, and we got a gradual diminution of the rate of inflation" But the evidence that exists suggests that we ought to be able to get some progress over time As I hinted here and said in my briefing, we'd like people to perceive that it's headed in that direction and that the Fed is persisting--accepting whatever slack there is, presumably    5/15/90  leading to some rise in the unemployment rate to 6, 6-1/4 percent Frankly, people thought that was looking pretty good coming from where we were Maybe we will get to see some of that developing and the tradeoff will look better   The employment numbers led us to show a weaker second quarter than we might have otherwise We didn't feel comfortable pushing the numbers much further than this I must say that there certainly are arguments--looking at what's going on in the automobile sector--for a larger second-quarter number But this is something we feel comfortable with   Well, this is a complicated question, obviously Part of the issue would be whether this was just a one-shot effort to hit the Gramm-Rudman target for this coming fiscal year or whether it was something that would dramatically change the outlook for the next series of years and greatly change expectations When you open up that latter door you're somewhat at sea in terms of an econometric model One can come up with rather interesting results with that, such as long-term rates going down appreciably in anticipation of less pressure on credit markets throughout the coming years But if that opened the door to a great deal of investment activity and it happened very quickly, we could even in the extreme get a net increase in aggregate demand in the short run; and short rates might even have to rise some in response to that to keep things on a desirable path Falling short of that, if the Federal Reserve is accommodative in terms of trying to hold real GNP close to the path it would otherwise have been on, I think the fiscal shock has to be one that tends to lower interest rates The degree would depend in part on how much forward expectation there was and how much bond yields move as well as short-term rates   Well, in addition to that--   Correct Our suspicion is that if you hold to the current money market conditions, economic activity will gradually pick up You will not see the unemployment rate rise much, if at all, over the coming year or so And since we believe that right now the pressures are such that the tendencies for inflation point up, we would make a new course and head in that direction So, instead of heading south to 4 percent a couple of years from now, we feel the risk is that inflation would be heading north to 5 percent That's a significant difference and I'd hate to make it more precise than that But as we've said, we felt there was noise affecting the reading of the trends [unintelligible] a variety of special factors the surprising strength of the dollar earlier in the year and so on It's always difficult to read these [unintelligible] So, that's the basic thrust of our assessment at this point   That's what we are saying Now, there's a second part to this and that is Will the Federal Reserve obviously let financial conditions go, maintaining the historic growth path of resource utilization numbers where they are? And that's the second projection One is the implication of the resource utilization level; the second is about what financial conditions are compatible with resource utilization levels I guess I'd say I'm a little less sure about the second than I am about the first and there's a good deal of uncertainty on the first   My sense of the consensus of business economists is that the economy probably is going to run with 2, 2-1/2 percent growth going out the next year to 18 months and inflation is going to remain roughly in the 4-1/2, 4-3/4, 5 percent zone   No My sense is that they probably are expecting very little [change in] inflation, maybe some slowdown--   Let me just go back to a factual matter What we have built in here is a rise in the funds rate of about 200 basis points but then we have it coming off [some] in the latter half of next year as pressures begin to abate   Well, a large part of that revision is RTC- related and we don't think that's a real--   Our measure of this shows a shade less restraint in the current fiscal year than it did previously and that's mainly a reflection of our reading of the information on what occurs on the tax side It does look like tax revenues are running a bit weaker than we had anticipated What seems to have come out of tax reform, reading a lot into the 1989 experience, is that revenue falls a bit relative to what we previously had anticipated in our forecast So, we do have a little less restraint but it's a marginal difference, although that's [unintelligible] factor Looking back at the 1988-1989 experience, there are many things that are different; and one has to make very difficult judgments about the timing of various effects At that point we were coming off a dollar depreciation that was causing considerable improvement in our export growth Exports were growing much more strongly than they are now That probably worked against that restraint We didn't have, perhaps, quite the debacle we think we have now on the construction side, though office building has been going down significantly for a while now and it wasn't at that point Perhaps we are closer to demographic requirements in housing construction [unintelligible] some cushion here on interest rate effects The levels are somewhat different I think there are parallels in the two periods, but there are differences; and I have a very hard time drawing a particular lesson Our sense is, as you said, that we did contain the rate of inflation Whether that slowing in the economy and leveling of the unemployment rate that occurred was    5/15/90  attributable to the rise in interest rates or to interest rates and other factors is difficult to say   I wasn't trying to characterize the current money market conditions alternative as one which led to a take off, but merely a gravitation back to the recent trend of potential output--a sort of natural tendency in the economy in any event unless there are countervailing forces But in the short run we think that we could do a little better due to some pickup in inventory accumulation relative to the significant swing we have seen in a negative direction in inventories And without that, the final demands in the economy should show through ultimately to output growth If we didn't get the rise in interest rates, we would have in our forecast a stronger housing sector than we have If we didn't have the restraint, we would expect investment to be stronger So, if we start removing the restraint, the interest sensitive sectors would look a bit stronger across the board and we'd probably add on top of that some leaning toward a moderate, or higher than we have, level of inventory accumulation And if the dollar were to be weaker than we have in there--   Then, I'd begin looking for the fiscal policy--   That's the [unintelligible] shift   Well, as I suggested, the commercial real estate market may be more affected by this We have built into this [forecast] some effect, showing the availability of credit to builders at a reduced level in the residential sector I wouldn't say that it's large; it's not hundreds of thousands of starts in this forecast, but there is some mild effect We think that would abate over time as builders make connections with new lenders and as lenders find ways of participating loans and some other arrangements Over the next year or so we think we probably will see some abatement of these problems   My judgment at this time is that I don't see inventories as an impediment to the growth of production I'm not inclined to read it as a really strong bullish factor, in part for the reason that you suggested I think there's still some effort, particularly in manufacturing but in other sectors too, to decrease inventories in relation to order/shipment ratios And we view this as still having some way to go An industry economist at a meeting I attended recently said "Boy, these numbers look great; but my boss thinks these inventories are still too high" So, I think the target, in effect, is continuing to drift downward That was one of the reasons why in the past year when we saw manufacturing inventory/sales ratios essentially just level out we didn't move up [our forecast] very much I thought that was a concern and would likely lead to some effort to restrain inventories And I think as [it turns out] that's the pattern we've seen I think we're in much better shape now; but still, my enthusiasm for thinking we're on the verge of a boom is [unintelligible]   That would suggest the need to stock up in order to have supplies, so that's the argument against the big boom With the firming of materials prices in [unintelligible] sector, the carrying cost might not look quite as formidable as it did months ago, but it's still substantial   Mr Chairman, I was away the last three weeks and missed much of the excitement For that reason I've asked Dave Stockton, who was here for it all to reach the exciting conclusion, to present the domestic side of the outlook   We will be taking another cut at this when we get the revisions on the employment data next month We may have something additional to report then   We don't want to offer you the great hope that that's going to eliminate all of the peculiarities in these numbers This series just seems to move in ways that are inexplicable at times And we think the ECI data are a more reliable guide than--   We also have to keep in mind the possibility that some of those phenomena that might be affecting labor force participation suggest that the unemployment rate may not capture all of the elements that are affecting wage behavior If labor force participation is falling off because people don't feel the job opportunities are there, that's a somewhat different kind of slack in the system that could moderate wage increases So, it's a very complex system But I would underscore the point that there doesn't seem to be evidence contradicting the basic view that slack will diminish inflationary pressures Indeed, there are few other channels available to us that would seem really to affect the inflation rate   That's true because we haven't had extended periods of slow growth So the question is Is it the slack or is it the sudden shock of a decline that one sees in a recession that really explains that?   We noted that fact last fall when we had a presentation on inflation--that there was uncertainty about whether there was some sort of nonlinearity in the system   Let me try to put this in the perspective of our forecast For fiscal 1991 we have a $35 billion deficit reduction That's smaller than the $50 billion they still are talking about but perhaps some of the people who are concerned by recent developments would think that maybe even $35 billion is in question at this point As Dave indicated, just before the last meeting all the talk was leading us to think that maybe $35 billion was too pessimistic At this point, it looks like a healthy adjustment given the political situation But if you take some of that out, we could begin to move closer to a $250 billion deficit, including $70 billion of RTC-related [expenditures] in fiscal 1991 If you overlay on that a weaker economic picture--say, with no growth or a mild recession over the next year--then it could easily move toward the $300 billion level So this discussion of a $250-$300 billion deficit is not inconsistent with the kind of picture that we've depicted in the Greenbook   Well, I think you're correct There isn't much in here We have really a trivial increment to defense spending in this forecast over the next few quarters, partly consistent with the oil price assumption that things are presumably--   I think there is also some effect on suntan lotion prices--the sunblock effect! At this point, it seems largely to be a matter of taking some things out of inventory, shifting expenditures, and so on If this results in major deviations from what we had anticipated in overall personnel and additional munitions and [supplies], if we maintain a significant presence in the Middle East over the coming quarters, then we might begin to talk about at least several billions of dollars One could read into comments made by the President yesterday that some of the defense reduction that people had been looking for might not be achieved That then perhaps would begin to chip away at our fundamental fiscal assumptions So, there is clearly upside potential here on the fiscal front for some lesser restraint than we have embedded in this forecast I think that's a clear risk   That's true   There has been a consistent drop-off from the last 10 days [of a month] to the first 10 days in these seasonally adjusted figures   I think on ours as well I just don't think we've found a way of capturing the pattern, particularly in the transplant sales They have this tendency to be very strong in the final--   Well, it's not entirely clear We have looked at the historical evidence on these oil prices, and whether people don't buy cars or whether they shift the kind of cars they buy is not as clear as one would think   Well, it depends on your--   In a sense, the only thing that would change is inflation expectations and that would drive down perceived real interest rates That would affect demand for goods and services in a  -11-    8/21/90  stimulative way, conceivably It's a very complex process and it's going to depend on your response to those--   I think the third alternative illustrates this to a degree by showing the higher level of inflation that we would have   A forecast of recession or the experience of two quarters of less than 1 percent growth   Either OMB or CBO, I believe, can make that forecast   It allows for a suspension   I'm not sure that it's automatic, but it does provide for the Congress to temporarily suspend [the Gramm-Rudman cuts] They have to make that decision   Put it in the file cabinet? [Laughter]   There always are innumerable uncertainties I think we've just layered over the normal ones There are some very, very big imponderables at this point I might just say--and this might seem silly normally, but just to close the loop entirely on this Gramm-Rudman issue--if there were a declaration of war, that would suspend the Gramm-Rudman [provisions]   That's why I raised the point It's not inconceivable   I think the sense in which this nominal GNP concept is attractive is as sort of an automatic stabilizer   But you don't necessarily have to constrain yourself to that automatic response So, there's nothing magical about this If you were concerned about any acceleration in inflation in the short run, you might want to have a lower nominal GNP path or even--   So it doesn't do the work for you here in terms of the policy decision   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   That is part of the first-quarter effect Of course, with the timing of the gasoline tax that has been proposed, that means we'll get something before the end of the year   I'm pleased that you said we had to make that assumption because, obviously, there was some degree of arbitrariness to that, and we hope that this is a plausible baseline We feel somewhat optimistic--but [unintelligible] I think to highlight the kind of policy issues you confront Basically, that rebound does follow fairly naturally from the improvement in real disposable income that would result from this kind of decline in oil prices History suggests that oil price shocks of the sort we have had do tend to disturb consumers, and [thus] we see very sharp drops in confidence The previous large drops were in somewhat similar circumstances Unless the economy really follows through with a significantly negative performance, one might expect confidence to improve somewhat We certainly see downside risks here because of the credit situation, but we think we've built in some allowance for that in an informal way But should quality spreads widen dramatically, should lenders really pull in their horns more sharply than we sense they are, that would certainly be a drag on business spending We've assumed that inventories will be kept in very tight check over the coming months; that's one of the reasons for the weakness in production in the forecast We don't have a buildup [in inventories]; they keep production lines running So, that positions us for a nice rebound in production as soon as that underlying demand picks up But as we enter into a period of such weakness, there are a number of variables that could turn more negative than we have [projected] It's possible too that we will skate through this without any cumulative decline   Well, I guess one would have to reach pretty far back to find any example This is a supply shock The supply shocks  -10-    10/2/90  that come to mind occurred in 1973, which was a period when other things also tended to exacerbate recessionary pressures, and again in the 1979-80 period when we had a recession with an oil price shock But the magnitudes differ and the general circumstances differ I think one couldn't simply appeal to historical precedent to justify this forecast   Well, as I suggested, we've assumed that businesses do move their inventories very consistently with sales in this period ahead Our sense is that in recent years, given the kind of inventory management practices that have evolved, the pattern really does support that kind of assumption about their behavior One can already see an awareness on the part of businessmen that there may be weak sales in the months ahead We have anecdotal reports of retailers ordering very cautiously for the fall Basically, we are looking for the production adjustment to happen very rapidly and that's when our recession is occurring   On the latter point, we really haven't done anything exotic in the assumptions about potential GNP You're quite right that the shift in the relative price of energy could affect the productivity of the capital stock; it could have an effect on the level of potential GNP If oil prices stayed very high, one would have to be concerned about some effect I can't state the magnitude; perhaps Dave has something to contribute on that point Basically, though--assuming there isn't a major contraction of supply that is permanent, so to speak, going out through 1992--I think our forecast follows quite naturally from the assumption we made about oil prices, the projection we made for the dollar, and our anticipated increase in slack in the economy We have a 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate We think that is high enough and the slowness of growth per period great enough that we should see some downward pressure on real wages We    10/2/90  anticipate that import prices will be rising fairly rapidly in the near term, but as a result of our dollar path [the rise] will be decelerating and thus that will be a helpful factor in the deceleration [of overall inflation] by 1992 And we have a favorable trend relative to overall inflation and energy prices as we go out through 1992 So, the cumulation of these things puts [inflation] back into the low 4 percent area during 1992   Dave   This is a complex question--one we really want to look at in the weeks ahead As we noted in the Greenbook, one still has to be very tentative about one's assumptions on potential GNP And we've yet to address that in that broader production framework   Well, that's just one more of the uncertainties And, of course, if and when there are revisions of the data, that will alter the sectoral distribution of value added as the result of the repricing of computers and so on And that could alter one's impressions of what has been going on in productivity performance   I suspect so But that doesn't mean that we're expecting things to return to the kind of situation we had three or four years ago I must say that on the mortgage side, as opposed to the construction side, we still don't see signs of any great addition to effective demand in that market But I think the construction credit side will continue to be a touchy situation for a while longer As you know, we have assumed that there would be some gradual improvement in access to credit by builders who have decent projects to propose But the key here is that we're looking primarily to the weakness in real income over the next couple of quarters to be the major drag on housing demand And as that situation improves, we expect some people to come back into the market and provide some lift to housing demand The level to which we go back is still a relatively low level of overall housing activity; it certainly does not go beyond what one might think the longer-run demographics would suggest should be the basic level of housing demand So, we don't think we have a very aggressive forecast here as we look out to 1991   Well, the figures that we've built into our thinking would involve about 400,000 units a year to replace dilapidated or demolished units and meet the second-home demand If you add that to the demographic trend, we estimate that the basic housing start level ought to be somewhere at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 million units--maybe toward the lower end, if you want to be conservative   Well, we are sort of building into this forecast the notion that we're going to absorb some excess supply at this point That's one moderating influence in the growth of starts over the next couple of years  SPEAKER(?) That's just residential, right?   That's right   I think we've been pointing for some time to the altered psychology of this market The investment motive for buying a home in many areas of the country is not very strong at this point There are still areas where prices are reasonably firm On the whole, though, the picture is certainly one of a flattening out of prices for both new and existing homes It looks much like the kind of rate of increase or stability that we saw in the last recession But interest rates are anticipated to be a bit lower They're at the low end of the range we've seen in the past decade or more And there is some basic underlying demand Now, houses might get smaller We've seen a lot of moving-up-the-scale by homebuilders in recent years and perhaps if there's some moderation in demand for shelter, it will take the form in part of less extravagant houses But at some point we're going to have this pressure to house this population While we may have doubling up and so on for a while, I think there is some underlying support here  -14-    10/2/90   It could go even lower than that It's a small sector It has some side effects but it would take a very deep plunge relative to our forecast to have a major effect in altering the outlook   Well, you're moving into another sphere I guess you could say that might--   That might [hint] at some offset in terms of fiscal policy   That's a slight variation of what I tried to say   We can't see it yet   Well, as I noted, there were several [factors] One of the biggest single considerations was the significantly higher level of oil prices that we have in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year, which is going to squeeze the real purchasing power of households by a significant degree   That would account for at least the majority of it; I wouldn't say it would account for all of it in a [strict] mechanical translation We thought there were other factors in the environment too The general inflation trend looks a bit worse and the excise tax hit also implies somewhat greater inflation in the near term and still further erosion of real income We also looked at the credit market developments and at least intuitively judged that there is more restraint being imposed there than we might have anticipated in our previous forecast We try to take into account the anecdotal information I mentioned that as something that certainly has looked negative and I think it would be silly for us to ignore that totally   Hard evidence? Well, obviously, the trends are visible The lending practices surveys that we pick up aren't that up-to-the-minute, but the recent survey showed a slight widening of quality spreads in the bond market Very clearly something that has impressed us is the turmoil in the banking sector That is something we can't yet document in terms of its effect on their lending, but it seems to us to suggest some significant further constraint on them   We have had some reasonable increases in industrial production thus far this year Indeed, there is something of a tension between the industrial production numbers and the GNP numbers over the course of this year The relative movement is pushing the limits of what one might have expected But the natural consequence of that is that we don't have capacity utilization coming down a great deal I don't have an answer for this These are somewhat independent data sets and they sometimes do diverge They are also both subject to revision And where the truth lies, I can't say with any certainty   Well, in a sense this is a mechanical calculation All the variation in capacity utilization essentially comes from the variation in industrial production We don't measure capacity month-by-month I guess one might say that there hasn't been anything very obviously strange about the relationship of capacity utilization to price behavior this year Materials prices have not been collapsing; the PPI for finished goods has not been collapsing This doesn't suggest that capacity utilization really has been falling dramatically So, I don't see any indication that we've been led astray by these numbers  -16-    10/2/90   I could use a couple more inches!   Well, the point we tried to make is that if potential GNP is growing more slowly, one has to lower one's sights on what kind of GNP growth we can have and achieve a given degree of slack That, I think, is the cutting edge on this issue   Governor Angell, I might just note that the relatively low deflator we have gotten for the fourth quarter--  -17-    10/2/90   --is something of an artifact of our assumption about oil prices, the oil import pattern, and how fast those prices of imported oil flow through to finished products, and so on The fact that we had a big bulge in the oil price gives us this temporary dip, which is then reversed in the first quarter That isn't to say we don't have a pattern of slower nominal GNP growth over this quarter and the next; but it is still a relatively low number   You recall they also have regulated the maturities, in essence for the same purpose   So, they played a very active role in this field   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll try to sustain the level of interest here! [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the major mechanism is the drop in oil prices that we have assumed On top of that we get some impetus over time coming from the recent decline in the dollar showing up in the stronger export growth and the retardation of import expansion So, that's the major impetus to defining final demand as we look out into the latter half of 1991 As to the risks Obviously, they're manyfold and very substantial If I had to characterize them for the very near term, I'd put a small interval around the minus 2 percent and say that is what we think is the most likely result My judgment would be that the tail [of the probability distribution] is probably a bit longer and a bit thicker going to the down side but that we have a significant [mass] of the probability around this moderate drop--I don't know if a drop is ever moderate--of 2 percent or something close to the magnitude that we have in the fourth quarter   Well, we're sort of captives of our key assumptions And oil, given the movement we have forecast, is a quite powerful influence So the broad contours here seem right to me in light of that assumption Now, as to how one might want to alter that in light of one's geo-political-military assessments, obviously, there's a tremendous range of possibilities I think there is a lot of sense to assuming that at some point over the next 6 to 9 months we will have a significantly lower oil price either after military conflict or in the absence of military conflict But the timing of that and what might happen in between is hard to say So, that obviously complicates things As to the credit picture, as we've said all along, this is just very hard to translate into GNP points We  -15-    11/13/90  are not able to point to very clear-cut real impacts at this juncture that we can say are obviously attributable to the credit situation For example, in nonresidential construction, which is where everyone thought the most direct hit would be, it isn't really obvious there yet We can see the contracts and permits data suggesting some weakening, but there seems to be a pretty long pipeline and there isn't a sign of an enormous drop right now We're predicting that we will see some significant weakness in construction put-in-place in the next two months' reports But this is hard to predict   Well, I think the evidence is mixed in this area Last week at a meeting of business economists, a steel company economist indicated specifically that the steel fabrication for structures seemed to be holding up quite well up through the first part of next year   This is just what they had booked through the first quarter of next year Now, there's always a vulnerability to some shift in this; and one company's perspective may be different from another's We're expecting a significant change in the tenor of these things Also, based on anecdotal information that has come in, there are some areas such as steel and chemicals where perhaps there has been a bit of inventory building, and we could see production fall off very noticeably in the coming months Certainly, we have a distinct change in the tenor of things happening right now in this forecast And it's a judgment call; it's not something that we can substantiate by pointing to clear leading indicators in the data, particularly with regard to the timing and magnitude   Well, both of them look weak over the last two months and that's the key inference that we're drawing--that there is weakness in labor demand There have been these divergences over time, which have not been fully explained But both series for employment show weakness recently, and that's one of the reasons we're putting considerable weight on that information   The personal saving rate has come down and has done so in circumstances where real disposable income has been significantly eroded by the energy price increases Basically, in the very short run, if these data hold up, what we've observed is that people have not adjusted their spending patterns very rapidly in the face of this decline in their incomes We're expecting that this adjustment will occur and that we'll see some movement back up in the saving rate, particularly because of the general financial environment All that we know about consumer sentiment suggests that people are not necessarily going to want to diminish their financial wealth They've already experienced rather weak real estate values and the stock market hasn't gone up, so their wealth positions just have not been improving recently   I think that's a fair characterization   77 percent! [Laughter]   All right, 65 percent [Laughter] I'm not going to be enormously more confident when I've seen the first set of retail sales data knowing how much they are vulnerable to revision subsequently But it would certainly help to make the pieces fall into place in this puzzle that we tried to put together here We have had, basically, a very large drop in hours [worked] Historically that has proven to be one of the most reliable indicators at our disposal of short-term movements in output We had discounted that because the drop in the average work week, especially outside of manufacturing, was just huge and seems incredible But even with that discounting, we're off to a very bad start Initial claims don't suggest that the labor markets are firming; we're looking for further declines in employment and a noticeable drop in hours overall for the quarter   [Unintelligible] are still set with a wide confidence interval No one could state this with normal certainty We do know one other thing and that is that motor vehicle production is going to be down appreciably in this quarter and that alone by our arithmetic--when you put the cars and the trucks together--probably cuts better than a percentage point off of GNP growth in this quarter   That's helpful in adding these things up We know that, unless something bizarre happens with wages in this quarter, real labor income is going to be very weak because of the oil price increase So then it becomes a matter of how aggressive people are going to be about spending what they have And the Christmas spirit--my predecessor was always inclined to bring that up at this time of the year--may move people to spend very freely But we have to try to make our judgment based on all of the information at our disposal And we don't hear anything that suggests that kind of pattern emerging at this point So, we think it's a negative quarter Basically by going [from a forecast of minus 1 percent], which was just slightly different from 0 in our perspective, to [minus] two percent we're signaling that we think it's going to be a negative quarter and we feel fairly confident about that   Well, if they are wrong and demand holds up reasonably well, we're going to see a drag on inventories here that's going to give us the possibility of some bounceback in the early part of next year   That's true There's some income that is lost in this process   Well, some of it is just the straight price effects on real purchasing power But I wouldn't set aside the question of confidence It isn't just an oil price shock; it's a whole discussion of war and peace and one's sense of the stability of the world after a very good move that developed because of [unintelligible] in eastern Europe So, I think with that, plus the debacle of the budget in Washington, there have just been a number of things which seem to have led to an enormous shift in the sentiment of American households With the passage of time maybe the budget issue will be forgotten and something will happen with respect to the military situation I guess it's implicit in this that the risks don't look worse several months down the road   My sense is that the polls suggested some loss of confidence in our economic policy makers at that point  SPEAKER(?) It's hard to believe!   I've tried to puzzle through this The people on Wall Street keep saying that the economy has hit a wall They think that we're going into a serious recession and that we need dramatic monetary policy action to cushion the economy Yet they have not bid the bond prices up further than they have I suspect part of that, and I've heard it said, is that people don't want to buy bonds in front of a war So I think there is a risk premium embedded in there and it is reflecting this   What happens in a war? You mean economically?   Well, I don't think we would presume to have enormous insight There's a considerable range of things that could happen Clearly, if there were significant damage to the production facilities and the transport facilities and so on, we could have a period of time in which supplies were significantly disrupted On the other hand, perhaps in that circumstance we would get the drawdown in reserves and that could be a cushion for a period There could be military spending consequences if a war went on and utilized a large amount of munitions that it was felt had to be replaced within our lifetime It's conceivable that some things just would not be  -19-    11/13/90  replaced immediately, but the sign there I think is positive--ie, that there would be more military spending   I think you're right Under the contract there are these unemployment benefits You probably have it nailed down better than I do   Look through the corporate [unintelligible], if you want to get fancy You would figure that's coming out of Big Three profits, all other things equal, and that certainly affects the shareholders ultimately   I might note that in terms of our forecast, nominal consumer expenditures will grow in excess of 6 percent in the fourth quarter, which would affect transactions demands for money   [Statement--see Appendix]   We have not had time to sort through these data in detail and to try to match them up against the various expenditure categories, but I think one needs to emphasize that GNP measures domestic production   Indeed, as of last Wednesday when we went to press with the Greenbook, we didn't even have retail sales data, etc We were depending to a considerable extent on the labor market data to get some sense of what the input was to domestic production and then we were trying to make some reasonable guesses, in effect, about productivity and so forth But I think one should not leap to the conclusion that dollar-for-dollar any surprise in net exports would track through to GNP We may find stronger expenditures on capital goods, for example, to match some imports or some other adjustment There may be more luxury cars being imported, which will be part of our bulge in consumption in the fourth quarter If that were the case, rather than coming out of inventories, that might have implications for the first quarter So, I think it's a very complex process that one needs to go through with these data   [Unintelligible]   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, by the end of the year   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I've made the argument for a long time now as I've looked at the trend of inventory-sales ratios in retailing I've looked at the enormous growth in floor space in retailing and the many shopping malls that have opened up We have developed an awful    5/14/91  lot of stores Each one of them has some inventory They have clearly moved beyond the point of adequate returns and we're seeing an industry shakeout And in the course of that shakeout we probably will have some consolidation over time and some movement down in inventory-sales ratios That's a very macro sort of view of the process But clearly retailers have moved to try to capitalize on computerization and some of these other [techniques] such as "just-in- time" deliveries They should be doing better on inventories than they seem to have done, and maybe this is part of the story   We still don't hear a lot of complaints that inventories are uncomfortably heavy On the other hand, the profits aren't there Something is out of kilter I think this excess capacity in the industry is reflecting part of the excess stock of consumer goods on the shelves   Well, I think you put your finger on the problem in saying anything with any great conviction at this point We don't have much data We've looked at orders to try to see beyond the data for recent months that we have on industrial production We don't know a great deal about the flow coming in from abroad or going out from current production; that's an unknown We basically reached this conclusion as one that was consistent with what we thought plausible as a final demand picture and what we sensed was going on in terms of production Also, I think there is certainly in some sectors a desire to achieve lower inventory levels And, as I've noted, this is the third successive quarter of substantial inventory liquidation For a recession that we entered with supposedly pretty lean positions, we're ending up in total absolute dimensions with an inventory liquidation that's pretty much in the ballpark of previous cycles--not relative to GNP but simply in '82 dollar terms So, maybe there is some upside risk, but I don't think there's a great desire to accumulate inventories at this time   I don't think this is greatly atypical   And we may not be getting, overall, the kind of cushion we did in some cycles in terms of the government sector But I don't think there's a gross disparity here We were disappointed, as I noted, in the first quarter; much of the surprise was in data revisions Some of it seems quite plausible to us Previously, the interest income figure seemed to be holding up more than appeared reasonable in light of what was happening to interest rates So now we've had a significant reduction in interest income in the figures for the early part of this year It's reasonably sensible   Well, of course, they use the very best data that are available our flow-of-funds accounts!   Let me correct something We did have some numbers and I blanked out on this We're getting more DPI decline in this recession than on average in prior recessions That's what I had in the back of my mind, but then I was thinking no other data I had seen looked different from that   Yes, especially since this is a lesser GNP decline   Statement--see Appendix   Well, what happened in the second quarter was clearly a liquidation of stocks in the nonfarm business sector We  -16-    8/20/91  believe on the basis of the data that came in after BEA's advance estimate that that liquidation will be, in all likelihood, deeper in the revised numbers but perhaps still not quite as sharp as we had anticipated in our June Greenbook forecast Looking ahead, while one can see in the June data--if one wants to read them very closely--some hints of a diminished rate of liquidation, basically our view is that, in light of the anecdotal evidence and our anticipations of what behavior would be at this point, we are probably still in a phase of inventory liquidation but at a slower pace than earlier And probably we are not swinging toward stability or accumulation quite as rapidly as we had thought we might be in our prior forecast As I indicated, businessmen just seem to be very cautious and not at all confident that the recovery and the demand are there and will remain there So, I think this process is likely to be stretched out some relative to our earlier forecast   What is in the Greenbook is the BEA number We think we're likely to have several billion dollars less inventory investment   I would think that oil would be the major item of inventory that would be significantly affected, but obviously other items could be affected to a lesser degree   I have not seen estimates and I don't think we are able to replicate those estimates at that level of disaggregation; we could not really pin that down   Well, there are always risks that the inventory numbers could be significantly revised History provides very discomforting examples of this kind of thing The evidence--in terms of surveys and in terms of what we see going on in industrial production and orders and so on--is consistent with our impression that, indeed, inventories have continued to be liquidated But the dimensions are important here So, if there are errors in these numbers, they could be misleading us   We would like to see firmer numbers than the June figure The June figure wasn't particularly a surprise, in a statistical sense, coming after the pretty good gains we had seen in the prior months At this stage of what we think is a recovery, erratic movements without a clear-cut, month-by-month upward thrust are not uncommon But, as I said, the major areas in which we became somewhat more insecure were how rapidly the inventory turnaround would occur and how much spending on business equipment would improve I'd say those figures will be of considerable interest   Just to clarify something stemming from an earlier question from Governor Mullins Our guess is--just reading the data that we can see on manufacturing and retail/wholesale trade-- that the inventory liquidation that was put at $3 billion in the initial GNP estimate will be more like $11 billion So, it's a significant change   We think that the manufacturing and retail and wholesale trade data imply a downward revision of roughly $8 billion in the inventory accumulation rate in the second quarter   I think that notion has some intuitive appeal It's not something that one can discern in terms of the behavioral relationships that are sort of the averages through cycles that are embodied in econometric models My sense is that where this in fact may be a part of the current process is that some sectors are having a more muted initial response for various reasons The housing sector, for example, is perhaps not having as big a kick from declining mortgage rates as we've had in some past cycles, and we are not seeing a big pent-up demand for consumer durables We didn't get a big surge initially, and this may have tended to contribute to this sense that things are really not picking up And with the rather negative tone that I referred to earlier, in those circumstances the confidence may not be there on the part of businessmen to proceed to the next phases of restocking and pickup in investment as might have occurred previously So, in a sense, the initial sluggishness may be continuing to retard [activity] as people just don't get the sense that things are falling in place and that they should proceed with confidence in making investments to meet future demand So, it may be that there's some of that dynamic here I don't see that, though, as    10/1/91  necessarily suggesting that this [recovery] has to peter out We have this continuation of what we think is the beginning now of a moderate growth path   Ted Truman presented an interesting econometric result--I think it was in the chart show--which indicated in essence that to a first approximation the decline in interest rates that had occurred since the beginning of this year had effectively offset the surprise we have seen in the dollar, which we had not anticipated to appreciate as it did Thus, if you looked at where output would be sometime out in 1992, these were compensating forces Now, what caused the dollar to do that--whether it was exogenous events and political factors and so on or part of the internal endogenous dynamics in the economic system--is hard to say But some political factors clearly were involved in that development   Well, I would not discount entirely the notion that some of the responses to the financial developments that we have seen in the economy may have differed from what we have observed in the past There's a complex of factors in terms of term structure and financial flows and the credit crunch aspects of this and so on that you'd have a hard time matching up against previous history My sense is that the key interest-sensitive sector, housing, has responded to the easing in rates; that did happen And we expect the recent easing to continue that process Inventory investment has been very cautious and we've been a bit surprised On the other hand, there haven't been other things occurring that should have driven firms to restock aggressively So, maybe things are not out of kilter there; the basic elements of the cyclical dynamics are there And it's really hard to discern how much they've departed in degree from the past   This is an extraordinary slump    10/1/91   Right, it's very long; it started a while back and it is very protracted by historical standards In terms of gauging how far it might go, we think it's reasonably aligned with what we can see already in the construction contracts and permits data, which have some lead time in them We think that there is still [in train] a significant decline in office and hotel construction and probably in other commercial construction to some degree and that we're likely to see only modest improvements over the next year or so beginning in industrial construction and maybe in some utilities construction This just looks like a very weak sector The vacancy rates have remained high to date despite the fall-off in construction of office buildings We just don't see a basis at this point for an improvement there And the financing situation is obviously not a plus But, given the fundamentals, that's just a side story Nobody in their right mind would finance the construction of a new building in many of the major cities   In fact, as we noted in the footnote in this Greenbook as we had in the prior one, we actually perceive the liquidation as likely to be larger than the number we wrote down in the Greenbook, given our expectation that the inventory liquidation in the second quarter would be lower We've circulated some revised tables   Under this cover sheet are the revised forecast tables that we distributed There is a substantial liquidation still in the third quarter We think that is consistent with the July numbers, anticipating that in the subsequent months there will be a little less liquidation and that as we move into the fourth quarter we're going to move toward to some end to that liquidation But even the fourth quarter we perceive at this point to be in negative territory on a GNP basis So, we think it's consistent with the production figures and the import figures and the limited inventory data we have But we're dealing with a very small amount of data on the third quarter   And there's room for a surprise, certainly   [Statement--see Appendix]   Given the direction things have been going, my gut reaction is to say "yes" But I think also that the tail isn't quite so long and so thick as before As I said, what we've done now essentially is that we have realized some of the risks we perceived earlier [by lowering our forecast] and I think the risks may be somewhat more balanced in this forecast than before   That's right Our strategy normally is to take the prevailing funds rate as a neutral base for the projection What we were looking at with that funds rate path, though, was an economic forecast that in our judgment strayed farther perhaps from the Committee's objectives than one might like in terms of presenting you with a reasonable framework for discussion Indeed, the unemployment rate at the end of next year might have been a shade higher than it is currently rather than the level we have So we returned to a procedure that we have used in the past of putting in policy adjustments so as to try to get closer to something we thought would be acceptable to the Committee    11/5/91   That's correct   Right, but obviously 25 basis points is a very fine reading But that is [the thought] we went into this with   Well, there are two things, I would say One is that the swing in inventory investment in the quarter just ended in September was considerably larger than we had anticipated And with the potential revisions of those data, it goes even further In a sense we got ahead of the game that we were anticipating businesses would play here The second factor is that as we look at the prospects for final demand and what we think businessmen might be anticipating at this juncture, we have a hard time conceiving of businesses wanting to move further in the direction of inventory accumulation at this point So, we stretched the process out here We have an inventory/sales ratio path that is downward through this forecast We think that implies that at some point in the coming year, if we can just get through this period and sustain growth, there is going to be some further movement in the direction of inventory accumulation And by the end of next year we have businesses adding to their stocks at a gradual pace This might be regarded as a quite conservative inventory forecast Certainly, we have model results that would suggest that that is so But we think businesses are being very conservative in their inventory management And to the extent that there is still stringency in credit markets affecting some businesses, I think it just encourages them even more to try to keep their inventories down to avoid having to finance a lot of stocks   Right As I mentioned, the manufacturers inventory numbers were much higher for September than we had expected They were also much higher than the Bureau of Economic Analysis built into their estimate of third-quarter GNP Relative to their assumptions, there were additional manufacturers inventories of about $10 billion, in 1982 dollars at an annual rate And that inventory investment in the third quarter is essentially equivalent to a    11/5/91  percentage point of GNP Whether that will be the ultimate adjustment of the GNP numbers and whether we'll see some weaker wholesale and retail figures than they anticipated, one can't say But, clearly, it's a substantial surprise for BEA   Are you talking about auto dealer inventories?   Well, actually, they've been running very low, for autos in particular Truck inventories were heavier, but they undoubtedly came down in September with the big surge in light truck financing   It's always a bit murky as to exactly what data they are using in estimating the retail auto component of inventories But, yes, presumably they had a handle on what was happening in vehicles   Well, I think I showed in a chart show earlier this year our estimates of the number of unoccupied dwelling units during the '80s The buildup was much more marked in the multifamily area than in the single-family area But those are housing units and people can choose among these I think there is something of an overhang in the housing market Certainly, at this point with the new homes sales at the pace they're running, the months' supply of new homes on the market is very sizable So, yes, that is a factor Sorry, I forgot the other--   Auto sales were quite high through much of the 1980s and the stocks looked to be fairly sizable per household, for example In the last couple of years the average age [of the auto stock] has leveled out; it's fairly long As I look at the forecast going forward, I think perhaps we're beginning to develop a movement back in the other direction If car sales stay as low as we have them in this forecast, as we look ahead another year or so the demands may begin to reflect some pent-up buying desires But at this point we don't think those desires are very intense    11/5/91   Well, Janet Norwood called attention to this in her testimony before the Joint Economic Committee last year This is a procedure that is followed routinely every year to utilize the unemployment insurance data to benchmark the payroll employment series The data evidently did show a very abrupt drop relative to the payroll employment series estimates early this year She cautioned against taking this as gospel at this point; these are preliminary readings But it is conceivable that ultimately, when the revisions are made, payroll employment growth will appear less robust than before I think the feed-through to GNP that has been implied by some of these reports is a bit tenuous Certainly, in the short run we expect that BEA when it has a lot of data missing may give some attention to the hours input, but I wonder how important that would be looking back at history It could be, if the employment is slower and hours commensurately lower, that productivity growth will look better than it currently does   It could also be that this will lead them to lower their estimates of labor income until the data from tax returns are available   Well, I wouldn't want to leave the impression that we feel there aren't any upside risks here We continue to return to the notion that, in the absence of absolutely clear evidence that we are back into a second dip, recoveries often surprise one in their strength So there could be unexpected areas of greater increase in expenditures It is conceivable that the decline in mortgage rates, which seems to be inspiring a lot of refinancing-- suggesting that people think these are good rates--perhaps will stimulate some additional home buying beyond what we have My concern is, though, that people are just so worried about whether they are going to be employed that that [rate decline] may not be as powerful as it might otherwise be It's a possibility We don't have any clear index of what desired inventory/sales ratios are in various sectors of the economy We can guess by the historical patterns and apparent response what that is But maybe this goes to the earlier question Getting a more rapid buildup of inventories could be an indication that we underestimated where businesses want [their inventories] to be and that they won't continue this kind of liquidation but rather will stay even or move into some accumulation in the near term That could be worth a point or two, conceivably, on GNP growth in the short run Business investment is another area,    11/5/91  conceivably, that could be stronger, but the orders and anecdotal evidence just don't seem to suggest a lot of upside potential there And we have consumers not spending a whole lot in the quarter The personal saving rate ticks up Maybe consumers, despite the worries they're expressing, will behave as they seem to have behaved throughout this recovery and spend practically every dollar they get their hands on Maybe that's simply because many of them have their backs to the wall and they really don't have a lot of leeway, and if there is this additional income, it actually will flow into the spending stream Those are possibilities, and cumulatively they would add up to a materially different picture   Well, I suppose there could be something there My sense is that this is an ongoing story It may be that managements feel the ongoing negative earnings reports require some action to convince the security analysts that this is not going to be repeated in the future Some people have noted that there seem to be a lot of layoff announcements pertaining to the fourth quarter and that this cuts against some tradition in business of not laying people off just before Christmas My sense is that a lot of restructuring is going on in industry where this recession has revealed the need for some cost- cutting in order to get reasonable profit margins in an environment where inflation is not going to offset any looseness of management There's this sense, too, that the layoffs are occurring in places where people thought jobs were once fairly secure And that undoubtedly adds to the feeling among many people who would seem on the face of it to be in pretty good shape that even they could be vulnerable to some structural adjustment that seems to be going on, particularly in the service-producing sectors    11/5/91   I think that's a fair statement The rough cut I made, just looking at short rates, was perhaps the conjecture that inflation expectations might be viewed as a little less tenuous than thinking about 10- or 20-year horizons By this assessment the short- term rates have come down considerably One calculation I have looks very similar to the general level during the 1960s My point really relates more to that cyclical stage typically reached toward the end of a recession when real rates quite regularly have been decidedly negative The point is, though, that perhaps there wasn't a movement to tighten soon enough as the expansion progressed to avert that building up of inflation pressures This isn't to say that a sharp move of the sort I suggested might be necessary in order to achieve the Humphrey-Hawkins central tendency as a rate level you want to hold for a long period There might well be some need to move back up within a year or so But historically, the lows in this cycle don't look at all like the lows we have seen in short-term real rates in previous cycles, certainly in the postwar period   The real estate is an easier factor to consider The leveraging gets to be a little more difficult to pin down--ie whether firms really are cutting back their investment because of their debt loads There's some anecdotal evidence that would suggest that, but I don't know how powerful a force that is And we can see a significant amount of restructuring going on, with some of the firms that have leveraged themselves up to the hilt being able in the current environment to reduce their interest burdens and to alter their debt/equity ratios in ways that ought to give them a little more room to maneuver I think the real estate problem is going to be there for some time and will weigh against a strong surge in the economy The fiscal policy picture--just the total setting aside from the current budget program--will remain less than stimulative, of course So, there are some things that [appeared] in the past in recoveries and early expansions that aren't going to be there this time But the higher the growth rate, the lower the unemployment rate; and the less slack in the economy, the greater the risks are that you're not going to make the kind of progress toward lower rates of inflation that we have in this forecast And that even might just    11/5/91  be cut off entirely if we get a strong enough [trajectory] So, these are the risks one has to weigh at this point as to whether the economy is going to prove weaker than is acceptable and whether the inflation rate might be more stubborn than we've anticipated I must say there seems to be a lot skepticism among forecasters with outlooks for economic activity that don't differ greatly from ours about whether the disinflation trend can be sustained well into the expansion period--say, getting out into 1993 There is a sense that in the past the decline in inflation has stopped or has become very meager as people have sensed that the economy was on a solid growth track And that might be a concern   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, [the reliability of the] information we are getting from those data is a matter of considerable dispute among researchers I think there is considerable evidence that they do add something to the relevant data one has for judging what consumer spending is doing currently The increment to our knowledge of what will happen down the road is probably more limited We had basically taken it as a sign early on, when we saw the drop in last month's figures, that this was going to be a weak quarter for consumer spending; and I wouldn't want to read much more into it at this point   Well, I would duck that to anyone I could! If we had a strong conviction about what the composition and magnitude of any package would be, given our guess that something is going to happen, we would have put it in We really don't know There are significant differences among the packages, [such as] emphasis on actions that would reduce the cost of capital versus other things that would provide a rapid transfer of income to middle class households or whatever These things vary considerably and their impacts would be significantly different, I think, in timing and potential dimension   Well, that fact was one of the reasons--and I think we at least hinted at it--why we didn't put it in I do think    12/17/91  they still feel somewhat constrained at this point by the size of the budget deficit and the Budget Act itself No one seems to be talking about really large net fiscal impulses, so we felt we wouldn't be missing much by not including the package in the forecast at this point and merely suggesting that the direction is likely to be stimulative but probably not very large   Well, the change in computer deflators that went into the index is a major factor in the change in this forecast   But we've also anticipated, in light of the stalling out of overall activity, that there's going to be a greater deferral of equipment spending So there's an element of fundamental change in the forecast I might also note that the revisions in the national income accounts give a larger weight to nonresidential construction in business fixed investment And given that that's a very weak component in the forecast, that also tends to damp the expansion of business fixed investment in this forecast   It's the output that we're talking about   There's probably also some greater volume of net mortgage financing and it's clearly at the long end   There's a very modest pickup from the fourth quarter   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we do think that the outside world is perhaps overestimating the inflationary effects of this moderate growth and underestimating the effects of what is generally perceived to be a continuing fairly sizable amount of slack in the economy So, I think the possibility of diminution in the markets' inflation fears is a significant one Also, as people perceive that only moderate growth--if we are right--is ahead, that will ease some people's fears that we might be opting to do something that could close the margin of slack more rapidly I have the sense that perhaps long-term rates have moved up into the range in which they have been fluctuating for a while without a particularly sound basis and that we can simply have some reversal But I think the fundamental factors are the moderate    3/31/92  course in the expansion we see and the continuing slack that should be bringing the inflation rate down, not stabilizing it or pushing it up as most outside forecasts have it   I feel reasonably confident that it is a process that is ongoing Certainly, to the extent that there is any evidence, formal or informal, companies indicate that they would like to have lower inventory/sales ratios In manufacturing, while there has been some considerable progress, firms still are redesigning their production processes, their relationships with suppliers, and their overall inventory management, to trim inventories And as we noted before, we've yet to see the benefits of inventory management techniques and utilization and so on in the retail and some wholesale sectors that we might have hoped for, and we think there's potential there as well But, certainly, the consolidation of the retail sector, if that continues, ought to work a bit in that direction So, there's still likely to be a trend movement and it's inherent in our forecast We have a very modest rate of inventory accumulation; late in 1992 and in 1993 the inventory/sales ratio is drifting down [in our forecast] We're drawing our lesson much more from the trends of the last long expansion than from what one might have seen in earlier cyclical upturns So, in a sense it's either a cushion or we've captured a trend that's probably continuing   That is obviously hard to assess It's to some extent a matter of gauging what people's desires are and those could change over time A simple examination of what happened, particularly in the motor vehicles area, is that we look for trends in motor vehicles per household The trend in the stock of motor vehicles has varied in constant dollars We look at the equations that we have for automobile demand, such as they are, which estimate a desired stock given operating costs, interest rates, and those sorts of things All of these seem to point toward some shortfall We're not sure how much it is Drawing some trend lines we get something like 1-1/2 to 2 million units at present We are aware of the forecasts within the industry, which are based on the notion that there may be a 3 million unit shortfall--pent-up demand as it were Basically, our forecast is one that, given the basic replacement needs, doesn't really make any substantial progress in overcoming that Again, one might view this as possibly a small upside risk That as this expansion proceeds people will want to replace some of those cars which are now, in terms of median age, considerably older than people used to live with Maybe the cars are better; maybe we don't need to return [to trend]; but there does seem to be some possible backlog of demand there  Other areas we don't see so clearly There has been a very sharp downturn in expenditures on other durables and on some nondurable items that one might think of as lasting some span of time Conceivably, there's some backlog of desired spending there We haven't built it in; it isn't readily visible in other data on stocks for durable goods, for example The past year or so has been a period  -11-    3/31/92  of extraordinarily weak consumer spending and we think there's some backlog and buildup   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we've felt that the balance of risks also was more even in the last couple of forecasts than it had been through much of last year And I think we repeatedly flagged what we perceived to be the asymmetry of the probability distribution through last year We are reasonably comfortable with this forecast as presenting fairly balanced risks I think each of the items that you mentioned is a plausible story The one reservation I would have in light of the recent data is that the latest housing market data are disappointing relative to even our meager expectations We probably had about as low a forecast for second-quarter housing starts as anyone and yet the April figures--one month admittedly--do paint a weaker picture   Rates have come down and some observers sensed that people were beginning to look at home buying as they would look at car buying They had to feel there was a bargain You know, the government offered rebates early in the year and people rushed to buy We had not attached a lot of importance to that at the time, but in retrospect it may have pulled forward some housing starts from later    5/19/92  in the year, or certainly some home sales And we're not exactly sure where we are   I think they're reasonably balanced here   Let me give you the arithmetic [to the extent] that we are able to do these translations Every number that has come in since the BEA's initial estimate has been higher than they had anticipated, at least until the revision for the March housing starts, which had only a small impact If you cumulate those figures, you come out at this point with about a 4 percent increase in GDP That's assuming that the merchandise trade figure comes in right on their assumption It could be higher; it could be lower Our feeling was that all these additional goods being sold might be tilting the risks toward some lower [trade figure] So, that's where we are, and I think it's a fair statement at this juncture Now, BEA will confront the same anomalies that I noted, and they will have to take that into account They have some room to maneuver, but I think we should expect a substantial revision   Indeed It's looking backward, but I don't think everyone has caught up with this I see that a number of private analysts have been talking in the last week or so about growth of around 3 percent, and they will probably refine that a bit So, it's unlikely to be a total shock, but it's coming in on the high side of expectations, well on the high side   Explicit decline!   Well, I'm not sure how one would define the "recent" trading range If you look at the period since early    5/19/92  February until recently, I think we're pressing against the lower limits [of that range] this morning, and we could conceivably break below that Looking at the broader time frame going back, with bond yields having gotten down to about 7-3/8 percent, that's about the dimension of the decline that we're anticipating in our forecast by early next year I think the answer to your question depends on what circumstances bring about this failure [of long rates to decline] If it is a buoyant economy and strong demands for capital, then obviously it's not a problem If it is higher inflation expectations, we get into some more complex issues about how that might affect the affordability of housing and so on; but if it's inflation expectations and not real rates, again it may not be a compelling negative If it's risk premia brought on by political uncertainties--and this may be a year of tremendous political uncertainty--or just the wrong expectations, as we've had on some occasions, that could be a negative So it's really hard to say ex ante   Well, let me just say that I think we noted in the last Greenbook, not this one, that we didn't find the narrower monetary aggregates nor the enhanced narrow monetary aggregate that you're implicitly describing as providing strong evidence on the outlook Historically, we haven't found that these provide all that much better guidance than M2 as it is, with all of what I view as flaws in the logic of its construction But I'd also argue that in telling the story about how money affects inflation, there's a short- run transmission mechanism which I think would run through the pressures of aggregate demand on aggregate supply Thus, I think our assessment of the pressures in resource markets is very relevant to the short-run outlook for inflation through 1993 So, I can segment these questions to some extent   Well, I guess I'm skeptical about the meaning of the monetary aggregates right now I'm not inclined to assign a large asymmetry to the risk just because the monetary aggregates have been running low Clearly, that's a judgment call Others have differed, and perhaps wisely, in looking at the progress of this recovery But one also needs to interpret why the aggregates are behaving the way they are and whether it is demand shifts or changes in the structure of intermediation and so on that may be neutral in terms of their implications for the cost and availability of credit to support it   Well, as a general matter, we would perceive the interest sensitivity of the housing sector as being reduced from what it once was, in part because of reduced market segmentation--the elimination of the non-price rationing effects that occurred a couple of decades ago when rates moved above Reg Q ceilings and we got disintermediation The introduction of ARMs might work in the same direction, but how important that is isn't clear There's a question on mortgage rates Some people have been able through considerable effort to tease out of econometric equations some suggestion that people will wait until the rates have come down and they don't think rates are going to go down any further before they will move But that is a very short-run phenomenon and it doesn't seem to be a very important result over significant spans of time  On the price side, it depends on which model you think is most relevant There's an affordability model, which clearly does have some importance That looks at mortgage rates and prices and at that combination relative to income; and that says that we have had a considerable improvement in affordability over the past couple of years On the other side, if you look at an investment model, a user- cost model, it says that it's cheaper to own a home when you're getting capital gains So expected price movements would be important in that model Basically we've taken a middle-ground view saying affordability is better and the fear that people will be losing their shirts in owning a home is probably abating because house prices generally have firmed some over the past year It's a hard call to make as to which of these things is most important I think what we've seen recently, as I was suggesting, is that people are very sensitive to a number of aspects of this They jumped when they saw those mortgage rates get down to low levels and when there was the first-time home buyer credit [proposal] They seemed to have pulled back very sharply when rates backed up and the credit [proposal] evaporated An environment in which people are still rather uncertain about their employment and income prospects is a fragile situation And, going back to President Parry's comment, if we can begin to get, without generating strength solely out of the housing sector, some reasonable growth going here and some confidence in employment prospects, then people may move in response to this vastly improved affordability, and we could get a significantly stronger housing expansion than we have forecast We're certainly operating at low levels even given the prevailing demographic trends   Well, it's not bad news The question is how much good news there is in these numbers We've looked at the history and a lot of other analysts have too Some have declared that there is some lead, particularly in the early phases of an upturn, in the household employment series relative to the payroll series Others have said that's just not a very robust relationship We find hints, but [the relationship] doesn't seem to be highly reliable The fact is that in the payroll series the Bureau of Labor statistics make an allowance for new business formations as well as the closing down of businesses And it is a little murky how they do this It is conceivable that they're underestimating the rate of new business formations if the economy is picking up and that that is biasing the change downward But as I suggested, looking at corollary evidence entirely separate from these things--such as initial claims and the responses in the Conference Board surveys about job availability--all these other things don't suggest that employment is growing at 300,000 plus a month [Actual growth] may be somewhere in between but I'm more inclined to think it may be closer to the payroll trend at this point than to the household trend   Well, as you know, I've not been an enthusiast of that view and have worried that that was more a coincidence Typically, we have thought of there being a lag between changes in money growth and changes in GDP So, the close timing last year I think was not necessarily in line with what we normally consider the relationship to be Whether a one-quarter lag in velocity gets at this or not is another question I think we're looking at a period of slow growth of money that stretches back a few years now And in a sense we haven't gotten some of the payoff [in] disinflation that some might have anticipated If [the economy is] growing at the rate it appears to be, that doesn't quite seem to fit But I don't want to state the case excessively strongly either There may have been a message--and it may show up in the second quarter or the third quarter--from that weakening money stock growth last year   Well, without being too precise in this, we've seen some evidence in the first quarter of a very big jump in profits A sizable move at this point wouldn't be surprising in terms of the historical relations, which suggest an acceleration in output growth that produces an acceleration in profits As things level out, as productivity increases begin to move back toward trend, we get a little additional pressure on the profit margins even though the rate of compensation increases is diminishing And thus we get this leveling out of the profit share and in the pattern we see for total corporate profits It may be that profits should be trending up a bit more That certainly would be more consistent with the view that I think prevails among private analysts, which has consumer price inflation stabilizing or increasing in 1993 Those people tend to see continuing upward movement in corporate profits   I think it's very difficult to read what the stock market is building in here But looking at this year's profit forecasts, recognizing that the PE ratios are distorted by extraordinary factors in 1991 that may be unwinding in 1993, we can see a movement of PEs at current stock price levels back into the high teens, still at a high level historically But later on this year things will not look as out of line as they do now And if interest rates are stable or coming down, this all hangs together fairly plausibly It's on the high side of history but plausible I sense the market probably is taking a view that with expansion come firmer prices and that profits will be a bit better in 1993 than we forecast   Well, the repercussion is that had we ended up with the level of sales we are running at with lower inventories as per the initial estimate, that would have been a bullish factor for the economic outlook As it is, though, we don't see that there is a gross inventory imbalance coming out of the first quarter except for the wholesalers And in fact in the nondurable wholesale area there are not very many signs of inventory/sales ratios being high Our expectation is, though, that inventories are going to be managed very cautiously and that quite possibly wholesale inventories will run off some Manufacturers show no inclination to see their inventories rise We expect to see some runoff of inventories for a little while longer but at a lower rate than even the reduced pace that we think the first quarter produced So that means that inventory investment makes a small positive contribution in the second quarter in our forecast and a considerably greater contribution in the second half of the year as we see a swing to a mild rate of accumulation as sales trends continue positive   I'm deferring to my colleague, Mr Stockton, this morning in light of my absence through much of the period He's more on top of the forecast  MESSRS STOCKTON and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  -11-    8/18/92   On these July figures, I think last time in the Chart Show one of the exhibits I showed indicated that [the housing data] had been somewhat out of whack in the past several months We were getting a much higher level of single-family starts than customarily goes with the level of new home sales we had observed The level of starts in the latest month is well aligned with the permits--it had been running high relative to permits--and it's well aligned with the recent pace of new home sales Our supposition is, though, that we are in a period when new home sales are rising There will be some eating away of inventory And attitudes are favorable for home buying apart from the concerns about the general economic environment Certainly, home buyers perceive interest rates as being attractive So we'll see permits and starts rising a little  -12-    8/18/92   New home sales are reported fairly promptly after a sales contract is signed, but we don't have data for July And there are slight lags; [sales are] a little behind when these lower interest rates should have had their effect   The recent data have been favorable on balance for consumer spending Car sales haven't been great, but retail sales have been good and orders for capital goods have been pretty good There just isn't any reason to think that we are falling off from this somewhat erratic but generally steady trend of slow growth We only have 2-1/2 percent growth [forecast] for the fourth quarter If we were to fall short of that by a percentage point, the Okun's law relation would add only a touch to the unemployment rate So, it gets back to what Dave has been emphasizing in terms of these uncertainties about the labor market relationship per se What is happening with productivity and what is happening with labor market participation?  -13-    8/18/92   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It's a difficult question I think many people in different positions perceive the effects of changes in short-term rates differently A retiree living on the proceeds of short-term deposits would not see an improvement coming from lower short-term rates A business that has a heavy load of short-term floating rate debt or debt that rolls over frequently is going to achieve some significant improvements in the bottom line from the decline in interest costs I think it is fair to say that some of the channels of positive influence from declining rates have been somewhat diminished in their effectiveness in the past couple of years because such sectors as commercial real estate are just so far out of kilter in terms of the fundamentals of supply and demand that making borrowing cheaper is not going to make new investments particularly profitable It may enhance property values to some degree and diminish the write-downs that will occur, but we're not going to get quite the stimulus we would have in other circumstances Similarly, to the extent that credit availability has been the problem for some classes of borrowers, a small reduction in rates probably is not going to make a very great difference  But there are a lot of borrowers for whom lower rates will make a considerable difference I think we've seen that the decline in rates has significantly abetted the balance sheet restructuring process I think lower rates have played a role in sustaining relatively high valuations in the stock market and probably have cushioned the falls in a variety of other asset values We have not argued that modest changes in short-term rates are going to make a    10/6/92  night and day difference, but if you feel that there is nothing else here to provide a great deal of push to the economy over the next few quarters, our assumption of a decline in long rates looms rather large as a factor in the projected acceleration And the question becomes one of whether some easing of short rates is needed to facilitate that process If people thought that the Fed was overdoing it and that the implication of the easing was that we would have significantly higher inflationary pressures down the road and that we wouldn't reverse course in a timely way, then we might not get the beneficial effects in the bond market My sense is that unless the Fed went to 1 percent on the funds rate tomorrow--if the movement was gradual--that in the context of weak economic indicators we are more likely to get the "too little too late" complaint than we are the notion that we've overdone it and have shifted to a grossly inflationary posture So, there are a lot of things to weigh here But, as we suggested, I don't think we should ignore the fundamental notion that on balance easing probably does give us some stimulative effect It's a very long answer   I'm confident that we don't have any evidence to support that but no evidence to counter it either It's hard enough to discern a general phenomenon of a lower propensity to spend out of interest income in general They refine it to that point I don't know that anyone has even endeavored to do that By postwar standards this is rather an extraordinary episode in terms of the dimension of the decline in interest income, partly because we started the rate decline early and there's a lag effect here as instruments roll over I'm not sure we have a great historical sample from which to try to discern those [relationships]   This is the income-to-price effect We have the classic question here about how interest rates will affect consumption and savings   Their target is trying to get current income    10/6/92   Well, I suppose we ought to be more uncertain [given that] we have been disappointed in our prior thinking, but I don't conceive of it as more uncertain, though it's still very uncertain I think the risks are reasonably balanced at this point One might argue that we have tipped the scales in a more negative direction by taking the position we have on productivity, in a sense making the personal saving rate more directly a function of what is going on in the labor market But I think this forecast is no more certain in the end than our prior forecast was We've been less than confident for some time now about what was going on   Your question raises an interesting issue about the consumption behavior that we've observed because consumption has not been stronger than one might have expected given the usual determinants So, that would suggest it has been running fundamentally even weaker if this phenomenon is--   I guess the simple answer would be that we don't have that in our forecast There could be a tradeoff between the direct effects of lower taxes on income or higher expenditures on activity that would eliminate the need and probably tend to elevate long rates relative to what they are in our scenario   Yes It's an open question, of course, whether rates are now higher than they would otherwise be if there were not already considerable concern about the possibility of some significant enhancement in the size of the budget deficit So, it's a little [hard] to sort out what the effects would be; but I can envision circumstances, as you're suggesting, in which the bond markets would be adversely affected at least temporarily   I can't say that we have a lot of company in this projection There are some other forecasters who are looking for that kind of rate effect, but it is clearly not what is built into the market structure at this point There are always uncertainties about liquidity premiums in the term structure, but I don't think it's built into the market now nor is it necessarily clear that the forecasters generally are talking about this But it's interesting, I might note, that most private forecasters are anticipating flat or maybe even a slight upward tilt to long rates over the coming year or so A growth forecast of the dimensions we're showing here is also quite [common] so they're in essence saying that [a decline in long rates] isn't essential We're taking a bit more negative view of what the underlying strength of demand will be ex any effective fiscal stimulus, post-election surge in sentiment, or something   Possibly; it's hard to say Even before the employment report last week, having much the same information as we had, I sensed more positive expectations than we had For example, I attended a meeting of the technical [consultants] of the Business Council last Tuesday and the prevailing forecast--there was a slight lag in this, admittedly--was for growth more around 3 percent without interest rate declines and without a general expectation of significant fiscal stimulus   For 1993   Well, I guess it could be viewed that way in the context of a prevailing expectation now that some small amount of easing is going to be occurring, which might have a little negative effect on bond yields if the market were disappointed, all other things equal Basically, as we were putting this forecast together, my sense was that given the behavior of the Committee what we were forecasting seemed highly probable and that, unless you switched gears, some slight further easing would be consistent behavior We did not assume anything that we felt was really material to the basic thrust of the forecast As we indicated, we are thinking only of a small fractional further decline in the funds rate as being in the range that underlies this forecast If our story is right, most of the decline in long rates that we have projected would occur even if the funds rate were held at 3 percent But that's a conjecture Basically what I said in my briefing was that we have the expansion beginning to pick up gradually fairly soon If something is wrong in our analysis, the only logical conclusion we could draw in terms of policy implications is that more needs to be done if you want to do at least as well if not better than the forecast We're falling short of what the Committee's expectations were for economic activity as it stands, so that was the conclusion we reached   Well, I don't have anything new to add As we've noted in the past, there is possibly some measurement bias toward higher inflation than in truth is occurring That probably has prevailed for some time It could conceivably be getting worse, but that's even harder to judge The 1 to 1-1/2 percent inflation that I held out as a possibility sometime out toward the middle of the decade could be interpreted in light of the scientific evidence available as being essentially price stability So, if I were at DRI, I would probably title this a price stability forecast We are following a path very much akin to what we've outlined in the past Dave Stockton and his colleagues in briefings to the FOMC have indicated possible paths to price stability; and inadvertently in terms of what our forecast have been, we've been on that unemployment path for the last couple of years and our forecast continues on that path in essence We're on a gradual path back toward full employment in this forecast but it's far enough down the road that we'd be making a lot further progress on disinflation   Well, nothing obvious on nominal GDP--there may be some tricks of measuring here that would have an effect--but real GDP presumably is being underestimated But then so, too, is  -15-    10/6/92  potential GDP in some sense The benchmark I think you want to put an eye on here is capital resource utilization The unemployment rate isn't affected by any of these measurement issues and it has been trending upward in this recovery We expect it will be going up further, so there is room by that measure for the economy to grow faster; no matter how fast it is growing, it can grow faster than it has been   Indeed, and that may go back a considerable ways into postwar history   There is no material change, for example, from the last forecast to this one in terms of the path for the long-term rate Now, I think we've gradually come down over the past several forecasts In 1992 basically long-term rates have followed the path we charted at the beginning of the year It took a lot of short-term rate decline apparently [Laughter] and that is something that one might want to consider in terms of the prospects for achieving the further interest rate decline that we have forecast Whether we would be where we are now if we had not had those cuts in short-term rates is difficult to say On the one hand, we wouldn't have had the pull from those short rates punishing people who don't go out and invest at the long end On the other hand, we probably would have reduced aggregate demand to some extent and lowered inflation expectations and tended to lower nominal bond yields But we've been saying for some time that we expect the long rates to come down significantly over the forecast period   May I correct something I said? While the interest rate decline going out to 1994 is essentially the same amount as before, in light of the weaker economy over the next few quarters we've moved that decline up in time somewhat More of it occurs quickly So, on this forecast we have somewhere between 1/4 to 1/2 point more decline by next spring than before; then the rate flattens out more as the economy picks up   I've seen a few, but I think the more predominant notion is that the recent weakness in economic indicators just seems to make a compelling case in light of the past patterns of behavior of the Committee   We in essence have the real short-term rate moving back toward what might be regarded as more the equilibrium level in the longer run as we use up some of the slack in the economy to insure that aggregate demand doesn't overshoot a disinflation path Our assumption is that we have reached further in the direction of relatively low real short-term rates, below what would be sustainable in the long haul We have it coming back up some Another factor in this is that we are getting some extra retardation in a sense in the financial sphere now from the credit crunch and other experiences in the financial system As those ease, some adjustment in the nominal market and real market rates would be called for in order to exert adequate restraint on aggregate demand   Well, we're thinking of this more in terms of a link from real interest rates to spending decisions And there's a whole dynamic here of activity and resource utilization and inflation; the inflation results do affect expectations about future inflation That gets built into the bond yields and so on   But I think it's not a sustainable relationship here to have inflation running at 2 or 3 percent and inflation expectations remaining at 4 or 5 percent Something has to give Either those inflation expectations will prove such a serious impediment to lower wage agreements and provide some momentum somewhere in the price system that we won't get the disinflation we have [forecast] or, as experience builds that the norm is not the 5 or 6 percent inflation we've experienced over the last two decades but 3 percent or 2 percent, there's going to be an adjustment The experience to date suggests that the brute force effect of slack in the system has been able to overcome any stickiness in this inflation expectation that's evident in the consumer surveys or even many professional economists forecasts Indeed, we pointed out over the past year that it didn't appear that the private economists were generally expecting inflation to come down further in the latter part of this year or 1993 I've seen a shift in that I think there is more movement in our direction We're still a bit ahead of the average in our expectation about the disinflation progress, but there is a change Some of you have noted that businessmen increasingly are thinking that they are going to have to do their planning in a pricing environment that is going to be more consistent with lower inflation   Well, I will confess that we never did, [at least] on the straight P* form--though there are elements of the P* model that are very much consistent with our models That is, the output gap there is the critical lever in lowering inflation, and that is equivalent to the aggregate model we're using Obviously, the money growth numbers don't argue against our forecast; they argue for an even more rapid deceleration of prices And if you believe that money is behaving in a normal way, then I guess you'd want to argue that we grossly [over]stated where the inflation rate is going to be in 1993-94   You might think about whether it makes sense!   [Statement--see Appendix]   Mr Chairman, I might note that I heard an oil company economist last week cite figures that ran something like this About a year ago, there was a mix of oil rigs in the mid-400s and gas rigs in the mid-300s; now that has flipped So it's about the same    11/17/92  overall level but the mix has shifted toward gas with those firmer prices   I don't want to venture a political judgment, but--   I can't argue with the direction of what you're saying It would look like reduced budget deficits That might be favorable for the financial markets but they would also perceive the cost-push and worry about it translating, unless monetary policy were very restrictive, into ongoing higher inflation So, it's hard to say how that would net out as a bond market shock   I think so I'm not sure what kinds of changes you're assuming, but if they are mandated health care, mandated expenditures on training--though I gather there may be some signs of a backing away from that--they would enter the cost structure one way or another and tend to be passed through   Incidentally, the [revised] third-quarter GDP number is 34 percent Maybe there was something; I don't know If there was, we missed it, obviously Another possibility is that all those quarterly numbers will be revised in ways that will alter our perception of where we went wrong To be sure, we are trying to forecast numbers that are consistent with the current scheme of estimation, but there is an erratic quality in this One wonders whether the fourth quarter of last year was as low and then the first quarter as high, and so on, or whether there are some flaws in the numbers We pointed out that at this point through the first three quarters of the year--at least before today's revision--there was a somewhat puzzling, growing discrepancy between the income and expenditure sides of the accounts All of these things I think you need to recognize as the [unintelligible] pattern of errors But I don't know what magic forecasting tool we missed I will remind folks that in May or June you were presented with an analysis of how we had disregarded the information from M2 It suggested that our forecast should have been revised down to 1-1/2 percent for the third quarter and for the fourth quarter So, M2 at that point wasn't the missing forecasting tool, at least applied the way that particular model presented it I just don't know what it was   Well, let me say two things One is that after having lowered the real short-term rate, even stability means that the time profile of growth rates of GDP will show a bulge and then will come back down as the level effect peters out The growth rate effect disappears and becomes negative But we've added on to that a rise in nominal short-term rates in 1994 plus the further modest deceleration of prices, which enhances the increase in real rates And, yes, the rise in real interest rates in 1994 is a factor in this forecast   Just to be clear on why we've done what we've done Obviously, we need to make some decision about what assumption to base the forecast on In this case we're making some judgment about where the Committee desires the economy to head Starting with one rather simple observation, which is that real short-term rates now are very low and lower than we think would be consistent with some steady state, and secondly that the other financial restraints in the system will presumably diminish over time as capital positions of financial intermediaries improve and so on, it seemed to us that at some point the short-term rate should go up We could have postponed that until beyond 1994, but in our assessment of the trends in the economy that ran the risk of overshooting going out into 1995--hitting full employment and tending to head through it and thus reversing the disinflation process We could fine-tune this, but that is the basic sense of what is behind the interest rate outlook   Well, the reduction in inflation was less than the nominal interest rate change We notionally put in about 3/4 of a percentage point increase in the nominal federal funds rate The disinflation at that point is progressing at several tenths per year So, it's a small element in this rise in real rates    12/22/92   Our notion is that, yes, there are natural equilibration processes in the system With adequate monetary expansion, there are corrective mechanisms through the price system that ultimately push the system back toward [equilibrium] But those take time; and it's rather hard for us to define this in terms of some monetary path, given the uncertainties   I'd like to establish that in the past the Federal Reserve has shied away from enunciating a view about potential GDP growth, remaining agnostic and being prepared presumably to accommodate any positive surprise If the positive surprise on nominal GDP could be discerned to be a favorable supply shock, then accommodating it would be a more natural thing to do than if you felt it was a demand shock which tightened up markets and had inflationary consequences down the road But viewing nominal GDP targeting as your basic approach takes some things as given, as being relatively stable You may view this [approach] as a way of having an automatic stabilizer over time so that it would be natural to react if you're overshooting, with the thought that you would end up with some price pressures later [if you don't react]   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, not in specific detail But I think we have seen some improvement overall in margins over the past year or so There are still some sectors, though, where it has been very difficult--in some of the materials areas particularly, where prices have been soft and there has been a lot of discounting Now, we've seen circumstances where there has been some pressure put on capacity Firms are looking for price increases and in some instances getting them; steel is a clear example The steel industry has had extra help from our trade policies, but their bookings have been very strong and have stretched out some months They've had some price increases already that have stuck and they are looking for more And there are a few other places But it does seem to be only here and there that    3/23/93  we're really seeing much happening among materials prices Lumber is another obvious example Again, there are special supply stories More broadly, though, there is still considerable slack And we see some industries, chemicals and so on, that are still pretty hard pressed in terms of widening margins   You've asked a complicated question I might observe that there were times when our interest rate forecast was even lower for this period into 1993 than it was, say, at the time of the last meeting We got worn down a bit by the fact that the markets weren't responding to all that good news the way we thought they should be, so we tempered our [rate] decline somewhat I guess our notion involves two things One is the view that inflation would remain lower than the market was anticipating And that seems to have been the theme recently As was noted earlier, the market seems to have sloughed off the recent bad news on the price measures and still sustains this view that inflation, at least for some period of time, will be lower than the market seemed to have been worrying about earlier The other element in our thinking was that simply holding down short-term rates as we've assumed--it's not a prediction but simply a conditioned assumption in our forecast--would tend to pull down the long-term rates One explanation of the dynamics of the recent market movements that wasn't given a few minutes ago--well, I think there was some hint of it--is this People are simply growing impatient with the low yields they're getting; they're reaching for current income, and this gives us an inexorable pull on the long-term rates It took a bit of a psychological breakthrough, I think, to get us into the current zone Over recent years something in the low 7 percent area had been a floor to rates People had not adjusted their thinking to bonds possibly being a good buy at 7 percent or less, but we seem to have broken through that [barrier] recently And what we're anticipating going forward is that inflation still will be on the low side of expectations, that people will become more hopeful that the economy is not going to bound back up to high inflation rates, and that this persistence of low short-term rates will continue to push [investors] out on the yield curve We have only a mild further decline in long rates, though Our models, which I noted before seem to have performed quite well over time, now are again fairly well aligned with where bond rates are and would suggest that  -10-    3/23/93  we could still get a very large decline as people respond adaptively to the kind of news that we think there is going to be   Well, there may be some element of truth to that In fact, one story that we've heard is that the change in the perception about the likelihood of the Fed tightening over the next year has provided the bond markets with some encouragement   Indeed I think the other story about the fear of Fed tightening was consistent with the view that as soon as the cycle begins to show some substantial growth in the economy, we're going to have inflation picking up and the Fed will then respond to that So, these things do fit together But there are many strains that aren't entirely consistent   Indeed   Well, the difference in forecasted real growth is not a vast one between the two The rise in nominal short rates in the Blue Chip is offset to a significant degree by the acceleration of prices in assessing what their real short-term rate path is So, their real short rate path may not be vastly different from what we have in the forecast The differences may be less than meets the eye in terms of an underlying sense of what the determination of aggregate demand will be in this period--real activity  -11-    3/23/93   What we've noted before and we've hinted at recently is that we're not at all sure, given the kind of disinflation movement we anticipate, that this level of the funds rate is really sustainable all the way through 1994 This level implies a relatively low real rate, perhaps one that is not sustainable; and we think it's more likely that we'll see the rate higher rather than lower in 1994 and that there may be a need for some tightening as we look out beyond 1994 The other side of this is, of course, that there is going to be a clearer negative fiscal impetus as we move into 1995 and some of the pent-up demands will have been satisfied and so on It may be a little early to get particularly far out on a limb in predicting where interest rates will have to go, but our notion is that the movement is likely to be upward by 1995 and that perhaps there will be a need to move before then   Well, I think you're saying if things turn out stronger than--   Right I think what we saw for a while in the latter half of last year was stronger growth and very strong productivity and not much sign of any real deterioration in the price trends But we've gotten a bit of a pop in early 1993 What we see at this point is some evidence that inflation expectations really are currently higher than what we anticipated the outcome would be In a sense we may have to fight against that to push the inflation rate lower But if things turn out stronger, I think it will create not only a lower unemployment rate--less slack in that kind of Phillips curve argument for higher inflation--but it may also create a psychological environment in which pricing behavior becomes a bit more aggressive This is in a sense the speed effect that we've talked about, simply that the rapid growth may create some additional pressure That may be what we've seen in the deterioration recently We really did have a pickup and that may have given us a little of that Unemployment was coming down relatively rapidly   Real GDP   [Statement--see Appendix] Thank you, Mr Chairman I apologize for the unusual length   Well, as I noted, we're trying to understand why things have been going the way they have Certainly, supply conditions [are] a possible explanation That was something that was at least in our minds as we were doing this But basically the bigger driver in this was simply a recognition that the trends had not been developing as we had anticipated and were carrying through higher levels of inflation throughout and moderating somewhat further the tradeoff; in a sense, we were getting less bang for the unemployment [buck] from here on But it's very much a level adjustment that is involved here   Nothing more than what I suggested It's not going to [unintelligible] a separate matter from the tradeoff if you feel that in effect the NAIRU has been raised It is simply that the gap is small--   The tradeoff could be affected if the expectations formation process is different than the backward-looking version that's inherent in a simple Phillips curve model But again,  -11-    5/18/93  it's hard to say whether that's a level adjustment we're making or a tradeoff adjustment We simply tried to recognize the tendencies we've seen and to be a shade less optimistic, going forward, about the tradeoff between unemployment and disinflation These are rather small adjustments in a sense   Well, we think it's probable that weather chipped a bit off of the first-quarter growth We could see some disruption, some temporary loss at least, of output in industrial production But I don't see a correlation between those output losses and the price pressures I see it certainly in vegetable prices Clearly, agricultural commodities have been affected by the weather and we see it in their prices But I don't think the steel price increases that were referred to earlier and the medical services price increases recently had any significant weather element So, while it's a nice simple conceptual analysis to say "Well, we reduced the supply and the prices went up," I really don't think that was what has accounted for the uptick in the inflation trend   Well, in the overall CPI it was an element recently But we're really focusing on the core CPI, recognizing that within a few months we should move back to normal supplies of fruits and vegetables and then the price level of food should return to the basic trend So, this is not a significant element in our analysis   Indeed Overall inflation undoubtedly is important as well as the core in determining peoples' expectations about the future, or what they perceive to be acceptable increases in wages, and so on But I don't think weather is the story here   But clearly we have had an exchange rate movement and slack in the Japanese economy Both of those things have tended to boost the prices of Japanese automobiles and have provided an umbrella for domestic manufacturers They started off the year with relatively generous incentives that held down the seasonally adjusted prices They've been able to take those off; they raised a few list prices And I think this is certainly influenced by the developments in the foreign exchange market As the Chairman noted, in steel there has been a marked reduction in imports and there has been considerable pressure on supply in some parts of the steel market There is some uncertainty about whether that's going to persist in the coming months Of course, this will depend in part on decisions that are made about protectionist measures Basically, the improvement in profits has largely conformed to the typical pattern of profits moving up with an acceleration in activity and a related jump in productivity I assume we've had a rather typical cyclical pattern in that respect   Well, on net, there probably has not been a very great influence to date The Japanese automobiles are one story, but exchange rates against other currencies haven't been adverse So, overall import prices have not been rising very rapidly at all In fact, for the first quarter, non-oil import prices are estimated to have declined So I don't think to date that we've seen, overall, a major unfavorable impact from import prices In particular areas it has been a factor   I think we all recognize the dangers of pegging nominal interest rates It is not an automatic stabilizer And if the pattern has been relatively stable, it has been because of various offsetting factors I would say that coming into the first quarter we initially expected growth in the high 2 percent area for the quarter with a lower inflation path As things have turned out, we may yet approach that real forecast but the price numbers clearly have been unfavorable Going forward, you are correct that--as we noted in a footnote in the Greenbook--in essence the higher inflation trend and what we would take probably to be somewhat higher short-run inflation expectations than we had been expecting earlier do imply a somewhat lower real short-term interest rate The question is whether at that level we are providing sufficient stimulus to offset the fiscal drag and other drags in the system now Or perhaps, on the other side, is this excessive monetary stimulus? As has been noted, we don't see it in terms of rapid money growth on average We don't see it yet in terms of rapid nominal GDP growth But in due course it's conceivable that we would see that this [policy] was excessively stimulative Our sense has certainly been that as we move along there would likely be some tendency for the real short-term interest rate to rise But we do have to recognize that at least out through 1994, if this fiscal program is adopted, there is going to be a very large tax increase and a very substantial amount of fiscal drag So the point at which this becomes an unsustainable real short-term rate may not be imminent; it may be some time down the road At least that's the implication of our analysis   The simple analysis might lead you to expect lower real interest rates But if you believe that inflation expectations are based on either some primitive notion of how deficits cause inflation or a more sophisticated one about the risks of future [monetization] then, yes, we could get also some narrowing of the inflation premium In either case we would have had some offset from the beneficial anticipatory effects of the fiscal action We think those are probably already behind us, but I'm not sure Back to the question that Bill addressed earlier, what could happen here would be an important, pleasant surprise that would be a big boost for the bond market At this point, I think people recognize that there's a budget resolution out there with which they have to contend Most likely [Congress] will do something that at least nominally meets those requirements No one, I think, is anticipating a vastly larger or vastly smaller deficit reduction than is currently being discussed  -14-    5/18/93   Well, as I should remind everyone, our presumption has been that even if this were legislated by sometime in 1994 the phase-in would be long and the effects within our projection period would be almost solely those based on expectations Our presumption would be that an increase in mandated costs relating to payrolls would be passed on only gradually to the workers in the form of lower wages and that the hit would be primarily on the price side in the short run   Well, that depends on whether monetary policy accommodates that kind of supply-side shock Clearly, the monetary policy response to that, as it would be to any other jump in exogenous forces, is critical But if this provided opportunities for much larger consumption of medical services to people, there presumably would be some offset on the demand side   I don't think I can give you any useful sectoral breakdown On your question of the long-term versus short-term expectations, could you repeat that one for me?   Our indicators of long-run expectations are rather volatile from month to month and my sense is that in general they haven't moved much recently They came down some earlier in the recovery, but recently I don't think there is a particularly discernible trend The Michigan Survey has bounced around in the 5 percent neighborhood A survey that is a successor to the Hoey Survey shows a similar pattern, except that it's more in the 4 percent neighborhood, but I don't discern a big change there On the short- term side, what is notable is that we have not had any consistent further lowering and there's perhaps a little firming if one wants to read it very finely But basically it has been a rather stable picture even as we got into the 3 percent CPI increase area for two years That's the impression I have  Let me go back to Governor Lindsey's question I suppose in general if people felt that they were more secure because this program offered them particular long-term care and some other safeguards against their wealth being depleted, then we could have in a sense a wealth effect that could be positive for consumption in the short term apart from the fact that the cost of medical services for some part of the population might have been lowered   I always thought being audible got me into more trouble! I thought the example set by Mr Volcker and Mr Corrigan might be the one I should follow, but I'll try to follow my colleagues' example this morning Having asked the Committee to endure a very long presentation last month I shall be quite brief this morning [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think we had some discussion of this in the Greenbook Pinning down the amount of the leasing transactions with consumers is a little difficult There is some survey evidence that we're aware of that suggests that perhaps a quarter of the consumer car sales have leases And that does seem to have been the way that the major manufacturers have gone as a substitute to some degree for the kind of price shaving they previously had done--rebates and other techniques Clearly, they've been trying to firm up their    8/17/93  margins One step was to diminish the flow of cars going through the rental companies that come back as nearly new and are perceived as fairly close substitutes for the new cars That was partly a response to a general rise in retail demand, which meant they didn't have to sell the cars on concessionary terms [nor did] the rental car companies If demand remains on the uptrend we think we're seeing, and with the Japanese car prices likely to be under even more pressure than we might have anticipated in light of the further appreciation of the yen, there may be some further tightening up of that market, with some firming of prices either through less aggressive residual valuations on the leases or through other devices But I don't think we have that good an insight into what trick they're going to use   Well, they seem to have maintained incentives They've broadened them recently We don't think they are as deep or quite so broad as we've seen at the end of some other model year clearance periods because the stocks are pretty [low] So, we might enter the new year with less overhang of prior year models The "end of year" has gotten a bit vaguer We see new models coming out at different times of the year; and in the case of Chrysler, one of the reasons they're pushing so hard now is that they're going to be bringing out new models at the end of this year, sort of a '94-1/2 [model] So, there's a lot going on here Our sense is that there is a more moderate level of promotional activity going on than there was [at the same time] a year or two ago And that trend will probably persist for some period   Well, to be honest I can't give you a neat accounting on this We didn't perceive that the outcome was drastically different from what we've been assuming previously The major change was the smaller energy tax than we'd been anticipating We thought they'd come out somewhere between the House and the Senate [bills] and [in fact] there wasn't any concession [to the lower Senate version] [Unintelligible] reduction number they moved them to full    8/17/93  retro-activity for 1993 Other changes were quite minor And as we noted last time, the baseline from which we were measuring that tax deficit reduction last time isn't the same as the accounting that was going on here We perceived [the reduction] to be rather heavily on the revenue side A good bit of the indicated expenditure cut is attributable to the cumulative effects of the lower deficit on interest costs I suppose it's legitimate--it's an expenditure--but whether it's a high powered expenditure or not is another matter But we perceived that it's enough on the tax side and there's enough of a case to be made that the GDP aggregate demand effects of tax increases may be somewhat less than expenditure cuts to suggest that the damping effect on economic activity would be less than if they had gone as far as some had advocated on the expenditure side But we still see it as a substantial fiscal contraction, depending on how one looks at this-- liabilities or cash basis and so on It's either a tremendous restraint in 1994 or a substantial restraint in '93 and again in '94 So, we're looking at the consumption behavior and so on, and we would allocate some of that restraint to 1993   I don't think there is a lot of that in this There is obviously still talk of doing some things in terms of grazing fees and mining and so on; those aren't big dollars But, no, I don't think there is much of that in here   Mr Chairman, might I just add something? An earlier comment--the comment about the medical expenses--raises an interesting point One of the major savings on the mandatory spending side is the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid costs Economically one would anticipate a lot of cost shifting here, which might call into question exactly how one wants to view the quality of this expenditure reduction There are also some user fees, things like the FCC auction expectations and so on; but I think that medical cost issue is a very big one, looking back   A fellow named Hotchkis, his former colleague, does it It's a little below 4 percent   Well, there's a 5-year and a 10-year rate; they are both in the same ball park   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix   Well, I think you hypothesized a situation in which the consequences are obviously explosive If you held short- term rates too low for too long, initially through this term structure mechanism lowering the cost of capital below the equilibrium rate in the intermediate- and long-term end, you would generate excess demand and inflationary pressures Those inflationary pressures would mount over time Something would have to give; presumably at some point monetary policy would have to adjust in the proper direction But one of the reasons I have reservations about the model is that in a sense it doesn't include a place for people to recognize where things are headed and to have a more forward-looking response The latter could introduce an inflation premium earlier on and tend to override what this model's formulation would suggest And perhaps because we didn't move into those patterns of behavior the model didn't have those kinds of experiences from which to estimate So, I grant that this likely has limitations If I didn't feel that, we presumably would have a significantly different kind of forecast But the one thing that gives me pause, as I suggested, is that this model has worked remarkably well in the past, even the past decade I noted that it was fitted over 1958 to 1983, and even during the 1980s when there has been an acute sensitivity to inflation risks and what had happened in the past, the model has tracked quite well Other versions of the model, with the same sort of formulation, [have also tracked quite well] So it has gone through some difficult times and I think it does capture one element of human behavior, its adaptive expectations formation as people become accustomed to given rate levels But I would agree with you that in the extreme it's likely to break down   Well, President Jordan, that's the kind of very complicated question that I'd have to have in writing a week in advance, I think, to be able to do justice in answering it I don't think I've absorbed all of the threads We do have, obviously, in our forecast for 1993 a substantially less favorable mix of output increase and inflation We've gotten much lower growth than we anticipated and inflation has been running somewhat higher Now, curiously, the unemployment rate has not been higher than we anticipated; it has been lower, and that needs to be taken into account as well Furthermore, looking at the revised national income account data and at both the actual growth and our estimate of the potential growth, the output gap we've estimated tentatively at this point is somewhat smaller than we thought, not larger The actual growth has been revised up more than our estimate of potential growth So, in a sense the gap here that is exerting disinflationary pressure isn't larger than you thought; it's probably smaller Furthermore, we had earlier in the year what we view to have been some response to the surge in activity We think that is unwinding now, but on net thus far this year I don't think it has been helpful  I would really have to review a lot of detail here to be able to give a better answer to your question, but I don't think our basic model, in the sense of how this works, has changed We've had a few surprises What I've suggested in regard to the current forecast is that we see some underlying confirmation here of the scheme that we've been applying in our forecasting And that has led us to be a little more confident that we can extend the disinflationary trend going forward And we think that if growth for '95 remained moderate and unemployment remained close to where we have it, there would be an ongoing disinflation But we have not seen quite the favorable tradeoff that we anticipated, and the slack has been a shade less on average thus far   Well, we don't think that has affected the tradeoffs here but, as you know, at the beginning of the year we didn't introduce a fiscal package because of the uncertainties Then we introduced one that included fiscal stimulus because we wanted to follow the President's lead on this Ultimately, there was no near- term fiscal stimulus in the package; in fact, it probably moved the restraint forward in time beyond what anyone would have anticipated earlier And we now have a substantial amount of fiscal restraint in the forecast damping aggregate demand but not affecting the unemployment/inflation tradeoff Well, there are some elements here, [such as] gasoline taxes; an excise tax impact in a sense gives you a short-run deterioration in the tradeoff And there are other things that have been going on and that could still happen that will tend to raise the price level in the short run relative to what everyone--   Well, there are two things one could say One is that monetary policy can't be adjusted to offset shocks such as a change in fiscal policy I don't think there's an economic basis for that statement There may be difficulty in doing that because we can't anticipate with precision what will be occurring without a shift in monetary policy and there are uncertainties also about what the effects of a monetary policy change will be So, all those uncertainties may lead you to think it might not be desirable to attempt to engage in fine-tuning Certainly the Committee over the recent decade or so has in one way or another repeatedly made the statement that it realizes it would be impossible to be fully effective in fine-tuning and that there would be some risks in attempting to do that  In terms of advocacy, I would view that statement more as a positive statement than a normative statement It simply says that if you wanted to achieve this growth path, it might require low real short-term interest rates for a longer span We didn't advocate that particular outcome That's clearly the Committee's decision to make [It's up to the Committee] to weigh the risks that might attend the policy movement or no policy movement here in terms of whether you might end up with less output or more inflation or whatever than you desire We're attempting to be as neutral as possible here by taking as our essential assumption that the nominal funds rate remains fixed We aren't advocating that necessarily; we were just taking that as a    9/23/93  baseline and giving you something you can adjust from based on whether you feel the risks are different or that the fundamentals are going to push things in the stronger or easier direction   We have a very marginal increase in September for PCE We see a pretty healthy gain in the third quarter because of the data already in hand Real consumer goods expenditures other than motor vehicles seem to be well above the level of the third quarter, and service expenditures were running very strong early in the summer So, we think we have the likelihood of a strong advance there We see a flattening out, and arithmetically that works in the direction of a more moderate increase in the fourth quarter But we are basing that on income trends and attitudes and all the other factors that one might look to in explaining the prospects for consumption expenditures  GOVERNOR GREENSPAN Governor Angell   Well, we've alluded to this problem in the last couple of Greenbooks and there has been a great deal more discussion about this in recent weeks in the press, some of it by investment banking firms such as Salomon Brothers who have been calling attention to this issue It appears that a large number of corporations are in serious risk of having major underfunding in their defined benefit pension plans with these kinds of investment returns They've been very optimistic in maintaining high expected returns, [ie] in the assumptions they've used for determining their contributions They're going to be under significant pressure to make those more realistic And we would expect that there will be upward pressure on that component of employment costs That is not likely to be a gigantic effect We don't really have a good enough handle on it to size this, but we feel there's probably something there that is of significance in buoying increases in benefit costs While other items may be coming down, the overall deceleration seems likely to be limited by this factor   I think it's possible It's also possible--I don't think we have much evidence, though I've asked a few businessmen whether they can perceive this--that people may not opt for early retirement to the degree that they have in recent years because they may have lowered their expectations about what their assets will earn in the way of income over their retirement years I don't think we can see anything yet in labor force participation data to support this notion, but things may work in that direction We may see some tendencies toward a little less of that 55 to 64 year old male retirement that we've seen recent years   I might have   Well, the numbers in terms of the unified budget are distorted by the year-to-year movements in deposit insurance, so that the drop, for example, from fiscal '93 to fiscal '94 excluding deposit insurance programs is on the order of $40 billion If we look at the NIPA budget deficit numbers, we're going to get something like an $80 to $90 billion reduction in that deficit over a two-year span with roughly constant levels of resource utilization If we look at the structural budget deficits, while the CBO numbers and the OMB numbers show a flattening out as we go out several years, in the near term there are a couple of years of fairly substantial reductions in    9/23/93  the structural deficit Our own measure of fiscal impetus, looking at discretionary components, indicates a significant movement in the direction of restraint I think the direction is pretty clear, but gauging the economic significance is always problematic We interpret things as suggesting that in this period going out through '94 and maybe well into '95 the direction of fiscal policy is one of significant restraint   No As I said, this is a very simple model; and a small upward movement is just going to begin a process of altering the moving average, which in our model reaches back several years So, it's not going to have a major effect I think you have to ask whether this model is something you want to rely on in reaching a judgment, though The other questions are how low the rates have to go in order to get the outcome you want and how fast do you want to get there? Do you want to be patient? If you believe that rates might [move] as the model is suggesting, is that quick enough for you? Would you rather accelerate the process by cutting rates further, knowing that ultimately you probably are going to have to reverse course more dramatically down the road in order to move real rate levels to something that is more appropriate in terms of the longer- run equilibrium? But a small adjustment, in terms of this model, is going to be essentially meaningless   Right   Okay, let me address a couple of things very briefly One is that, as we are gauging it now, we believe that a reasonable estimate of potential output growth at this time is perhaps a shade below 2-1/2 percent So, it's very close to the growth rate of output that we are projecting If that is so, then all other things equal, one would expect the unemployment rate to be reasonably stable There are short-run uncertainties about labor force participation If it remained on the weak side, then one might anticipate a lower unemployment rate If it rejuvenated suddenly, the unemployment rate could easily go higher I'd say, looking at various models, that there is a very slight upside risk on unemployment  As for the inflation forecast, basically we've had about 3-1/4 percent over the past year for the core CPI We see it edging down to just under 3 percent over the next year or so This is not out of line with various models we look at Some of them would give more deceleration and some less It is a bit less favorable than we had been hoping a year ago, say, or at least at the beginning of this year We remain concerned that there is a certain momentum here that is supplied by expectations, which still have not adjusted downward among households, that appear to be in the 3 percent area We think part of the disinflation process will be a gradual adaptation of expectations to that kind of inflation; but in the near term it tends to keep wage increases a little higher than they would otherwise be We think we're in a reasonable middle ground, given the uncertainties that we feel Based on the experience of the past year or so, we think it would be a little aggressive at this point to lower that forecast further   I would anticipate that if the inflation outcome is also similar to what we're forecasting, those inflation expectations would come down But you are correct--   What I'm saying is that as inflation has remained low expectations have been adjusting and they will continue to do so   Well, I can't speak to all of the experimentations done over the years on this In the current model, there is only a minimal role for inflation expectations in the term structure determination And it's in [the model in] an arcane fashion It is possible that such a model as you hypothesize might be serviceable, but I suspect that we have experimented enough that this formulation has proven more robust I think saying that this model is nonsensical and totally at odds with reality runs up against the point that it does contain some very basic notions that people have talked about theoretically for a long time, and it has worked But I don't want to push that too far   Indeed   Let me say a couple of things One is that a 5 percent long-term rate, with inflation moving below 3 percent and a short-term rate around 3 percent, still looks like a high long-term rate if you go back to the early 1960s Now, if that's what people were thinking, perhaps about 3 to 4 percent inflation for the next X years--they were probably thinking 1 or 2 percent [in real terms] which is not inconceivable--   But in that case you'd be looking maybe for a 4 percent long rate   Well, to take minor issue with that, I think that perhaps is embodied even in some of your recent comments about what has been happening with the way investors have been moving into the stock and bond funds I think it's very much compatible   Those people are not necessarily thinking in any precise way about what inflation will be doing over the next 10 years They're saying "I just can't stay with these 3 percent rates forever" They are saying here that maybe [rates] aren't going to go back up, and they shift out [of CDs and the like] The model doesn't precisely specify the psychology, but it's compatible   Well, cumulatively, it's conceivable that it's non-negligible A number of things have happened over recent years where we've had various mandates that have added to the cost of production in one way or another or circumscribed supply But whether those things have been increasing in size on a trajectory that means faster inflation in recent years is very hard to say   Prospectively the same thing would hold The big issue hanging out there clearly is health insurance And we have not made an assumption on that in this forecast, in part because we've not yet ventured beyond 1994 I grant that we need to before very long because of the necessities of monetary policy strategizing But I don't expect that a program will be in place before the end of 1994 And it is likely to be phased in over several years in terms of the various costs So, whether it will show up as a sudden large boost to costs isn't clear I'm reminded of another thing we had in our earlier forecast, based on some trial balloons or whatever, and we've taken it out, which is a minimum wage increase The kind of minimum wage increase that is being discussed is only going to have a very small effect if implemented in 1994, maybe one-tenth of a percent  -11-    9/23/93   It's partly that [such costs] aren't readily measurable in terms of their aggregate price effects A bunch of little things have come along, all of which may tend to increase costs and in some cases are perhaps affecting the willingness of employers to take on full-time workers and so on So, there are broad effects And one of the reasons we have this rather subdued view of aggregate demand going forward is the thought that there will be a continuing burden of worry in the business community and among households about what government mandates may do to them over the years   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we have not assumed anything significant happening within 1994 We have the notion that things might start in that direction and then continue on gradually through 1995 I don't think the precise pattern is critical here Basically we've stretched our forecast horizon out through 1995 We would anticipate that as we move through 1995 into 1996, not knowing what will happen on important things like medical care and so on, there will be alleviation of some of the negative elements in the economic picture [at a time when] fiscal policy will no longer be exerting quite the drag it will through 1994 and perhaps into 1995 We expect that we will have worked our way further through the overhang of unoccupied commercial space and multifamily residences and so on and that by then there would be some assurance that foreign industrial activity will have picked up In general we think there may be an emerging stronger thrust to activity and that some tightening of policy may be called for in order to hold aggregate demand at a level that would be consistent with maintenance of some marginal slack in the system and thus the conditions that will promote some gradual further movement toward price stability This is in essence a matter of design, trying to capture at least in a rough way the objectives of the Committee over the intermediate term   I don't think there is a change in any fundamental way There are two things that we had in mind in this forecast One was we had to live for all practical purposes with the set of third-quarter data that existed Our suspicion was that that level of inventory investment in the third quarter was overstated by BEA They didn't have data for September, and that's why I focused some attention on that a couple of minutes ago As things turned out, it does appear to us, as best we can do the arithmetic--and this isn't easy--that there will likely be some downward revision to nonfarm inventory investment in the third quarter And we noted in a little subtle footnote in the Greenbook that using our best change approach, which addresses what the growth contribution of inventory investment would be, the numbers written on the green sheets are artificially high relative to our belief of what would be happening Basically we think that inventories are at reasonable levels now There are some sectors where they may be a bit lean, particularly at the manufacturing level We don't see large shortages; we don't see any real impulse coming here in the way of longer lead times and expectations of rising prices that would lead companies to want to stock up rapidly Essentially, with this adjustment we have inventory/sales ratios in the aggregate probably declining slightly over the forecast period And I think that's a continuation of the just-in-time modifications of inventory practices and so forth   Well, we're always constrained in terms of those level numbers but we don't think we have an exceptionally high rate of inventory accumulation here If some of those upside surprises that I suggested came about, those might be circumstances in which we might also get besides the extra final demands some greater inventory investment But we just don't see inventories as a tremendously dynamic element in the forecast; it contributes only a small fraction of a percentage point to GDP growth over the coming year   Yes, the BLS had a press conference this morning There are a number of changes that will be taking effect with the January household survey Some of these have to do in essence with concepts and the way various questions are asked and how the responses might be interpreted Others have to do simply with the mechanical procedure of the survey--the use of computers which will permit them to check out what the person in that household who has been in the survey in prior months had been saying; they have found that that sometimes alters the responses They've run this experiment now for the last year and they indicated this morning that the result of that experiment was that the unemployment rate they were getting for this overlap sample was 76 percent versus 71 percent on average for the regular series Whether this is a unique period of some sort that  -69-    11/16/93  might make this 1/2 point differential unrepresentative, one can't know for sure And there will be, I gather, a number of analyses of the difference issued over the coming year But it does appear that the methods they will be using will raise the measured rate of unemployment The question for us will be Is there any reason to assume anything other than that in essence the natural rate has risen 1/2 point and we just need to adjust our thinking, with due recognition of President Jordan's remarks, about what inflationary pressures might be implied by a given level of the unemployment rate   I don't believe so, and there's not going to be any endeavor to do historical revisions   Yes, and I'm sure [BEA] will be engaged in an educational effort But I suspect we'll have one confronting us, too, in February when we present the Humphrey-Hawkins report Now the public will be trying to educate us as to what we've missed all along   Presumably, if we were to adjust our forecast today, we would just tack 1/2 percentage point on there for lack of any alternative rationale  SPEAKER(?) Ouch!   Let me remind you that the change in the survey has not changed anything in the realities of the world It's a matter of how we understand them and perceive them  SPEAKER(?) Well, it's a political reality  SPEAKER(?) Yes it is   Mr Chairman, I think one could also note that because of the interpretation we made of what the System conference wanted in the way of an emphasis here we sort of set aside all the questions of what damage might be done in terms of the welfare lost from unanticipated inflation because people were not saving enough for their retirement There's a whole array of welfare costs that might go with high and unpredicted inflation So there's a whole other area to explore if one wanted to look for reasons one should be concerned about non-zero inflation   Well, we recognize that it's been very hard to establish, as it is on any macro issue, anything definitive out of this research But there were some analytical points that argue that low inflation could conceivably be better than no inflation We tried to experiment, but we also thought the mission was to try to put some empirical flesh on these analytical [bones] Some progress was made but we have to concede that the lack of certainty--  -3-    12/21/93   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the price performance this year relative to our expectation a year ago depends on which series you look at The GDP fixed weight price measure is now expected to be 3/10ths of a point higher than we expected for '93 a year ago So there are some crosscurrents in the price data There has been a modest--though we think significant in terms of whether it is consistent with out expectations of deceleration--slowing in core inflation over this past year We now are at a somewhat lower level of unemployment and a higher level, I think, of capacity utilization than we expected to be at this point We see in the compensation data, which we consider another important measure of some underlying costs trends, no really clear evidence of ongoing deceleration even over the course of the period when unemployment was higher than it is now So we are not perhaps as sanguine as we might have been before about the prospects for ongoing substantial deceleration as we move on out through 1994 We're re-calibrating some things as we move along here And we are looking at some different initial conditions than we expected to see as we enter [1994] Now, one could certainly argue from a variety of econometric models built on the Phillips curve--one you're not particularly fond of--that there could be more significant deceleration If you have a view, as some do in using this model, that NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent, we have a significant output gap; and normal rules of thumb would produce more deceleration in prices than we have On the other hand, I think there are many people who would say that the prospects aren't quite as rosy as we're forecasting them to be But our basic notion is that we think the most likely direction of the trend on inflation through 1994 will be downward   Well, there is going to be some significant competitive pressure from imports in a number of sectors of the economy, [though] not all sectors All sectors are not as susceptible to that influence in the same degree But as I noted, the import price prospect is one of the things that makes us hopeful that we can continue a downward [inflation] trend We have not had import price pressure over the last year This isn't an element that in our forecast is going to move in a [significantly] more favorable direction over 1994; if anything, the prospects might infer a less favorable contribution from the import price side But we're splitting hairs I think the picture is essentially the same and it doesn't really make a very big difference as we go forward in terms of the rate of deceleration   I think the major story here is the ongoing increase in the relative importance of computers, whose prices are decreasing at a very rapid rate   Well, they are different measures I think the deflator is not an optimal measure of prices but even broader measures of consumer prices are going to be affected by this computer pricing  SPEAKER(?) As a technical matter the computers have a much smaller weight in the CPI than in the deflator for gross domestic product So the weight of this one item, this fall in price, is small in the CPI and it's relatively large in the deflator   Well, I don't have a strong conviction about the likely magnitude or direction of revisions in GDP, the personal saving rate, or some of the other key variables and how we would look at the gap between potential and actual real output In the first half of this year, to be sure, there was some evidence from the income side of somewhat more rapid growth than was registered in the GDP numbers  -6-    12/21/93  But it isn't a night and day difference I don't think I would make a great deal of that at this point We are at least as leery about defining precisely the GDP gap as we are in looking at the unemployment gap It's a difficult number to construct So I don't think looking at anticipated revisions here would loom large in our thinking about the inflation risks  There has been some discussion, I might just note, of possible revisions in the industrial production measures and capacity utilization We may have stirred things up by indicating in our release--I guess it was a month ago--that in February we hope to be publishing annual revisions Some in the markets took this as an indication that we anticipated major changes At this time we don't really have a good fix on this and don't have a real predilection toward reducing or raising capacity utilization based on the evidence we've been able to process to this point So we're agnostic on this for now; we'll be looking at this in a couple of months   You're talking about the actual unified--   Yes, the receipts   No, in this case they don't I'm not sure I can give you a good answer off the cuff here We have put into this our forecast of the effects over '93 We have some modest differences with the OMB and CBO estimates We've been a little more conservative in the sense of allowing for a bit greater behavioral response, diminishing the income tax receipts that will accrue But in April we're expecting to see a substantially higher level of non-withheld income tax payments than we had in the 1993 second quarter And that's the key feature of the year-to-year movements in revenues apart from what is being generated simply by the ongoing increases in economic activity which are boosting both corporate and personal income For 1995 I'd have to look into that more closely I see a lesser gain from the second quarter to the second quarter in '95 than in '94, which seems reasonable to me But I can't be very specific at this point   Sure   Well, that isn't precisely how we're viewing it As things have progressed, we've moved a bit in the direction of thinking that there could be a larger effect in the first half of 1994 than we had initially allowed for We've made some shift in that direction Yes, it's true that a lot of people knew that tax increases were coming; they began to adjust their behavior at least in the timing of their income receipts in late 1992, which showed all those bonuses coming in then But looking at the behavior of consumption this year, one is hard pressed to discern any anticipatory effect And it's not entirely clear that everyone behaves totally rationally in terms of gauging their lifetime income stream and adjusting their expenditures quickly There probably will be a number of households that are going to be somewhat liquidity constrained at tax time And we're anticipating that there will be a disproportionate effect in the first half of 1994 as people really calculate and confront their tax bills   Mr Chairman, could I clarify something in my earlier response to President Jordan? Not only was the GDP fixed weight price index up more than we expected, the CPI and the core CPI both have risen more over this past year than we anticipated last December while the unemployment rate has been about 1/4 percentage point lower as we got more decline in unemployment for the output growth than we anticipated So I'd assert more strongly than I did before a broad consistency with the fundamental principle that applied in our forecast and continues to apply Thank you   I hope so   No, it's the employment report that is--   The 20th of January   Ted will begin   We switched   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, as I noted, I think we have provided a baseline against which you can apply your own objectives As I said, if you accepted the structure of our forecast but didn't accept the implied result for inflation, it would logically lead you to say that the monetary policy assumption made wasn't sufficiently stringent As to the strategy we applied, I think we could plausibly have read the forecasts that have been made and the statements that have been enunciated by members of this Committee as suggesting that we would have given you something useful if we had put in, in terms of our analysis, a tighter monetary policy and therefore a somewhat slower growth and lower inflation result over the next two years In the  -16-    3/22/94  present circumstance, I think we have put in a tightening of monetary policy that does not seem grossly at odds with the kinds of signals we pick up from statements that have been made and the degree of aggressiveness with which you've moved at this point We have given you an alternative that is perhaps more comparable to what many outside forecasts that you might look at embody at this point in terms of the increment to short rates That's a hard call to make It's hard to say what people are thinking just today  As to the changes in our forecasts over time, I think what happened basically is that we made some mistakes Sometimes we made mistakes, in a sense, in our policy assumptions; the Committee didn't do what we anticipated I would have to admit, too, that we have had some upside growth surprises over time But perhaps even more important, at certain junctures we didn't anticipate how much unemployment would decline for a given amount of growth And what we find ourselves with today is what we think is less slack than we might have anticipated in those earlier forecasts and less downward pressure on the inflation rate So we are not anticipating, without very sharp constraint on aggregate demand, that we'll get to the low 2 percent inflation range within the next year or so That was perhaps a complicated answer, but you've raised a whole bunch of questions   I think you've put your finger on what is a significant question and, if we had wrestled with it for a while longer, perhaps we might have come to a different conclusion You've highlighted the key point, and that is that we have taken seriously our view of what has happened recently--I mean the drop in unemployment--not seeing clear evidence that it is just a fluke And we essentially used this as a jumping off point in this Okun's Law assessment If one used a different jumping off point for that kind of simulation, it is arguable that perhaps the unemployment rate path could be a couple of tenths higher than what we have But this is always difficult It goes back to the very problem that I mentioned in responding to President Jordan's question It has proven very difficult in recent years to get a fix on that Okun's Law relationship and where we are in terms of cyclical or trend behavior of labor force participation in particular So I think there is a significant area of uncertainty in this whole relationship   No, I think this is separable But again, going into this deeply, one gets into questions of labor market structure and behavior It's not entirely separable from those features of the economic system that relate to how much pressure we get on wages and prices at given measured levels of unemployment   Well, all things equal, if we held to our assumption of the NAIRU of 6-1/2 percent or a shade less and we had unemployment at 68 percent, and looked at those numbers very, very finely, that would be enough slack, presumably, to give us some modest edging off in the inflation rate over the coming year or two   My life is flashing before me in the transcripts of the meetings that were released recently where we got into extended discussions of these sorts of hypothetical cases It's a fair question; it was back then, too [Laughter] I think we made some significant mistakes in our assessments of what the term structure would do a few years ago It depends, obviously, on what circumstance gave rise to that If it were in essence a decidedly greater degree of risk aversion on the part of investors who have been burned recently and are demanding a much larger term premium, all other things equal, it would make capital more costly to firms who wanted to buy equipment and so on And I think it would tend to damp aggregate economic activity relative to our current projection If it were a reflection of underlying stronger demands for capital based on higher expected returns, then I think in a sense it could be the bond market vigilantes keeping things under some control Whether on net we would have a higher GDP outcome or not, I don't know But it would be a different situation   I think 1/2 percentage point at the long end, even perhaps modifying the rather strong interest-sensitivities in our model, is non-negligible in terms of economic impact So I think we are talking about potentially a few tenths on GDP over the next year   Chairman Greenspan, could I inject a couple of points of clarification here?   One, for what it's worth, the level of GDP is about the same in this forecast as in the last As currently estimated, we got more growth in the fourth quarter than we anticipated and, in essence, the lower growth rates simply offset that surprise The second point is one of arithmetic on consumption in the first quarter We don't know what will happen in March; we don't even know for sure what happened in January and February at this point But in your calculation I think you were probably using the currently published estimates of real PCE for January   The retail sales revisions for January were dramatic, and they would substantially lower the number one gets doing the same February/March arithmetic So that's the key explanation for why we have as seemingly low a number as we have On the interest rate story, I think you did touch upon the various elements in our thinking, but you went a step further in describing what has happened, covering things we didn't say explicitly in the Greenbook You referred to the 120 basis point rise in long rates since October I guess basically we find it hard to believe that circumstances have changed in such a way as to raise intermediate- or long-term inflation expectations by anything approaching 120 basis points We don't find evidence in the surveys of that kind of movement; we don't see evidence in other asset prices and so on that really suggests that big a move But we don't rule out at all--I suggested this I think in my comments--the distinct likelihood that an elevation of inflation concerns did play a role in the recent backup of rates, particularly since early February Basically what we said is that, given our expectations about what kind of news will be coming forth over the next several months, there will be some allaying of those concerns,  -24-    3/22/94  and thus a part of the backing down in rates is due to some reduction in those inflation expectations   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, clearly, I was trying to suggest that for someone who wanted to look for evidence that things were not going so well We do still regard these longer trends in the indexes as quite relevant to gauging the behavior or the direction of inflation Last year, to be sure, the spurt that we saw was, it appears now, considerably a matter of seasonal adjustment problems Looking back now, things don't appear quite so bad Our recent experience has been a shade better than we anticipated a few months ago The very latest data aren't any better than anticipated If there has been some good news recently, it's been on the labor cost side The employment cost index in the first quarter was considerably lower than we had anticipated, and in our view that sets the world right in a sense As you know, we had wondered a bit about why ECI increases had leveled out last year in the face of unemployment rates considerably higher than they are now, the substantial reduction in the current inflation, and to some degree in shorter-run inflation expectations So, we give some credence to those numbers and it has led us to trim a little off    5/17/94  our wage forecast or our total compensation forecast on the benefits side going forward And so we are reasonably comfortable that, if the economy follows the path we're talking about, the inflation trend will remain stable to perhaps a shade lower But I did want to highlight some risks and certainly to underscore our view that the room to maneuver here in terms of faster growth than we're projecting seems to us rather limited, if one really is concerned about inflation   Current CPI   Yes, for the total over recent months, we're doing somewhat better   Yes   Well, I can address this on two levels One is simply the arithmetic of plugging in the actual data that are now available in place of the assumptions that the BEA had made And this is primarily data that have changed on inventories, retail sales, and construction On net, those numbers would seem to chop a good percentage point off of the 26 percent GDP growth rate that was estimated initially Now, we're anticipating that some of the incoming data, particularly on trade, perhaps will come in better than BEA had assumed And ultimately, perhaps on the next round of revisions when there are some further changes, for example, in construction, we may get closer to the 26 percent So, notionally, in framing this forecast we've been thinking that GDP in the first quarter was probably a little less than the 26 percent, probably 2 percent plus rather than what the incoming data just mechanically would suggest And then we made an estimate of, in essence, the best change for the second quarter, and that's what gives us an estimate of something over 3 percent for the first half   Our working assumption is that, in the near term, potential output growth is about 2-1/2 percent I think one might take a more optimistic view of the underlying productivity trend-- assign more of the increase we've seen over the past few years to perhaps sustainable underlying trend growth, as opposed to the normal cyclical component But we think that's going out on a limb a bit at this point We've already assumed a considerable pickup in trend productivity growth from what we were experiencing prior to the 1990s On the labor force side, we haven't seen much lift yet in labor force participation and the population trends are very hard to read It's conceivable that the trend in labor force growth isn't even quite so strong as we've anticipated, which is not robust by historical standards We feel that the 2-1/2 percent potential is a reasonable working assumption We don't advocate that the Committee take that number as gospel and make its policies on that assumption and close its eyes to the incoming evidence But we think that's a reasonable estimate for now  I must say that, for example, in a recent Business Week article there was much talk about how the world was changing in terms of productivity growth, and I think high-tech investment is one of the elements in that story In quantitative terms, the net investment from that kind of equipment isn't very large because it's rather short-lived; it turns over relatively rapidly So the capital stock in that sense isn't growing very rapidly But if you believe that it is affording firms the opportunity to reorganize in major ways the way they do things and is really creating disproportionate efficiences in a sense, then I think you can make a case for stronger growth The other thing I found puzzling in that article was that it said because of all of this, one needn't worry so much about inflation And the key argument it made was that if there were pressures, firms would just ship production abroad Well, that's a rather puzzling argument It says basically that you can avoid inflation by sucking in imports, but that doesn't really enhance domestic economic growth in the GDP sense So, I think there's some loose thinking behind some of the more optimistic stories   Well, President Jordan, let me just say that we have no reason to think that this hasn't been a distinct improvement in the seasonal adjustment   Well, actually, the median generally has been running very close to the regular core inflation number over the past year They are almost identical on a 12-month basis But the key here is that I don't see on technical grounds a reason to be very concerned at this point that, in essence, the recent data have been overstating the degree of deceleration and that we're going to get a vast surprise later on simply because the adjustment in the seasonal factors has been overdone The methods seem to us to be reasonable We consulted with them during the process of their revisions, and don't believe that they really are missing significant residual seasonalities   Yes, but that's splitting hairs in terms of the measurement accuracy   Well, I think it's pretty close with the minor exception that I would suggest that, in terms of the inflation forecast, the behavior that we're predicting is not simply a function of expectations but also of our judgment that the output path producing the unemployment rate and capacity utilization rates leaves a modest amount of slack in the system So that force is tending to tamp down wage and price increases In terms of the risks in this outlook, they are so numerous and disparate that it's hard to know where to begin That isn't particularly different from any other forecast This may be one of the reasons why the markets seem so unsettled and volatile; and like many other forecasters we have a hard time, in light of the dramatic reversal of the bond market, judging where the equilibrium may be The market movements have been very fast and very large, and judging what the impact will be as we move forward several months or quarters is a very tricky business  As I suggested, there are considerable differences of opinion among private forecasters and we think they mirror some of these uncertainties On the one hand, there is a view that we are in the midst of what will be a dramatic and very well sustained capital spending boom that will interact in some sense on the trade side where we will be very competitive In that view, as these foreign economies pick up, we will see tremendous increases in exports, and this kind of lift will provide the income to support a healthy rate of consumer spending right on through 1995 On the other side, there are those who are beginning to find some hints of weakness here and there; they think the higher rates that we have, assuming they are sustained, will have an even more serious damping effect on the housing sector and that consumer demand will be damped not only by that but also by the effects of the tax increases beyond what we had anticipated They see that saving is already at a low level, that we've already seen increases in debt and probably will have more ahead, so consumers may feel more constrained down the road And certainly even with the recent better news there are those who are skeptical about how quickly the foreign economies will come on and thus what kind of impetus we'll be getting in the next few quarters from a diminished drag on the trade side So that's sort of a range of some of the thinking that I see, and there certainly are elements of risks in those directions in our view   Well, if I take the base as last October's low when the rate was about 58 percent, that's an increase of some 170 basis points, if I've done my arithmetic correctly I would judge that more than half of that is real That's a seat of the pants judgment and I can't point to any clear-cut analytical support for it I certainly see nothing in changes in inflation forecasts going out the short distance for which most professional forecasters' results are available; and nothing in the household surveys indicates that the longer-range inflation expectations have risen dramatically Looking at stock market behavior and trying to intuit something about what may have happened to the real returns that are built in there, I see a significant element that must have been real as opposed to inflation   In looking at the behavior in the housing market, as limited as the evidence is at this point, people have not on the evidence dismissed these higher rates as being simply a reflection of higher inflation in terms of what they might expect for their wages or for house prices going forward We wouldn't have seen as much effect as we have perhaps if there really had been that kind of inflammation of inflation expectations   Well, looking out over a 5- to 10-year span, I guess I would be more comfortable asserting that market expectations would be on the order of 4 percent inflation They could be a little lower, but that would leave the real rate a little lower than it has been   Indeed, that's one of the reasons, given our assumption that there will be at least mild fiscal restraint and that inflation expectations will be going down, I think there is a discernible downside risk to our bond yield forecast; we have it really not getting much below 7 percent by the latter half of 1995   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   No, I don't have information on that It's very clear the ratio of starts to permits for the single-family sector is extended well beyond the norm Given the better statistical reliability of the permits series, I think that this argues pretty strongly for starts likely to have been less robust than this report suggests But we had a level of single-family starts for this quarter in the forecast that would still be below any reasonable adjustment, I think, of that single-family starts rate   I think it's a reasonably balanced forecast, given my suspicion that inventory investment in the second quarter may have been overstated But I wouldn't want to make too big a point of that The May figures held up very well; they were raised in the    8/16/94  revised figures To date, there hasn't been any evidence there But we have, in essence, carried through a slightly higher level of the inventory/sales ratio, that having been achieved in the second quarter We do not have a significant movement; the ratio begins to trail off very slightly in the latter part of 1995 In a sense, at that point we are beginning to get a little improvement in final sales and we begin to see the hint of a restoration of what we think is the secular downward trend in the overall ratio We have anticipated in this forecast that the adjustment in stock levels relative to sales trends is going to occur in the distribution sector, particularly retailing We have allowed in effect for a substantial degree of manufacturing inventory accumulation, which is the area where we might have anticipated the upside risk to have existed because of the tightening in supplies and some of the pressures on prices of materials and so on Certainly, no inventory forecast is without its risks, but I think in this case the balance is not distinctly on one side or the other We really are not uncomfortable in that respect   A compound question here, I think   No   Let me try to be helpful with a few, brief comments I think if we had to do the single-family housing construction forecast again today, we would still have in essence the kind of pattern we have, with some further erosion of single-family housing construction in the near term and then some firming over the course of 1995--the levels in the two years being pretty comparable and quite decent by historical standards A fairly high level of existing home sales is also likely over that period We have seen very strong sales of appliances and furniture Even through July, the retail sales report shows considerable strength there We would expect to see some ebbing of that strength and some deceleration in non-motor vehicle consumer durables outlays over the coming quarters At the same time, we think we've reached a rather low level relative to the plausible trend in motor vehicle sales, in good part because of the shortage of some of the more popular models We see a substantial ramping up of production going on currently and we are anticipating that sales will move up significantly in the next few months, and then we have a slight upcreep during 1995 with the continued moderate growth of income and employment Our sense is that there probably is still some element of pent-up demand in the motor vehicles sector, just looking at what has happened to the stock of cars relative to the number of households and the aging in the stock and so on Our forecast for next year, at just a little over 15 million for light  -4-    8/16/94  vehicle sales, is certainly not high by the standards that we see in private forecasts and certainly not relative to the hopes of the automobile industry I think they will have the capacity to supply that many cars and this is not an extraordinarily high level of durables expenditure overall relative to income or GDP In fact, it's rather moderate in that sense So I think there is a reasonable rationale for this path   Well, we have at least 59 varieties of, or is it 57, I don't know, [Laughter]--57 varieties The number has crept up over the years, of econometric models So, we probably can encompass a pretty wide range of outcomes, given the conditioning assumptions of the degree of slack in labor and product markets, the acceleration or deceleration in activity, the signs we have seen of materials' cost rising, the implications of exchange rate changes for import prices, and so on Our models have not done that poorly in capturing the general trend of things Our analysis is that we are generally in the ball park of the natural rate, I think our forecast looks quite plausible We have sort of a stabilization of the core inflation rate One could say that there might be some offsetting influences here of abatement of the speed effects and the pressures on materials prices that we've had recently and some of the shifts in the influence of the exchange rate I think this is not hard to justify at all in terms of a pretty wide variety of econometric models, but a significant element of judgment has gone into this As I indicated, we simply do perceive a leveling out of things that have occurred in the last several months, the last few quarters We foresee a generally stable labor market and level of industrial capacity utilization if the economy slackens as we have forecast And so the broad macro conditions are sort of stable in this picture   I think you probably cited one period in which we could find it in the 1980s, but I'd have to reexamine that record I'm not sure what precedent one would look for What we are anticipating in this forecast is a moderation of economic expansion that extends this cyclical upswing with inflation not picking up at all We think that the implied real rates of interest, given the kind of inflation expectations that presumably could prevail in 1995 with    8/16/94  the continuation of 3 percent inflation, are fairly ample by historical standards Even with the nominal rate decline we have, these real rates might be regarded as generous by historical standards Some might say it poses the possibility of a downside risk We think that there is probably still an element of extra liquidity premium in the market--some trepidation on the part of investors People who had been throwing money into bond mutual funds with abandon until a few months ago are perhaps a little more cautious now I think we can get a combination of some reduction in the inflation premium and some reduction in the liquidity premium that is probably still embedded in the long rates The yield curve would still have an upward slope of some significance and certainly wouldn't look strange in that regard   I suppose I should have thought ahead to this kind of question; it comes up frequently I don't really have any clearcut answer jumping into my mind at this point I think there are risks that one could identify in every sector and I could identify them as having potential on both the upside and downside So I don't think there is any key number here On the inflation--sort of the Phillips curve--side of things given the outlook path, we certainly are somewhat at sea still about what the unemployment rate truly is right now There is still, because of the change of surveys, an unusual degree of uncertainty about the seasonal [unintelligible] labor force participation would change radically from where it is now We noted that we tried to come to grips with the news that we've seen recently, but that news involves a lot of interpretation And so even given an output path, the degree of labor market slack that that implies is uncertain Looking back at the recent experience and maybe leaning toward a slight degree of pessimism, one could argue that things really began to firm--the end of the deceleration in wages, the lack of evident further deceleration in core CPI--earlier this year, before we got the drop in unemployment that we've seen recently This    8/16/94  might suggest that more pessimistic views of where the NAIRU is, such as those embodied in the famous Kansas City Fed estimates, might be correct and that one could see some pressure emerging fairly promptly that we don't have in our forecast  On the other hand, as I said, the range of estimates we could come up with in this regard certainly embodies NAIRUs that would be below what we perceive the current level of unemployment to be and thus might give us a little more room to run We've got a sustained strong investment pattern We think that makes sense, but it is on the strong side perhaps of what some models would suggest There is uncertainty about inventories, and certainly in the near term, if there were enthusiasm about building stocks because of concerns about supplies and price increases, that could give some impetus We are continuing to see the evolution of the recoveries abroad, and in that kind of dynamic one could be off the mark in gauging just what impetus we are going to get one way or the other there Given our own experience in the United States and maybe once things settle down, one could see a sequence of surprises in a positive direction On housing, as we saw this morning, we've been surprised; and so we could be right or wrong there I don't feel that this is, on balance, far out of line with the Blue Chip consensus in the sense that they have more growth and more inflation They have higher nominal short-term interest rates, I think, ultimately perhaps But again, that is also consistent with more inflation So there is not a glaring inconsistency of our view with a lot of the private forecasts   My recollection is that we were anticipating that the increase in the latest month would have been 50,000 or so less   Right   Without an explicit view about the bias adjustment I think the bigger surprise was in June where we got a whopping increase in employment, and we were, as I recall, anticipating something again more in the 200,000 area So I think, we have had a substantial upside surprise for those two months   I think that is the order of magnitude   Mr Chairman, may I simply improve upon my answer to Governor Blinder? In the latest data, there were upward revisions to April and May payrolls from what we were aware of at the time of the June Greenbook, a total of about 100,000 The increment to what we were expecting in June and July is about 150,000 So the total increment we have had is considerably larger than what I suggested But the June-July increment is about 150,000   I think DRI is perhaps in the lower part of the spectrum right now   I think they have about a half percentage point increase in the funds rate in the second half of this year and nothing after that   Right, I think they have some modest easing next year and bond yields come down a bit more than in our forecast, and yet they have somewhat weaker growth over the next six quarters In terms of what a more gradual rate increase would produce if one used our quarterly model, the distinctions, as I hinted in my remarks, would be modest   Well, we are talking about rather small differences A 1 percentage point change in the funds rate done immediately according to our quarterly model will only take several tenths off GDP growth by the second half of 1995 And it only means a couple of tenths or so on the CPI So, if you simply select a more gradual rise, the differences are going to be even smaller I guess what we are suggesting is that, in our judgment, the tilt begins to be most likely in an upward direction in terms of inflation right now, that is, given that we feel we are essentially at full employment   Faster growth will mean some additional tightening and the probability at least of an upward tilt, but only very gradually; it's a question of degree  -13-    8/16/94   I just got these numbers at the break and I think the picture in the adjusted permits and the single-family starts is really one of rough stability in the past three months  -32-    8/16/94   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   Implicit in the third-quarter payroll forecast is an increase of about 250,000 for September   This includes in essence no particular assumption for the strike We have made some back-of-the-envelope calculations, and it is conceivable that it could have a measurable effect But many of these people are part-time who might have found something else to do We had the start of the exhibition season for football; they may have been employed as vendors for football games There just seem to be too many imponderables here to make it a very big factor in the estimate for September   There would be some loss of hours   It could be a few tens of thousands, conceivably   In retrospect, the numbers through August looked as if there might have been a World Cup effect--if you look at the areas of employment that might have been sensitive to that There was that falloff in August So, there might be some upside bias, all other things equal, in our forecast because we didn't make allowance for a big effect from the baseball strike   We are, I think, well aligned with Okun's Law models if you take where we are as the jumping point   Right Clearly, you can get a variety of results depending on what your starting point is, but we looked at this both in terms of the simple rule of thumb of an Okun's Law model working from where we are as well as in terms of models that can reach back a ways and take into account some of the errors that have occurred and so on This looks as well aligned as our forecasts ever are, gauging this by our miscellaneous Okun's Law models   I should note, Dave Stockton reminds me, that implicit in this forecast is potential output growth more like 2-1/3 percent than 2-1/2 percent   I'm sorry, I should have noted that   Mr Chairman, I might bring to the Committee's attention a late-breaking piece of news here this morning The Conference Board released its survey for September The headline is that consumer confidence registered its third consecutive monthly loss in September, declining 2 points In June the index had registered 925 but it is now at 884 The punch line in this release is that "the current level of consumer confidence has been associated in the almost 30-year history of the survey with a reasonably lively economy" So it's consistent with the notion that consumer sales have slipped a bit but are not far below the higher levels that we reached earlier this year   Well, this is open to varying interpretations! [Laughter] Certainly, as we perceived it, that announcement has been an element in the sense that it gave traders a period of safety in which they didn't have to worry that every bit of incoming economic  -10-    9/27/94  data would necessarily carry with it the risk of a tightening action So, they probably were a little more relaxed about the near-term outlook   Well, I think I highlighted the numbers that struck us as most important   I think our sense of the momentum in the consumer sector was altered by the combination of the August retail sales and the upward revisions to the prior months Private economists had become very enthusiastic about the signs that consumers really had moved to a more cautious spending posture So this certainly suggested that there was still a willingness to spend and also a willingness to borrow; we still have considerable growth in consumer credit, and consumer sentiment is holding up well So, I think our perception of where the consumer is has been altered I noted two other factors One, at least through the current period--this does not necessarily tell you very much about the next few months--there is a considerably greater degree of strength in manufacturing than we had perceived earlier; and, secondly, the housing data just have not shown the erosion of activity that we had anticipated We still see things as slipping but not at the pace that we had expected earlier  So this certainly suggests that one of the key channels through which we would have thought that interest rates would damp aggregate demand is not working with the force that we had anticipated This has its corollary, too, in all probability, in the fact that purchases of household furnishings and appliances have remained very strong; that was the notably strong element in the consumer spending report through August There just has been no sign of tapering off there So, those were key factors suggesting greater momentum in aggregate demand At the same time, the employment data and the initial claims suggested that we were still getting a lot of growth in payrolls In all likelihood, we were getting a little tighter labor market than we might have anticipated On top of that--   Right, capacity utilization is much higher So, given the momentum, given the slack, we have felt that somewhat greater tightening is probably needed in order to hold the pressures in the economy down to something like those we had in the forecast by the latter part of 1995   We will be looking at all of these things We currently are anticipating some bounceback in orders for nondefense capital goods If we got another very weak report, it might cause us to revise our view of what the trend is in capital spending, which has been giving good impetus to the expansion Obviously, we'll be looking at those other indicators of response to interest rates, which might be the housing sector and consumer durables And we'll be looking at what goes on in the financial markets to see how things are proceeding through those channels  -12-    9/27/94   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   President Boehne, I think the first question is more a forecasting question The second one perhaps is more a policy question, though there are obviously ingredients of both in the two questions We hinted in the Greenbook that, in essence, we see the probability distribution as skewed a bit in the direction your first question suggested--that, indeed, the momentum could turn out to be better maintained in the near term and that it might take considerably greater monetary policy tightening in order to generate a quick and significant slackening in growth, bringing the economy below potential and beginning to reverse what we regard as an overshooting in resource utilization So, I take your point, and while I don't think history would suggest that a moderation in growth requires a total flattening of the yield curve, I would say that perhaps we are a bit optimistic, if you want to view it that way, on that relationship The Greenbook assumes a reduction in the upward slope, but the latter is still significant If I had to pick an alternative scenario, I might lean in the direction you are talking about  As to slow growth and openness to shocks, the economy is always open to a shock that could move it off the projected path by a given amount When growth is that low, such a shock obviously could move the economy into negative territory Maybe the psychology of that is different and downward momentum might develop, but I don't think we have a way of coping with that In fact, in 1989-1990, we did have a period of slow growth There were some revisions of data which revealed just what the pattern was, and it wasn't until that shock occurred that the economy really tipped into recession In the absence of that shock, it is conceivable we might have skated by A period of slow growth does not necessarily mean that the economy is going to slip into a recession   This is hard to pin down, but my sense is that the credit availability cycle has been out of sync with the normal pattern this time around   In the sense that, when interest rates were coming down in 1991-1992, we were still seeing the tendency toward tightening of bank credit terms   And, as we have been tightening money market conditions, our loan officers' survey and the preponderance of the anecdotal evidence have suggested that the banks have become increasingly aggressive in their business lending and obviously have been increasingly willing to extend consumer credit as well We looked back at the responses to that same senior loan officers' survey some years back through a couple of cycles and found that, as we might have expected, during periods of rising interest rates and a flattening term structure, some of which we have had, we generally had a tightening of credit terms; but recently we had a tendency toward an easing in credit terms So, I think we may be moving in an unusual direction Be that as it may, we are pretty much convinced that we have been moving in the direction of easier credit availability and that that has tended to work against the effect of the rising interest rates on demand From the perspective of businesses, it is certainly clear that the credit crunch is no longer there and credit availability is not a concern to firms that want to expand their fixed investment or inventories   I don't want to put too fine a point on it, but I think the main point is that this seems to have been an offsetting influence over the past year to the rising market interest rates   As a technical matter, the productivity numbers for manufacturing that are published along with those for overall productivity growth are in essence based on a separate system in the current period The recent period is based on industrial production data rather than industry gross product data Those numbers will be revised There isn't any reason, though, to think that they are giving a grossly misleading picture Our assumption is that, indeed, there has been substantial growth in manufacturing productivity I'm not sure you want to subtract that number from overall nonfarm business sector productivity growth and get the residual for the rest of the economy   There's a big gap between the industrial and the nonindustrial sector productivity measures even when we do this exercise   Maybe that isn't actually true; maybe there is an inaccuracy in the measurement of output It would be affecting the GDP numbers It also would be affecting our estimates of potential output growth It is in fact neutral in terms of assessing what the output gap might be All the measures are commensurately affected As to the pattern we have going forward, we do have a deceleration of productivity growth This is a normal accompaniment to a significant deceleration in output growth We believe that we are somewhat above the cyclically-adjusted trend line and that deceleration normally occurs in mid-expansion As we move to fuller resource utilization, the expansion will be slowing; there will be some tendency to move back toward that trend line Historically, the economy has moved below it during recessionary periods, but we don't have a recession in    11/15/94  our projection period In essence, we have a somewhat below-trend growth of nonfarm business productivity over the next year or so and then we move back toward that trend Basically, looking at the growth of productivity in the 1990s, we don't see any real evidence that our assumption for some time now of about 14 percent trend growth in nonfarm business productivity is off the mark The data seem to be conforming to that in terms of the normal cyclical pattern   I don't think I can work my way through all the history you gave on the forecast But I think the first statement you made about giving back the extra growth that we had recently is fundamentally correct That extra growth, as we assess it, resulted in an overshooting of sustainable levels of resource utilization-- levels that would be consistent with at least stability in inflation as opposed to accelerating prices We tried to devise a scenario in which, within a reasonable period of time, we move back to and slightly above the NAIRU to damp the incipient inflationary process I think that is an apt characterization of how this scenario is designed  I hope Don has some thoughts on the M1 velocity story It is not something we focused on, frankly, in designing the forecast We didn't give any attention to M1 M1 is an endogenous byproduct in this forecast just like many other variables There can't conceivably be any tension in our thinking about the money and income relationship It is whatever it is, and we don't have an M1 target range that we need to worry about violating, so that doesn't arise as a side constraint, and we think the broader aggregates will remain at growth rates that are compatible with the 1995 ranges and any reasonable extensions   I don't think we can do a precise dissection One of the things we've pointed out in the Greenbook is that in looking at the acceleration--I don't want to overstate this--what we are talking about in essence in the core CPI number is that we are going to get pretty much 3 increase a month rather than a mixture of 2 and 3 a month   Whether we'll be able to perceive this month-by- month isn't entirely clear But we see this as involving a mix of things that are sort of overlapping We have had an exchange rate depreciation We have seen raw materials prices increase Some of those raw materials are internationally traded and are imported in some instances We have seen rapid growth of output recently, and econometrically, while it is not always a particularly robust result-- you can tinker with your models and get large or small effects--that mere increase in resource utilization can produce in these models some increase in markups, and when things taper off we see some stabilizing and a return to the trend I really can't parse these things out with any great precision Some set of these factors we think will give a little bit faster rise in prices in the near term than would be dictated simply by the margin of slack in the economy, which we would see as only adding maybe a couple of tenths to underlying inflation over the coming year, no more than that  -10-    11/15/94   Right We have a timing question here It is hard to say but we think that we might get a little more of the price increase announcements at the beginning of the year   So, there is a considerable amount of guesswork involved here But, yes, I think it is these speed effects or the exchange rate effects on import prices and so on that are giving the bulge However, if we did not eliminate the excess pressures on resources during 1995, as we have in this forecast, the risk would be that wages would begin to reflect more fully the higher price increases, inflationary expectations would take hold, and we would begin to build that higher track into the trend That's why we felt it important to try to indicate what kind of interest rate path would lead to this slackening fairly promptly   Reality will never be that smooth!   That's one of the risks we noted in the Greenbook   An inventory adjustment could come more quickly If final demand were to taper off and be perceived to have tapered off early next year, perhaps the inventory adjustment would be sharper That could move us much closer to zero or even conceivably negative GDP growth for a quarter, but inventories might then come back if final demand is still growing moderately So, they are certainly a potential source of volatility in the numbers and of some greater cyclical variation   It is going to be a factor affecting the cash flow of many households, but it is not a huge effect It is less huge than one might have expected because what we've observed this year is that a substantial proportion of the ARMs originated this year have fixed rates for 5 or 10 years This is something of an innovation in this cycle We are not going to have any adjustment on those and there is a 2 percentage point limit on those shorter-term ARMs So, this is not going to produce a drastic income shock in 1995  -11-    11/15/94   I think we have a forecast that is middle-of-the- road [Laughter]   A view that is certainly held in the industry is that there is considerable pent-up demand that could buoy sales of automobiles and light trucks but such demand really has not been fully seen yet because of capacity constraints We think there is some element of truth to that story On the other hand, it is true that, to date, we have had a very moderate response of auto loan rates to the increase that has occurred in market rates Prospectively, one would expect that gap to close, and in addition we have assumed some further rise in market rates I must say that the rise in rates is most pronounced at the very short end of the market, and the sort of intermediate-term rates that we typically compare to auto loan rates would not be going up as much We get some flattening in the yield curve here So, in our thinking, there is some further increase in auto loan rates, but maybe not as dramatic as one might think by adding the rise in the funds rate to the gap that seems to exist now between market rates and auto loan rates Arguably, that sort of normal interest rate response could produce a weaker automobile market than we have I think we are somewhere in between, but I would grant you that the interest rate picture might constitute a downside risk   I think that's fair One also could argue that we do not have as large an interest rate response here as we could have Again, as President Boehne suggested in his original question,  -12-    11/15/94  it is possible that we have not put in enough of an increase in interest rates to get the damping of aggregate demand in the Greenbook forecast   Equity markets clearly have been buoyed, in the face of rising bond yields this year, by surprisingly favorable earnings reports Our anticipation would be that those reports will not be pleasant surprises in 1995 That suggests some vulnerability to the stock market, at least in the early part of the year before the significant bond market rally that we anticipate occurs This pattern of flattening profits and diminishing profit share is quite consistent with the cyclical pattern of profits moving with the acceleration and deceleration of output--moving with the growth of productivity in a sense As we go forward, as was noted earlier, we do have a considerable slackening in productivity We see some pressure coming, as wages accelerate and productivity flattens out, toward certainly weakening profit margins--maybe not a pronounced plunge but some pressure on them   We think that investment has been benefiting to some degree from strong profitability and ample cash flows As we go forward, cash flow does flatten out We do get a growing nonfinancial corporate financing gap, and we do see that as an element that will be damping business fixed investment Recall that you are probably looking at real numbers that are inflated to some degree by the computer deflator You get rapid growth in real computer purchases with a zero nominal increase That's basically what we have in our forecast for the next two years We still think this is a climate in which business investment in computers will be fairly robust On the nonresidential structure side, we anticipate a pretty solid uptrend There are lags in this process Permits have been rising noticeably recently We think the uptrend at this point is unlikely to be reversed in the near term by the further rise in interest rates That's giving some underpinnings to this advance, and BFI along with exports are a couple of the sectors against which we are working in reducing the growth of other elements of private domestic demand   In all likelihood, the parallel survey that was conducted prior to the first of this year misled the Labor Department It showed that the unemployment rate would be 1/2 percentage point higher with the new survey The evidence from the survey that was conducted afterwards using the old relationships to other series such as the unemployment insurance data and payroll employment series suggests that somehow or other that parallel survey was misleading-- perhaps a fluke statistically--and that the gap between the old and the new series is probably very small, maybe no more than 1 with another upward estimate of 1 for the change in census population controls   [Statement--See Appendix]   That is a risk I hinted at in my remarks about the late 1980s experience I think the key here is to look back at why we projected the inflation that we did for 1994 In essence, we were concerned at the beginning of the year that the pattern of expectations we were seeing, the very buoyant attitudes and so on, and the rapid growth at the end of last year were going to give us a stronger price increase this year than would have been dictated by our analysis of where levels of resource utilization were Looking back now, we see a pattern that seems reasonably consistent with our fundamental view of the Phillips curve picture We did not get down to our point estimate of the NAIRU until this summer Under the circumstances, some further deceleration was not implausible We also think that perhaps we underestimated the cost effects in the medical care area We have had tremendous deceleration of the cost of medical benefits, and this has helped to tamp down the rate of increase in compensation I think that has been a surprise that was not built into our forecast and now appears possibly to have been a broad element that was helping to bring down the inflation rate this year We don't see that contributing as much going forward We think there    12/20/94  will still be some deceleration, but it will probably taper off to some degree   I don't think one can rule out the possibility that the interest sensitivity of the economy in the short run may be less than it was Certainly, we have felt all along that, without the disintermediation effects of Reg Q ceilings that we got decades ago, there wasn't going to be quite the abrupt swing toward restraint that previously accompanied increases in short-term market interest rates But we are still learning Financial markets continue to evolve It is conceivable that the lag structure is different I just don't think we have enough evidence to make a strong statement in that regard Part of what has happened this year has been a surprise in the growth of European economies, in particular, that has helped to buttress export demand On the domestic side, while we cited a risk repeatedly through the year that inventory investment could be stronger than we were anticipating because businesses might become concerned about the availability of supplies, as things turned out, that seemed to be a much more dynamic feature in the economy than we had anticipated There is a cyclical dynamic to this As inventory investment and exports proved strong, that raised aggregate demand and that in turn reinforced the desire for inventories As we got more production and more income, that raised consumption So this is a process that feeds on itself up to a point  Going forward, it is critical, as I noted, that these levels of inventory investment are unsustainable If the economy is going to get back to a growth rate of no more than the long-run potential rate, there has to be a drop-off at some point The question is when that drop-off in inventory investment will occur We are also banking on there being a significant lagged effect of the interest rate increases that have occurred It is still early, as has been discussed repeatedly here As estimated even in our current models, the lags are long enough so that we would only begin to get significant effects now and in the early part of next year We are also building in further rate increases, which will have their effect more in the latter part of 1995 and into 1996, but we think these rate increases may reinforce the effects in the shorter run, too, through increases in adjustable rate mortgages and even adjustments in the stock market If short rates rise as much as we have assumed, it will be more and more difficult for households to get enthusiastic about taking on what appear to be some risks in the stock and bond markets when they can get sizable real returns without risk in the short run    12/20/94   In fact, we didn't quite get back to the unemployment level in our prior forecast We took the kinder, gentler approach to some limited degree here so that by the end of the period, we are in essence back at our point estimate of the NAIRU as it currently stands rather than somewhat above that This means in essence that we don't see any disinflationary pressure through 1996 We merely stabilize things That is the design principle here What we have attempted to do is give you a baseline forecast that holds activity to a path that at least doesn't let inflation get out of control and tries to tell you whether that is achievable and how That exercise involves a great deal of uncertainty, but that is why the good news in terms of output and low unemployment that we have recently experienced gets offset by bad news of slow growth and increasing unemployment later in the forecast   I don't know if there is anything I can say! It certainly occurred to me that taking these numbers just as they are might provide a somewhat unappealing forecast in the Humphrey-Hawkins report But this forecast is not so far from the consensus view among economists that a little degree of optimism, as you suggested, wouldn't put it in the ballpark I don't want to prescribe what people should say here What we have forecast clearly is a slight uptick in unemployment between now and the end of next year, a slight uptick in inflation, and growth that is only modestly below most people's assessment of the long-term trend We are a little bit lower, I think, than the consensus forecast at this point for GDP growth We are lower on the inflation rate than the consensus forecast I admit that these are differences, but we think they are consistent   The model simulation we have done using a constant funds rate has only slightly more growth in 1995 and then appreciably greater growth in 1996   By the model's assessment, that would add several tenths to the inflation rate in 1996 So in that sense, the difference here is one of stable inflation at slightly over 3 percent versus an accelerating price picture with the inflation rate moving up into the mid-3 percent range by 1996 I don't have a basis for seriously questioning this outlook I do think there is a risk in the near term that, if the economy behaves anything like what we are anticipating and if the fed funds rate were to remain at 5-1/2 percent, inflation expectations could mount in ways that wouldn't be anticipated in the structure of our model It is manifest that the market is expecting as much tightening as we have built in, if not more The recent response of the markets to the tightening action shows that they are rather sensitive to indications that we are going to resist inflationary tendencies The common forecast is for inflation to move up I'd say the consensus is about 3-1/2 percent, looking at the Blue Chip forecasts for 1995 I think there would be considerable worry--unless there are clear indications the economy has weakened in the next couple of months--if the Fed were not to move the rate up significantly   I think inflation mounts because, in this alternative, we are running with an unemployment rate that remains below the NAIRU out through 1996 and presumably into 1997, so we are getting an accelerating picture   But I think that in the near term, taking into account exchange rate and import price effects and so on, the model begins to get additional inflation creeping in within 1995 and building a bit It is very gradual and probably undiscernibly different That again goes back to the comment I made earlier It could creep up on you, and sustaining the low unemployment rate, as happened in the late 1980s, eventually does build up to a significant pickup in inflation That is what our forecast has been designed to avoid   I think it would show up certainly in the tenths column, but we are talking about a matter of a couple of tenths over the next year or year and a half   It is not dramatic I would caution that in thinking about the slowdown in the economy, one does not want to think of that as purely a straight interest rate effect Some of it is the inevitable reversal of that cyclical dynamic in the inventory investment area that I talked about Our inventory equations, just as other forecasting tools, don't work all that well, so it is not something I'd want to bank on the model to capture This is a very important element in the timing of the deceleration as we see it   We have the funds rate moving up into the 6-1/2 or 7 percent area by early next spring   It is specified and you should have heard through your research director what the specific numbers were I apologize if there was a slip in communications   My point is that we think the tightening needs to be significant I think a problem with specific numbers is that they imply a false sense of precision about what it will take Yes, to enter something into an econometric model, we would write down 6-3/4 percent   We are talking about Part I   Part I is classified as Class II   I think Peter was referring to the shorter intermediate term, the 1- to 3-year area   We didn't have it in February It's an open issue for July   No  -16-    3/28/95   After we have gone on even briefly you may decide that you don't want the full length Chart Show, but we'll see [Statement--see Appendix]   Reading the numbers as precisely as they are written down, the thrust of the baseline forecast is that we think we have a modest degree of financial restraint that will hold growth slightly below potential and have the unemployment rate creep up But we are at a point where we think high levels of resource utilization will begin to foster very gradually some momentum toward higher inflation So, yes, the most natural extrapolation from this would be a slightly higher rate of inflation in 1997   That is correct   Essentially, we would have an upward slope of average dimension   Yes   If you are asking whether the relationship of nominal interest rates to nominal growth looks abnormal or unreasonable here, I would say that there is not a very strong regularity in the history of the relationship between nominal interest rates and nominal GDP growth We have played around with some econometric exercises to see whether there is any information to be gained by looking at that spread as an index of restraint and prospective real economic activity It is weak It can contribute a little to explaining the prospects I don't feel uncomfortable with this forecast I think the fact that the nominal interest rate is a little higher than nominal GDP growth is consistent with our sense that this is putting some drag on economic activity, just as the fact that the real short-term rate, a bit above historical averages as we perceive it, could be interpreted as being consistent with some modest monetary restraint on top of what we believe to be some moderate fiscal restraint That is very hard to say The real rate of interest could vary considerably over a cycle or even a little longer   We are slightly above the ceiling now, drifting back toward the ceiling   We are splitting hairs here  -18-    3/28/95   Let me separate these questions In some simple models, one can relate the observed real rate of interest to the longer-term growth of the economy as a sort of equilibrium, steady state condition But if one starts elaborating those models, it can get much more complicated On the question of what we think is going on with inflation expectations, yes, our presumption is that the current inflation expectation for the shorter run is in the 3 percent --3 percent plus--area for consumer prices As we go out into the intermediate-term--5 to 10 years--expectations are probably closer to 4 percent inflation   At this point, in our judgment, the notion of a downward trend to inflation is not embedded in the markets Rather, there is some more inflation in the works, as President Parry was suggesting Our forecast is pointing toward some gradual pickup to a higher level of inflation   Indeed But in 1997, assuming gradual convergence, we are as I said splitting hairs   Exactly, and in 1997 on this trajectory, we would get back to the NAIRU and a little lower on capacity utilization In theory at that point, the inflation rate would stabilize at just a hair higher than we observe as the trend to 1996   We are using the usual sacrifice ratios and a NAIRU around 6 percent; and given our projected unemployment rate, we are only talking about accelerations of a couple of tenths a year The convergence by 1997 implies that we may not even have that in that year   Yes   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It will take me a minute or so to find that I think we are still seeing rising backlogs   I can't give you that answer immediately I'm sorry   I don't have in mind a particular number that goes with neutrality in the sense that over time one would expect the economy to grow at potential--or to sit at potential output We have interpreted monetary policy per se as probably modestly restrictive at this point That is, the real rate of interest is perhaps somewhat above the natural rate But, in the total financial picture, we also recognize that credit availability if anything has been improving; the terms and standards of bank loans have been moving in an easing direction; and we also have had an impulse through the exchange market, which you might take as part of the broader financial context, that is tending to be stimulative over this period So, on balance, we don't have a picture of very marked financial impetus or restraint   We would anticipate, particularly in an environment of ongoing fiscal restraint, that the equilibrium as we look ahead to 1996, 1997, 1998 would be one in which the real short- term interest rate would move closer to its historical average; that rate would be on the order of 2 percent or maybe a bit less This would suggest that the rate probably is higher now than would be expected over the longer term So, we have some restraint there Don points out to me that we have had a very big run-up in the stock market that is providing another financial impulse  Mr Chairman, in answer to your question about nondefense capital goods, orders were about 4-1/2 percent above shipments   In March   I don't know that the concept of neutrality was ever particularly well defined, and I think the kind of economic outcome that would ensue from a given short-term real rate of interest is going to vary considerably over time, depending on fiscal policy and other impulses So, I have problems putting myself in that particular context But to respond directly to your question about the longer-term outlook, we have shown in previous longer-term scenarios in the Bluebook and elsewhere a declining path for the real funds rate over time because, looking at history, we felt that this was a relatively high real short-term interest rate and one that would not be consistent with stability in the economy It would be exerting some ongoing contractionary force and overshooting what would be required to stabilize the inflation level ultimately So, if we redo this projection, we would anticipate, particularly in a context of ongoing fiscal restraint, let alone any balanced budget program that is credible, that over the next several years there would be a decline in the real short-term rate of interest as we moved either toward a condition of stability at potential GDP or even maintained some minor gap so as to bring the inflation rate down gradually   I don't think so As I said, I think that a number of environmental factors would alter the implications of a given real interest rate level Thus, I don't think there is a number for all time   Two comments may be useful in responding to that One is that you characterized the range of possible NAIRU levels as being one that was sort of biased to the up side of where our forecast has been recently As we are interpreting it, I think we would say that might be a little too pessimistic Perhaps one of the risks is that the very good news we saw on the ECI through the first quarter of the year is an indication that the NAIRU was lower than is built into our forecast   Basically, our forecast is one in which the economy is operating, at worst, just a shade below the full employment level, or the NAIRU, as we move through 1996 In that kind of environment, one would not anticipate a great deal of pressure toward higher inflation So, given the recent experience and the factors that suggest what growth rate may be sustainable in this economy without a buildup of inflationary pressures, I think there is a reasonable balance of risks as we look out through next year Now, we are in a period in which there are some vulnerabilities The economy    5/23/95  is still operating at a quite high level It is being hit by a shock through the exchange rate channel As I noted, that shock is not as great perhaps as one would surmise looking at the yen alone, but we think there is an impulse there that is going to tend to bring higher import prices and provide an umbrella for domestic producers of autos and other goods We quite possibly still have in front of us a significant pass-through of materials cost increases We can already see that showing up in some industries It is clearest in industries like paper, but there are hints elsewhere It is conceivable that this hump that we are looking at in our forecast could be greater and could stretch out more if it generates some broader inflationary expectations than seem to be present now or than we have anticipated in the forecast So, I think that certainly does pose some short-run upside risk at a minimum   I think that relationship has varied considerably over decent spans of time historically So, they have not moved in precise lockstep   We are certainly mindful of there being a relationship over time By the end of the period, we are moving into the vicinity, if not below, what one might judge to be a natural rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing This reflects in part the slower growth of goods output in the economy, but it also reflects the fact that we have built into this forecast very sizable increases in manufacturing capacity, largely in response to what has been a very large increase in investment in manufacturing to date and what seems likely to be strong investment going forward So, that is a significant ingredient in the diminution of capacity utilization in manufacturing It is one of the factors that provides considerable hope that we are going to see a damping of inflationary pressures and a flattening out of materials prices--that such prices will not be a concern when we get to the latter part of this year and certainly as we move through 1996  -10-    5/23/95   Yes Obviously, as we move out into 1996 and capacity utilization drops, corporate profits will not be growing the way they have been, cash flow won't be as favorable, and all of these factors will work to damp further increments to growth of the capital stock in manufacturing We are not going to have an ongoing decline in capacity utilization forever, but this is our short-run forecast A lot of this is given by the natural lags in the process of adding to capacity so that we think there is a good deal of momentum in this process going out several quarters   I'm not sure I have a concept of a convergence process here, but over time the average and what we estimate as being a natural rate in terms of price behavior is at 82 percent or maybe a bit less One would anticipate that if we stretch this out, there would be some processes that would probably move us in that direction   [Statement-see Appendix]   I think your characterization of a favorable surprise relative to many typical models is right When we get surprises, we go back and start tinkering with models We want to see whether we can fit history better and whether we can, for example, introduce something into these equations such as lagged wages that    9/26/95  might capture a trend in wages or a wage norm and reduce the errors significantly I don't know whether that is particularly appealing on analytical grounds, but there is a sense that we are locked into some trend here People seem to have a 3 percent figure in mind about wage increases If we looked at wages alone and tried to model those, we would probably also see some surprise there in terms of how low the inflation has been But we do think that the overall compensation number is more relevant over time, and we have seen the downward movement in medical costs as constituting something of a favorable supply shock in a sense to the system  There are significant changes going on in the medical care market It appears that after a period in which many businesses were surprised year after year by how fast the costs of their medical benefits were rising and they did not necessarily subtract those costs from workers' wages, we are getting a reversal of that now that there is some revolution in the market for medical services Business firms have not passed the benefits of reduced medical cost increases through to workers on the wage side or in other benefits As we see it, this process is likely to continue but with diminishing quantitative importance as we go forward A lot of firms have made the shift to managed care systems Medical care inflation itself seems to be stabilizing There are some risks, as we noted in passing in the Greenbook, that if some of the reforms that are being proposed for Medicare and other programs are adopted, there could be more cost shifting to insurance providers So, we think that this run may be at its end, but we just don't see anything emerging now that looks like a substantial acceleration Many of the Reserve Banks have reported in their letters on the discount rate and in the Beigebook that there are signs of tightness here and there and that employers are responding with higher wages But one also has a sense that there are pockets of weakness and that many employers are looking to other means besides raising compensation to solve their labor problems   I think we will remain below most model forecasts, but we have projected a little acceleration in the growth of compensation costs as we go through the next few quarters   Very slow   On the first question, if this emphasis on training is a manifestation of poor quality of the labor force, then that presumably has some implication for potential output In terms of the growth of the labor force, the effective growth is less than it would appear That tendency can be made up for by investing to improve the quality of the labor force Training presumably is a cost that would perhaps be an element in some markup over perceived unit labor costs if it doesn't show up as a form of compensation  On the NAIRU, I suppose it's possible that this deterioration in the quality of the labor force, if that's what it is, could lead to a greater tendency toward mismatches in the labor market and some elevation of the NAIRU But I don't think we have any sense that there has been a radical change in this Employers have been complaining about the quality of workers for a good many years I don't know that what you describe is an entirely different circumstance, but maybe the response is different I alluded to this when I was replying to President Parry We do hear these reports, and it does seem that there is this alternative response of taking a less qualified worker and making that investment in training rather than bidding for the scarce pool of well-qualified workers  On the job insecurity question, I don't think there are any direct measures There may be some opinion polls of which I'm not aware that might have asked people how they felt about this One can look at some indicators, such as perceptions of job availability in the Conference Board survey, and relate that to actual unemployment and other labor market indicators to see if things are out of kilter My recollection is that the number of people saying that jobs are in scarce supply is probably a little high relative to what one might have expected We have tinkered with the question of whether there is a systematic influence by, for example, putting variables into a Phillips curve relation and so on My sense is that we haven't come up with anything that is very persuasive   I think one can make an inference from other expressions of dissatisfaction with the current situation in the economy and just anecdotal evidence from the press and so on that people probably feel that they don't have a lock on their jobs, even    9/26/95  in a well-established corporation, the way they once did There is a sense that because of changing technology the loss of a job will incur the risk that the next job will pay a much lower wage than the current job and lower than might have been expected in prior years   Mr Chairman, I think you've made a very good point about these levels and changes It certainly would be a possibility that as unemployment remains in a relatively low zone, though the average duration is remaining relatively long, people would become a little less concerned about their potential vulnerability so that that could alter the--   Exactly   Yes Your point's well taken   Moreover, for any given amount of unemployment, if it were disproportionately short term it would suggest that people were able to find jobs relatively quickly   But when there's a lot of long-term unemployment, that would suggest there may be some difficulty for people who have been displaced, for example, with all the restructuring   I think that was the leading hypothesis for a long time   I think it ultimately depends on what monetary policy you pursue In essence, given our assumption of little change in the federal funds rate--we have just a little ticking down at the end of next year--we don't see here an aggressive effort to offset the ongoing fiscal restraint We have specified a three-year reduction, but the presumption would be that Congress is going to pass something that goes even beyond that So, fiscal restraint would be an ongoing force in the economy, though diminishing As we have it, the biggest degree of fiscal restraint is imposed in 1996 Some of the restraint that flows from earlier actions--over 1993, for example--disappears and the smaller increments from our assumed new fiscal package are what is left So, on our assumption, the degree of fiscal restraint really is diminishing a bit as we move out in time We felt that, (1) we wanted to stick to the steady policy assumption for the baseline, and (2) this produced in our analysis an outcome where resource utilization rates eased only moderately and created a situation in 1997 where there was only a small degree of slack in the system  -12-    9/26/95  Given the enunciated goal of moving toward price stability, that seemed to be reasonable to present to you As you move on out, unless you wanted to accelerate the progress toward price stability, if the tendency was for that gap to remain and for the unemployment rate to continue drifting up, you might want to pursue a somewhat more stimulative policy for a time to at least stabilize things at a comfortable level of resource utilization It's a question in this mechanical fashion of just how fast you want to move toward price stability   In our forecast we don't anticipate that there will be any favorable wealth effects as we move beyond this year   There are some very obvious questions, for example in the area of medical care We have not specified our package in a way that calls for staking out any position on this But it's quite conceivable that people of reasonable means, if they were called on to pay a larger Medicare premium or to have some deductible or something, might continue to consume roughly the same amount of medical care and save less in the short run As I suggested, the package being discussed now includes lots of changes in programs that are very fundamental--for example, the welfare program There are potential labor supply responses that we will have to come to grips with If legislation is enacted in the next few weeks, we may not be able to put that off for very long in our analysis for the forecast I don't think it's going to be a big deal over the next couple of years even if there is a phasing in and so on But over the longer haul, there could be effects on saving behavior; there could be effects on labor supply behavior and maybe many other effects We'll have to look very carefully at what are pretty radical changes that are being discussed in some of these programs Regarding the transfer of programs to states and the block grants, we have assumed that there will be some short-run cushioning for states and localities in cases where there were cutbacks in funding to absorb some of those cutbacks and maintain benefit levels But over time that would change, too   [Statement--see Appendix]   At this point we don't see anything in the cards that is going to change the picture materially We have had relatively rapid expansion of capacity in our forecast, and the incoming data in the updated survey on investment have supported that We will be revising our numbers on production and capacity utilization, but my sense from talking to people who are engaged in that work is that this isn't going to change the picture materially Basically, we think we have something that's pretty much parallel to our assessment of the labor market We are a little on the tight side of what would be "nonaccelerating" inflation over time   I don't know that I just looked at the rounded data here which show a core CPI increase last month of exactly 3 percent, but I don't have the data with the Board staff's estimate   We have discussed this in the past, and as I said, we pondered this question of whether having nominal interest rates running higher than nominal GDP growth over time is an unnatural  -14-    11/15/95  relationship It strikes one as being something that is unsustainable We think of this, in terms of government budget positions and so on, as a relationship that's unsustainable But over limited periods of time, this relationship clearly has varied tremendously, and there isn't a very compelling short-run macro story that pushes you toward equilibrating these things or having the nominal GDP growth rate higher than the nominal interest rate Certainly, our view in formulating this revised forecast is that, given real interest rates in the current environment--one in which we are experiencing ample availability of credit, and we looked at all the other parameters of financial conditions at this point--these real interest rates are not creating quite the damping effect on aggregate demand that we anticipated earlier But we do expect that they will create some drag on final demand and that we will have this tapering off in the growth of consumer and business expenditures We think there is a coherent story here But it does in essence have implicit in it, if you like that model, a relatively high natural real rate of interest for the forecast period   We have intermediate- and long-term rates rising in nominal terms, but we see no reason to think that inflation expectations for the intermediate to long run will change materially The 3 percent inflation that we are forecasting is very much in line with what private forecasters are expecting I think the survey evidence suggests that expectations for inflation over the intermediate run probably run in the 3 to 4 percent range I don't think that would change a great deal You are correct in noting that the uptick in real interest rates has a damping effect in the forecast It's one of the things that contributes to the deceleration of fixed investment, residential and nonresidential, and gives us this moderation in growth going forward   Let me make several comments I probably won't be able to achieve absolute coherence here In a sense, we have introduced a supply shock into this forecast to the extent that we have lowered our NAIRU and in essence have raised the potential output ceiling On the trend of potential output growth, the analysis that we have offered is that when one looks at data--not on a 1987 fixed- price basis, but on a more recent base year or chain-weighted basis-- recent evidence of surprises in productivity growth disappears We seem to be running on a trend that has been in place for well over a decade, something on the order of a percentage point in these terms It doesn't suggest that we had a big surprise in the last couple of quarters It doesn't suggest that there has been a radical revolution over this decade relative to where we were running before Now, that may mean there was a mismeasurement, as Chairman Greenspan noted earlier There may be components that could be added in and so on, but those add to both potential and actual measured GDP and don't alter the output gap So that doesn't imply anything different about the pressures on the inflation side  Training is an interesting question I would remind you that training costs money It's a cost, as you've characterized it, of production It would have to be made up on the price side So it's not a free good Second, I am not sure how clear the data are I think there may be bits and pieces around about how much expenditures on training have increased I am not well versed in that, but I have certainly seen anecdotal reports of it here and there Some of the stories I have seen over the years have suggested that a lot of this training goes to managers--upper level people They are getting all kinds of training that may not have particularly obvious payoffs in production I could cite the training here at the Federal Reserve [Laughter] It will be five years before my colleagues in HRM hear that and in the interim you are all sworn to secrecy! [Laughter]   Furthermore, a lot of this training is remedial Many of you have reported what directors and other contacts have told you about how it's really hard to find workers who are literate or numerate A question might be raised as to whether they have to spend more and more money just to maintain the quality of labor input that they are accustomed to In a sense, one of the reasons for some of this investment in computerization--I have speculated about this with my colleagues, who would rather I not say this--may be to make up for some of the deficiencies of the work force A simple example is something like fast food outlets where workers are able to tell you what you owe them without having to enter in any numbers They just punch a button that has a picture of a "Whopper" or whatever it is I think we need to be a little cautious here in thinking that there is a revolution in progress leading to an improvement of the labor force  -16-    11/15/95  We all recognize that achieving the gains in productivity that might potentially result from the investment in high-tech information processing equipment will only be achieved when people know how to use the equipment, reorganize production processes accordingly, and the whole infrastructure is developed Maybe it's still ahead and maybe we are not optimistic enough going forward But from what we can see to date, we feel pretty comfortable with our assessment of the trends in potential output   This is consumer durables spending excluding motor vehicles in our forecast, As we have suggested, we think there will probably be some improvement in sales of appliances and home furnishings in connection with the surge in home sales that we saw over the summer; reports seem reasonably favorable into early fall Second, we anticipate that there will be some considerable strength in home electronics, computers, and other such items--hardware and software   Obviously, the housing element flattens out We have a weaker motor vehicle contribution in the first quarter Yes, this is a big Christmas for computer buying in our thinking I don't want to get too fancy about this Obviously, whether the sales occur in December or in January isn't of great moment for the GDP forecast-- and certainly not for monetary policy--because the production might occur anyway on this schedule   Yes, and I think it gets counted with books and other things and in many cases probably is bought at the same outlets That's one of the real problems in gauging the actual level of expenditures   The question is whether it lasts very long or whether you have to go out and buy a new one next year when you buy your replacement computer That is where it's counted   Let me just say this The incoming data have been weaker and that would be a component of this downgrading of the PCE that I suggested would be appropriate at this point   As you know, the personal saving rate is 44 percent in the forecast and it has been 44 percent So, nominal expenditures are roughly keeping pace with nominal income   Probably inadvertence in the forecasting process Let's take a look again The latter part of the year is weaker in 1997 The saving rate is down because of the intra-yearly tax pattern that we have and our assumptions about how people will spend their tax cuts   We do have a deceleration going on at the end of 1997 in general   As you may recall, it wasn't until quite recently that levels of investment got to the point where we were really adding rapidly to the capital stock My sense is that those people who would try to approach estimation of what labor productivity should be through a production function find some pretty substantial rates of increase in labor productivity in 1987 dollars My recollection is 1-3/4 percent   Indeed, how strong investment has been is obviously important to the story   Yes   I don't have the number in my head for what you would derive from a production function approach But I know from talking to people like Larry Meyer and from our own quarterly model work that one could argue for a somewhat higher number than we have embedded in our forecast   That's all a matter of model estimation There is still the question of what the actual experience has been The simplest way of looking at this is, if you believe in Okun's law and, admittedly, it is not a precise relationship in every time period, that there is nothing in the behavior of the unemployment rate that would suggest that we have been grossly underestimating the growth potential of output   I think some would argue that what we are seeing that is reminiscent of the late 1980s is this undaunted optimism on my  -19-    11/15/95  part [Laughter] There is a distinct chance that this will be declared Prell's second folly and that we inched toward a somewhat greater degree of optimism on how low the NAIRU might be just when things were starting to turn   We were somewhat seduced at that time by the run of good experience after we had hit what we thought was probable NAIRU territory As we saw the unemployment rate moving in the 5 to 5-1/2 percent zone, we got a little more optimistic than in retrospect we should have and there is the risk that that is also the case at this point In terms of sheer econometric tests, you can't say that the experience that we have had over the past year, a relatively brief period, deviates in a statistically significant way from what model predictions would have been based on a NAIRU as high as the roughly 59 percent that we had before we made this change, or even numbers in the low sixes Compensation per hour numbers have begun to push the envelope a bit But if you look at reduced form models with prices, there is certainly no inconsistency with a higher NAIRU I think we have cautioned, at least implicitly in what we've said, that we are making an assessment of what we see going on now and what is likely to be going on in the near term in light of all the factors affecting the economic environment It is not necessarily the case that we can expect the NAIRU to be permanently lower than what we have previously thought it to be There may have been some short-run favorable supply side effects, so to speak, that helped push the short-run NAIRU below where we thought it was, and it may pop back up We need to be very cautious and continue to watch this Some people point to the other compensation-per-hour numbers that come out in the productivity cost release, and conclude that that has turned up--Larry Meyer, for example, and that's perhaps because it fits his model It is true that there certainly has been no deceleration in core CPI this year The latest data are a little worse than they have been for the last few months But given the average hourly earnings and the slight uptick in the core CPI, I would rather have had the numbers go the other way than have had my neck stuck out this time   There is also possible irreparable damage to the November CPI estimate because they normally have people out in the field all month getting quotes Those people presumably are not out in the field now If they get back soon, this may not lead to any major miscues in the estimates, but there is still a potential problem for the estimates   In fact, we may not publish another number in 1987 dollars! [Laughter]   I'm a sporty kind of guy!   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   One feature of the latest forecast is a change in our projection of labor force growth As we have reported from time to time over the past few years, we have been surprised by the lack of rise in the labor force participation rate The most recent observation was distinctly short of our expectations So, we have flattened that path out considerably and have less labor force growth going forward Now, what would happen if demand were stronger and employment were to grow faster? One possibility is that labor force participation remains on the track we are forecasting and we do get a decline in the unemployment rate relative to the path we projected and that creates some additional pressures Alternatively, maybe at long last what we would see is a response by potential workers to the healthy demand for them, and you would see some renewed growth in labor force participation and stability in the unemployment rate I don't think we can say what will happen with any certainty at this point, but we have made a distinct change in the trajectory of the labor force in this forecast   I don't know what this particular regression is I assume we are talking about the MPS model   Let me say, we are looking at net worth in the model, so that also shows up, which is the other side that you cited in passing at the end of your comments Could I clarify one point without getting into an argument about the construction of these numbers? There is no significant wealth effect built into our forecast If you look at the personal saving rate, there is no decline from where we have been In essence, we pretty much neutralized this, taking into account also the debt side of the picture That's why I characterized this as an upside risk It doesn't take the full dimension of the model wealth effect in order to give rise to an upside risk of the sort that I was suggesting   No   We won't get a 1987 dollar figure The waters could be muddied in other ways, but we do think the third quarter looks stronger than it did before   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I take it you are not referring to yesterday's--   I don't have a good answer My sense is that a reduction in herd size probably has not begun in any significant way That remains one of the uncertainties It could be that the markets anticipate that such a development will occur in the not too distant future   Yes We see that as more of a risk as we move out into 1997   The article did echo a couple of the reasons that we stated in the Greenbook Admittedly, we stated those reasons only very briefly   One was the remark about replacement demand I certainly have heard this from people in the industry They feel that in many cases businesses have acquired about all the computers they need The question is how fast they are going to replace those computers, given the changes in technology That was a central theme of yesterday's article It also is clear that businesses confront an ongoing decision about whether to buy or to wait for the next round of technology This is not something we really went into in the Green- book, but it is one of the uncertainties in the forecast We have gone through a number of product cycles At times this has been a significant feature in our thinking--that perhaps people would hold off buying until the Pentium chip became available or some earlier version In this case, the P6 chip that is just coming out might lead to another issue of timing Basically, though, the industry seems to be mature enough at this stage--its penetration of the business market, in particular, seems great enough--that the movements in investment more generally are going to show through in computer purchases If we are in a phase when the accelerator effects are no longer a big plus, we would expect that to show through more in the computer sector than it might have earlier when computers were still increasing dramatically their penetration in the business sector   President Jordan, that's a good question I do not have a ready answer for you Obviously, the deflator has shifted more than the other price indexes   That suggests an element of mix change here It is conceivable that, on further investigation, we shall find that there is something we are not entirely comfortable with in these numbers So, I shall take that question as something for us to investigate before the next round   I should have noted that Because the nominal GDP is higher, there is a bit of a mystery here for us   No, but in the course of a forecast where one needs to align both the income and the product sides of the accounts, the nominal totals are relevant We should not end up with numbers that don't make sense   Let me remind you that the observation was about a forecast made last September That September forecast was put together prior to a total revision of the national income accounts Some of those revisions did affect nominal GDP going back historically I don't want to go too far here I am not certain   Right But the fact is that the largest change in these nominal GDP forecasts for 1997 was between September and November There has been a further upward creep that accumulates to a significant difference from September to now But if one looked at the changes just over the past couple of months, one would see a pretty small creep and it would not be quite so shocking We have to go back and look at this in light of the fact that, as Dave Stockton pointed out, we really did have a total change in the accounts in this period, both in terms of data whose history was revised and concepts that have changed   You are getting into a fundamental question about the whole forecast, and I am focusing more on the fact that, in particular, our consumer price forecast looking out into 1997 did not change a great deal Our real GDP forecast has not changed much either, but we have switched from 1987 dollars to chain-indexed 1992 dollars Allowing for that, our real GDP forecast for 1997 is stronger than it was back in September You have just pointed to a couple of factors that would be relevant to thinking about that one, we have a lower funds rate path than we anticipated at that time; two, we have removed some of the fiscal restraint that was in the forecast looking out through 1997 So, there is a consistency in that respect I was focusing more on this narrower technical question and this relative movement in our price measures That raises an interesting question   I find the distinction a little awkward myself, having dealt with these numbers What I have always found strange was that no one changed the numbers after the discussion at the meeting, which may have given people a clearer impression of what the Committee was up to But the numbers stood as they were, presumably as numbers that were based on your optimal policy prescription To divorce that from what is possible in your minds would seem pretty strained to me So, I take this as a matter of emphasis to remind you that, especially for forecasts that extend further out in time, you should be thinking about what you want to achieve and not just producing some forecast based on current conditions, which is what some people have done   We indicate that they are consistent with the monetary ranges that the Committee selected and so on So, they presumably are based on some policy plan That is what the Humphrey- Hawkins Act calls for   President Jordan, I figured that that was what your GDP forecast would embody Are you asking the staff to take each of the members' forecasts and rationalize them in terms of productivity?   Each of you would have a different model and different relationships   [Statement--see Appendix]   In 1998, economic growth would remain essentially around trend and the unemployment rate around 5-1/2 percent Our judgment is that the core inflation rate is tending to rise gradually and perhaps it would continue to do so in 1998 We do not think that we are far beyond the NAIRU, and that would mean a very gradual trend in the direction of more inflation   There are some exacerbating factors, as I emphasized in my briefing, and those are areas where the uncertainties are substantial But as we looked at the probability distribution in light of developments since the last Greenbook, we felt that we ought to assign a higher expected value to the levels of grain and food prices down the line That is the most important exacerbating factor   We noted in the Greenbook that we do not feel that we can pin that down with any certainty I think we are already seeing this transmission process affecting the poultry area where producers are cutting back on their production levels, and we expect to see a price pass-through there fairly promptly   We have looked at the futures prices and--   We are making assumptions, but there are no guarantees Certainly, it is our perception that things have started to turn in the cattle area Whereas, a couple of months ago, we saw the risks that herds would be cut back, the anecdotal evidence suggests that this process is now under way So, we feel more certain that there will be that pressure several months down the road   I guess our assumption is that it would probably come out of savings to some degree in the short run Over time, we would expect people to reallocate their spending and to absorb that elsewhere But in the very short run, there probably would be some inelasticity It would not be a one-for-one substitution for other expenditures   There is still an anticipation in the market that oil prices will decline What happened yesterday, though, is that prices in near-term contracts jumped dramatically after their initial drop The market reports talked about the closing out of near-term contracts, some short covering, and so on As we read most of the commentary, though, there is still the expectation that the net effect of the Iraqi oil flow will be to push oil prices down a couple dollars per barrel below what they otherwise would have been It is recognized that in the near term there is going to be some tendency to rebuild stocks, and that may mean that we are not going to get all of this increased supply benefit passing through to retail energy prices very promptly   In terms of our CPI forecast, if we assume that the price of oil declines a little faster, the contour of the forecast changes in that we have a little less inflation this year than next year But at this point, we need to monitor what is happening in the markets   We are well aware of the calculations that show how the grain in a loaf of bread accounts for just a few cents of its cost There has been an increase in packaging and distribution costs so that there is less sensitivity to changes in grain prices than in the past The big kicker here is the meat price story, and there again we are less certain about the timing There have been changes in the production processes, as we have seen dramatically illustrated in the poultry and pork industries So, one does have to be a little cautious in following past patterns here, but we think that ultimately this grain price increase is creating a lot of pressure on margins and will lead to reduced supply That is where the big kicker will come over the forecast period   Perhaps I think we need to see what happens with cereal coupons and all of that business   That underscores again that, while we know something about a good chunk of this year's wheat crop, we know very little about the corn and soybean crop outlook We are making a bet, and the markets are making a bet We are pretty much in line with the markets, but there is going to be a lot of volatility and we are not going to know the outcome for another four or five months I think one's optimism on this score has to be tempered by the fact that inventories are quite low and demand growth seems to be robust enough that one year of good harvests probably will not relieve the pressures entirely   I think that's important whether it's a formal COLA--and COLAs are much less important in the economy today than they    5/21/96  once were--or an informal process, in the sense that employers are conscious of what is happening to the cost of living and have some sort of behavioral norms for adjusting wages in light of changes in the cost of living In any event, there would seem to be a tendency for one-time shocks to be built into wage increases as they engender a certain elevation of expectations about ongoing price increases I think there is little basis for thinking that people will look at this price increase as a one-time shock, that workers will absorb that increase, pass the income willingly on to the farmers, and we won't have any resulting elevation of wage increases with resulting cost pressures To date we don't have a lot of evidence to support this hypothesis, but if one looks at the Michigan survey for early May, coming as it does on the heels of the April survey, the one-year, mean inflation expectations measure has gone up fairly substantially and it seems quite likely that it has been affected by the gasoline price increase We think that increase will be reversed fairly quickly, but as we move out into the second half of 1996, we are going to have, in our forecast at least, food prices increasing more rapidly and we would anticipate that the consumer will be quite sensitive to that change   That's the most direct driving force   As best one can judge, yes   I take it that you are suggesting that we take as given the projected output path and look beyond that The year 1995    5/21/96  is still something of a mystery We had essentially stable unemploy- ment in the face of very low GDP growth One possibility is that GDP growth was mismeasured One hint that we have, and have mentioned previously, is that looking at the addition from the income side one would conclude that GDP should have grown about a percentage point faster That would help to reconcile this behavior I don't want to push that too far We don't know where the truth is in that regard, but it is a possibility Another point is that these relationships are not super tight in the short run There is considerable varia- bility in the Okun's law relationship This means that what happened last year could be viewed as just a random event or we could have some continued disturbance as we go forward Last year, we had very weak growth in the labor force We also had very small increases in household employment These tend to correlate, but perhaps it is arguable that somehow or other we will get some rebound in the growth of the labor force and unemployment will tick up a bit and average out in line with the experience in earlier years But there is nothing to suggest that we ought to think about it that way, and going forward, we have the labor force tending to grow slowly with a flat labor force participation rate That is one uncertainty that we discussed previously, but basically we have a normal alignment of output growth and unemployment movements in our forecast   I think that brings you back then to the question of whether demand really will slacken as quickly and as much as we have in the forecast I indicated that a number of assumptions about the behavior of various sectors underlie that forecast These really have not changed in our view Our basic view has been that we don't see underlying forces in monetary policy, fiscal policy, the dollar, and so on that ought to be expected to produce persistently more rapid or slower growth than potential as we move out In the very short run, we can see a flattening of motor vehicle production The arithmetic relating to that helps us to reduce growth very quickly in our forecast from a more rapid pace in the second quarter to a moderate pace in the third quarter We don't see ongoing, double- digit growth in business fixed investment as plausible, but we recognize some upside risk on the computer side On the consumer side, we could now be seeing the wealth effects that were not perceptible earlier, and if that continued in some significant magnitude our consumption forecast might have an upside risk In housing, the anecdotal indicators and recent survey evidence do not suggest that we are getting the kind of weakening in starts that we have in our forecast, but we are anticipating that there will be a significant drop, maybe fairly quickly So, we can see these upside risks Perhaps there are risks on the downside as well, but I take your point, and I think that I communicated the view that the risk seems at least as great on the upside at this point   We recognize that, because we have a new current population survey that has been in place for only a short time, the short-run movements are very difficult to assess The seasonal factors could have changed, and we don't have enough evidence on what they are doing So, we need to take these numbers with a grain of salt   Well, I can't say that there is a surprise that I can point to I suppose that relative to our forecast one thing that happened last year was that we got a lot of growth in profits We don't see that as out of line with corporate profit reports, but, certainly, as things evolved last year that was one factor that was a surprise Basically, we have had a significant swing in statistical discrepancies, and where that gets reduced, whether it's on the product side or the income side, one can't know Historically, I think you find it somewhere in-between and a little more toward the income side on average   That is something that might be noted about our forecast In essence, disposable income is currently being reduced by the capital gains taxes that we think are probably a significant factor in the heavy tax revenues, and yet that does not show up in income   Charles Siegman will start us off this morning, Mr Chairman   [Statement--see Appendix]   I am not aware of any Certainly, in this particular set of circumstances, were there not to be a major damping of underlying demand trends--and I do not see why that would necessarily occur from a strike of plausible duration--the attempt to make up the lost production to meet the pent-up demand for autos would press pretty hard on capacity The GM strike in March, as we have seen, created some turbulence in the data, and GM had to press production pretty hard after the strike In that recent period, we did not see major price increases in the auto industry So, the bottleneck there does not seem to have resulted in a lot of inflationary pressure   Our understanding is it would not occur before the expiration of the contract, which I believe is September 14 So, we presumably will have some information around the time of the next meeting The strike target is, as I gather, to be announced on August 22  SPEAKER(?) August 22   I would just note that in this auto industry situation there also are peculiarities that people will be focusing on in terms of whether the union is able effectively to set a pattern after they have negotiated an agreement with one of the auto makers I think there are major questions about the mechanics of this negotiation process with the three auto makers So, there will be a lot of grist for the analytical mills that look at how labor relations work   There is little I can say at this point because I do not really know the details of these revised data One obvious implication is that, if our estimates are correct, we will have stronger final sales and stronger output We also will get the same kind of inventory level that we estimated before, which suggests that inventory positions may be even leaner relative to sales than we had anticipated Obviously, that might have some favorable implications going forward Now, we are not talking about night and day differences, but we would lean in that direction We also want to look for whatever evidence of export trends there may be in these data, and we shall have to make a careful assessment of that Charles, maybe you know more   This nominal GDP change is so small that it is going to be very hard to pin down all the factors that go into it from different directions I don't think there is a major story here because, as I have said before, we do not approach the forecast in terms of taking interest rate assumptions and from that drawing directly a forecast of nominal GDP It is a complex process There has been a reassessment of some of the price series and relationships that have crept into the analysis We do have a situation where we have a bit more inflationary pressure because of (1) a lower starting point for the unemployment rate, (2) the minimum wage hike, and (3) we  -10-    8/20/96  are impressed by the wage data in the first half of the year that are tending to push us to a forecast that has a little more of an inflationary cast Given the nominal funds rate, we have a little more inflation and a monetary policy that is a little more accommodative as measured by real interest rates If you put these things together, they end up producing a nominal GDP path that is a little higher even with essentially the same real path   We have a monetary accommodation implicit in our forecast   We let the money stock be whatever it will be Whether it actually comes out faster in our forecast is also a function of how the recent developments have influenced our views of the money demand relationship We do not have faster money stock growth in this forecast   What we assume is that monetary growth will accommodate the maintenance of a nominal funds rate in the face of the growth of aggregate demand   We do not think there is enough of a slowdown in our forecast to relieve inflationary pressures Basically, what we  -11-    8/20/96  see is that the evidence on wage behavior in the first half of this year supports the view that we are operating at a level of resource utilization that is incompatible with maintenance of a steady rate of inflation in the economy We are not in such tight conditions, particularly looking at the capacity utilization side of the picture as well as the labor market side, that we would anticipate, absent external shocks, a very rapid pickup in inflation But we would expect some gradual updrift   I think our confidence in our assessment of the implications of this level of resource utilization has grown with the latest wage figures   I've observed what you well know, that the data certainly are supportive of the notion that there has been in the past couple of years a continued quite rapid improvement in productivity in manufacturing We get reports from business executives that they can produce as many widgets now as they did a few years ago with twice as many workers then I think the data are not completely inconsistent  -12-    8/20/96  with the reports we get anecdotally from the manufacturing sector In some of the nonmanufacturing sectors, we get into the difficult problem of measuring the output, and it is conceivable that output growth is being underestimated The only caveat in this regard is that, when we look on an aggregate level at what has been happening to output and what has been happening to unemployment, the relationship has held up reasonably well We had some veering off seemingly in 1995, but we now seem to be pretty much back on track with that basic Okun's law relation Ultimately, we think that is of critical importance because it tells us where resource utilization levels are headed for given measured levels of output growth   [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think I can comment very productively on your point about what future revisions may show We do not have a basis for a judgment about whether the allowances that the BLS makes in blowing up their samples for new firms and other statistical problems are on target this time or not To be sure, there have been sizable revisions at times in the past On the broader point, as I tried to suggest, we certainly do see evidence that hiring has continued to be quite robust, probably outstripping the trend increase in labor force growth However, I am not sure how much that tells us about things going forward It may be in essence that this reflects the strong production gains that we have seen recently rather than the anticipation of much more rapid growth in business than we have projected I think the indicators of business sentiment that we have suggest that firms are anticipating growth, but not necessarily growth that differs greatly from what we are forecasting It is a risk, and certainly this is a part of the picture where households that have enjoyed very sizable income gains recently, and probably are continuing to do so in September, add a certain buoyancy in the economy that is visible in consumer sentiment That is probably a response to the very favorable labor market environment   We are just moving too fast!   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   I think there always is a question about the behavior of the saving rate, particularly when we are estimating it ahead of the annual revisions of the NIPAs We have seen saving rate trajectories altered considerably by those statistical revisions Given that we feel that GDP growth may have been underestimated, it is not inconceivable that a part of those revenues could be in consumption expenditures I do not have any particular insight on that, but that may be one aspect of the situation that should make one cautious about jumping to conclusions But on the face of it--   I cannot give you an answer to that off the top of my head   Obviously, each time they do their quarterly estimate, they try to reconcile the income and product sides If they find income is stronger, they are presumably going to look for    11/13/96  opportunities to find product and add it in But I think they are limited by their source data And now they are running behind on the updating of the benchmarking to Census surveys and so on because they were unable to do their regular annual revisions That said, and recognizing that the data may be throwing us a curve, one would have anticipated over the past couple of years, all other things equal, that the saving rate would have declined appreciably in light of that increase in wealth The saving rate might have been depressed by 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point this year relative to a path that would be consistent with a stable wealth-to-income ratio, say, since the end of 1994 The apparent updrift that we have seen creates a considerable differential from that, and so we look to other possible factors One of them, as we have noted for some time, may be the fact that the wealth gains are not evenly distributed across the population A considerable number of households that have built up debts may now be restricting their spending The tightening of credit availability has contributed something, even if it has not been very great to this point Earlier we were seeing a liberalization of credit availability and that could have been enhancing consumption growth; now the credit effect presumably is moving in the other direction We also have offered a laundry list of other rumored factors that may be affecting the saving rate such as greater concerns about retirement security, particularly in light of the perception that Social Security may not be there fully for people now in the workforce; Medicare and Medicaid issues that might suggest less security about medical coverage later on; and the general notion of job insecurity While we do not see clear evidence that by historical standards people are unusually uncertain at this point about job prospects, there remains some general sense that all is not well and that jobs are not secure, so there could be some rise in precautionary saving levels   We do have some increase in real wages We have diminishing profit shares So, some shift is occurring in income shares   I should defer to our foremost authority on this, Mr Stockton   I should note that our estimates of the effects of these changes in method, or the market basket change in 1998, are somewhat conjectural It is not a simple, mechanical arithmetic story, and that is truer in some cases than in others But these are estimates; they are not engraved in stone I would remind the Committee that the Boskin Group is slated to come out with their final report on the bias by December I do not think we have any inside information on whether they will be revising their estimates up or down, but there certainly will be considerable focus on the issue at that time    11/13/96   That is right, yes   Well, final sales for the quarter could be changed at least noticeably, maybe not importantly, by a possible revision to September retail sales to be published tomorrow Moreover, we have yet to receive the net exports data for September, which are always a wild card At least some modest change in that number is possible, but at this point we would not expect a major change in the PCE estimate based on retail sales We are talking mainly about September In effect, enough of the quarter is known at this point that there is not going to be a big surprise In addition, there is only one more month of trade data So, we know it was a weak quarter for final sales  The inventory situation is harder to gauge at this point Built into the estimate that we gave you is the BEA assumption about retail inventory investment It is a moderate number We did not see any reason to quarrel with it, but the translation of these data into real inventory change is difficult There is a further wild card here in that a lot of the surprise in the wholesale trade inventory numbers was in food products There is some question about whether BEA might decide that, if it did not show up in those numbers, the food was still on the farm and maybe some adjustment should be made in farm inventories Nothing that we have been able to glean from discussions with BEA or from their previous behavior would lead us to assign a high probability of their making some ad hoc adjustment here, but it is a possibility   I think the numbers will probably hold up fairly well As I said, they may not be accurate numbers, but we have no basis for gauging a bias one way or the other We do not perceive that the trend in the growth of consumption has moderated to the degree that those third-quarter numbers might suggest   If I'm asked again, I might give a different answer!    11/13/96   Not highly confident, given the statistical uncertainties that I indicated We can imagine a number a little lower; we can imagine a number a little higher You will recall that one of the fundamental factors in our thinking about the third quarter was that the labor input was quite ample, and the income side would suggest there was room for considerably more growth On the other hand, when we looked at the first half of this year or the second quarter, we did not always see these things tracking perfectly; there was some averaging out The basic trend of growth in the mid-two's for this year seems fairly reasonable relative to the behavior of the unemployment rate, to other measures of labor input, and to our general sense that things had picked up and were running somewhat above the long-term trend   We have some notional views about proportions of the population that might be liquidity constrained or not liquidity constrained So, embedded in some models is a perspective on that But in preparing our forecast, we are not thinking of this on a disaggregated basis   Transfer income has been relatively strong, and to an extent that might lead one to have expected fairly firm consumption relative to aggregate income   Thank you [Laughter] Let me just say once again that our forecast is not based on the monetary aggregates Rather, we derive what we would expect in terms of monetary aggregate growth through our assessment of likely patterns of money demand consistent with the interest rates and economic activity we are forecasting That is a different framework than I think you are suggesting for thinking about the outlook for nominal GDP As we look ahead, we see an economy that is operating above potential and a gradual acceleration of inflation In such an economy, the growth of real output tends to erode gradually over time We anticipate some gradual deceleration in real output growth from 1996 to 1997 and 1998 I think there is a coherence to this, and nominal GDP is just a summation of these forces as we see the picture I do not have a particular view about 1999, but certainly we are coming out of 1998 in no better position with respect to the alleviation of inflationary pressures in the labor markets So, we would anticipate at this point an extrapolation of that gradual acceleration of inflation   Mr Chairman, in this case the reference is to the staff forecast, and the question is how to portray the movement of inflation in 1996, 1997, and 1998 and its relationship to--   In essence, it refers to the Greenbook forecast We could go back to the original wording in the preliminary draft of the minutes or we could put in something that says the price forecast is adjusted for technical changes   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   As I recall, it is up about 3/10 of a percent   They account for a very small portion, as you know, of the overall index   You mean the quarterly average?   Exactly, it's a very small weight in the outcome for the quarter, but we have been looking at the other evidence such as trends in orders, and we are comfortable in anticipating a moderate increase   We feel comfortable with that at this point We are anticipating that, in part because of the effects of the cold weather that showed up in the utilities component of IP in November, the energy component of PCE services would be quite robust in November I don't know what to make of all the anecdotal reports on Christmas sales activities, but I will note for what it is worth--and it may not be very much, for even though it has gained some prominence, it is a very small sample--that the Mitsubishi chain store report that came out this morning showed a quite sharp further increase in the latest week So, we have had a couple of weeks of distinct upward movement there We have heard other good things about retail sales So we are reasonably comfortable, especially given that--going back to the Chairman's arithmetic point--a deviation of a few tenths in the outcome for December will have only a modest effect on annualized growth rates   Not materially  -10-    12/17/96   More likely up than down given, for example, the stronger industrial production data Also, the single-family housing starts will feed through rather directly in the calculation of residential construction activity in the current quarter and add a smidge So, the adjustment might be in an upward direction but nothing of great significance   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   On our interpretation, there probably has been some positive effect  on consumption over the past year or so from the increase in financial wealth Setting aside  measurement problems, that effect likely has in reality been offset at least to some degree by  an increased propensity to save based on concerns about retirement income and for other  precautionary reasons Going forward, we would interpret our forecast as continuing to  incorporate some positive wealth effect, but again with these other factors tending to balance  that Because we have assumed that the stock market tops out as we move into the latter part  of this year and then declines noticeably in 1998, the wealth-to-income ratio falls back a  considerable distance toward where it was several years ago That tends to diminish the  wealth effect as we move out in 1998 Another factor to keep in mind is that we have had a  surge in income growth over the past year or so It would be natural, given a permanent  income view, for spending to lag a bit and for the saving rate, all other things equal, to edge    3/25/97  up a bit As income decelerates over the next year or so, we might still be getting some  adjustment in consumption that would then tend to result in the saving rate edging lower So,  we see a number of counteracting forces that we have tried, at least judgmentally, to balance  in a sensible way in the forecast   75 basis points   We felt quite uneasy about what kind of message the forecast would  convey had we retained the assumption of a flat nominal funds rate We perceived that the  underlying strength of demand has been greater than we expected Extrapolating that to  some degree, it exacerbates what we already saw as a fundamental instability I think this  was highlighted in some of the longer-run simulations in the last Bluebook, where we  stretched the projections out a bit Perhaps it became clearer to you there that what we  foresaw with unchanged nominal interest rates was in essence a path where resource  utilization was going to continue to be well above sustainable levels Following up on that  analysis, we thought that the assumed uptilt in the funds rate would be a natural way to    3/25/97  indicate that at some point nominal interest rates probably would have to rise to avoid  excessive stimulus We built in something that is on a par with what is happening to the core  CPI and to some of the broader GDP-related price measures   For all practical purposes the assumed rise in the funds rate is  tantamount in terms of the economic outcome to your not doing anything over the period  1997 and 1998   But I thought it might be a useful signal here of what we now  perceive to be the longer-term unsustainability of the scenario that we have been drawing in  prior Greenbooks   I guess it is a matter of interpretation as to what the opportunistic  approach entails If it entails making sure that the inflation rate does not move above the  recent range, then our forecast implies that a policy move is necessary at some point  Whether that means a relatively aggressive approach or something that involves a continued  "wait and see" stance and moving later, I don't think we can readily discern But the fact is    3/25/97  that our forecast does imply that, in an underlying sense, consumer price inflation is moving  above the 3 percent mark in 1998 If you view that as a ceiling in the range of acceptable  outcomes and the point where you want to apply the brakes, then I suppose you could argue  that a more aggressive approach than that associated with our baseline forecast is the one that  is consistent with opportunism But that is in the eye of the beholder I do not think we can  define its application that precisely   The "maybe" is an important qualifier That is not our baseline  forecast, but again these are matters of definition We do have a forecast that, given current  money market conditions, now sees the most likely outcome as above-trend growth for an  extended period and an unemployment rate that falls to 5 percent or less In some sense, you  could regard that as boom conditions even without going to the more dramatic, stronger  growth scenario that I suggested was a risk Why has this occurred? I think we consistently  said that we did not see the stimulus that would maintain above-trend growth, so we kept  forecasting that growth was going to fall back to something like trend for lack of a  compelling reason that it should not  What has happened? That is very hard to sort out If we look at consumer  behavior, for example, we have not had a drop in the saving rate It is true that the stock    3/25/97  market has been much stronger than we anticipated We have had a tremendous increase in  financial wealth that either has reflected or supported a tremendous surge in consumer  sentiment We are at very high levels of consumer confidence according to the Michigan or  the Conference Board surveys The current Michigan index is the highest since 1965, and in  only a few months in the history of that index have there been numbers this high I think  there is at this point some buoyancy in consumer demand beyond what we would have  anticipated We see very lean inventories We continue to be surprised on the upside by the  strength in computer investment; we have had some very strong numbers We seem to be  getting a more solid performance in nonresidential construction than we anticipated You  will recall that we were somewhat puzzled by weak contracts data through much of last year,  but they tended to catch up with an enormous burst in the fourth quarter All the anecdotal  evidence suggests there is more momentum in that sector than was apparent six months ago,  and that has multiplier effects The upside surprise seems to be a collection of things that  have supplied a considerable lift to economic activity At this point, while we are still  somewhat in the spirit of saying that economic growth probably will move back toward  trend, we see an economy that seems to have considerable momentum, and we are not  optimistic that the moderation in growth is going to occur overnight Basically, one of the  things we learned was that financial conditions were not imposing as much restraint on the  economy as we thought they would   I am not aware that anyone has tried that; it is an interesting idea It  sounds like a lot of work   I am not sure that we have that much free computer space right  now! We can check into it   Thank you very much, Mr Chairman Carol Low is distributing a  table to which I will be referring in a couple of minutes [Statement--see Appendix]   You are talking about the natural rate of interest, I presume   I guess one could interpret what I have said about the stocks of  capital goods and so on as implying a lower natural rate going forward One could look at  this from various vantage points Whether, indeed, one should view the development of  surprisingly strong growth over the past year as a favorable supply shock, I am not sure  There certainly are some elements in the picture that support that view The labor force  growth that we have had over the past year might fall in that category If one felt that we  were seeing something more than the normal kind of cyclical kick to productivity over the  past couple of quarters as output growth surged, say from strengthened aggregate demand,  then that might be characterized as a supply shock I am not sure that conclusion is clearcut  Indeed, by our normal rules of thumb and model results, I do not think we have had any  more productivity acceleration in the past couple of quarters than one would have expected  with a surge in aggregate demand, a rise in output, and firms being able to get more mileage  out of their existing resources   Barring some shift in the demand for money--this is almost  tautological--we would expect to see slower money growth with the moderation in nominal  GDP expansion that we are anticipating But our forecast in a sense says that, on an  intermediate-term basis rather than looking quarter-to-quarter and defining movements in  natural rates of interest in that sense, we have the actual rate too low relative to the natural  rate to bring us back to equilibrium between actual and potential output In other terms, we  have an ongoing gap between the natural unemployment rate and the actual unemployment  rate and some tendency for inflation to pick up   As we have pointed out previously, the money demand relationship,  the relationship of velocity and opportunity cost, has been quite stable over the past couple of  years And we have not had a big movement in interest rates, so you would expect close to  equal growth of M2 and nominal GDP   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the opening sentence of the Greenbook, we characterized the economy as continuing "to hum along in recent months" As of last Thursday, we were able to report that hiring remained strong and that high-spirited consumers were once again spending heavily at auto dealers and other retail outlets Now we can report that homebuilders are busy, too According to this morning's release, which is summarized in the table you received, total housing starts were unchanged in July, as we expected Single-family starts rose 3 percent, just a hair above our guess, but permits for such units were off 2 percent On the whole, these data, along with the upbeat report from the homebuilders survey for early August, would seem to support our view that the housing sector is doing quite well at this juncture  Indeed, the basic point is that the indicators now in hand provide few direct hints that economic expansion will be limited to the relatively moderate path that we think is ahead We are predicting that real GDP growth will average just 2-1/4 percent over the next few quarters--well below the 3-1/4 percent rate of the past year And as you know, a slowing of at least this degree likely is necessary, given our assessment of the trend of potential, if we are to avoid a further intensification of pressures in an already taut labor market  Unfortunately, our near-term growth forecast hinges crucially on a judgment about the outlook for inventories--a very tricky element to predict In a nutshell, we find it difficult to believe that the pace of accumulation in the second quarter was as high as the available statistics indicate But, after discounting the data as much as we feel comfortable doing at this point, we are still left with a rate of inventory growth that is clearly unsustainable-- around a 6 percent annual rate We don't think there were major overhangs of undesired stocks at midyear, but there will be if the accumulation doesn't slow soon Our guess is that it will, exerting an appreciable damping influence on GDP growth in the second half of this year  What could go wrong with this forecast? The possibilities are numerous One is that the rate of accumulation could have been even lower than we have assumed, so that the near-term drag on output might therefore be less than we are anticipating It's my intuition that this should be viewed as the more likely alternative to our Greenbook forecast than that inventory investment has been greater than we have assumed    8/19/97  But what if we have the rate of inventory investment in the second quarter just right? The possibility would still exist that businesses will want to maintain that brisk pace of accumulation a little longer because they are highly optimistic about sales prospects However, I don't sense such a degree of optimism now; nor am I as concerned as I was earlier that final demand might seriously overshoot our forecast, in turn generating additional inventory requirements  In particular, we have been noting for some time the risk that consumer demand might yet surge in response to the enormous run-up in stock market wealth Now that the national income accounts show the personal saving rate declining considerably over the past couple of years, the likelihood of such a spending surge would seem to have diminished Moreover, for what it is worth as we look ahead, the flip side of this argument is that we can perhaps also be somewhat more confident that there will indeed be some demand-damping effect if the stock market drops, as we are still predicting it will The wavering of the market recently might suggest we are on the right track in that regard, but we have been wrong before  There are uncertainties regarding other components of final demand as well, but I think our forecast is reasonably balanced overall I won't take the time to run through all the sectors of demand, but Ted and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have  Before concluding, however, I would like to say a few words about the price outlook We continue to believe that a pickup in inflation is brewing out there in a very tight labor market, but it clearly has not surfaced yet As you undoubtedly noticed, we have lowered our forecast of price inflation again--this time by a couple of tenths of a percent through next year  The incoming wage and price indexes provided only a bit of the motivation for this adjustment The ECI for June and the CPIs for June and July were no more than a rounding difference below our expectations But we saw other grounds as well for some greater optimism about the price outlook  Notably, while we think the recent run-up in the dollar is unlikely to hold up permanently, it seems prudent to anticipate only a gradual erosion in its value over the forecast period Consequently, we have anticipated a tad more restraint on inflation coming through the trade sector in coming quarters Certainly, the auto market is demonstrating the efficacy of import competition as an inflation fighter, as the Big Three have cut prices to save market share  In addition, however, the prospects of competitive pressures damping inflation seem greater now because the inventory adjustment is likely to    8/19/97  contribute to some slippage in the level of factory capacity utilization Moreover, the revised NIPA data suggest that profits have been much stronger and that corporations have more cushion to absorb some increase in labor costs Finally, there has been increasing evidence of a gradual downdrift in inflation expectations among individuals, for example in the Michigan SRC survey, which bodes well for the nominal wage outlook  Speaking of wages, in refining our inflation forecast, we obviously did not give much weight to a concern that surfaced occasionally last week when commentators were looking for excuses for the stock market decline-- namely, that the UPS strike might signal a major shift in the balance of power in the labor market, with workers now being able to dictate the terms and conditions of employment In particular, there was a fear that the outcome would be an erosion of firms' ability to use part-time and contingent workers at lower cost What we have heard of the settlement does suggest that the Teamsters won some significant pay gains for part-timers and 10,000 promised conversions of part-time jobs to full-time over the next five years But, pending receipt of more information about the agreement, it is far from obvious that what has happened would warrant a change in our forecast of only a gradual acceleration of labor costs   I don't think we know enough to answer that question at this point It  does appear that the gains for full-time UPS workers may not be spectacular in terms of hourly  wages I don't have a very good fix on what the part-time workers received   I saw those figures and I'm not sure to whom they apply or whether the  reference is to the minimum wage or some other measure    8/19/97   In that case, it would seem that there have been some significant gains   The company has been saying that they probably would lose some market  share, at least for a time, because many firms would no longer want to rely solely on UPS This  strike is going to be a fundamental problem for them, at least until they can rebuild confidence  among their customers I have not heard the assertion that they would be priced out of the market  by the wage agreement, but it was not known what the wage agreement would be when people  were making these pronouncements The company evidently has indicated, and as you said the  union has confirmed, that there probably will be some layoffs So, the situation is ambiguous I  don't know how much erosion of market share one might expect simply on the basis of the cost  factor   To a considerable extent, yes, but there is also a lot of capital investment  involved, particularly in the rapidly growing area of second-day service that UPS has developed  That is part of the story behind the changing employment mix In order to implement this rapid  delivery service, they needed to have a lot of people in concentrated periods to shuffle all the boxes  and get them loaded onto airplanes That is where the disproportionate rise in part-time  employment apparently occurred So, UPS evidently had some real problems in accommodating  the labor union's desires; many of their employees were working two four-hour shifts with a three-    8/19/97  hour break The unions did not want to call that an eight-hour day I do not know how these  working-condition aspects of the negotiations were resolved   I do not think, given the standard errors across most models, that one  would say that the price equations have uniformly broken down And I emphasize "equations"  We tend to look at an array of models in our forecast work Some perform better than others Not  surprisingly, the inclusion of import prices as one of the variables in the Phillips curve model  would have produced much better results in the last year or so in terms of anticipating the  deceleration that occurred in the core CPI So, we would not throw these models out at this point  We would use them cautiously, though, as we always have, knowing that they are not very precise  predictors in any given period As a practical matter, we have not found an alternative to these  models that we can turn to in our effort to come to grips with the problems involved in constructing  quantitative forecasts   As we emphasized, applying the normal lags that we found in estimating  consumption functions with wealth terms, the time profile and dimension of the stock market  movement that we have assumed suggest that we would not get much of a retardation in consumer    8/19/97  spending from that drop in stock prices before the end of 1998 If we contrast this outcome to a  counterfactual one where the market continued to climb at anything like the rate we've seen on  average over the past couple of years, I suspect that we would have a considerably different  consumption forecast for the latter part of 1998 Unless there is a significantly quicker effect  transmitted through consumer sentiment in some way, which at the fringes is allowed for in our  thinking, I think the story mainly is how robustly the economy will be moving in 1999   I don't want to convey the notion--and I hope we didn't state it quite that  way--that we believe the durable equipment sector is systematically less cyclical than it might have  been in the past Our assessment at this juncture is that there seem to be in train some changes in  technology of a dimension such that the demand for those products will outweigh whatever drag  there will be from the general flattening of profits and cash flow and the deceleration in output We  would not see the same kind of impetus in some other areas of capital spending such as basic  industrial equipment So, we have a continuation of quite rapid growth in real computer outlays  and fairly substantial growth in telecommunications equipment expenditures as measured by the  national income accounts The effects of this, as I think we noted in a footnote in the Greenbook,  on the growth in spending for overall producers' durable equipment are invisible in this forecast    8/19/97  relative to the previous forecast because of the chain weighting This means that the weights  diminish as the prices of these goods fall rapidly and this balances out the higher real growth that  we anticipate for this component But at this point we see very substantial reductions over the near  term in the cost of various components of computers and very strong continuing demands for  equipment in the networking area There seems to be enough innovation going on here that people  are going to find that their equipment is becoming obsolescent, and they are going to be replacing it  at a relatively fast rate for a while longer   We saw considerable strength in imports in the second quarter in a number  of categories in the consumer goods and machinery areas, and that suggests that imports may have  contributed to the very substantial increase in inventories in that period As we look to the third  quarter, we anticipate that some of the fallout in inventory accumulation will be mirrored in a more  modest increase in imports in the merchandise category   I don't recall whether there was any significant change in trends in those  estimates    8/19/97   Thank you, Mr Chairman It would not surprise me if many of you found the tale of the staff forecast in the Greenbook more tortuous than usual Preparing the forecast and then writing it up proved to be a considerable struggle for us this time    9/30/97  Perhaps we engaged in more soul-searching than was really required, but we found ourselves with what seemed like a complex task We had to contend with the fact that as we were at work, financial markets appeared to be in the grip of new era fever and stock prices were moving ever further above, and bond yields ever further below, where we had anticipated they would be We also had to explain why we were raising our forecast of near- term growth again, as well as why we thought moderation would yet be coming And we had to explain why, though we were lowering our inflation forecast again, we still expected prices to accelerate in coming quarters I will try to run through some of the highlights of our thinking as quickly as possible this morning  First, on the new era, we do not have any problem with the notion that a good many things have changed in the world There have been some marvelous technological advances that offer the potential for productivity gains The emergence of new market economies around the world has unlocked vast amounts of underutilized labor resources There has been a lowering of barriers to international trade and capital flows There have been gains in competition and efficiency through domestic deregulation and restructuring Also, today's labor market is marked by less unionization and by more flexible approaches to compensation  Of course, one may observe that these phenomena generally involve rather gradual processes, most of which have been in train for some time, but perhaps there has been some harmonic convergence that is yielding magnified effects recently In any event, the practical question is what to make of these observations when we attempt to prepare a forecast that may be helpful in framing monetary policy The new era advocates say the economy can grow faster, with lower unemployment, without generating inflation If they are simply talking about higher trend productivity growth or lower NAIRUs, this doesn't suggest the need for a new analytical paradigm But they sometimes seem to be claiming that aggregate supply and demand will always be in non-inflationary sync, even if the government's statistics do not always show it Monetary policy seemingly is irrelevant in this self-regulating state of perfection You can dump the staff and take an indefinite vacation [Laughter]  If I were not well shy of retirement eligibility, I might be more receptive to this view But, I suspect that most of you share at least some of our skepticism Under the circumstances, we feel much more comfortable taking the most relevant and persuasive aspects of the new era view and incorporating them in our model--one in which supply-demand imbalances can occur and give rise to inflationary pressures that can be modulated by monetary policy This is, in effect, what we have been doing all along    9/30/97  So, with that prologue, what tendencies do we think are facing you in the economy today? As you know, we believe the economy is still running pretty hot Exports have been zipping along with remarkable strength And, though last Thursday's report on capital goods orders was a bit weaker than we anticipated, it didn't undermine our assessment that this sector of the economy is still on a steep uptrend, paced by demand for computers and communications equipment but with fairly substantial demand elsewhere, too The growth of these sectors and the massive gains in stock market wealth are providing consumers with the wherewithal to spend, and they are doing so Indeed, judging by yesterday's monthly PCE release, they are doing so to an even greater degree than we thought In light of those figures and the other late-arriving data, we would now place likely third-quarter GDP growth in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range  We continue to think that the levels of some types of household and business investment expenditures are high enough that stocks might soon begin to get out of kilter with income and output trends if there is not some deceleration in inventory accumulation And we believe the rise of the dollar has been large enough to damp export growth and raise import penetration further in the period ahead But, these are far from a sure thing--certainly in terms of timing and dimension  Booms generate a momentum of their own, and like others, this one is being supported by a degree of financial exuberance In fact, it is our assessment that, more likely than not, financial restraint sufficient to rein in the excess demand we see will be achieved only with a decisive enough monetary policy jolt to shake the market's current euphoria Whether the percentage point hike in the funds rate in the forecast is the right dose, we obviously do not know for sure, but if our analysis is correct, something noticeable probably will be required  The other part of the analysis is, of course, our judgment that we can't depend on productivity increases large enough to sustain such rapid growth of output and that the Phillips curve is not dead It is somewhat disfigured, perhaps, but not dead On the productivity front, as we suggested in the Greenbook, there may well be room for optimism regarding the outlook for growth in output per hour Among other things, despite all the complaints about the quality of available workers, measured productivity performance has improved of late We are skeptical of the new era view that firms always have another productivity trick up their sleeves to offset any cost increase-- but it could be that the high-tech investments are now having a more significant payoff, and we have taken a somewhat more optimistic view of productivity prospects  As for the Phillips curve, we believe that compensation practices probably have changed in ways that may temper the short-run response of    9/30/97  overall pay structures to tight labor markets On top of that consideration, we also have the apparent divergence of the degrees of labor and factory utilization This might be viewed as part of the new era--the perfectly elastic and immediate supply of plant and equipment as needed to meet demand Our projection of moderate capacity utilization argues, we think, for some restraint on inflation relative to what might be implied by labor market conditions Similarly, in the near term, the legacy of recent low inflation and a seeming convergence of expectations on continued low inflation bodes well for the sustained moderation of compensation increases  How far to carry these arguments in recalibrating one's model of the inflation process is a difficult judgment call We do not think they eliminate entirely the risk of an upturn of inflation if labor markets remain as taut as they are now, let alone get tighter, as we are projecting Moreover, there are a couple of other special factors that reinforce the likelihood of a steeper rise in prices going forward  One of them is the possibility that employers will face significant increases in premiums for health insurance In this regard, I might note that, at the end of last week, it was announced that the premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefit program will be rising an average of 8-1/2 percent next year We have not had the opportunity to research this development adequately, so I am not sure that this is a clear sign that the pressures in this sphere will be greater than we anticipated in our forecast It is a worry, however  Finally, in looking at the inflation outlook, we think it is important to consider the prospects for the dollar Estimates of the effects of the dollar appreciation and the associated decline in import prices vary considerably, but they certainly have been a significant factor tending to trim domestic inflation in the past year or two An advocate of the new era might say that a strong dollar is just a natural and lasting result of the reaccommodation of the United States in the world economy, but with the probability of a growing external deficit, we find it hard to swallow the concept that we should be anticipating another 20 percent rise in the dollar over the next two years It could happen, but we are betting against it Without that influence --indeed, with the possibility of some reversal of the dollar--containing inflation is going to be more difficult  Toting up all these considerations, we have core inflation accelerating only a couple of tenths per year through 1999 despite continuous sub-five- percent unemployment That rate is, to be sure, damped a couple of tenths by technical changes to the CPI But, especially given the expected abatement of favorable exchange rate effects, the forecast does fall somewhat short of what might normally have been anticipated simply on the basis of the excess demand for labor--say, if one simply applied a    9/30/97  conventional "sacrifice ratio" to the unemployment gap relative to a 5-1/2 percent NAIRU  We think that we have been judicious in adapting to the incoming evidence and in taking account of alternative explanations for the surprises we have experienced In the end, despite our flirtation with the new era view, our forecast conveys a rather clear message that the risks are tilted toward higher inflation in the absence of some restrictive policy action But, I would have to say that this is truly a period in which the outlook is characterized by the proverbial "unusual degree" of uncertainty   Those are very interesting questions Perhaps the relatively high real rate  of interest in recent years, particularly if it is measured in terms of the prices of goods, say the PPI,  may have something to do with why we see a downtrend in inventory-sales ratios Another factor,  of course, is the better information systems that firms have to work with Going forward, we do  project a substantial deceleration of inventory investment from what we have been seeing recently  The level of the inventory-sales ratio remains historically low in our forecast I think firms will still  find that markets are not so loose, even given our capacity utilization numbers, that they feel they  can avoid the need to have some precautionary stocks on hand But, yes, there is always the  potential, especially when we are anticipating that final demand will be decelerating and perhaps  surprisingly so over the coming year, that inventories will get out of line at least temporarily That  would lead initially to a period of somewhat greater inventory accumulation than we have in the  forecast but that would be followed by a swing down toward a much lower rate of accumulation,  and it would introduce a bit of a cycle into the outlook Whether inventories in our forecast are too  high on an average basis given these real interest rates is an interesting question I don't think I  have much more that I can add on this question It is certainly something that we are aware of  On the stock market correction question, there is something of a chicken and egg  problem The same sort of thought has occurred to me; we may have some shifting of the risk  premia in the market But there is a consistency in the forecast, at least in the sense that one reason  why we anticipate the stock market decline is the rise in interest rates That rise will require a  higher discount rate in the stock market valuation formula If we did not get that interest rate  adjustment at least initially, we wonder whether the negative earning surprises would be enough to  create this kind of decline in stock prices So, it may be a timing issue; we may see some swings  involving a flight to security and to fixed-income instruments It is not inconceivable that the    9/30/97  enthusiasm about prospective stock market returns has been a factor that in essence has raised  yields across the board on various types of financial instruments Why would I invest in a bond  that yielded only 4 percent when I think I can get a much higher return in the stock market? If the  expected returns in the stock market go down, perhaps we will also have some effect on the bond  market But I think we would see this in significant measure as a change in the equity premium in  the stock market so that people will require a higher expected return relative to those on bonds   The "no change" scenario that we have included in that model simulation  clearly would imply a higher level of stock prices than in our baseline forecast That better stock  market performance results from the strength of the economy that helps to sustain profits, and it  works through the discount factor in stock price valuations So, the wealth effects are more  favorable to consumer demand in the alternative stable interest rate scenario Our feeling is that  there is certainly the potential, simply on the basis of disappointment in earnings growth, for stock  prices to fall off some We see the tightening of policy, and the shift in expectations that that  causes--and the related tendency for bond yields to back up--as an important factor in explaining  the timing and dimension of the stock market decline we have in the forecast   Let me mention a couple of things One, we did build in only mild  accelerations in wages and salaries and in total benefits, and we incorporated a rather modest  upturn in the cost of medical benefits relative to some of the stories we have heard To some  extent, we have to consider whether we are looking at the gross increase in the cost of the medical  benefits or whether they are the net cost the employer is going to incur Certainly, many larger  companies in the last year or two have been talking about how their philosophy has shifted to  viewing the health insurance benefit as a defined contribution arrangement rather than as a defined  benefit So, they are looking for ways to pass along the rising cost to the employees by restricting  benefits or increasing the out-of-pocket expenses that the employees will experience In light of the  seeming confirmation of some of the scarier stories and the recent federal employee health benefits  announcement, our faith is a little shaken that we have allowed for enough of an increase I would  say that we do not see compelling evidence that one should write the step-up off as something that  will be offset through lower wage increases The evidence that that will be the pattern in the short    9/30/97  run is rather shaky In this tight labor market, I think there is a clear risk of more overall  compensation inflation than we are projecting  The final point I would make is that, in this forecast, as measured in product prices--and  we think this highly relevant--the increases in compensation are sizable in real terms and they are  growing faster than trend productivity So, in this model, workers are doing reasonably well  because of the benefits of low price inflation Now, whether this is the dynamic that will prevail in  this kind of environment is a matter of conjecture We have been struck to date by how, in the face  of lots of stories about tight labor markets and employers undertaking to pay particular workers  more in one way or another, we really have not seen an acceleration in labor costs It may be just  around the corner, and we may have to reverse course in the sequence of revisions we have been  making in the forecast   I might just remark that since this is the first time we have formally done a  forecast for 1999, it probably is a little shakier than it might otherwise be   I do not have a model simulation in my pocket to give you a quantitative  answer to that I think that a series of policy moves that raised the federal funds rate 100 basis  points by next March instead of one that only started to raise the funds rate next March would  probably lead to circumstances that would encourage the Committee to think about reversing  course by 1999 The reason would be to make sure that, as we moved out of 1999 and into 2000,  monetary policy was not holding down the level of output so much that more slack ultimately  would be created than was needed to achieve a gradual moderation in the expansion and a return to  a flat-to-descending inflation path Another way of approaching this policy adjustment would be to  start the process earlier and move more gradually to get to the same point You basically are  talking about shifting the process forward with about as sharp a total increase in the funds rate, and  I think that approach would create a greater likelihood that you would have the opportunity to  reverse course, say, in 1999   As a first approximation, I would conceive of that as a more likely  alternative in terms of nipping in the bud what we think is an incipient pickup in inflation But we  recognize, harking back to President McDonough's remark, that the implied real interest rate at the  short end would be fairly high with a nominal federal funds rate of 6-1/2 percent At that level,  some easing in policy might be warranted if and as the inflation rate was checked and the  perception was that the rate of inflation was clearly headed back down into the sub-3-percent  inflation zone   I'm not sure I understand that thought   I'm not sure I conceive of it as exogenous In a sense we are letting  bygones be bygones and not anticipating that the favorable inflation surprises have created some  pent-up inflationary pressure that is going to burst forth in the future I am impressed by recent    9/30/97  commodity market developments I looked at the charts the other day I did see some indications  in copper markets of changing expectations that appeared to be associated with the problems in  Southeast Asia, and there may be some special stories elsewhere However, when we look across  the breadth of the commodity markets, there really is no sign of general pressure in those markets  If we look at these markets narrowly in terms of the domestic industrial picture, capacity utilization  rates are not extraordinarily high in most sectors And where utilization is fairly high, as it is for  example in the steel industry, the businesses in question are drawing in a large volume of imports  and they have capacity coming on stream prospectively in such a way that there really does not  seem to be much pricing leverage So, in the last few months we increasingly have given weight to  the sense that there really is not much pressure in the goods sector and that there is a lot of capacity  coming on line in the United States and in many instances abroad In our view, worldwide  economic activity is not going to be so robust relative to capacity that we are going to have a lot of  pressures in the commodity markets I do not see those markets as the source of more inflation  independently of what is going on more broadly   We are in a sense modifying some of the conditions in that model When  we look at cycles historically, we see that capacity utilization has tended to move up as  unemployment has moved down It is very hard to discern econometrically a separate role for  industrial capacity utilization as a measure of the underlying inflationary pressure In the current  circumstance, the deviation of the capacity utilization rate from what we would predict given the  unemployment rate is becoming substantial    9/30/97   Probably Those industry unemployment rates are a shaky proposition I  must say I have not really looked at that   Since manufacturers cannot produce without workers, the labor market is  still relevant here We do hear, and there were some Beigebook comments, that at least in some  instances manufacturers were finding that they had to raise their wages in order to attract and retain  the workers they needed But the system seems to be working in such a way that we think it  behooves us to give some weight to our expectation that capacity utilization is going to remain  relatively moderate We think this will put some damper on what the pickup in inflation otherwise  would be going forward   One of the risks we repeatedly have pointed to and then last time said it  might not be such an asymmetric risk was the role of the stock market and the implications for  consumption As you may recall, the revised national income accounts that we received after the    9/30/97  August meeting showed that the saving rate had fallen so that the wealth effect seemingly was  working the way one would have expected We thought that somehow the world now was right  and that we had a grasp of its functioning We were not quite so concerned as we had been about  the risk that we would suddenly find consumption surging in a belated response to the  accumulation of wealth In the interim, the stock market has once again risen more than we  expected The difference is not big, but it is there, and consumption expenditures are surpassing  even our expectation of a robust upturn in the third quarter Going forward, I do not have the sense  that our forecast implies an asymmetry of risks in terms of aggregate demand being stronger or  weaker But it makes me nervous that we keep making revisions in the same direction, and my  sense is that there really is a boom mentality at work in the economy today The financial markets  are supplying ample credit to borrowers, and the ongoing appreciation of share prices, now more  concentrated in the smaller cap issues, is providing cheap equity capital for many companies I  worry that these booming conditions may be even more strongly maintained than we have forecast  But in terms of the nuts and bolts of putting this forecast together and the assumptions we have  made for deviations from what we think of as normal behavior over time, I don't think we have an  obvious tilt in the risks  Let me add something that Don Kohn just whispered in my ear We have helped, I think,  to balance these risks in a sense by changing the policy assumptions As we talk about the changes  in the forecast, you should not overlook that we have incorporated in it a more stringent set of  policy actions   I have heard that joke specifically pertaining to chip plants, an industry  joke   Mr Chairman, may I interrupt for a moment? I would like to remind the  members that in this discussion of what happens if the Committee tightens sooner than is assumed  in the Greenbook forecast, the tighter alternative in the Greenbook is a first approximation It is the  sort of scenario where the Committee starts the tightening process immediately, and by the middle  of next year the funds rate is at 7 percent instead of 6-1/2 percent But as you can see if you look at  the numbers for 1999, we have slow growth in economic activity and the unemployment rate is  moving up very rapidly So, this goes to the remark that I made earlier If you looked out to 2000,  you would probably be thinking about moderating the amount of restraint that was being imposed  so that you did not needlessly overshoot the sustainable unemployment levels I think you can get  some sense from the Greenbook as to what the difference might be   I don't question that I just felt that I probably overlooked a piece of  information that might have been a more direct answer to your question   I should say that the word I used to describe the Greenbook forecast was  "tortuous" [Laughter] I hope we did not torture the readers   Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to offer just a few comments before yielding to Ted for his remarks on the recent turbulence in the international economy and its implications for the US outlook  I think it's pretty obvious that we don't share the view that the United States is going to be sucked into a deflationary whirlpool by the difficulties encountered abroad Time will tell just how big the contractionary shock will be, but it would have to be a large one to override the momentum of domestic demand in the near term  All major segments of private spending look strong right now Consumers as a group are rich and happy, and it seems likely they will continue to buy with abandon Manufacturers of capital goods report heavy inflows of orders--not just for computers and communications equipment, but for a wide range of other machinery as well Commercial property    11/12/97  prices are rising and should buttress nonresidential building activity Meanwhile, all indicators of housing demand are giving off positive signals As for financing, although the recent upheavals have produced some widening of risk premia in the securities markets, conditions are still such that most projects can get funding on what evidently are regarded as attractive terms  Absent a sizable shock, then, the economy probably will continue to power ahead--perhaps not indefinitely, but for long enough to exacerbate inflationary pressures significantly In our forecast, the recent developments abroad are a drag on aggregate demand, but not enough alone to bring a halt soon to the above-trend growth we have been experiencing One possible source of restraint on demand would be a steep decline in the stock market It's quite possible that the large equity premiums of the past will not be restored; however, we do believe that the current price-earnings multiples incorporate unrealistic expectations about future profits If we are correct, the market surely will reflect it at some point, but that might not be soon and the adjustment might start from still higher levels  In our forecast, therefore, we have assumed that you will put a damper on the economic boom by raising the funds rate three-quarters of a point by the middle of next year That isn't a lot, but we expect that the effects will be magnified by some deflation of the stock market bubble As you know, we are predicting a drop next year that would take share prices down about 20 percent from Monday's closing level We make no claim of precision in that forecast--we are dealing not simply with math but also with mind reading In any event, we expect that once people are shaken out of their complacency about the economic risks, the bond and loan markets will also be affected--with a further widening of yield spreads and some firming of loan standards  With the resultant financial restraint, demand growth weakens and growth of output falls below potential in our forecast But this doesn't occur before the labor market has tightened further In that regard, a few words about Friday's labor market data might be in order According to that report, the unemployment rate has already traversed some of the distance to our predicted cyclical low of 46 percent The report also showed the labor force participation rate slipping further This suggests that we might, despite the trimming in our latest forecast, still be on the high side for labor force growth This could spell more labor scarcity and greater wage pressure We would recommend waiting for another reading or two before reaching that conclusion, but the data do sound a cautionary note    11/12/97  The sharp increase in average hourly earnings in October was anticipated in our forecast Although the recent surge in wages is attributable in part to the effects of the hike in the federal minimum, we do believe that there is an underlying tendency toward acceleration associated with the efforts of businesses to attract and retain workers in a very tight labor market Real wage gains have turned up noticeably over the past couple of years, and the pressure will remain in that direction We think, however, that the decline in price inflation and inflation expectations this year has created a circumstance in which nominal wage increases will be damped in the short run--enough to offset a pickup in medical insurance costs that seems to be in the offing  Our projection shows prices accelerating over the next two years However, the pickup is even more gradual than in previous forecasts The recent developments in the external sector suggest that the swing from declining to rising import prices will be of still smaller magnitude than we anticipated earlier In addition, our reassessment of the trend in labor productivity leads us to think that price inflation will rise more slowly Our projection of actual productivity growth has not changed much; however, price setting seems to be influenced more by the trends of productivity and unit labor costs than by the short-run variations, and so the change in our trend assumption tends to damp our inflation projection The end result is a prediction that the rate of price increase will rise only a little over the next two years--especially in the published figures, which will be held down by technical changes to official indexes But, I would conclude my remarks with the reminder that we believe this rather benign outcome is probably contingent on something happening to create a less accommodative financial environment  Ted will now say a few words about how we see the external environment   We have looked at the movements in the labor force in some detail  Basically, in this latest forecast we backed off from our previous expectation of a significant rise  partly because the incoming data were not moving that way What we have seen since the spike  in March is a rather broad-based decline involving adult males, adult females, and teenagers  Certainly, a possible factor affecting school enrollments is the wealth or income effect that you  have noted One area where we have seen recent increases in participation is among women who  are head of a household, and I think that is consistent with some impact from welfare reform  Basically, all of the rise in labor force participation in our forecast is related to the anticipated  effects of welfare reform The latest data put the participation rate at a lower level than we had  anticipated, but there is enough noise in these numbers that we are hesitant to leap to further  conclusions Even so, the data do tend to underscore the risks to the participation outlook in that  direction   All other things equal, it will tend to lower productivity growth over the  period in which they wedge in this increase We are talking about a 01 or 02 reduction   I think it was 475,000 If we assess the effect on productivity growth in  terms of gauging the trend over a period of time, it would not be quite so large   They will carry something through as well, but there is also the  possibility that by the time we get to the middle of next year other data will have changed too,  perhaps on the output side   That is a very interesting question for which I do not have an answer It  is something that we ought to look into   As I understand it, the only data we are really dealing with are the  revised employment numbers They will feed that through in estimating total hours, but one  does need to look at the income data themselves   That is a part of the story We view resource pressures at this point,  particularly in the labor market, as being strong enough to produce some ongoing acceleration in  prices The fact that productivity growth in the industrial sector is as rapid as it is suggests to us  that, going forward, we are going to have a reasonably comfortable picture in that sector, but  more generally we see ongoing pressures in the labor market We have the difficult question of  judging what the relative influences are of trend productivity and actual productivity growth It  is probable that reality lies in some combination of those two elements Therefore, as we go  forward and the upcreep in compensation is augmented by a decline in productivity growth, we  expect to get a noticeable acceleration in unit labor costs that will put some pressure on profit  margins In that case, firms may, in what will still be a reasonably tight market overall, try to  extract some price increases along the way   One might think that there will be something of a so-called speed effect  as we move into 1999 The other element, though it is a small and uncertain factor, does work in  the direction of tending to raise inflation It has to do with the fact that we have been benefiting  significantly over the past couple of years from a decline in import prices Going forward, we do  not anticipate that to continue, so that adds to the acceleration of prices in our forecast   The numbers do conform arithmetically with the behavior of  compensation and unit labor costs, but there are other factors that play a role such as movements  in interest costs, foreign earnings, and so on In the short run, we probably will have our greatest  hit to foreign earnings from the problems in Asia in particular So, there are a number of  elements that tend to put a damper on profit growth in the near term The profit share begins to  turn down, but the greater damage really occurs as we run through the forecast period The year  1999 is where we see profits really declining Indeed, that is one of the reasons we have only the  mildest of declines in the stock market through the first part of next year Year-on-year  comparisons of earnings in our forecast will still look quite good Certainly if there is any  continuing inclination for investors to be optimistic, as they clearly have been in recent years, I  do not think reduced earnings will be such a rude shock to the markets that they would have    11/12/97 31  devastating effects on share prices in the early part of our forecast period Cash flow in the  nonfinancial corporate sector is not growing as fast as capital expenditure, and we are seeing a  widening of the financing gap As we go out through the forecast period, the financing gap gets  to be sizable enough that at least we would not think that firms will be spending simply because  money is coming into their coffers and they have to do something with it It begins to be a less  favorable factor as we move out through 1998 and certainly into 1999   I will call on Ted to comment regarding how he thinks other markets  will respond This is a question that President Jordan asked at the last meeting, and in retrospect  I thought my answer may not have hit on one point that logically would be potentially significant  in our thinking about the forecast That point is that to the extent that you surprised the market  early on before you saw any evidence of building price inflation, your credibility would be  enhanced You would not appear to be playing catch-up, and the solidification of low inflation  expectations would be greater Now, in fact, with the kind of acceleration in prices we    11/12/97 32  anticipate, it might be very hard to explain price developments from month to month So, I do  not want to draw this distinction too sharply Certainly, one of the reasons we have share prices  declining is that the markets do not seem to have built in any anticipation of tightening, and an  earlier move, as the Bluebook points out, could have fairly sharp effects on domestic financial  markets   The basic thesis here is that we have had a spurt We think the  improvement in trend is an element in that, but we also think that, in part, the acceleration of  output has lifted the growth in productivity to substantially above the trend line that we would  draw As the economy decelerates, we would anticipate a movement back toward the trend line  That is the pattern that we have here   No Think of the productivity trend as a line that is rising and current  productivity as moving above the line The two lines then tend to converge, with actual  productivity converging to trend from above Now, during past business cycles, this has  occurred irregularly Certainly, it has occurred at the end of cyclical expansions To some  extent, that may have reflected a deterioration at the margin in labor quality as new workers were  added to the labor force In some cases, it may have reflected the need to use less efficient    11/12/97 34  equipment, which does not look to be a very significant problem in this instance It could be  simply the deceleration in demand and the cutback in output, which is not followed immediately  by a proportionate reduction in hours of labor It is quite conceivable that not only are we  wrong on the trend, we could be wrong on the shorter-run dynamics too, and we could have a  more sustained growth of productivity But we think this is a sensible pattern, one that conforms  to experience as we have it embodied in models of productivity behavior   Perhaps because we did not include verbiage in that part of the  Greenbook about a lot of other developments, it may have seemed that there was more focus on  the wealth effect Since the midyear revisions to the national income accounts that showed a  decline in the saving rate, I think we have used essentially the same logic in terms of assuming  that a good bit of the strength in consumption and decline in the saving rate over the past year is  attributable to the increase in stock market wealth We also anticipate that, as the market turns  down in our forecast, we are going to see the wealth effect eroding gradually "Gradual" is the    11/12/97 35  point that we have tried to stress Some have suggested that the response is almost  instantaneous, but as best we can gauge that response, looking at a variety of econometric  models, it takes a significant span of time for the wealth effect to play out So, in 1998 we would  still see for most of the year some impetus on balance to consumer spending relative to income  coming from the rise that already has occurred in the stock market But, by 1999 we have it  turning the other way  I guess one could say that, anecdotally, we hear increasing reports of people feeling  rather wealthy and deciding that they are not going to leave all of their gains to their kids or the  IRS They are going to spend some of those gains Certainly, people in the auto industry believe  that one of the reasons the demand for sports utility vehicles, especially the high-end models, has  been so strong is that people are spending some of this wealth I think there is some evidence in  the housing market that demand for second homes has firmed in the past year, and people in that  industry seem to feel that the improvement could be a reflection of the stock market So, this  factor could be having fairly broad and significant effects, which is the reason we feature it so  much in explaining the deceleration in 1998 and 1999   There is a simple rule of thumb One has to have a full-fledged  scenario that indicates the circumstances in which, for example, this extra couple of tenths of  GDP restraint might be occurring If we just had a quarter percentage point more deceleration in  GDP growth for two years, we would end up by Okun's Law with about a quarter percentage  point higher unemployment rate by the end of the second year The difference in inflation  outcomes would be very small But if we blend in stories about exchange rate and import price    11/12/97 39  effects and their financial dynamics and so on, one has to step back and think very carefully  about what the outcome might be Just taking that little bit of arithmetic that Ted was  mentioning, we need to go to a drastically "worse" case scenario to totally change the outcome   As I noted briefly, the average hourly earnings report for October did  not upset us We anticipated another large number, and it was in line with our expectations The  forecast of a stable ECI increase in 1998 reflects the expectation that wages will be favorably  affected by the very low rates of consumer and overall price inflation that we've seen in the past  year and the apparent effect of that price behavior on inflation expectations That effect has been    11/12/97 40  small on the median of such expectations, for example, in the Michigan Survey, but very striking  on the mean Seemingly, there has been a convergence of expectations to the lower level We  would anticipate this to have a damping effect on wage increases, and in a sense we are not  looking for the ongoing effect of the minimum wage hikes that have raised the rate of wage  increases in the past year When we did simulations about a year and a half ago, the simulation  of a minimum wage increase involved some follow-through as higher wages raised prices and  price expectations But in fact consumer prices have decelerated, so we see that as a favorable  element in the near term  We have built a significant acceleration of health insurance costs into the ECI forecast  We have reports of increases in insurance premiums beyond those of CALPERS and the federal  employee health programs We are fairly well convinced that those increases will happen this  time They did not happen this year despite some earlier reports, but we feel the evidence is now  tangible enough for us to want to build that into our forecast at least in a moderate way  I guess my final comment would be that there seems to have been some increase  recently in the anecdotal reports of step-ups in wage increases It is very hard to read this  information, but I would say that there's a basis for some concern that the increases may be  larger than those we have built into the forecast I have not seen the actual numbers, but just to  cite something that I have heard, the survey of smaller businesses by the National Federation of  Independent Businesses has evidently shown a noticeable increase in the last few months in the  number of firms reporting that they actually have raised wages and a noticeable increase in the  number of firms saying they plan to raise wages    11/12/97  In sum, there clearly are risks I think we followed the logic of the basic model of  how wages are determined, and it just may be that we are going to get increases in this period  that turn out to be greater than we forecast   Before the drop, the market had moved up further So, as of Monday, I  think the average for the quarter was actually higher than we had predicted in the last  Greenbook Now, if the market stays at these lower levels, we will come out pretty much in line    11/12/97 42  The decline from the very peak of the market to the low that we forecast, going by the Wilshire  5000, is about 25 percent We have about 5 percent under our belts   It could be We have been wrong previously! We certainly have found  it more difficult in the past couple of years to track from our output forecast to profits, because  the statistical discrepancy has moved substantially Perhaps that could happen going forward In  our forecast, we do not have that continuing movement in income relative to expenditures that  we have experienced over the past year or so   Thank you Anticipating that, as last month, the focus of your interest this morning is on the international side, I will try again to be    12/16/97  brief I thought, however, that I would offer a few remarks on some of the tougher calls we had to make on the domestic side of our forecast--namely those relating to the outlook for wages, the stock market, and capital spending  Before that, however, just a few words on this morning's statistics The CPI--total and core--increased just 01 percent in November The twelve-month changes were 18 percent for the total CPI and 22 percent for the core--the total a tenth below our Q4/Q4 forecast and the core right on it  Housing starts rose slightly further last month We had expected a dropback Most of the upside surprise was in the lower value multifamily segment, which held at a high level For what it's worth, I am told that this may be the result of a new seasonal pattern related to efforts to qualify for tax breaks on low-income housing projects We'll have to look into that further Single-family starts were up a little, but permits were down, so this more important segment looks broadly in line with our prediction of flatness  Now back to my main theme, some of the tougher issues in the projection The first I noted was the outlook for wages As you know, we have forecast that wages and total compensation will decelerate slightly in the next year, in the face of continued low unemployment We certainly are not arguing that the labor market is not tight We have heard the anecdotes and read the surveys, as you have, and we are persuaded that finding and retaining qualified workers is a major problem for employers While many firms continue to report that they will do just about anything they can to avoid raising their wage bills--including even forgoing expansion opportunities--wage increases have been creeping up for a while now  My gut tells me that the pressure is building in this labor market pot to where the lid could blow off But, for better or worse, our forecast has not been shaped by this visceral sensation In particular, we have given major weight to the observations that wages are rather inertial and that they can be significantly affected by perceived trends in prices And, at this point, workers and employers are looking at very low inflation over the past year, and they should be seeing more of the same for a while longer, given conditions in goods markets The net result in our forecast is still a hefty further rise in real wages and a marked increase in the labor share of the income pie--but not an upward wage-price spiral  Another tough call relates to the stock market outlook As you know, in light of our reassessment of the prospects for inflation, we have eliminated our prior assumption of an increase in the federal funds rate We    12/16/97  had viewed that tightening as an important trigger for a marked downturn in the market in the first half of next year The question before us, then, was whether disappointing corporate earnings alone could be expected to produce a significant correction before long Our answer was yes, but that the decline will likely be more gradual and smaller overall--about 15 percent from yesterday's close by early 1999 Question marks remain, however  To date, individual companies or industries have been punished for bad earnings announcements, but this seemingly has occasioned merely a rotation to other sectors by determined equity investors So, could the market shrug off the negative news we are forecasting? Perhaps, at least for a while Certainly, on our numbers, aggregate year-on-year profit comparisons will not begin to look really poor until next summer or fall  That said, though, I think there is the distinct possibility that, once the deterioration of profits comes clearly into view, the market could develop even more downward momentum than we have anticipated I would note that we are currently projecting a low for the Wilshire 5000 in 1999 that would only take it back to where it was this spring and leave price-earnings multiples at historically high levels A combination of revised earnings expectations and any further increase in the equity premium from what probably has occurred recently would point to a much more sizable decline, unless interest rates were to fall appreciably at the same time  Finally, a few thoughts on the outlook for business investment This is a sizable sector and one that has provided a lot of propulsion for the expansion to date We have forecast a significant deceleration in capital spending, and while this gets a little circular, it fits well with our predictions of rising equity capital costs and decelerating output However, most of the indications at this point are that investment plans are very strong going into 1998 For example, the semi-annual survey of the National Association of Purchasing Managers indicated that manufacturers are expecting to increase their capital expenditures next year by 15 percent--an even greater increment than they reported for this year The NFIB's November survey of small firms also showed extremely upbeat investment plans  These surveys underscore the risk that investment will, yet again, prove stronger than we have gauged But, there is some reason to doubt their predictive power in the present case For one thing, even if the surveys are merely a few weeks old, they may still be providing pretty stale readings Just looking at how our own changing perception of the international outlook has altered our GDP projection over the past few weeks, it seems reasonable to think that businesses are also reassessing their plans and that many of them will be trimming their investment budgets If we are wrong,    12/16/97  that does raise the question of whether this capital spending boom won't come to a more jarring end sometime down the road, with firms finding themselves with excess capacity and experiencing a deeper hit to profits  So, to sum up, we think we have provided a realistic baseline forecast, but there is still plenty to puzzle over--and perhaps to worry about from a policy standpoint On that comforting note, let me now turn the floor over to Ted, who has been doing a lot of worrying lately   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think it would be appropriate for me to begin this morning by acknowledging that, yes, you did tell us so last month You said that our GDP forecast for this year probably was too low, and now we have raised it appreciably Moreover, a little reading between the lines of the Greenbook would indicate that, even with the revisions we have made, we are somewhat more concerned about the possible upside risks to our forecasts for demand and inflation than about the downside risks  With that as preamble, let me engage in a little mind-reading and attempt to anticipate a few of the questions you might have about our revised forecast  First, isn't the upward-revised GDP growth rate of 31 percent that we're showing for the first quarter still rather skimpy, especially in light of the strength of the labor market indicators?  That's certainly a reasonable question Judging by the growth of employment and hours through February and the continuing low level of jobless claims, the increase in labor input almost surely was well above the average of recent quarters Moreover, the data on consumption, housing, and equipment purchases point to a large gain in private domestic final sales However, it is also true that the January figures for net exports and inventory investment were much weaker than their respective fourth-quarter averages Even when we plug in what seem like ample numbers for these two variables in February and March, we still end up with a drop-off in GDP growth  But, you might ask, doesn't that just imply an implausible drop in labor productivity? Yes, it does imply a drop, but obviously not one we find implausible Output per hour has risen considerably in the past two years relative to the underlying trend embedded in our projection--the kind of pickup that one might expect to accompany an acceleration of production If we have it right, a movement back toward the trend line was to be expected over time--and, given the erratic character of the series, a substantial drop in some quarter would be far from shocking That said, in    3/31/98  the present case, we also would not be stunned if the spending data coming in over the next few weeks were to point to a larger gain in Q1 GDP  Well, you are thinking, the first quarter is history, anyway; so the real question is what makes us think that the still greater moderation of GDP growth that we long have been forecasting is here at last? Isn't domestic demand proving to be strong enough to override any damping effect that might be coming from the external sector?  It certainly is conceivable to me that what we are going through now will turn out to be the obverse of the 1987-88 experience In that case, a strong upswing in net exports helped to keep the economic expansion on track in the face of the stock market decline This time around, a booming stock market might offset the effects of a slump in net exports  However, a few considerations lead us to conclude that this scenario is not the most likely I will leave it for Larry to discuss the incoming evidence on the trade front Suffice it to say at this point that the recent news has not undermined our notion that there is--and will be for a while--an appreciable drag on activity coming from the external sector It is not just an Asia story; it is also the lagged effects of a sizable cumulative appreciation of the dollar over the past few years  But, that said, could we be seriously underestimating the ongoing thrust of domestic demand? As we look at it sector by sector, we do not think we have stinted on expenditures Among other things, demand has been boosted recently by the decline in longer-term interest rates over the past year, and we do not foresee that interest rate trend being extended in any meaningful way As many have commented, this has in part been the dividend of the Asian crisis for the US economy To be sure, the predicted softening in economic indicators could revitalize hopes of Fed easing But, unless the bond market bulls are able to push yields materially below the recent range, this should not provide a great amount of additional stimulus  Where we might be especially vulnerable, though, is with respect to the stock market At this point, it appears that the market has entered a phase in which the gravitational pull of valuation may no longer be operating The PE ratio for the S&P 500 recently reached 27, based on trailing 12-month earnings, even as companies were issuing warnings and analysts were lowering their 1998 profit forecasts In the prevailing psychological environment, with people increasingly convinced that the market will inevitably yield returns vastly greater than those available today on liquid fixed-income instruments, the market can keep going appreciably higher on its own momentum--at least until there is an event jarring enough to cause people to reassess their general view of the world    3/31/98  For now, the market is an integral part of a perpetual motion machine that keeps the economy powering ahead We have seen this before, recently in Asia, and while I do not want to overstate that comparison, the issues about bubbles that the Chairman raised in his famous "irrational exuberance" speech do seem increasingly relevant We pointed out once again in the Greenbook the difference it might make to the outlook if the market were merely to rise moderately from here--rather than falling somewhat, as we have predicted If the market were instead to keep zooming upward at 20 or 30 percent per year, then the consequences for aggregate demand and thus for inflationary pressures could be quite striking  This brings me to a final question There seems to have been some increase in concern about inflation risks of late, with commentators noting such things as the continued tightness of the labor markets, the recent upturn in oil prices, or the heating up of real estate markets Is there something going on here beyond what we have captured in the Greenbook? Perhaps, but we think that the upward revision we have made to our inflation forecast leaves the risks reasonably balanced--assuming that the predicted output and unemployment path is about right  As we noted in the Greenbook, increases in average hourly earnings --the only broad statistic yet available for this year--have not been getting discernibly larger or smaller of late However, the anecdotal reports seem to be indicating with increasing frequency an acceleration of compensation rates and an increase in recruiting and training costs The picture is still uneven, with many firms saying they are holding the line on pay and others that they are tightly targeting increases to those workers in key positions or with "hot" skills And, where pay is raised, it often is through flexible forms of compensation that can be trimmed more easily when business slackens--a feature that we think may be significant in determining the momentum of wage inflation going forward In the end, we bowed only slightly to the anecdotal news and raised our compensation forecast just a touch more than we would have on the basis of the lower unemployment rates in this projection  At this point, we are sticking with the notion that the decline in inflation and inflation expectations over the past year will exert a significant damping influence on nominal wage increases Thus far in 1998, the trend in overall CPI inflation has remained very favorable, owing to the sharp decline in oil prices Moreover, even with the recent firming in oil prices, the outlook for this sector through 1999 now looks more favorable than it did in late January, and we have lowered our forecast for retail energy prices  On the other hand, though it may be splitting hairs to say that the core CPI has increased more rapidly on average in the past couple of months,    3/31/98  there certainly has not been any further downside surprise there The deflationary impact of the Asian crisis appears to be no greater than we anticipated, and with a slightly lower dollar exchange rate path this time, the projected decline in non-oil import prices outside the semiconductor and computer sector is a little shallower Overall, our interpretation of the incoming price news--coupled with the more inflationary labor market conditions in this projection--has been mirrored in the quarter-point elevation of our core CPI forecast  In concluding, I might remind you that we have not built into the baseline projection any allowance for the big hike in cigarette prices that looms as a distinct possibility The legislative proposals keep changing, as they did just yesterday, and the only thing that seems certain right now is that there are lots of people willing to provide the manufacturers with an excuse to raise their prices sharply It is easy to come up with numbers that would add several tenths to the CPI inflation rate at some point This would present the Committee with a challenge it has not faced in some time--that is, deciding whether to accommodate an adverse, rather than a favorable, supply shock  Larry will now comment on factors bearing on the external outlook   I think we need to consider what the source of that difference might be  before we would characterize that as fiscal drag We have not gotten totally inside their brains to  be able to say exactly why their numbers differ from ours, but it appears that one element in the  picture is, in effect, New York's expectation of much larger revenues from capital gains We  normally would not think of that as a particularly restrictive fiscal element People get wealthier;  they presumably anticipate that they will be paying more taxes; and they are not bound by any  liquidity constraint, given their wealth So, if that is the source of the difference, we would not  regard that as implying much additional fiscal restraint Also, I wouldn't say at this point that  the difference is outside the range of normal noise We have had some substantial surprises in  the last few years As the economy gets bigger and bigger, the possible dollar errors grow Even  so, it is a significant difference, and we shall know a lot more in the next few weeks Some of  this is speculation about whether people anticipated their tax liabilities for last year better than  they did for the previous few years There also is uncertainty about the sources of the income  We are not adamant in saying that the New York forecast is wrong, and I am sure that they are  humble about the precision of their forecasting ability, too, at this juncture   It is my understanding that the difference in the projections of the  surplus for the fiscal year, which I believe is on the order of $40 billion, is mostly on the revenue    3/31/98  side, but not all of it is there There are the ongoing questions concerning how appropriations  will play out in terms of authorizations and expenditures   I cannot cite a rule of thumb off the top of my head, but in some of our  models we do have terms for food and energy prices feeding through to the core CPI We did a  simulation that indicated that the effect of the downward movement in energy prices in our  forecast on the core inflation rate this year is somewhere between 1 and 2 percent   It is not negligible, to be sure   We do not have real wages declining, but in 1999 the gap between the  ECI increase and the CPI increase is smaller We are not at all sure that that is the number to  focus on In fact, we prefer to focus on a product price measure rather than the consumer price  index in looking at real wages, and it feeds through, too, to the implications for income shares  We have had very substantial acceleration of real compensation gains over the past two years  We are anticipating sizable further increases in 1998 and 1999 In 1999, it is a smaller increase  and one could explain that in part by the fact that we project a little upcreep in the unemployment  rate We also are banking to some degree on the notion that the ECI and other wage measures  have been boosted over the past year or so by minimum wage hikes These are not present in  this projection One could regard that, I suppose, as another upside risk on the inflation outlook  because there obviously is discussion, albeit fitful, of further minimum wage increases We also  saw a very big increase in commissions and bonuses in the latter part of 1997, which we think  probably will be repeated in the first quarter of 1998 These are associated in part with the huge  level of profits and activity in the financial and real estate sectors We foresee an abatement of  that contribution to compensation increases as we move forward  As I said earlier, we are fairly convinced by all the anecdotal and survey evidence--  indicating that employers have been utilizing more flexible forms of compensation such as cash  bonuses and incentive pay of various sorts--that future adjustments to compensation should be  more sensitive than previously to a deceleration in the economic expansion and a falloff in  profitability such as we have in our forecast In other words, the inertia in adjustments to  compensation that formerly might have been present in such circumstances may not quite as  evident in this cycle Those are the elements that lead us to be fairly sanguine about the  prospects for holding the line on nominal compensation increases even in this tight labor market    3/31/98  We still anticipate sizable increases in real wages that we think are in general conformity with  the Phillips curve model   I am not sure about the ability of John Q Public to filter out all the  cumulative changes from the 1994 approach to measuring consumer prices to the method used in  1999   In the world of instantaneous flows of information, all the economists  will be talking about it and maybe it will filter out into the real world to some degree I guess we  are not totally persuaded one way or the other on this We are inclined to think that in terms of  formal cost of living adjustments and, more informally, to the extent that people look at what the  CPI has done over the past year, they are probably going to be influenced to a considerable  degree by the headline number I did note some tension between the anecdotal and the statistical  news on the wage side This does make us nervous In our survey that all the Reserve Banks  participated in, the focus was more on what business firms are doing, if anything, if they are  experiencing a shortage I think a majority of the firms that were in that predicament said they  were doing something But I think it is difficult to judge the timing and dimension of an    3/31/98  acceleration--how much more they are doing now than they were doing before And in general,  based on this anecdotal evidence, I wonder if there isn't some sort of Heisenberg problem here  We are looking so hard and we are asking so many people that one wonders whether we are  finding a few more stories than we would have if we did not have a neutral expectation about  what was going on We are a bit nervous about this, but I think there is a little upside risk in the  wage outlook  On the price side, I believe the markets and the commentators have gotten a whiff of  the inflation that may be out there Recent housing market developments have intensified that  impression The indexes have been distorted by shifts in geographic mix, but I think the large  increase in prices that was reported in connection with this new home sales figure the other day  is one more instance where people are not looking at those subtleties What they sense is that  this is a really hot market and prices may be moving   This is an area in which economic science has not given us anything  that we want to stake our lives on We have various results with the various models, but I think  we are persuaded that the appreciation of the dollar has had a significant effect Looking at what  is going on in the goods markets, I think the evidence is quite persuasive that we are getting a  significant effect As we go forward, the waning of that effect, given our dollar assumption, does  add a little to the acceleration of prices that we have in the forecast   All of that reflects the arithmetic that I described at the outset as to how  we have added up the GDP components There is the tension between the labor input indicators  and what we can add up on the expenditures side We've seen this before We will see it again  It leaves a lot of room for surprise, but we have reconciled this discrepancy by pumping up the  missing expenditure numbers as much as we felt was reasonable, particularly on the inventory  side We are left with the implication that there was a substantial decline in productivity in the  first quarter As I said, that is not inconceivable to us in terms of our general outlook on the  cyclical, so to speak, element of productivity performance over the forecast period However,  the quarterly change in productivity is sharp and that raises a question We might yet find that  GDP growth did not slow in the first quarter   This is a policy issue on which I have no expertise You are asking  whether I am comfortable with that? I guess what you are saying is that the characterization of  economic activity need not be a reference to GDP growth per se, because the latter may not  capture the sense one has of the vitality of the economy in the first quarter of the year Perhaps  there is some other way that you folks might want to express your view of what you heard at this  meeting   If we talk about it simply from a straight arithmetic point of view,  obviously we would have to find some more expenditures Where might we find them? It could  be in any number of places One could conceive that, despite what looks like a very strong  consumer expenditure number in the first quarter, people really have had a lot of income, though  it is overstated in the first-quarter number because of seasonal adjustment quirks Nonetheless,  consumer spending is strong and is supported by a lot of wealth and people feeling really great  So, there could be an even boomier picture in consumer expenditures than we have projected   In the end, BEA is only going to publish a number that adds up on the  expenditure side, and the productivity numbers are measured that way So, that is how we are  going to have to get there We have only one month of data for net exports and that is a volatile  number, so we could be surprised there Over the past year we have been surprised on final  sales, and there has been an accompanying upside surprise on inventory investment We could    3/31/98  see larger amounts of inventory investment that would be consistent with higher final sales and  with our basic sense that no troublesome accumulation has been occurring Getting up to 4 or 5  percent GDP growth is not totally implausible We could also have some revisions in the  employment figures or something precipitously on the weak side in March that would make up  for the string of upside surprises that have helped to generate this weak productivity number   Again, arithmetically it is Certainly, what we have in this forecast for  1998 in essence is a story where unit labor costs are increasing more rapidly because of the  lagging adjustment of labor input to the deceleration in output Weaker productivity means  weaker profits   I think they have been hiring people in part because business has been  very good and they expect business to continue to be good On the basis of the anecdotal reports,  firms have had such a difficult time finding workers that they're probably still catching up to  some degree That may be one of the reasons the workweek has been on the firmer side than we  would have expected, even allowing for statistical problems I think that continues to happen  There is momentum to this process If we get that stronger first quarter, it is going to imply  accelerator effects and possibly a stronger investment outlook beyond If we get that    3/31/98  performance and stronger profits, it calls into question our expectation of a weaker stock market  So, one could envision, as happened last year, that things could come together in a way that  propels the economy forward and keeps going on with the support of the financial markets On  the other hand, that would imply that we might be moving toward a 4 percent rate of  unemployment this year, and I think that strains one's sense, given what one can already see, of  what is possible without really substantial inflation pressures   It could be less I apologize if word about what we are assuming did  not get to you We have a 10 percent decline in the market from its level last week to the end of    3/31/98  the year and we then have a flat market in 1999 So, in comparison to what we've seen in the  past few years, which as I recall were a couple of close-to-10-percent corrections that were  quickly reversed, this more permanent correction would be a distinct contrast We provided a  simulation in the Greenbook of an alternative GDP path in which in essence the stock market  rises roughly 5 percent a year, enough to keep pace with the growth of nominal disposal income  It makes some material difference when we move out to 1999 As I suggested in my remarks, if  you think the market can do appreciably better than that--and that is really a paltry performance  by the standards of recent years or in relation to what the average investor seems to be  expecting--then the economy's performance will be dramatically different as we move out into  1999   Thank you, Mr Chairman I might call your attention to the housing data that were put at your places this morning I won't go into that at any length Let me just say that the single-family housing starts and permits data were very close to our expectations, while the multifamily starts were on the low side and really surprisingly low given the trend in permits Multifamily starts are of lesser importance in dollar terms, and we would also expect to see some bounceback So, on the whole, I think these data do not represent a significant departure from what we had in the Greenbook for residential construction activity  We have seen some astonishing economic data since the last meeting, and we have worked hard to make sense of them In the end, what we have    5/19/98  presented to you in the Greenbook is a forecast that, from the current quarter on, looks much like the prior version in terms of both growth and inflation I hope that this is not simply because we are unimaginative or stubborn, but rather because we have shown good judgment in processing the various surprises that came our way  For some of you, the central question probably is how we could have looked at a first-quarter GDP increase that we now estimate at more than 5 percent, along with April's 4-1/4 percent jobless rate, and still not have come up with a scarier price forecast I will focus my remarks on that question, with the expectation that I will end up addressing some of your other concerns along the way  First, there is no doubt about it The first quarter was a stunner As you may recall, I did say at the last meeting that it would not be a shock to see the forthcoming expenditure data come in strong enough to push the GDP growth rate a point or two above our 3 percent prediction But, at the time, we knew only about the huge increases in payrolls in January and February; I would have been more conservative if we had known that employment had declined in March  In any event, the incoming spending data prior to the April 30 release of BEA's advance estimate really did not prepare us for a GDP number as high as the 42 percent they published The major surprise was their big inventory component It was not a matter of their writing down a questionably high set of assumptions for the missing March data They did not Instead, it was mainly the translation of the available book-value data for January and February into real terms We talked with the BEA staff who did the calculations, and we could not find any flaws in their methods  That said, though, $67 billion of nonfarm inventory investment still looked awfully large to us, coming as it did on the heels of a similarly high rate of accumulation in the fourth quarter It seemed odd that stocks could be piling up so much more rapidly than final sales without our hearing more reports that firms were concerned about excess inventories  All things considered, it looked in late April as if there was a good chance that subsequent data would point toward a downward revision to the Q1 GDP number--most likely in the inventory category Well, you know what happened We got a string of stronger-than-anticipated inventory readings for March, plus some upward revisions for prior months All told, we think these ran the nonfarm inventory tab up to a whopping $93 billion--more than 3 times what might plausibly be sustainable in the steady state  Recognizing the important implications this would have for the dynamics of our forecast, we considered again whether there were any chinks in the data    5/19/98  that might be grounds for discounting them in anticipation of later revisions Finding none, at least of a statistical nature, we went ahead with the straightforward translation in the Greenbook What we did was to adjust our expectations regarding the March international trade report, which will come out tomorrow, with the thought that some of the increased inventory accumulation might be reflected in a wider trade gap than BEA assumed This did not alter the inventory picture itself, but it seemed sensible in terms of better aligning the production and expenditure data  So, as it stands, it is the high level of inventory investment in the first quarter that is the key reason why, despite the indications of strong momentum in private domestic final demand, our GDP growth rate for the remaining seven quarters of our forecast is virtually the same as it was a couple of months ago There are many risks here One is that the Q1 inventory bulge really was not so large, and thus that the drag of the forthcoming adjustment will be less than we have anticipated Another is that, even if the number is right, we could be wrong in our prediction of the timing of the adjustment We have a substantial deceleration occurring already this quarter and carrying into the summer, and that is a crucial ingredient in the immediate, and quite marked, slowing of GDP growth in this forecast  That such a slowing in activity is indeed in train is far from clear right now For a variety of statistical reasons, discussed in gory detail in the Greenbook, the labor market data are unusually opaque at this time; however, it is our general sense that if there has been a reduction in the growth of labor demand, it has not been commensurate with the degree of GDP slowing that we are predicting In other words, we are expecting that the slowing in output growth will be mirrored in large measure by a slackening in productivity gains Of course, I told you a similar story at the last meeting in regard to the first quarter; I will understand if you are a little skeptical now  But while I'm on the subject of productivity behavior, let me take this opportunity to segue to another conjectural aspect of our forecast, namely the revised productivity trend Based on a review of recent developments and of the newly available data on multifactor productivity through 1996, we have raised our assumption regarding the trend growth of output per hour in the nonfarm business sector by a quarter percentage point per annum This might not sound like much, but it is significant in offsetting the surprise we have had with respect to the unemployment rate It provides an offset in two ways It mutes the effect of a higher GDP path on the unemployment rate, and it also means that a given rate of compensation gain translates into a smaller increment in standardized unit labor costs This helps to explain why, despite the recent surprises, the unemployment rate is only a hair lower by next year than in the last forecast and why we have not raised the inflation forecast    5/19/98  Of course, we not only have not raised our inflation forecast, we actually have trimmed it a tenth This puts us more clearly below the consensus, although I am not sure how many of the private forecasters are being as assiduous as we are about keeping track of the damping effects of the ongoing BLS technical revisions to the CPI I may not be able to persuade the doubters among you of the wisdom of our view, but for the purposes of setting the stage for discussion, I will remind you briefly of the major ingredients of the forecast  First, on the compensation side, we have absolutely no doubt that the labor market is extremely taut We are a bit skeptical about the 4-1/4 percent unemployment rate registered in the survey last month, but whatever the true number is, we are sure that workers have gained some clout in the pay-setting process Nonetheless, the March ECI figures showed wage and salary increases right in line with our expectations and benefit cost increases below our guess Thus, there was nothing in that report to negate the basic premises of our forecast of flat nominal compensation inflation namely, that low price inflation will damp wage increases; that there will be no repetition of the minimum wage hikes that boosted pay rates in the past couple of years; and that, though health insurance costs will be increasing more rapidly, a slowing of the economic expansion will take some of the "oomph" out of commissions and bonuses Time will tell whether this sanguine assessment is right, but we are sticking with it for now  On the price side, the incoming data have been close to our expectations, though we can find some reasons to worry The tobacco price increases keep coming at us, and we have not incorporated a legislative action that might lead to much steeper increments than we have been seeing of late The 04 percent jump in owners' equivalent rent in last month's CPI could be a harbinger of a more adverse trend in a stronger housing market And there are signs of price increases happening elsewhere, too  But, against that consideration, one must also weigh the continued indications of softness in prices in many sectors--the lack of "pricing leverage" still so widely reported, especially in goods markets The fact is that there are substantial segments of the economy where prices are going nowhere or downward because there is slack industrial capacity, intense import competition, deregulation, cost-saving technological advances, and so on Commodity prices clearly are not signaling an upturn in inflation In fact, oil companies will tell you of a supply-demand picture that leaves them concerned that prices might go down from here The predictions regarding the likely fall grain harvest suggest the possibility of price-depressing inventory buildups, especially if the Asian crisis countries are not able to reverse the dramatic contractions in their ag imports Semiconductors are in abundant supply, leading to steep declines in the prices of chips going into computers and innumerable other items I am told by an auto company economist that his firm    5/19/98  is actually thinking about targeting declining vehicle prices in future negotiations with their parts suppliers In short, there is no sign that goods prices are on the brink of acceleration, and they could be even weaker in the near term than they have been  We have noted for some time that, if one looked at the factory utilization rate as the indicator of pressures on productive resources generally, one would not only have done better in predicting what has happened to overall prices to date, but one would also be looking for appreciable further deceleration ahead We have not gone that whole hog by any means We have stayed closer to what might be suggested by the unemployment rate outlook We think a little caution is called for, given the possibility that the end of the favorable supply- side shocks of the dollar's appreciation and health care cost-cutting might be more important than is apparent at this point  I have gone on, now, at some length, without touching on perhaps the most crucial issue in the economic outlook--namely, the prospects for final demand The risks and uncertainties here are obvious Asia is one that remains prominent; the possibility that we shall yet head toward one of the "worse case" scenarios is still out there, but at least thus far the direct effects on the United States through the trade channel have been in line with our expectations On the domestic side, the latest reports on the retail sector and the housing market have given further evidence of the robustness of demand trends  It was not a slip that we mentioned in the Greenbook the current catch phrase, "bubble economy" We continue to believe that the rise in equity prices has been a key element in the persistent strength of spending And we remain concerned about the possibility that the market will continue to climb even in the absence of earnings gains It is commonly remarked that this is a "liquidity driven" market, the implication being that it will take an appreciable tightening of monetary policy--or the fear of one--to prompt a serious correction Perhaps the hints of a little sterner antitrust posture will put a damper on mega-merger speculation, but that has not materialized yet And the market has largely shaken off the renewed slump in Asian equity markets So, at this point, I think one has to consider the possibility that, rather than weakening even slightly, as we have forecast, the stock market will climb appreciably further and give an added boost to domestic demand   I think the analysis is a little more complicated than that, and I will  spare you some of the details I would probably stumble over them in any event We have been  building into our forecast a substantial allowance for a positive effect on productivity from capital  deepening We did not have a set of numbers that was as up-to-date as we would have liked, and  the recent statistical release has clarified that picture What we found was that the productivity  effects on the capital deepening side probably were not as large as we had estimated earlier, and yet  we also saw more favorable data on other components of the productivity picture  One of them was a step-up in the rate of improvement in labor quality That always  seemed to be a possibility We know that college enrollments have been increasing We have seen  recently some increase in participation among older, more experienced workers Whether such  workers are truly as productive as one might assume on the basis of their experience is conjectural,  given the changes in technology and other innovations But looking at the compositional changes  in the workforce and the influx of recent college graduates who may have more current skills in  terms of what employers are looking for, it seemed reasonable to us to extrapolate that recent  improvement in our forecast  So, taking our investment forecast, extending what we have learned about the capital  services contribution, extrapolating in a sensible way in light of recent labor markets developments  the information we have on the quality of labor stemming from greater education, we concluded  that it was reasonable to raise our assumption about the productivity trend We triangulated against  all the other information that was available--the continuing surprises in the recent labor    5/19/98  productivity growth figures and how these fit with the Okun's law relation--and we concluded that  this elevation of our number was reasonable  I must say that we are not alone in our estimate of a 1-1/2 percent productivity growth  trend I think DRI is there People bringing different technology to these estimates come up with  different conclusions, but we feel that this is a reasonably sound move for us at this point   I think I voiced my concern in this regard, maybe not clearly enough  There are a couple of possibilities here One is, as I indicated, that while we cannot find a flaw in  the data at this point, inventory investment may still have been significantly less rapid than the  first-quarter numbers currently seem to add up to On the other hand, we have to cut such  investment back a long way to get to as lean an inventory picture as we had just a couple of  quarters ago in terms of inventory-sales ratios Another possibility is that businesses are so  optimistic or they see so many opportunities to pick up relatively inexpensive supplies--perhaps  because of what is happening on the import side--that they are building up their inventories  willingly, and we will see this in the data that will get released in the weeks ahead Thus, there  may not be as big a drag from inventories in the near term as in the Greenbook forecast  MRPARRY Voluntary accumulation, but unwise!    5/19/98   In the short run, that provides a little more support to production,  employment, and income growth, and this process can be self-sustaining to a point But I think the  level of inventories is high enough now that one has to anticipate a gearing down in the rate of  inventory accumulation at some point in the coming months Whether it will be as quick and sharp  in the second quarter as we have in the forecast is an open question  I might note that a good part of that dropback is in the oil sector where inventories ran  up very substantially in the first quarter We are not expecting a repetition of that When we strip  that out, the moderation in inventory accumulation in the second quarter is not quite so dramatic  In fact, for the remaining components of inventory investment, there is still quite ample additional  accumulation that would be quite unsustainable by our lights   The process by which price movements enter into the determination of  wages is very complex The movements in the CPI are a benchmark in some collective bargaining  situations where employers are gauging an appropriate pay increase to offer their employees in the  hope that the workers will not be so perturbed about where they stand relative to others that they  will leave Movements in the CPI also serve as a benchmark in many cases outside of collective  bargaining where a one-sided decision has to be made Employers will look at what has happened  to the published index over the past year, or some other relevant period, and make that an important  element in their decision In some cases where there are complex systems of general base pay  increases that are supplemented by merit pay increases and bonuses and so on, that first element  may be very much influenced by the perception of what has been happening to the cost of living I  think these year-by-year changes that you are talking about--you referred to the Greenbook level of  CPI inflation in 1999--involve comparisons using 1994 methods They are cumulative and  overstate the differences from year to year We are talking about differences of only 1 or 2  percentage point for each of these years That is a subtlety that probably is missed in those cases  where people are simply looking at the published CPI to gauge what the appropriate pay increase  might be Part of this process is, I think, simply a backward-looking one as I described It is a  cost-of-living catch-up, formal or informal  There probably also is some influence from expectations that may not be entirely  backward-looking On that score, we have no evidence that people are expecting a dramatic pickup  in inflation The recent survey evidence has shown a declining trend in inflation expectations,  though with some small uptick in the Michigan Survey last month The expected level of inflation  is not down to the measured level of inflation yet That might suggest that some people are not  going to conclude that if they get a 2 percent wage increase, that increase is going to keep them    5/19/98  whole over the next year But I think the downward progression of readings on inflation  expectations would suggest that, whatever their influence on wages was a year ago, it is probably  going to be less this year So, we think that both the price changes we have seen and the  expectational changes will tend to moderate nominal wage increases  An important point is that real wage increases have been very sizable, as measured  against product prices in particular but even against overall consumer prices in the last year What  we are forecasting in the next seven quarters is a continuation of very sizable real wage increases in  product price terms It could be that this whole process will escalate, but at this point we don't see  a big surge coming from the price side So, we don't see any reason to think that the way to  reconcile these things is to jack up both our wage and price forecasts in the near term There's a  certain momentum here that I think is quite favorable for the wage outlook  Benefit costs are very erratic from quarter to quarter We did get a downside surprise  for the first quarter We are assuming that there will be some catch-up in the quarters ahead You  may have seen the horror stories about medical benefit cost increases in this morning's Wall Street  Journal The second page had another story about how businesses are trying to head these  increases off or offset them in some way by making employees pay for a bigger proportion of the  cost if they do not take the cheapest plan Our expectation is that there will be a perceptible uptick  in medical benefit costs and in the total compensation picture Just to give you a rough handle on  the quantities involved here, if we had an extra 5 percentage points added to the rate of medical  benefit cost increases going forward, that would add about 2 or 1/4 percent to the overall increases  in labor costs The cost of benefits is important, but it takes really big numbers to greatly disturb  the trend here   That is an interesting question, and it may suggest that the way I  approached the prior question was not right In a sense, we think these changes are improvements  in the measurement of inflation because they better capture reality I guess that suggests that if all  along people had been making their decisions based on something more like the reality than the  published numbers, then they would not perceive, for example, that their real wages were going up  faster than the measured numbers suggest   We think these numbers better capture the reality We also think that it  is important to keep tabs on this in thinking about whether there is an acceleration or not in the rate  of inflation   We are moving only incrementally toward reality in the measurement  changes The fact that we are getting there gradually means there is a distortion in the underlying  acceleration   I'm sure they would be happy to accommodate us for a price  [Laughter]   I suspect that the Michigan survey people might have some qualms  about injecting that question, given the possibility that it would disturb the answer to the  subsequent question   They don't have to give survey participants the correct answer for some  index In fact, I don't think the question relates to any particular index   That would be a safer approach in that respect   We have talked to a number of business people and have attended  meetings where economists from various corporations talked about these things There are not a lot  of industries where the accumulation of inventories stands out I can cite a few anecdotes and a  few statistics that I think might be worthwhile The chemical industry clearly has had a substantial  increase in inventories and a big run-up in its inventory-sales ratio That is probably at least partly  related to Asian developments I believe there has been an upturn in pulp and paper I have heard  of some stocking up by electronics firms that thought it was a good time to buy because prices were  good We have a few anecdotes, including some in the Beigebook, that indicate that some firms    5/19/98  have taken advantage of low prices being offered by Asian suppliers to build up their inventories in  some materials   There is no doubt on the oil side My sense is that the buildup was  only to a modest degree the result of price speculation It appears to have been much more the  result of softer-than-anticipated demand for petroleum products because of the warm winter  weather   Right   Yes We showed these data in our briefings for the Board yesterday  that I hope the presidents received Neither the Purchasing Managers' survey nor the NFIB survey  provides significant evidence that there has been any unintended, undesired accumulation of  inventories in the first quarter One of the things we did not highlight in our briefings but that also  is part of the survey is a question about inventory plans The April reading in the NFIB survey  showed a startling jump in plans to build inventories   It may be that they are reflecting what has happened but, be that as it  may, the April number took a big jump It actually looks weird For what it's worth, no concern  was expressed there, and in fact the NFIB survey overall, as interpreted by their own people, would  suggest that the growth of the economy in the second quarter will be as strong as it was in the first,  and that did not come as any surprise to them According to their survey, second-quarter growth is  going to be stupendously strong   Let me offer two very brief final points One is on the financial side  If one looks at the business financing flows, short-term business credit in particular, those flows are  not inconsistent at all with there having been a strong run-up in inventories earlier in the year And  what we have in hand for the first part of the second quarter is entirely consistent with a big  reversal, sharper than the one we have in the Greenbook   Yes I was going to caution that this is not an entirely reliable  indicator There are a lot of things going on in the financial sector   The other point I want to make is that it is not simply a question in our  minds of whether this inventory buildup is involuntary It is in large measure simply a question of  whether the inventory accumulation was as rapid as was indicated for the first part of the year  because, one way or another, that rate of inventory investment needs to come down If it was  involuntary, then we might expect a more rapid orders and production adjustment, but the drag  would still be there over time   Right   On the stock market, President Poole, this is a recurring question and it  puts us in a tough logical bind You suggested a formulation that would have grossly  underforecasted what happened to stock prices over the past couple of years but not as much as we  have [Laughter]   We took a punch on that one, and it has been painful But the other  issue is one of simple coherence To the extent that we have any inkling of what is built into the  stock market in terms of expectations about monetary policy, interest rates in general, earnings, the  behavior of the economy, and so on, it leaves us uncomfortable to ignore all that and write down  something that implies a vast extension of price-earnings multiples beyond what we have seen So,  we have taken the approach of trying to put in a stock market path that seemed more consistent It  has not stood us in good stead to date Over the past couple of years, we certainly would have been  better off using the approach you outlined Whether that could be said going forward, we do not  know But it is a point we continue to think about   Are you talking about nominal figures here?   Total personal income, not disposable?   I have not focused on that measure We have a considerable slowing in  the economy--   I can see in the detail of our forecasts a number of components that we  have shifting Transfer payments, for example, fall off, presumably because of the spurt in social  security payments in the first quarter But I guess I don't have a compelling answer for you Total  personal income in the first half is still rising at a rate close to 5 percent, which is not far below the  average pace last year when employment growth was even faster than we have over the first half of  this year Perhaps there's something in these quarterly numbers that I can't immediately put my  finger on to explain this   When we go out that far, I don't have a big problem reconciling this  growth path with the much more modest increases in employment that we are forecasting It is  more with regard to this first quarter-second quarter pattern that I am not prepared to give you a  nice crisp answer as to why we have that particular gyration But as we move out in time, the  question is whether the economy is going to moderate as we have forecast If it does and if  productivity holds up reasonably well, employment gains will be much smaller and they will be  entirely consistent with this kind of slackening in the growth of nominal personal income in our  forecast   You're switching gears on me! Before I was addressing the question of  employment growth and how that is slackening substantially over the forecast period and  accounting for a good part of this slower growth in personal income The other question is what is  going to happen to real wage rates or nominal wage rates I discussed that earlier There is not a  great deal I can add to what I said about our theory in that regard What we are predicting, given  the price path, is not at all at odds with what history suggests in terms of models that relate wage  changes to past price changes and measures of labor market tightness The situation in terms of the  workers being fooled for a period and then some catch-up occurring is something that we have  made some allowance for, at least in our minds, in that we anticipated that the NAIRU would come  down a bit as the productivity trend shifted upward This productivity gain was not immediately  recognized, so employers might have been able to get away with more moderate nominal wage    5/19/98  increases, some of that showing up in lower inflation and some of it showing up in higher profits in  the short run That process may be reversing We are assuming a little tick back up in the NAIRU  Maybe it will be more dramatic than what we have allowed for  In the end, we are monitoring the incoming data as closely as anyone can As I said,  what we have seen in the recent numbers has not been at odds with our expectations You can  eyeball the moving averages on a number of these series and see an upward drift that you will  extrapolate, given your sense of what is going on Or you can look and see that, after you have  allowed for some of the bumps along the way with respect to the minimum wage and have looked  at the recent period, it is not clear that there is an ongoing acceleration in the recent numbers  Maybe more of this compensation is taking forms that are not captured well in the measures That  means there may well be a cost that employers are incurring that is not going to be reflected in the  wage data That would be something one would want to take account of, I think   Obviously, we would look at a number on personal income and adjust  our forecast as appropriate The personal income number is rarely something that is of enormous  importance in itself because we think we have some rough handle on how those numbers are  estimated from the available data on hours and average hourly earnings and so on   No, it reflects the thought that our stock price assumption might be too  low or that we might be putting too much of a premium on what we think is rational investor  behavior As we see it, if the market continues to go up, the wealth effects, cost of capital effects,  and so on would stimulate greater aggregate demand We leave it to you to determine whether the  implications of stronger aggregate demand for inflation would be troubling and thus whether some  policy action might be warranted In all likelihood, a substantial monetary policy tightening would  have some damaging effect on equity prices That is, I think, how we see this sentence   Exactly   There is some massaging As we have indicated, at the present time  with all of the uncertainties about the measurement of the average workweek and average hourly    5/19/98  earnings, that massaging is more important To a first approximation, we think we know how BLS  is doing this, and that is not normally an independent piece of information of great importance   We tried to address this issue once again I assume that President  Poole noticed this in Part I We do have a simulation where the stock market rises moderately  Given the uncertainties about equity premiums, I am not sure what your formula translates into, but  basically the alternative has the equity values rising with nominal personal income So, running  this through the model, we get a significantly faster growth of GDP We think that what we have  assumed is reasonable given our expectations of earnings against what seem to be still very buoyant  earnings forecasts While they have come down for 1998 among private analysts, it seems as if  most of them think the damage is entirely behind us and that earnings are going to be moving up  rapidly in the second half of this year and into 1999   Frankly, I'm hard pressed to see where I can add much of value to what you already have heard this morning or read in the Greenbook Much of the drama during the intermeeting period was on the international side, which Ted has just covered The domestic development that has attracted the most attention, the decline of the stock market, has been pretty much of the dimension we predicted last time and for the reason we gave--namely, disappointing corporate earnings  Looking ahead, our forecast has been altered only a little, mainly to incorporate the more negative outlook for the external sector and to deal with the additional short-run gyrations associated with the longer-than-anticipated GM strike The basic story, however, remains one of a deceleration in economic activity and some worsening of inflation  Perhaps the interesting point is that we appear to be predicting a considerably weaker expansion of aggregate demand than are the majority of forecasters For example, the latest Blue Chip consensus shows nominal GDP growing around 4-1/4 percent over the six quarters of our projection period--the    8/18/98  better part of a percentage point above the Greenbook prediction--even though their short-term interest rates are, like ours, flat  I can't tell you for sure why our forecast differs from the average view of the several dozen Blue Chippers, but the available detail on their forecasts contains one compelling clue Only two members of the Blue Chip panel have real net exports in 1999 as low as the Greenbook forecast, and the consensus view is that the trade gap will widen only around $25 billion over the next six quarters, versus more than $100 billion in our forecast Even allowing for the endogeneities that President Poole emphasized at a prior meeting, I feel quite comfortable in asserting that this difference is a key factor in our more subdued outlook While I can't prove who is right on this, I will note--because humility would prevent Ted from doing so--that in the past couple of years he and his colleagues have been much more on track than the private analysts with regard to the deterioration in our trade position  Of course, even if we don't seem to be at odds with the Blue Chip panel with respect to the tenor of the domestic demand outlook, that doesn't mean we're right on that side Expectations of a slackening of demand have repeatedly been disappointed in the past couple of years, and there is no assurance that it will materialize this time We continue to think that the performance of the stock market has been, and will be, a key factor The revisions to the national income accounts have done nothing to diminish our belief in the significance of the "wealth effect" Although the recent slide in equity prices has erased only a modest portion of the gains that had accrued to investors, the mere cessation of wealth increases relative to income would remove an impetus to household demand And this, in turn, would prompt businesses to curtail the growth of their inventories and fixed capital  This is, of course, the scenario that we have described in our forecast We have the Wilshire 5000 running at a level around 10,000 through next year; it closed less than one percent above that level yesterday after exceeding 11,000 a few weeks ago As we noted in the Greenbook, even with that correction, shares still seem to be very generously valued, given what we see as the plausible scope for corporate earnings growth from the high levels already attained But, while some hints of rationality perhaps have crept into the market, one still hears people saying that there is no other good place to put investible funds A sure return of 5 or 6 percent on a fixed-income investment doesn't provide much competition for equities that, as surveys have repeatedly shown, people expect to yield double-digit returns over the coming years To be sure, there were signs of some hesitation in flows into equity funds during the recent market downdraft, but we've seen such episodes before in this long bull market It seemingly takes merely a whiff of favorable-news oxygen to get the bulls running again In fact, yesterday they even rallied the market on what might have been construed as bad    8/18/98  news Under the circumstances, we've thought it wiser for now to treat a deeper market decline as an explicit risk rather than as part of our baseline projection  Let me turn, then, to the inflation side of the ledger Given our softer real outlook, it probably isn't surprising that we also have a more moderate inflation forecast than the Blue Chip Again, without knowing their perspective about such things as the dollar, oil prices, and crop prospects, it's difficult to pinpoint the sources of the difference in forecasts I think we've given due emphasis in the Greenbook and in yesterday's Board briefing to the uncertainties that attend the price outlook The trimming of our core inflation forecast since the last meeting represents in large measure a fairly straightforward reaction to the slightly weaker outlook for aggregate demand and the lower import prices that now appear likely But, at the margin, we've also been moved by some of the recent economic data to give a little more weight to the stories we've been telling all along for why inflation should be slow to pick up even with such tight labor markets Those data have included a smidge lower readings on wages and prices recently than we had predicted Given that the July CPI was to be released this morning, just before my briefing, moving our forecast farther below the consensus obviously was risking some immediate embarrassment But the Fates have been kind, with the two-tenths increases in the overall and core indexes being in line with our expectations  The bottom line of the inflation story is that, although labor markets are tight, experience suggests that prices respond only slowly to such pressures And, in the recent period, and for a while longer, the underlying tendency for inflation to pick up in response to those pressures is being offset by favorable shocks with respect to the terms of trade and supplies of food and energy--not to mention an ample amount of unutilized factory capacity Some of the favorable shocks are expected to turn around next year but not with sufficient force to do much damage within our projection period We'll be extending our Greenbook forecast through 2000 next month, and I hesitate to venture now beyond our current horizon However, recognizing that the lags in the effects of policy on inflation are long, I probably should offer the observation that, with a stable funds rate, there's nothing in the direction of our present forecast that points to a take-off in wages and prices in 2000 Of course, with things as unsettled in some important areas as they are now, we'll have to take a further close look at this over the coming weeks That concludes my prepared remarks, Mr Chairman   We have not anticipated that prospect in our forecast, as our numbers  might suggest The one thing that we have anticipated is a pattern of earlier than usual  acquisitions and installations of computer equipment over the next few quarters in an effort to  avoid doing a lot of that in late 1999 But I take your point; what you describe is possible  Certainly a lot of people may consider stockpiling some cash over that weekend That is an  entirely different issue   Obviously, we will have to confront this question more concretely when  we write down year 2000 numbers in our Greenbook forecast for the next meeting We will do  that with some trepidation I don't recall hearing anything from business firms that suggests they  have focused very much attention on this matter thus far In fact, even in talking to some of the  computer firms, we find that they sometimes seem surprised when we raise the question about  business strategies with respect to equipment purchases toward the end of next year It is a bit  puzzling that people seemingly have not given more attention to that question, but there is, I think,  plenty of time for them to undertake that kind of stockpiling   Obviously, firms that provide goods that their customers might want to  add to stocks will have to decide whether to increase production or just let their shelves be depleted  and then not have to reverse an increase in production With the just-in-time production chains,  there may have to be some producer responses   We're looking forward to it! [Laughter]   We are engaged in a multifaceted research effort on that issue In a sense,  the work that the Reserve Banks were kind enough to do for us in conducting the survey is a small  component of that research We have been talking to firms, interviewing them in some depth, and  we are going to be doing more of that Our contacts emphasize that this is a new labor  compensation regime and that flexible compensation practices will enable them to cut back on  labor costs if the economy and their fortunes deteriorate That outcome is untested and time will  tell We also are doing some statistical work at a micro level, using employment cost index data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to try to estimate at the firm level how businesses are  managing in this new regime, perhaps by trading off various components of their compensation  packages and so on We hope to have some additional insights on this in the next several months,  but I think this is something that ultimately will have to be tested in the real world by a real change  in the cyclical situation We will only be in the conjecture phase on this for now, but I think that  too is a potentially meaningful exercise  I would stress that our projection of the ECI does not assume a major change in  compensation behavior Some of these compensation elements do not even show up in the ECI  That is another factor we need to take into account in thinking about cost pressures in the economy  and how those may wax or wane Basically, the most important element going forward is the    8/18/98  potential role of the continuing low inflation that we are experiencing in damping nominal wage  increases On that basis, models embodying that mechanism suggest that there is considerable  potential for deceleration in compensation increases over the coming quarters As the pressures in  the labor markets abate in our forecast, these factors combine going out through 1999 to produce  what I think is likely to be some moderation in spending   That might be true at least for those people who are not living essentially  from hand to mouth I think a lot of these flexible pay schemes tend to affect people who are in the  upper income brackets and have no liquidity constraints   Maybe not with wage change, but with total labor costs in some way   Theoretically you might want to include those payments as your argument  suggests, but I don't think we have any data that quantify them I suspect that they are not a huge  element in the picture On top of that, we have payments that actually go to employees that are  not counted in the ECI The reason is that they are regarded by the definitions used in the ECI as  out of scope because they are recruiting expenses   Yes, except to the extent that in a sense they also are substitutes for the  internal management of labor resources   If you eliminate a janitorial function and outsource it to another firm, that  firm is taking over various fixed administrative-type costs The analysis gets complicated   Obviously this is an incredibly complex matter As I said, I hope that we  are going to make some headway in our effort to discern the effects that some of these changing  practices have on the cyclical variability of spending   I do not think that you need to go that extra step The stock market is  in effect one of the financial market channels through which the impulses that the Committee  generates through open market operations create a financial environment that influences the  growth of aggregate demand Exchange rates are another channel We also would include the  bond market and the shape of the yield curve We can think about what the consequences of the  Committee's actions might be with respect to the bond market if we were to change money  market conditions We also need to consider the effects on the stock market in that context, which  may be harder, though I am not sure, than anticipating the effects on these other financial markets    8/18/98  In any event, the whole complex of financial variables does influence spending decisions I don't  think you can avoid that conclusion   If you felt that the market was likely to start to rally again, even against  the fundamentals, and to spur aggregate demand in a way that you felt excessive in terms of the  inflation prospects that would go with that, I think that would argue at the margin for considering  a tightening of policy that you would not otherwise have wanted to institute were it not for that  expectation Now, what I think I heard from many people around the table is that they want to  remain humble about their ability to anticipate movements in the stock market, especially  nonfundamental movements So, that might cause you to be reluctant to move with great force on  a hunch about which way the market would go But I think you have to have one It is manifest  in the behavior of the economy in the last couple of years that the stock market's movements are  of considerable importance You need to take a position on this  Mr Chairman, I might just add one small fact I can't say for sure that we have this  nailed down, but I am told that our first look at the trade data suggests that about 3/4 of the imports  of capital goods would be offsets to PDE So, we would have weaker producers durable  equipment expenditures than is written down in the Greenbook However, the GDP effects are  trivial That is a tentative conclusion    8/18/98   Mr Chairman, I just want to make clear that while we were praying that  we would not be humiliated by incoming information, there was no divine guidance when we  drafted the Greenbook   Thank you, Mr Chairman Over the past couple of weeks, participants in the financial markets have become less certain that this meeting will bring another easing step My sense is that they continue to perceive that you're strongly committed to keeping the economic expansion intact, but that they see recent developments in the markets and in the economy as raising some question about at least the urgency of further policy action  The sources of this uncertainty about what you will decide to do have their parallels in risks that we noted in Greenbook While our forecast hasn't changed very much from that presented at the last meeting, this doesn't mean that we have a great deal of confidence that this is what would transpire under the assumed policy We are still confronted with an uncomfortably broad range of plausible outcomes    11/17/98  For example, it's not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the credit markets continue their healing process, the stock market moves to new highs, and aggregate demand barrels along You can get a sense of what that might look like by blowing up the differential between the baseline and the "higher stock prices" simulation in the Greenbook, which involved only maintenance of last week's market level On the other hand, it's just as easy to imagine a scenario in which there is another significant disturbance to the world economy and financial system, perhaps precipitated by a "meltdown" in Brazil; we have offered a far from extreme version of this in the Greenbook as well  Karen will have something to say about the international outlook but, before that, I would like to offer a few comments on the forces currently at work domestically  First, the fact that GDP growth in the third quarter apparently outstripped our expectations invites the conclusion that we've once again underestimated the momentum of demand in the economy However, the upside surprise appears to have been pretty much an inventory story In that regard, I should note that this morning's report on retail inventories showed that, outside of auto dealers, stocks were little changed in September-- probably implying only a marginal downward revision to our third-quarter guess As we said in the Greenbook, we don't think that there is a major overhang of unwanted stocks in the aggregate; but inventory-sales ratios have climbed, and they are quite high in a few industries At a minimum, I believe we should anticipate that businesses, at least outside the auto sector, will be attempting to curb the pace of accumulation That may well be one reason why the tenor of news from the manufacturing sector has been quite negative of late  Over the past couple of years, we've often underestimated the desire of businesses to maintain rapid rates of inventory accumulation, basically because we underestimated the strength of final demand But, recently, domestic final demand has not been any stronger than we anticipated; it wasn't in the third quarter, and last Friday's figures showing a hefty October advance in retail sales were closely in line with our expectations Moreover, the greater growth of output evidently has not generated any extra jobs and labor income Instead, payroll growth has slowed more than we expected, and there seems to be some pickup in corporate downsizing announcements This may be one reason why the early November Michigan SRC survey-- while showing a considerable bounceback in the sentiment index--didn't show much improvement in employment expectations  The flip side of the more moderate growth of labor income may have been a shade healthier corporate profit performance than we anticipated    11/17/98  But the trend of profits is still weak over the past several quarters and, though hope springs eternal in the stock market, the deterioration in corporate cash flow is a negative for capital spending The anecdotal evidence suggests that, whether for that reason or simply because they don't see current and prospective demand warranting further additions to capacity, many firms--especially manufacturers--are gearing back their investment programs  I've not mentioned the developments in the debt and equity markets, per se, in my comments on the spending picture The jury is still out on whether the recent turmoil is going to leave a substantial mark on the real economy On the credit side, the bond markets have reopened for business in terms of new issuance activity, and spreads are narrowing The commercial paper market is having some difficulty accommodating the over-the-year-end borrowing by firms that are not in the top credit rungs, but banks are filling in--sometimes reluctantly--and those tensions presumably will be behind us in a couple of months  Nonetheless, we still think it's reasonable to anticipate that it will take a while for the sting of the recent experience to wear off fully, and that the capital markets will continue to show a greater sensitivity to liquidity and credit risk considerations The commercial banks are not insulated from the capital markets, and they too have learned something about the risks facing them in their lending activities; consequently, we don't expect the recent tightening of loan terms and standards to be reversed immediately And, although the decline in the level of interest rates for prime borrowers, supported by the Fed's easing, takes some of the bite out of this tightening, credit terms overall have deteriorated for some higher risk enterprises and certainly the trend toward ever easier access to credit has been halted  Similarly, despite the rousing rally that has occurred in recent weeks in the stock market, unless that rise continues we also should see the impetus from wealth effects waning in the coming months As we indicated in the Greenbook, this is a real wild card in the outlook We believe that the market is skating on thin ice, at best, given the trend of profits; in that context, our prediction of a 10 percent price decline might even be said to be conservative, as it would leave the averages considerably above their recent lows But tell that to an investor who has once again seen demonstrated the virtues of buying on dips and who hears market gurus chanting the mantra that "you don't fight the Fed" And one might ask what earnings have to do with share prices, anyway, when any company with "dot com" can generate a huge market capitalization overnight on a base of nothing but losses  In sum, while we believe you should view financial conditions as having shifted in a less accommodative direction since August, this clearly    11/17/98  is a situation that will have to be monitored closely in the coming weeks We're dealing with volatile phenomena, the implications of which can be difficult to judge  In any event, even if we have the aggregate demand outlook right, that still leaves considerable uncertainty about the prospects for inflation Recent news has been quite ambiguous on this score The ECI for the third quarter, on the face of it, raised some serious questions regarding our forecast of a peaking in wage and compensation increases, but it was followed by hints of a moderation in the trend of average hourly earnings Among the major price indexes, with an increase of two-tenths last month the year-on-year change in the core CPI dropped back to 23 percent--not far above its low point However, the chain price index for GDP apparently decelerated further last quarter Going forward, the recent softening of the dollar suggests that the prices of imports may not continue to exert so great a disinflationary effect, but anecdotally one hears that the oncoming flow of cheap Asian goods will result in significantly lower retail prices in the first half of next year There is something for every taste in this wage-price stew I think we've taken an honest sampling from the pot, rather than picking out the bits that most appeal to us; but you may disagree, and we'll be happy to answer any questions you may wish to put to us regarding our view  But, first, if I may, let me turn the floor over to Karen   Dave Lindsey follows that more closely than I do   President Poole, may I try to move from the big picture to the very  small picture? Looking at the flows in the last few weeks--and recognizing your point about  somebody is paying someone and that makes it a little difficult to track this sensibly--it does look  to me in the data that I have, though I think we may have more recent estimates, that savings    11/17/98  deposits have leveled out in the last few weeks and money market fund growth has decelerated  substantially This coincides quite precisely with the time when we see the reflow of money into  the equity mutual funds, not in quite the same proportions we saw in the first part of this year but  still substantial So, there does seem to be a correspondence here that is consistent with the story  that people were hesitating and parking money in these very short-term assets And with  Treasury bill yields having come down so sharply the opportunity costs actually had narrowed  for putting the money in savings accounts   I am looking at weekly numbers where growth has been inching up by  comparison   As Karen noted, the October trade report seems to point to a considerably higher level of net exports than was built into our Greenbook estimate of real GDP growth in the current quarter However, yesterday we received the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) for November, and it points to lower federal purchases than we were expecting The two adjustments are almost offsetting, leaving us now just a hair above the 31 percent GDP figure in last Wednesday's Greenbook  That said, activity this quarter appears once again to have surpassed our previous forecasts What is the explanation this time? Unfortunately, I can't give as neat an answer as I would like Clearly, one piece of the story is our earlier underestimation of the rise in motor vehicle production, which accounts for about half the extra growth of GDP in the current quarter Some of this reflects the automakers' competition for retail market share, but heavy trucks have been strong, too Another piece of the story is that, while we thought that homebuilders had a sizable backlog of demand to meet, we couldn't foresee that the weather would be as cooperative as it has been Builders have been able to keep workers on construction sites, avoiding a good part of the normal seasonal downswing in activity Of course, the fact that this Committee chose to ease policy faster than we'd assumed hasn't hurt either the auto or the housing markets    12/22/98  Beyond that, though, things get murkier That's partly because of the incoherence of the current picture in the industrial sector, outside of motor vehicles In particular, one might think from many company reports and surveys that the output of other manufacturers would be weaker than our industrial production estimates show them to be But, to deepen the mystery, the IP data themselves are weaker over the second half of this year than would be suggested by the corresponding expenditure components of GDP Perhaps subsequent data will narrow these gaps, but for now all this raises some question about just how strong the economy has been of late and it makes it more difficult to get a handle on the dynamics of the situation  That brings me to the prospects for the further slowing of GDP growth in 1999 As you know, we're putting a lot of weight on the notion that accelerator effects should be shifting into reverse over the coming quarters That is, the flatness of output growth for a while now implies that we should expect the level of investment to tend to stabilize  As the perceptions of businesses and households regarding the prospects for their sales and incomes moved up in recent years, they presumably wanted to expand their stocks of capital goods to levels that would help provide the larger flows of production and consumption services Spending on business equipment, houses, and consumer durables consequently rose markedly At this point, though, such spending is so high that, even if it leveled off, the net additions to the stocks of these goods would remain substantial For producer and consumer durables, declining relative prices likely will continue to elevate desired ratios of capital to output, but we doubt that it will be by enough to override this basic accelerator mechanism  How can we be sure that this pattern will play out in the near term? We can't be But the evidence of low capacity utilization and profit compression in many segments of manufacturing gives some concreteness to this model, and reports of companies actually planning to trim their capital outlays or seeking to take out capacity through mergers do give some credibility to the prediction One might even be tempted to argue that the recent upside surprises in investment expenditures reinforce the case for anticipating a moderation going forward because they have further elevated the rate of capital accumulation However, there are a couple of obvious retorts to this assertion First, the mere fact that there have been surprises in investment spending underscores the imprecision of this analysis It's not easy to gauge the desired stocks and the time profile of the adjustment processes Second, the desired stocks can change over time for a variety of reasons Among them are changes in the cost of capital or in household wealth, and in this regard the behavior of the equity markets has repeatedly confounded us in our forecasts    12/22/98  The stock market remains a major wild card in the outlook Heartened at least in part by what has been viewed as a supportive Fed, investors have been willing to stick with equities even as corporate earnings have declined PE ratios have reached very high levels Neither our earnings forecast nor our interest rate forecast would seem to justify a further rise in share prices over the next couple of years, and thus we're expecting that wealth effects will ebb, taking a good deal of the steam out of aggregate demand  The behavior of stocks like eBay and Amazoncom might suggest that we're applying an obsolete paradigm for share valuation But, it may be noted that the market as a whole really hasn't made much further headway on net since the early spring, when the year-on-year profit comparisons began to turn negative We're essentially predicting that share prices will continue to fluctuate around the average level that has prevailed since that time A continuation of crummy earnings and poor returns might provide the basis for a deeper market correction, but we're hesitant to predict it when the market has shown such a capacity for levitation and when we aren't anticipating any monetary policy tightening Indeed, as our selection of alternative simulations in the Greenbook suggested, we wouldn't rule out a further rise in share prices, and another year or two of double-digit increases could trump the reverse accelerator effects that are key to our forecast The market surge of the past three trading days is perhaps a sign in that regard  Finally, a few words about the supply side of our forecast The recent upside surprise in GDP growth does not appear to reflect any unexpected improvement in productivity trends Rather, what we've seen has been consistent with the trend we have been assuming So, going forward, our higher output path has translated into a lower unemployment rate We've raised our inflation forecast, but not quite commensurately Recent news on wages and prices has been favorable, even in the face of tighter labor markets and higher capacity utilization rates than we had anticipated would be prevailing In addition, the prices of oil and other raw materials have fallen out of bed recently, and these lower input costs will be passing through the production pipeline for a while, in the process helping to hold down inflation expectations One might question whether this commodity deflation is an unalloyed blessing in terms of international economic stability, but it is one more timely shock helping to check inflation here  That completes our presentation, Mr Chairman   We try to track their production and delivery plans as closely as  possible, with the help of some inside contacts One of the uncertainties at this point is whether,  indeed, they will be able to make the volume of deliveries to foreign customers that they hoped  to make, because there seem to be financing problems still to be worked out   They have been in inventory We think those inventories are being  reduced in this quarter, and that is part of our forecast There is coherence in our arithmetic In  fact, in the ultimate GDP numbers--when we try to sort through all of this--we can't find the  coherence that we have as we put these numbers together ourselves So ex post, it is very hard to  trace   But, in terms of our forecast, we have taken into account their  production intentions and their delivery patterns   It is potentially significant on a quarter-to-quarter basis I think we  sometimes overestimate the importance of aircraft in total producers' durable expenditures in the  United States, but certainly it can be a significant quarter-to-quarter swing factor   There is a lot of room to maneuver at this point with the data that are  now in hand I would not put 4-1/2 percent out of the range of possibilities They did not have the  benefit of the MTS, though That can be pretty tricky to read We made that effort and it did  chip a bit off the fourth-quarter number Another possibility is that people have not interpreted  the net export figures the same as we did We have one month of data, the first month of the  quarter Does one extrapolate an upside surprise or anticipate an offset? I think Karen's  colleagues scrutinize these data perhaps with greater care than others, but it is still very difficult  to judge whether this component or that component will drop off Finally, on that score, one  needs to look also at whether there are offsets in domestic expenditures Relative to what we had  assumed, the net exports of capital goods were stronger in October than we had anticipated That  means less of the flow of shipments will be going to domestic customers So there was a  significant offset in producers' durable equipment expenditures as we did the adding up But in  the end one is looking at production indicators employment, hours, the industrial production  data, and so on As we balanced these things out, we felt uncomfortable going higher than we  did because there just seemed to be considerable tension We wrote down a relatively low  inventory investment number--much lower, I think, than did many of those outside forecasters  That is a product of this balancing act We had some low October inventory numbers but there is  still a lot of room for November and December to surprise us That was one of the balancing  factors I suspect that if you looked at these other forecasts, you probably would not find    12/22/98 17  inventory investment as low because others didn't feel as constrained as we felt by these  production-side indicators   I guess I feel the fatter tail of this probability distribution is on that side  On the other hand, as I pointed out, there are inconsistencies in some of the information we are  getting It is really hard to determine where all these goods are that supposedly have been  produced Anecdotally, it does not sound right; and our own statistics just do not show it And  that is true over the second half of the year as a whole   In inventories for the time being, I take it   A lot of imported apparel   Mr Chairman, if I could just respond briefly I am not sure I fully  grasp the point that President Broaddus is making I will follow up bilaterally with him to make  sure I have an understanding But just to be clear on the basis of our assumption for the funds  rate, let me say that our default is to assume a stable funds rate unless we see when we run  through our projection that we end up with an outcome that is glaringly at odds with what the  Committee in its discussions and its policy decisions has suggested would be acceptable Having  listened to the discussions at recent meetings, people have basically said they would be very  happy if we had an outcome like that So, I do not have a sense that, with our forecast based on a  stable funds rate assumption, we are giving you something that does not provide a baseline for  discussion Then, obviously, we try to give some indication of what different interest rate paths  might produce So, that is how we approach this I hope that's helpful in some degree, but I will  try to clarify it    12/22/98   That is going to be very difficult to portray because there is a good deal  of judgment involved In addition to the use of the quarterly model, we get input from sector  experts and so on As you know, we have invited Reserve Banks to send staff members--and  they have--to join us during a portion of our forecasting process so that they can get a better  handle on the various steps and the different inputs If your Bank hasn't sent someone recently  or if your staff's memory of what they saw has faded, we certainly invite you to send someone in  the near future I think that is perhaps the best way to understand what goes on   Thank you, Mr Chairman For the benefit of those of  you who didn't get your fill of basketball cliches over the last few days, I  perhaps should characterize the US economy as continuing to hit “nothin’  but net”--rapid expansion and low inflation In any event, as you know,  GDP came in even higher in the fourth quarter than we anticipated at the  last meeting, and we’ve now raised our sights on first-quarter growth the  better part of a percentage point, to about 3½ percent Meanwhile, recent  readings on wages and prices have been even more benign than we  expected Under the circumstances, I guess I’m obliged to explain why we  won’t just get with the new era program and simply extrapolate the good  news--rather than predicting, once again, that the economy will decelerate  appreciably and that inflation will pick up I’ll be brief, just emphasizing a  few key points in the Greenbook   Our basic thesis is still that domestic demand growth will slow  enough over the next several quarters to more than offset a lessening drag  from the external sector The two key elements in that story are by now  familiar--indeed, in danger of becoming quite shopworn   The first is that the stocks of consumer durables, houses, and business  equipment are already growing so rapidly that, absent some deceleration,  they’ll get way out of whack with longer-term income and output trends  The second element is that if share prices continue rising at anything  approaching the pace of the past several years, they’ll get way out of whack  with profit trends Of course, there can be an interaction between the two  elements--a virtuous cycle up to a point, but one that can carry too far on  the basis of unrealistic expectations   So, what are the most recent signals as to whether we are on the verge  of some moderation? Frankly, on the face of it, there aren’t many signs of  slowing as far as household and business investment is concerned Real  expenditures for consumer durables appear to be headed for about a 12  percent annualized gain in the first quarter; residential investment appears     3/30/99 6   to be headed for about a 12 percent gain; and business equipment outlays  appear to be headed for--you guessed it--about a 12 percent gain   But, let me try to put a little spin on these numbers In the case of  business equipment spending, our guess for the first-quarter growth rate is  off considerably from the 17 percent increase last year, and the recent  orders data and other indicators suggest further moderation ahead  Meanwhile, for both consumer durables and residential investment, one can  point to special factors that have boosted activity of late and that might  reasonably be expected to prove transitory   One of these is the intense competition among automakers sparked by  GM’s effort to regain market share The companies are making enough  money on light trucks that they probably can afford to continue this  competition for some time, but it seems unlikely that they would escalate  the pricing battle enough to push sales above the recent elevated pace-­ especially given their capacity constraints More likely, with some demand  having already been pulled forward by incentive programs, sales will fall  this spring   Another special factor is the mortgage-refinancing wave, which is  now receding Pinning down the effects of refinancings on spending hasn’t  proven an easy thing to do, but intuition, anecdote, and some statistical  work suggest that demand has received an extra boost from refinancings  stimulated by lower interest rates last fall   Finally, the further run-up in housing starts in recent months likely  has reflected the efforts of builders to satisfy the backlog of orders that  built up with the surge in demand last year--efforts aided by a mild winter  Going forward, tight supplies of construction workers could make it  difficult to achieve, from where we have been of late, the normal seasonal  pickup in activity But builders may not even want to try, given the recent  hints of peaking demand for homes Consequently, we are projecting a  substantial negative swing in residential investment over the next couple of  quarters   Of course, other components of household demand conceivably could  pick up the slack, if the fundamentals of income and wealth are still  favorable This is where the stock market comes in With some  trepidation, we stuck with our assessment that the bull market has pretty  much run its course We were encouraged in this regard by the  nervousness that has been expressed by market analysts about high  valuations and earnings prospects Time will tell whether the enthusiasm  of breaking the Dow 10,000 barrier will override those concerns As the     3/30/99 7   simulations in the Greenbook indicate, though, it probably would take quite  large further increases in share prices to totally undermine our forecast of  demand deceleration It could happen, but it is far from a certainty   This brings me, in a way, to the supply side of the picture and the  inflation outlook The bull market might be said to need a continuation of  low inflation--and thus no greater threat of substantial Fed tightening--and  strong productivity growth to extend the recent uptick in profits We’ve  become more optimistic on both these scores, but not enough to transform  the picture and lay out a really upbeat scenario   Labor productivity increases in the fourth quarter and, on our  estimate, in the first quarter have been impressive Looking at how the  various relationships in the economy fit together in light of those readings-­ and recognizing that we could be making a mole hill of a pebble--we’ve  tacked on a tenth of a percent per year to our assessment of the average  pace of structural improvement in productivity since 1995 In addition,  considering what seems to be going on with respect to investment and the  apparent unceasing drive for efficiency, we’ve extrapolated that small  increment through 2000   The cumulative effects of this slight change in trend productivity are  great enough to offset most of the effect of our higher GDP path on the  prospective level of the unemployment rate and also to ease somewhat the  apparent squeeze on the markup of prices over trend unit labor costs  Consequently, we’ve been able to carry the recent good news on inflation  through in the forecast Owing to the backup in oil prices, however, the  picture is still one of a noticeable rise in headline inflation over the coming  months By this summer, we’ll probably be looking at year-on-year CPI  increments in the 2s, once again   It is, of course, arguable that the latest productivity numbers are a sign  that we’re entering a period of even better performance than we’ve  anticipated If so, that’s clearly a good thing But, if it means that the  demand for capital goods is stronger, it could reinforce the assessment in  our baseline forecast that interest rates probably will have to be raised at  some point to maintain economic stability   Karen will now offer an update on some of the key external influences  in the outlook    Well, our forecast for real compensation in terms of the   employment cost index is greater than 2 percent over 1999-2000 when measured against   product prices--for example, nonfarm business prices And I think that is the more   appropriate metric to look at in this context It is more consistent with thinking about the   shares going to labor and to capital It also makes more sense of what we saw in 1998   when we had not only a tight but a tightening labor market So, that is what we have   been focusing on and I think our forecast makes reasonable sense in that regard There   are still questions, too, about what the nominal wage might do and I think we tried to be   quite clear--for example, in the Chart Show last time--about the uncertainties that   surround that aspect of the forecast and the different models one can apply But in terms   of real wages, I think we have fairly sensible numbers    Let me touch briefly on another aspect of your question There   is a school of thought--John Makin comes to mind, for example--arguing recently that an   improvement in the economies of Japan and some other Asian countries will have   negative effects for the United States The view is that demand abroad will reduce the   supply of savings--which as you indicated has been flowing readily into the United States   because we appear to be a safe haven or an area with fast improving technology--and that   will exert general upward pressure on interest rates, which will be damaging It is rather   hard for me to get my arms around the thought that better economic performance in the   rest of the world is a detriment to the United States But I suppose when one thinks about   1998 and the shocks that we’ve had and the beneficial effects in our financial markets,   the argument is that the accommodation that in a sense the Fed provided actually added   to aggregate demand and pushed the unemployment rate perhaps below sustainable   levels There might be something to the view that we have to give that back at some   point if we have overshot sustainable levels of resource utilization That is another   version of the worry about the reversal of the “supply shocks” that we have been   experiencing and how we might have to cope with that    I’m sorry, I’m not sure I caught the last part of your question I   was thinking about answering the first part and I lost the thread on the last part    The latter question is extremely difficult to answer, as is the first   one There are questions of definitions here What do we mean by “new economy” or   “new era” and so on?  I don’t think that’s easy to pin down In many accounts it is   something that rejects all the known rules of economic behavior, or what we thought   were known rules In other views, as I suggested in a briefing some time back, it may be   that what we need isn’t necessarily a new paradigm but simply some new parameters   We know that productivity historically has not grown at the same rate in all eras We   know that the composition of the workforce and other factors can affect the natural rate   of unemployment So we are always in search of what the current values of those   parameters are As we have gained experience with how the economy is operating, what   we have been trying to do is to put those numbers into better alignment with the facts   And that is what we have been doing over the past few years as we have seen better   productivity performance than we thought could be reconciled with a continuation of the     3/30/99 14   weak trend we had seen in the post-1973 era We could also see that investment was at a   very high level, producing considerable capital deepening That emboldened us to move   apart from most of the pack and raise our estimates of productivity trend And as we   looked at the experience of the past year or so in our latest forecast round--and we looked   at all the various behavioral relations in the economy--we once again thought that edging   up that productivity trend estimate a bit further was warranted If we were to go to the   new era concept, I think we would probably start by saying that resource utilization   levels have absolutely no influence on inflation That seems to be one of the tenets It is   not clear what does determine the rate of inflation in this new paradigm, but the new era   tenet certainly seems to be rejected by most people And it is not part of our forecast; we   haven’t incorporated that We basically just jiggled the parameters of a fairly   conventional model   Now, if we had knocked a couple of tenths off the productivity trend, the   effects would depend on where we started and whether we sensed that trend was   perceived by people in the real world or not I guess I’d have to say that the outlook for   inflation, if we reached back a couple of years and changed this productivity trend, would   deteriorate fairly rapidly relative to our baseline To the extent that we give any weight   to the markup over trend unit labor cost, which is a fairly conventional model of price   determination--and I must say we don’t give it the preponderance of weight--we would   find that the markup was being squeezed considerably over the past few years with a 17   percent productivity trend And that would have negative implications going forward,   especially in the tight markets that we have; firms would be trying to restore their   markups, and the price pressures would show up fairly promptly We’re talking tenths in   terms of the differences but, given that we already have an upward tilt, it would perhaps   make a material difference in our perception of the upturn in inflation    Not as much as we’d like We’ve actually been thinking about   examining the data on some aspects of that One assertion that has been made is that   wages are being held down because manufacturing has been weak and thus   manufacturing wages haven’t been rising, and that might be a sort of pattern-setting   element in the picture We don’t find any systematic relationship over time in that   regard It is an interesting hypothesis but not one for which we have been able to find   confirmation in the data   It is possible to look at the movements of workers One question I raised was   whether this trend in manufacturing employment could be providing some relief in the   construction industry People who could not get jobs on assembly lines or had lost jobs   on assembly lines might be filling the gap there    Well, they are not always similar; the skilled construction   worker has special skills that someone who has worked at a steel plant doesn’t   necessarily have But in terms of the opportunities available, a relatively low skilled   construction job might be attractive as opposed to working at McDonalds At this point   we have looked at this hypothesis in only a limited way and we haven’t found much   confirmation of it--statistical or anecdotal     3/30/99 16   I’m really not sure precisely what has happened on unemployment in   manufacturing; I don’t have the data in front of me Those are shaky numbers because   the survey asks what a person’s last job was, and a laid-off manufacturing worker could   have been employed elsewhere after he lost his manufacturing job Those data would be   one place to look, and perhaps I should, to see if there is evidence that idled   manufacturing workers are still lingering out there among the unemployed My suspicion   is that the decline in manufacturing employment hasn’t been going on long enough that   these people have totally abandoned their hopes of getting another manufacturing job   Unfortunately, in our forecast manufacturing does not grow rapidly enough to generate   any increases in employment While trade is improving, we really are going to be   generating little, if any, additional employment in manufacturing over the forecast period    Is that a short person joke?  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman The April Consumer Price  Index, published the day after we printed the Greenbook, obviously is  occupying center stage in the financial markets and I would guess that it’s  a pretty prominent question mark for many of you today But, before  getting into the nuts and bolts of that report and our interpretation, I’d like  to say a few words about the broader aggregate demand and supply  setting   First, on the demand side, the picture is still one of strength overall  We think, however, that the first-quarter increase in real domestic final  purchases of 7 percent greatly overstates the underlying trends A variety  of transitory factors combined to boost outlays the dip in interest rates last  fall, since reversed; the stepped-up incentives for auto-buyers, as GM  drove to restore its market share; the abnormally mild winter weather; and  so on Given those considerations, it’s quite reasonable to anticipate a  noticeable slackening of expenditure growth this quarter   And the latest retail sales figures support that assessment--although  we didn’t realize it fully when we finished our forecast last Thursday The  surprisingly large increase in goods prices in Friday’s CPI report implied  that the softening in real spending was even more marked last month than  we had thought on the basis of the nominal retail sales data If we’re right,  real PCE growth in the current quarter will be somewhere in the  neighborhood of 4 percent, at an annual rate--scarcely a weak number, but  one that would be at the low end of the range of recent quarters   Another area of deceleration in our forecast for the second quarter is  residential investment Our thesis has been that, although the demand for  homes probably hasn’t fallen off much, builders would find it difficult-­ perhaps practically impossible--to maintain the seasonally adjusted level  of starts they recorded during the late fall and winter months This  morning’s report is consistent with that notion Actually, single-family  starts fell more than we anticipated, 11 percent; but, as we thought last  month, the single-family permits figures may be telling a more accurate  story, having fallen about 4½ percent in March and another 3 percent in  April     5/18/99 12   The final major element of deceleration in spending this quarter is  state and local purchases--especially outlays for construction In this case,  we still have no useful data beyond March, but it just doesn’t seem  plausible to extrapolate the surge that we saw this winter Unusually  favorable weather almost certainly helped move building ahead of  schedule, and some reversion to trend is to be expected in the near term  This is not to deny that the underlying trend in public construction could  be relatively steep at this time Among other things, the transportation bill  passed last year is helping to spur activity, and states and localities have  been experiencing a bit of a wealth effect themselves, as their revenues  reflect, directly or indirectly, the capital gains taxpayers have been  enjoying   The wealth effect remains central to our projection of domestic  demand and economic activity through next year To be sure, we believe  that waning accelerator effects should be a moderating force with respect  to houses, consumer durables, and business capital goods--and, as we  noted in the Greenbook, one can discern some hints of this already in  various categories of expenditure But, if the stock market continues to  soar, consumers’ perceptions of their permanent income will rise and so  too will businesses’ perceptions of their sales prospects; target levels of  household and business investment goods will move still higher So, the  fact that we’ve anticipated that the market will peak soon is crucial to our  prediction that GDP growth will moderate over the coming year   As it is, the run-up in stock prices last month prompted us to raise our  forecast of demand growth during the next several quarters However, this  has shown through to output rather than to prices because of the more  favorable supply-side environment we are now projecting Perhaps most  notably, we’ve raised our sights on the prospects for gains in labor  productivity, and that has permitted us to raise projected output without  commensurate increases in pressures on labor markets   Our reassessment of the productivity outlook is yet one more in a  sequence of adjustments we’ve made on the basis of incoming data over  the past few years We’d prefer to rely on deep analytical insights, but the  fact is that the behavior of productivity is not well understood, let alone  readily predictable; if it were otherwise, economists wouldn’t still be  scratching their heads over the post-1973 deterioration in the trend of  economic growth Consequently, we’ve had to feel our way on this   In our view, the pickup in output per hour over the past year or so has  been greater than is likely attributable simply to the rapid growth of  output--the so-called “cyclical” influence Firms do seem to be achieving  substantial structural gains in efficiency through technological     5/18/99 13   innovations, investments in more and better equipment, improved  information management, and reorganization of production and  distribution processes Given the continuing high level of investment and  what we hear from business people about their efforts to improve  productivity, there doesn’t appear to be any reason to anticipate that these  gains will fall off markedly in the near term--apart from some tendency for  reductions in worker hours to lag those in output as the rate of GDP  expansion slows And even that cyclical element might be weaker than in  the past, given the heavier use of contingent workers and the pressures on  executives to deliver strong earnings quarter after quarter--except, I  suppose, in the dot-com sector So, putting this all together, we’ve added  several tenths to the rate of increase in output per hour through the year  2000   Obviously, the outlook for productivity is a consideration in the near- term prospects for inflation Among other things, the recent surge in  productivity has helped boost profit margins and thereby given firms more  room to compete for market share without forgoing acceptable rates of  return on equity Moreover, the compensation part of the unit labor cost  ratio is also looking more favorable Even taking the first-quarter ECI  with a large grain of salt, we now have some evidence that, perhaps in part  because of a lagged response to the lower price increases of the past  couple of years, nominal pay gains are not moving up--despite a tight  labor market These considerations encouraged us to take a smidgen off  our core inflation forecast--as did the surprisingly low price numbers  through March But, especially with oil prices and other “special factors”  already, or expected soon to be, taking a turn for the worse, we’ve  maintained our view that an unemployment rate in the low 4s will in time  prove incompatible with stable or declining inflation The question is  whether the four-tenths leap in the April core CPI is telling us that the day  of reckoning actually has arrived   We’re inclined to be fairly sanguine on this score at this point In  part, this is simply because what we hear from businesses doesn’t suggest  that there’s been anything approaching a sea change in the pricing  environment But on the statistical side, while it’s almost always possible  to slice and dice these data to find some residual that fits your priors, we  think there are elements in the April CPI report that provide at least some  grounds for skepticism that the burst in the core index is truly a sign that  the trend of inflation has now turned upward For example, the sizable  increase in apparel prices merely reversed surprisingly large declines in  the first quarter; we expected an offsetting firming of prices somewhere  along the line, and we may simply have missed the timing And the  rebound in tobacco prices after some discounting in March probably is  telling us little about fundamental macro imbalances in the economy  Incidentally, it’s perhaps worth noting that, setting aside tobacco prices,     5/18/99 14   which have risen 33 percent since last April, the twelve-month change in  the core CPI is the same as it was a year ago, even after we add back in the  effects of the technical changes in the index   All that said, though, we didn’t anticipate the outsized April increase  and we wouldn’t feel comfortable ignoring it If we were redoing our  projections now, we’d tack a tenth or two onto our inflation projections for  1999 and 2000 This would not really alter the basic conclusion that we,  and now many bond market commentators, have reached that the best  news on inflation is behind us and that prices will most likely tend to  accelerate over time unless domestic demand softens considerably or we  experience additional fortuitous external shocks   Given that we cannot divine those shocks, we’ve pointed to the likely  need for some monetary policy tightening aimed at reining in aggregate  demand The fixed-income markets have been firming on their own in  recent weeks--especially in the case of Treasury securities But it isn’t  clear that this is wholly a real tightening, as opposed to an escalation of  inflation premiums Moreover, many lower quality corporate bond issuers  have seen rates fall and their market access improve of late, and the stock  market has weathered the negative news of recent days in remarkably  good fashion Barring further adverse news, we can easily see stock and  bond prices turning back up in the coming weeks Thus, we don’t believe  that the markets alone can be relied upon to do the work of curbing the  financial support for unsustainable levels of aggregate demand    I don’t have any additional detail beyond the knowledge that total   starts were down something under 3 percent in April    Yes But, given that the level of starts looks low relative to   permits at this point, I suspect that in reality we probably did not have an unadjusted   decline in permits That is a rough judgment at this point and I don’t have the additional   data to refine that immediately    I don’t have that information     5/18/99 15    Yes, we do    I think the seasonals do continue to move in that direction to some   degree I have those numbers with me, so let me check Well, actually, the seasonal   factor in May is about the same as in April and then June is the low point for the seasonal   factor It is just a little lower We have had the major swing in the seasonal factors in the   last two months    It’s basically February to April The surge starts in February, but   from January to April is the story    On the first question, part of the increase in the productivity   growth that we have in our forecast reflects the stronger demand trends and the cyclical   component I would say that a little more than half, roughly, of the increase in   productivity growth going forward is attributable to the more positive view we have of   the structural improvements in productivity The second question is obviously very   important if one is in the business of making 10-year budget forecasts or 75-year social   security forecasts It is not a totally uninteresting question for us, either, even with our   shorter time frame, in part because one would want to have a sense of what expectations     5/18/99 16   might be and what would be built into peoples’ permanent income views If people felt   that we were just experiencing a brief period of prosperity with these huge productivity   gains, they might behave differently than if they viewed this as a new era, as it were, that   will last decades I think in a sense the stock market is probably behaving as if it is a new   era That is the way one can best understand the longer-term profit forecasts and so on   So, while we prefer to be noncommittal, it appears that what is going on in the economy   may be more reflective of an extrapolation of the kind of performance we built into the   forecast, if not a better one I can easily see this productivity performance not persisting   I can also see this as being a transition phase into a sustained period of more rapid   growth After all, we have had periods of more than decades in duration in which   productivity growth has averaged 3 percent The numbers we are working with are in   line with the very long-term trends in the United States So we are not looking at a   radically high productivity advance here in a broader historical context    Some of this reflects changes in measurement--the introduction of   new weighting that has altered the history by a few tenths But, as we look at it, we also   had a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s when in particular capital was shallowing,   and the low levels of investment did not help to boost productivity in that period In the   mid-1990s and since then, we have seen that change considerably So there are factors   that are readily identifiable It isn’t possible to pin down what contribution investment is   making, but the normal kinds of calculations one can do suggest that investment has been   a significant element in boosting productivity improvement in recent years On top of   that we do seem to be getting some extra productivity increase, so-called multifactor   productivity gains All that fits with one’s sense of what has been going on in the   business sector--that firms have been taking advantage of new technologies, have   reorganized the way they do things, and so on It has not been just the brute force   addition of capital goods that has promoted this improvement We are extrapolating this   out for a limited time here, given our projection period    If the locus of the uncertainty is productivity, I’m not sure that we   are more uncertain about it now than we were three years ago or six years ago I think   there has always been a considerable band of uncertainty around the prospects for   productivity We were puzzled by why productivity gains were so low for many years I   guess I don’t feel any more uncomfortable on that score The only way I feel   uncomfortable is that, in a sense, we are moving a bit beyond the pack But I think others   are moving up their assessments of productivity trends, too, as they overcome the basic   scientific skepticism reflected in the often heard statement that this recent experience   isn’t yet a statistically significant deviation from the previous trends    This is an area where many forecasters have been reluctant to take   a position, and thus it probably hasn’t shown up in their forecasts I know that the   National Association of Business Economists just completed a poll of their members, and   they indicated that they expected about a ¼ percent addition to third-quarter GDP growth   and a ½ percent addition in the fourth quarter But there is still some reluctance, given   the lack of hard information, to go out on a limb and write down a number that will stick   out in any way Now, I might note that the latest forecast by Goldman Sachs, which I   just received yesterday, looked somewhat like our forecast They have a considerable   increase in inventory investment in the fourth quarter, driving GDP growth up to about 4   percent and then a drop-back in inventory investment in the first quarter, though not to a   very low level, which gets their first-quarter GDP down to around zero I know from   having talked with their economists that their security analysts are hearing reports from     5/18/99 18   various companies that firms are planning to do some precautionary stock building It is   not across the board, but they are hearing this and I think gradually economists are   probably building something into their forecasts But this is an area of enormous   uncertainty It is very difficult to quantify What we have in our forecast is a very small   increase in the number of days’ supply; in fact, it isn’t even a day’s supply So there is a   lot of room to maneuver here if people begin to get worried In some sense this is just   flagging the fact that something may happen There probably is going to be some   turbulence in the data I am afraid we are going to have a hard time sorting out the   underlying trends late this year and early next year    I would say that we have some reasonable anchors for our   assessment of capacity utilization The series is periodically benchmarked to Census data   in which companies report what they perceive to be their level of capacity utilization   based on a given definition That definition has been uniform over time, so we think we   have a consistent time series The National Association of Purchasing Managers semi-  annually asks its members to report on what they believe their capacity utilization to be   It usually isn’t exactly our number But the two series track together over time, and the     5/18/99 19   readings through the end of last year still looked reasonably aligned We should get   another reading in a few weeks in the midyear survey of the purchasing managers   Finally, if one looks at vendor performance, which historically has been pretty   well correlated with capacity utilization, we don’t see anything to suggest that we are far   off the mark One additional point is that there is nothing in the behavior of producer   prices that is signaling that the capacity utilization numbers are leading us astray Now,   one might wonder--given a world in which many goods are available overseas and have   relatively low transportation costs and where plants may have the flexibility to adjust   their production on a tighter schedule and so on--whether the supply curve has precisely   the same slope in the short run that it used to have That is an interesting analytical   question, which we need to continue to explore But in terms of the reading on capacity   use at this point, I don’t think we are any further off now than we have been in the past in   judging that    That is true of the estimation of capacity utilization up to a point     5/18/99 20    Then we look at investments and so on to judge what capacity   growth would be going forward I think the question they are asked to answer is what is   their capacity utilization rate given a normal operation of their plants, not allowing for   additions of extra shifts and those sorts of things It is a question that is consistent over   time So whatever it is measuring, it is measuring it on a reasonably stable basis Given   all the other pieces of information, I don’t see anything that seems particularly odd    They are not reporting that they have the same capacity as before   nor that they are using the same amounts as before, but the question they are responding   to is consistent So, conceptually what they are trying to measure is consistent over time   As I said, I just don’t see anything that looks particularly odd in the variables that we   would expect to respond to capacity utilization    The other point to raise is one that the Chairman reiterated in a   speech recently And that is, if you see incipient labor cost pressures, how readily can   you adjust the productive capacity of your plant?  How quickly can you purchase and   install capital goods?  That is another element that one would have to think about in terms   of the dynamics going forward     5/18/99 21   I might just respond to the Chairman’s earlier question on permits My colleague   handed me the press release, which I didn’t have with me earlier The permits for single-  family homes in April were the same as they were in March; the drop was in multifamily   permits    Yes, unadjusted    Need I say more?  [Laughter] I wish I could! We are flying blind   again Maybe we are overly influenced by our experience with snowstorms in   Washington DC when everybody runs out and buys milk and toilet paper and cleans off   the shelves of the grocery stores I think we should expect, even if we don’t get all kinds   of dramatic Y2K programs on television and scary stories on talk radio, that people are   going to be concerned Polls suggest that if people are prompted to think about the Y2K   issue, they say “Yes, we will take some precautions” So the notion is that people will   buy some extra food and those who are dependent on prescription drugs will try to refill   their prescriptions early so they don’t have to worry about computer glitches creating a   problem in early 2000 There are various things I think people will want to buy, figuring   that they will just use them up in January if they don’t need them over the year-end   period We also hear stories about people planning to buy guns and ammunition,   dehydrated food, electrical generators, and wood burning stoves These things are   happening The question is whether they are economically meaningful But some little   movement at the end of the year seems inevitable    From what I understand about the thorough preparations that   people are making at the Federal Reserve Board, I suspect we would be able to meet here   even on January 2nd if we wanted to    We have allowed for that on a very limited scale in both cases    It is obviously very difficult and it is a judgment call But I think   the kind of situation you are describing, though complicated, is one reason to anticipate   that at least some companies will hire additional workers You say companies are   working beyond sustainable levels of labor utilization, but you also say they are   absolutely determined not to add workers In other cases, I think people are working very   hard, and firms would like to add workers but are finding it difficult to do so in a very   tight labor market For the latter group, we would anticipate that, even if business begins     5/18/99 23   to flatten out, some of these firms will follow through on their hiring plans to reach a   more comfortable position    And that would be a source of a cyclical weakening in   productivity On the other hand, there is still obviously a very strong culture of cost   control--that may be your first group--and managers will do absolutely anything they can   do to keep their labor force to an absolute minimum  And where they use temps and   other contingent workers, those people will probably find their hours or employment   reduced fairly rapidly So I think there is a balance in this prospect    Thank you, Mr Chairman   At first blush, it might seem odd that in this edition of the Greenbook  we’d be talking about heightened inflation risks and raising the assumed  fed funds path in our baseline forecast  After all, real GDP growth was  surprisingly weak in the second quarter, and the core CPI increased only  a tenth-and-a-half per month on average in June and July   Given that you’ve all perused the text, I’m sure that you appreciate  the compelling logic that lay behind our forecast revisions! [Laughter]  But, just for the record, Karen and I shall highlight for you some of the  key considerations Because a significant part of the explanation comes  from the international side--and because some interesting developments  have occurred in that sphere in the post-Greenbook publication period-­ Karen will lead off    Even with the revision to net exports, the biggest surprise  in the second-quarter GDP picture, relative to our last projection, still is  the very low rate of inventory accumulation A forecaster’s fairly typical  response to such a surprise, especially when it occurs against a backdrop  of solid final demand, would be to assume that the shortfall will translate  into additional impetus to subsequent output growth, as firms seek to  bring their stocks back into normal alignment with expected sales  Unfortunately, however, one must judge just what the normal alignment  is; and that is something that can shift over time in response, among other  things, to changes in price expectations or interest rates, or structural  improvements in “supply-chain management”   In the present case, the persistent--and now sizable--decline in the  aggregate inventory/sales ratio in recent quarters and the lack of evidence  that this is causing any discomfort have caused us to reassess our  judgment about firms’ objectives for stocks In essence, we’re putting  considerable weight on the structural improvement story and,  consequently, we’re not looking for any meaningful rebound in the stock- sales ratio But, on the assumption that firms will not seek still lower  ratios in the near future, we still get a step-up in inventory investment that  makes a positive contribution to GDP growth similar to what we had in  our previous forecast   So, in addressing the question of where our heightened inflation risk  came from, inventories are not the answer Nor, of course, is it from  recent domestic financial market developments Indeed, though we’d  been expecting that the markets would be afflicted with Y2K anxieties,  we didn’t anticipate that the fears would exert the force they apparently  have so far before the end of the year To be sure, the recent backup in  interest rates didn’t arise solely because of anticipated Y2K pressures;  concerns about monetary policy tightening contributed as well But it  seems quite clear, as has already been noted this morning, that the  concern that market liquidity would dry up later this year gave rise to  pressures on an array of rate spreads for which there were not the  arbitrage resources available to offset fully     8/24/99 39   The further rise in longer-term interest rates--especially those on  home mortgages--should exert some additional restraining force on  domestic demand in the coming months But we anticipate that the  spread widening, which already has reversed some this month, will  reverse more fully once we’ve negotiated the century date change   This is one reason we’ve assumed another 50 basis points of  tightening by next spring All else equal, if the System failed to validate  the market’s expectation of at least that much firming in short rates, the  tendency probably would be for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates  to drop back even more than we’ve anticipated Moreover, the absence  of tightening could well provide the all-clear signal that would help the  stock market to extend its uptrend The rally of the past few days, as the  markets became a little more sanguine about Fed policy, I think  underscores that risk   The final point I’d make on the domestic demand side is that the  outlook for the federal budget has turned a tad more stimulative for the  coming quarters, with the addition of about $20 billion of outlays for the  coming fiscal year that was not anticipated in our previous projection  Obviously, this amount isn’t a big deal in a $9 trillion economy, but it  comes on top of the additional impetus expected from export demand   So, on balance, aggregate demand growth prospects--even with a  notch more nominal monetary tightening--look to us to be at least as  strong for the coming year or so as they did at the time of the last  meeting But our inflation concerns stem also from the supply side,  where there are indications that cost pressures are mounting to a greater  degree than we’d perceived before All the recent wage readings have  surpassed our expectations, some by quite substantial margins  Admittedly, all the measures have their limitations as representations of  the cost elements that might be influencing short-run pricing behavior,  but it would seem wrong to discount them entirely as factors that could  contribute to larger increases in the prices of goods and services   In addition, recent news on crude and intermediate materials prices  has been disappointing, with the increases in the core PPI measures as  well as in oil prices pointing to more pipeline inflation We don’t expect  that either of these will provide a major jolt to core inflation, but the  picture is less favorable at this point than we thought it would be The  prospect that the recent weakness of the dollar will foster an earlier  upturn in non-oil import prices reinforces that concern   All told, then, we felt that a modest elevation of our wage and price  inflation forecasts was appropriate, and the 25 basis points of additional  fed funds increase that we tacked on did little more than keep the real     8/24/99 40   short-term interest rate path as high as it was last time Clearly, if the  recent sinking spell of the dollar continues, the alternative 10 percent  depreciation simulation in the Greenbook potentially comes into play,  and the inflation problem could be significantly intensified   We didn’t see that as the most likely outcome, but as a quite clear risk  that is worthy of your attention To put it in terms of an overused fairy  tale analogy, it could well be that Goldilocks, the international investor,  has pretty much gotten her fill of US dollar porridge--be it hot, cold, or  just right--and has begun to develop an appetite for some Kobe beef or  Euro truffles   That concludes our prepared remarks, Mr Chairman    Drywall and some other construction supplies certainly would be the   exception    I don’t think one can ever have confidence in an inventory forecast, and   I certainly don’t at this moment We are conscious of some areas in which it is likely that   firms would want to build stocks I’m not sure that’s the case in retailing on a broad front,   but it certainly would be true in many areas of building supplies There are still industries,     8/24/99 41   by all reports, with more inventories than firms would like to have--construction equipment,   farm equipment, chemicals still to some degree, and so on Our sense is that if there are   cases where inventories are leaner than desired, it is not a pervasive phenomenon If one   looks at survey evidence--for example, the purchasing managers’ reports on perceptions of   customer inventories--nothing has happened recently to suggest that firms in general have   been greatly surprised by the strength of sales and that their inventories have been depleted   beyond levels they would be happy to live with Going forward, we are expecting a   substantial step-up in inventory accumulation, augmented over the remainder of this year by   some Y2K hoarding So we do have a substantial contribution to GDP growth from   inventory investment over the next several months We are hopeful that with the   cooperation of the Reserve Bank research staffs we will be able to come up with a little   more concrete notion of just how big the Y2K inventory hoarding effort will be, and we will   report on that before the next meeting That’s certainly a wild card in the picture    I think we’d edge above the 3 percent mark in core inflation on the   assumption that the unemployment rate will be drifting up ever so slightly as we move   through 2001    We have some bits and pieces of information from various censuses and   some notion about what the reports from the unemployment insurance system are suggesting   about revisions to wage and salary income On both sides of the ledger, the information   points to upward revisions in the level of GDP this year I should caution though that this is   fragmentary  There will also be some changes in the scope of GDP, in a sense, as they     8/24/99 42   introduce computer software; what the year-to-year growth pattern will be there, one cannot   be sure Even on the compensation side, we really only have information about one very   important component of compensation--wage and salary income There is still the   possibility that other labor income could be revised in ways that would alter the picture   Based on what we know, we’d anticipate that we are not talking about more than a couple of   tenths on the current definition of GDP in terms of what the higher trend output growth   might have been over recent years That’s sort of the upside limit based on the fragmentary   information we have at this point    Thank you, Mr Chairman   As we noted in the Greenbook, the information received since the last  meeting has strongly confirmed the notion that the low GDP growth reported for the  second quarter grossly overstated any moderating tendencies in the economic  expansion Indeed, the data available as of last Wednesday persuaded us to raise our  sights regarding the pace of output growth over the second half--bringing us back up  to the 37 percent Q4/Q4 total that we discussed in the midyear Chart Show   The incoming statistical data and the anecdotal evidence found in the  Beigebook paint a fairly consistent picture of robust private domestic demand in  recent months Consumer spending has continued to rise at a fairly brisk pace, with  the advance of light vehicle sales to around the 17 million unit mark underscoring  that households remain confident enough to tap into their accumulated assets or  borrow to finance their purchases   The same positive fundamentals seem to have buoyed the residential real  estate market well into the summer in the face of higher mortgage rates The initial  estimate of August new home sales that was released late last week and showed  them rising monotonically since the spring, likely was biased upward by some  technical problems But, that said, it’s our assessment that demand for homes will     10/5/99 8   be subsiding only gently over the remainder of the year and that a backlog of  projects will help to sustain building activity   The biggest surprise of the third quarter was the apparent acceleration of  business fixed investment I say “apparent” because there are considerable gaps in  the source data in hand, and these numbers can be quite erratic But the strength of  the computer and communications equipment industries seems pretty clear, and  shipments from that sector likely paced a large increase in overall equipment  spending   Finally, on the private spending side, the fragmentary evidence suggests that  inventory investment picked up this summer from the very low pace of the second  quarter Still, by all reports, stocks remain comfortable, if not lean, overall, leaving  room for further appreciable accumulation in the coming months   All told, then, there’s no reason to doubt that domestic demand has retained  substantial positive momentum into the fall Moreover, as Karen will be discussing,  improving foreign economies are giving an increasing lift to our export sales  Though some of the demand in the economy is leaking abroad in a very steep rise in  imports, there’s enough left over to this point to provide ample impetus to domestic  production   Indeed, under the circumstances, one might reasonably ask whether our  projection of a slackening in the pace of expansion in the coming year, with only a  little further policy tightening, is realistic   In responding to that question, I want to begin by noting that, as impressive as  the economy’s strength has been of late, it does appear that the expansion actually  may already have moderated somewhat this year On our estimate, real GDP  growth thus far this year has been about 3½ percent, at an annual rate, versus the 4¼  percent increase registered in 1998 as a whole Granted, this is a thin reed  statistically--perhaps especially on the eve of a major revision of the national  income accounts--but it’s certainly not at odds with our longstanding expectation of  deceleration   Furthermore, a little of the strength in demand we’ve observed lately could be  a Y2K phenomenon, and thus inherently transitory We highlighted in the  Greenbook our hunch that the recent surge in computer sales was in part simply a  more exaggerated version of the story of information system remediation and then  lock-down than we previously had allowed for Likewise, it’s also possible that the  economy is already beginning to feel the effects of Y2K-inspired precautionary  stocking by households and businesses   That said, I wouldn’t push either of those points very far And I’d give at  least as much consideration to what may be one of the major upside risks to our  forecast of moderating aggregate demand in the intermediate term As we’ve  emphasized, that forecast hinges importantly on the flat path for equity prices that     10/5/99 9   we have anticipated To be sure, past, and what we have assumed to be prospective,  increases in interest rates imply some restraint on activity going forward However,  that restraint--occurring against a backdrop of a depreciating dollar, a rebounding  world economy, and a somewhat more expansive fiscal policy--doesn’t seem great  enough to outweigh the impetus to demand that would be supplied by a resumption  of a stock market rise even remotely resembling the average performance of the past  few years   As we indicated in the Greenbook, we can see a rational basis for anticipating  an even weaker market than we’ve built into our forecast, but we’ve said the same in  the past, only to be trampled by the bulls of Wall Street From a policy standpoint,  it would seem a central issue whether you want to bet on this recent correction being  a major break-point in the market trend, or whether you will want to take the  initiative yourselves to impose some added restraint on demand   Obviously, there would be no reason to worry about restraining demand if it  weren’t for the danger of an unsatisfactory inflation outcome In our forecast, that  danger is manifest However, a forecast is a forecast; it’s not a fact And the facts  are ambiguous at this point The broadest measures of goods and services inflation  have picked up this year, but if one parses the indexes, the story is the sharp reversal  of oil prices Indeed, some measures of “core inflation” have even slowed--for  example, the CPI excluding food and energy   One must of course exercise some caution in engaging in such slicing and  dicing in the effort to assess the underlying trends It usually makes sense to try to  filter out the noise in short-term movements in indexes like the overall CPI that  stems from erratic elements like energy prices; but this becomes an increasingly  risky approach when you do it over ever-lengthening time spans At some point,  you have to take the overall price measures as the better indication of the macro  phenomenon of inflation   Put differently, over time the movements in energy prices influence those of  other prices--either through their effect on production and distribution costs or as a  factor influencing wages In this regard, last year’s sharp drop in oil prices probably  contributed significantly to this year’s favorable wage and price performance, and  this year’s even sharper run-up in oil prices is likely to leave its mark on wages and  core prices in coming quarters   We can already see some of that effect in the behavior of intermediate  materials prices The PPI for core intermediate materials has risen considerably in  recent months and the September jump in the NAPM index of prices paid probably  bodes ill for the PPI measure in the near term   Items for which petroleum is an important input have played a significant part  in this surge  But oil isn’t the only factor Another is the strengthening of foreign  economies and the peaking of the dollar on exchange markets These have brought  a cessation of the declines in core non-oil import prices that we enjoyed in 1998 and     10/5/99 10   early 1999 This undoubtedly has contributed to the pickup in “pipeline” inflation  If our expectations about foreign growth and the dollar prove correct, one can  anticipate a further lessening of the disinflationary force from the external sector   That still leaves the crucial questions of productivity and compensation  Recent productivity developments have been pretty much in line with what we  would expect, given the strength of output and our basic assumptions about the  “trend” of output per hour On the other hand, they cannot be said to rule out a still  more optimistic view that structural improvements in efficiency are in an ongoing  escalation, which might translate into a temporarily more favorable trade-off  between unemployment and inflation  This is one of the issues that we shall have to  review carefully when we get the revised NIPA data at the end of the month   As regards pay rates, the most recent average hourly earnings figures have  shown no intensification of wage inflation--quite the contrary But there have been  some disturbing signs as well On the benefits side, it’s becoming increasingly clear  that health insurance premiums are in a substantial acceleration And the recent auto  agreements, coming on the heels of the Boeing settlement, suggest that labor has  gained some bargaining power in a tight economy With Congress seemingly  headed for an agreement to raise the minimum wage next year and this year’s higher  consumer price inflation likely to be showing through in pay decisions, there is in  our view a likelihood that nominal compensation will accelerate   Thus, though there clearly are many interesting things going on in terms of  technological innovations and other changes in the business environment, under the  present circumstances we think the odds favor an upward drift in inflation over our  projection period    Mr Chairman, could I make a minor suggestion?    You referred to the firming of conditions in our financial markets “over   recent months,” and there’s been much discussion about the slight easing recently So if you   changed that to “over the course of the year” or something like that, the wording might accord   better with the facts    Throw them in the middle of the table!   SPEAKER(?) Pass them to me    Mr Chairman, Karen Johnson is going to lead off our remarks, but let   me just mention to the Committee that we released industrial production data this morning--I   trust a few minutes ago We failed to put a copy of the release in front of you, so let me just tell   you about it There were some small net revisions to the data for August and September that left   September IP down 01 percent instead of the 03 percent decline that was published previously   And the October increase in industrial production was 07 percent  In manufacturing we had a   01 percent increase in September, also an upward revision, and 06 percent in October I think   these numbers are significantly above market expectations, so perhaps those of you with   electronic gadgets can see whether there has been any market reaction    I’m not sure whether that’s good news or not    I think it’s pretty clear that, even gauged with our re-calibrated  GDP thermometer, the economy has continued to run hot in recent months The  bigger issue right now would seem to be whether its temperature has reached the  inflationary flash point The recent indications have been mixed on that score, but  as you know, we aren’t very optimistic We see underlying price trends moving in  an inflationary direction, even as demand growth slows a bit from the recent pace   In that regard, we noted in the Greenbook that there have been some signs of  moderation in the expansion of household spending since midyear However, the  news received in recent days has taken a bit of the edge off those signs Friday’s  report on October retail sales showed a 04 percent gain at the so-called “control”  category of stores That isn’t an especially large gain, but it’s more than the chain  store figures and anecdotal news had led us to expect And what makes the  surprise still more disquieting is the fact that the early results of the Michigan  SRC survey point to a considerable resurgence in sentiment this month   Of course, PCE is not the only component of domestic spending for which  ongoing moderation is less than assured In the housing market, the rise in  interest rates this year appears finally to have taken some of the wind out of  builders’ sails However, with consumer confidence seemingly so strong and  mortgage rates having slipped back some in recent weeks, we’ll have to keep a  close watch on the indicators of demand in this sector as well As it is, continuing  reports that short supplies of inputs have been delaying projects suggest that  actual construction spending may hold up fairly well for a while   On the business investment side, apart from our reading of the zig-zags in  computer shipments as supporting our notion of a near-term Y2K lock-down  effect, there are no compelling signs that the strong uptrend in spending on capital  equipment is weakening  Meanwhile, yesterday’s retail inventory figures left the  overall stock picture for the third quarter about as we anticipated it--lean, and ripe  for some greater buildup in the near term, perhaps even apart from any Y2K  hedging   The bottom line is that it’s far from certain that we’re on track for the  substantial deceleration of domestic demand needed to offset the oncoming  external impetus Karen described and thereby avoid a further escalation of labor     11/16/99 11   market pressures As you know, in our forecast, we only get there with 50 basis  points of funds rate tightening over the next year and, importantly, a plateau in  share prices The renewed exuberance of the stock market this month seems to  underscore the upside risks to demand coming from that realm   One might argue that such upside demand risks are of little concern because  they in effect mirror an upside risk to aggregate supply in our forecast As you  know, looking at the patterns in the revised national income accounts, we’ve  found grounds for upgrading the structural gains in labor productivity in the  period ahead It is, of course, possible that we didn’t go far enough It might  even be asserted that the unanticipated strength of the stock market, especially  with its focus in the tech sector, is an indication that we’re still lagging beyond the  reality of the information revolution I’ll admit to remaining more than a little  skeptical that the market is providing an informed, rational assessment of the  prospects in this regard But, in any event, as we attempted to illustrate with a  model simulation in the Greenbook, it would take a much greater improvement in  productivity performance than we’ve allowed for to avert a deterioration in  inflation trends   Another way we might avoid that deterioration would be for 4 percent  unemployment to prove sustainable without putting pressure on real wage  increases A look at some of the data we’ve received in recent weeks could easily  tempt one toward that conclusion Certainly, the third-quarter ECI and October  average hourly earnings figures were benign Even the rather large, 4¾ percent  annual rate, rise in nonfarm compensation per hour in the third quarter did not  interrupt the broader deceleration since last year But these observations don’t  provide much comfort with respect to the outlook if one buys our explanation for  the slowing in nominal wage increases--namely, last year’s particularly low price  inflation, since reversed   Moreover, anecdotal indications of wage behavior have been less than  propitious While the picture is far from uniform, what I hear is that coping with  a tight supply of qualified workers has become a preoccupation for many  managers; that short-staffing is creating strains, with excessive pressure on  workers and sometimes quality problems as a consequence; and that more  employers are concluding that they will have to break down and raise wages by  more or on a broader front Of course, these stories aren’t entirely new, and my  perception that they’ve become more common and intense may be colored by my  analytical priors So you’ll certainly want to check them against your own  impressions   Switching gears, however, and looking directly at prices for the signs of  mounting inflationary pressure, the data again are mixed Awkwardly, the  October CPI isn’t coming out until tomorrow Like private analysts, we’re  expecting that both the total and core indexes will post increases on the order of a  quarter percent--something that would not alter significantly the recent trends in     11/16/99 12   either measure One question is which measure to regard as most informative  about the prospective trends, and I’ll repeat the thought I conveyed at the last  meeting that we should not focus entirely on the more subdued core index  People and firms do buy energy products, and the rise in oil prices this year is  likely to leave its mark on wages and core prices going forward In this regard,  the spurt in crude prices in the past few days is scarcely good news   But there are other indications as well that inflationary forces may be  intensifying The prices of non-oil imports have continued to rise, and this  probably has contributed to the further noticeable increase in the core crude and  intermediate PPIs Manufacturers of final goods and retailers still complain that  they lack pricing leverage, but these developments in the pipeline would seem to  heighten the likelihood of at least some up-drift in inflation   Broadening the perspective a bit, I might say a few words about inflation in  assets--a popular theme in some circles these days I won’t return to the matter of  the stock market; nor will I talk about what has been happening in the rarified  world of the art auction houses Rather, I’ll focus on the houses we live in The  latest numbers for house prices--the Freddie Mac repeat sales index and the  Census constant quality new home index--show accelerated increases of about 6  percent over the past year It isn’t at all obvious that this is a reflection of  increased inflation expectations; indeed, judging by the responses to the Michigan  SRC survey, people haven’t been buying because they view homes as an  especially good investment In the main, I think we’re simply seeing the kind of  relative price movement that occurs in a market where demand, driven by strong  gains in jobs, income, and stock market wealth, is pressing on what is an inelastic  short-run supply of land, labor, and materials   But, even if these price increases don’t reflect heightened inflationary  expectations per se, they’re not irrelevant to the outlook It is likely that the  higher house prices will show through at some point in the CPI through higher  owners’ equivalent rents And the price increases can themselves contribute to an  inflationary psychology Certainly, rising prices on reproducible assets like  houses tend to spur more investment activity in the future and add to the general  strength of demand--as may the increases in wealth enjoyed by the owners of the  assets As I’ve noted, this is not an economy in need of more positive wealth  effects on demand   This brings me to a final observation There has also been a lot of discussion  recently about the internal and external saving imbalances in the economy The  NIPA revisions shuffled things around a bit, but the basic contours remain the  same The personal saving rate has plummeted in this decade; the private saving- investment balance has swung sharply into the negative, the counterpart being a  considerable run-up in business and household debt that might someday prove  burdensome; and we’ve opened up a big current account deficit, mirrored in a  rapid growth of external liabilities that might weigh on the dollar     11/16/99 13   These patterns reflect a complex set of forces, one that I fear is beyond the  state of the art to sort out But it seems likely that part of the story is the  “crowding in” of private investment by the shift in the federal budget, some of  which has been structural Another element undoubtedly is the recent slump in  emerging market economies and the attraction of the United States and US dollar  assets as a safe haven Probably the central question for you is to what extent  these so-called “imbalances” are reflective of an unsustainable cyclical boom  fostered by excessive financial ease   This, of course, just brings us back to the same fundamental issues I was  discussing earlier In essence, the ex post saving-investment balances don’t seem  to add much to the picture; they simply provide a different vantage point on the  matter before you    That is a good question and one to which I do not have a precise   answer We do not anticipate a plummeting in oil prices; we have a gradual decline over the two   years The level clearly has moved up since we established our assumption; oil prices rose after   the Greenbook was published There is still a downward tilt in the futures markets, though   maybe not quite as sharp as there had been earlier The futures price is still pretty high for the   next several months But if the prices were to remain where they are now, it would add at least a   little to the core inflation rate, particularly in 2001 I do not think it would create a night-and-day   difference in the inflation outlook    This is not going to materially affect the additional-­   Yes    I think if potential had been as low as we previously had been gauging   it--this gets a little confusing because we have changed the books here--one might have     11/16/99 16   wondered why the unemployment rate had not fallen more So I think this does fit And indeed   we have reestimated our Okun’s Law relationship and feel reasonably comfortable with the   conformity of our assumptions with what has occurred in terms of the movement in the   unemployment rate    Yes It wasn’t a really big problem, but it does seem to be compatible   with our assumptions Indeed, it is even compatible with Okun’s Law relationships that are   estimated from the income side of the national accounts There doesn’t seem to be a great   mystery in that respect The little uptick in labor force participation rates we have had recently is   a bit of a comfort in terms of our understanding of the basic dynamics in the labor market We   don’t feel too uncomfortable with things in that regard    Thank you, Mr Chairman   If I were to put the Greenbook in a seasonal nutshell, I suppose I  would say that we’ve brought you tidings of great joy, but maybe not great  comfort   In broad macro terms, the economy has been performing splendidly  Though we can’t be especially confident at this point, it looks as if real  GDP growth in the current quarter will be close to 5 percent, at an annual  rate If so, 1999 would be the fourth year running of growth of 4 percent  or more With job gains still strong, we’ve now enjoyed three straight  years of average unemployment rates below 5 percent The chain index  for GDP prices has increased less than 2 percent for four consecutive  years   Moreover, the outlook as described in our baseline forecast is almost  as good GDP growth is projected to fall a little short of the 4 percent  mark over the next two years But the unemployment rate is expected to  remain near 4 percent and GDP price increases below 2 percent This is  among the most upbeat forecasts for the US economy that you’ll find  today   So, if we’re right, the basis for joy is pretty clear You’ve entered  Humphrey-Hawkins heaven Unfortunately, you haven’t been granted  unconditional permanent residency there, and this is where the comfort  side of the story comes in We believe that the economy may be getting  seriously overheated and in some ways significantly distorted   This Committee has, of course, announced its focus on the mounting  pressures in the labor market as the most likely potential source of  deteriorating inflation performance and thus cyclical instability But,  though there’s a near consensus among employers that qualified workers  are terribly scarce, the official data actually show decelerating wages I’ll  make just three quick comments on this dissonance   First, we continue to think that the wage deceleration this year owes  considerably to the downside surprise in price inflation that occurred last  year when oil prices plummeted; on this view, this year’s pickup in prices  should be showing through in wages over coming quarters Second,  judging by the nonfarm compensation figures--though not by the less  inclusive ECI--real wages (deflated by product prices) have been     12/21/99 9   increasing quite substantially even this year But, third, none of the  official pay series seems equipped to provide an accurate reading on labor  costs in today’s world where plain vanilla wages are becoming less  important relative to many other components, including deferred--and less  certain--compensation in the form of stock and stock options This latter  point is underscored by the stream of stories about people passing up big  salaries to go to young firms offering equity lottery tickets and about  established companies restructuring themselves so that they can compete  on those terms This suggests that the linkage between compensation  changes and price pressures--never an especially tight and predictable one  --has become even more problematic   Given these vagaries of the wage picture and its interpretation, and on  the thought that the proof of the inflation pudding might be in the eating,  perhaps we should simply ask whether there’s any evidence that prices  themselves are beginning to accelerate I would say that there is some  evidence, though it may not yet be compelling   Certainly, we’ve seen an upturn in core PPI crude and intermediate  goods prices At the same time, and helping to explain the acceleration of  the PPI pipeline measures, the prices of non-oil imports (ex computers and  semiconductors) have begun inching up as the dollar has stopped  appreciating on a broad basis and as foreign economies have recovered  At the final goods and services level, with some greater firmness in the  monthly figures of late, the core CPI has edged a couple of tenths above  its low on a twelve-month change basis   And, of course, as I’ve noted repeatedly, overall consumer prices  have accelerated noticeably this year with the run-up in the cost of crude  oil, something that may provide some momentum to inflation in the near  term One way in which that could occur is via expectations, and  households’ short-term inflation expectations do appear to have risen  some this year It might also be noted that the latest semi-annual NAPM  survey showed purchasing managers expressing somewhat greater concern  about increasing costs and inflation in 2000   All of this may well be stretching the point statistically, but I think  it’s worth sounding a note of caution that strong productivity gains and  intense competition--even accelerating productivity and intensifying  competition--do not by themselves ensure that there can be no step-up in  inflation Unless supply is completely elastic, which seems unlikely in the  short run, demand can become excessive   That, we fear, is the current situation, with the rising stock market  overriding the effects of monetary tightening Once again in recent weeks,  the market has defied our notions of valuation gravity by posting an     12/21/99 10   appreciable further advance Moreover, it has done so in a way that seems  to highlight the risk that it will continue doing so I refer to the incredible  run-up in “tech” and e-commerce stocks, some of which have entered the  big-cap realm without ever earning a buck   To illustrate the speculative character of the market, let me cite an  excerpt from a recent IPO prospectus “We incurred losses of $145  million in fiscal 1999 primarily due to expansion of our operations, and  we had an accumulated deficit of $150 million as of July 31, 1999 We  expect to continue to incur significantexpenses, particularly as a result of  expanding our direct sales force… We do not expect to generate sufficient  revenues to achieve profitability and, therefore, we expect to continue to  incur net losses for at least the foreseeable future  If we do achieve  profitability, we may not be able to sustain it” Based on these prospects,  the VA Linux IPO recorded a first-day price gain of about 700 percent and  has a market cap of roughly $9 billion Not bad for a company that some  analysts say has no hold on any significant technology   The warning language I’ve just read is at least an improvement in  disclosure compared to the classic prospectus of the South Sea Bubble era,  in which someone offered shares in “A company for carrying on an  undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is” But, I  wonder whether the spirit of the times isn’t becoming similar to that of the  earlier period Among other things, it may be noteworthy that the tech  stocks have done so well of late in the face of rising interest rates Earlier  this year, those stocks supposedly were damaged when rates rose, because,  people said, quite logically, that the present values of their distant earnings  were greatly affected by the rising discount factor At this point, those  same people are abandoning all efforts at fundamental analysis and talking  about momentum as the only thing that matters   If this speculation were occurring on a scale that wasn’t lifting the  overall market, it might be of concern only for the distortions in resource  allocation it might be causing But it has in fact been giving rise to  significant gains in household wealth and thereby contributing to the rapid  growth of consumer demand--something reflected in the internal and  external saving imbalances that are much discussed in some circles  Whether our assumed 75 basis point increase in the fed funds rate would  be a sufficient shock to halt this financial locomotive is open to question   A model simulation in the Greenbook gave some sense of what might  happen if the stock market shrugged off that further tightening and  continued rising But another factor that will help determine just how  much policy restraint is needed is what happens in the rest of the world  economy, and Karen has a few words to say about the risks in that regard     12/21/99 11    Well, no one has had a particularly good track record on forecasting   auto sales this year Even the automobile manufacturers themselves, I think, have been   quite surprised by the high level of sales Our forecast of overall economic activity is, as I   suggested, in the upper brackets of forecasts that one would find at this point and auto sales     12/21/99 13   are a cyclically sensitive sector of the economy I think therein lies a very important   element of explanation I don’t think there is much more that I can say on this We consult   a number of models, and they give somewhat different results about the likely pattern of   auto demand over the next couple of years But as we look back at recent experience--at   how much sales seemed to be above reasonable trends in the past two or three years--we   don’t see a compelling case for a precipitous decline from here, especially in a   fundamentally strong economic environment    I’m not sure that I can provide a very good direct answer to the   question of sensitivity to policy actions We have looked to see whether the responses--in   terms of long-term rate movements and so on--to changes in the funds rate are different   now I think there may be some small amount of evidence supporting that thesis    I should say that one of the nice features of our model is the ability to   change the expectations formation mechanisms And the one that we have used in doing   these simulations is a very simple, small model that is supposed to capture the way people   will react to a certain set of variables  It isn’t a fully consistent model of expectations in that   we are not taking a full rational expectations kind of approach That would be another way   of doing this This is one of the areas of active continuing research, and conceivably there   could be some changes in this small model in the not-too-distant future that would perhaps   enrich that a bit One of the things that we have pointed out repeatedly in the presentation   of our simulations is the difference in the effect of lower interest rates versus higher stock   prices for the inflation outcome That’s because the interest rate change induced by   monetary policy is affecting people’s inflation expectations to a greater degree than the   higher stock prices, even though they both create more aggregate demand So, this is one of   the areas that I think we need to work on a bit further in an effort to come up with something   that would be a little more realistic    We have a government sector to account for and I think that is   probably the--    12/21/99 15    I don’t think there is a particularly good way And I’m not sure, in   fact, whether in the real world we don’t have a mixture of both occurring In a mechanical   way we have cost of living adjustments in various contracts, so that is clearly backward-  looking I would think that in many informal wage adjustment systems people are looking   at what has happened to the CPI over the past year or some other recent period to get a sense   of what might be an appropriate wage increase In other instances, people may be more   forward-looking and the question is how they shape those expectations We have tried to   capture that econometrically in various ways by using lagged prices, survey measures, and   so on I don’t think we can really separate the two in a clear way    We have looked at how robust those estimates are, examining   different estimation periods and so on, and one would find some variation in that respect   On a priori grounds, one might think that this effect would not necessarily be perfectly   stable over time as the demographic distribution of wealth changes If more of the wealth   was held by people with shorter expected remaining life spans and there was not a strong   bequest motive, one would think the coefficient would go up because people would be   spending that wealth more quickly If younger people are getting wealthy and they spread   the spending over a lifetime, one would expect the coefficient to go down I think there are   any number of reasons to expect that the coefficient is not going to be perfectly stable    They have to find some workers to do the census! [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman The economic picture  remains the same in many respects as it has been for some time  The  now record-long expansion has continued to outstrip most analysts’  expectations--including our own; meanwhile, inflation--apart from the  price of energy--has remained relatively low  Beneath these broad  trends, there’s the usual abundance of interesting sectoral details, but  sifting through them, as we did in the Greenbook, doesn’t seem to add  a great deal to the story  Certainly, it provides no clear indication as to  when this extraordinary performance might end              - 29 -       Obviously, a key element in the continuation of the favorable   pattern has been productivity  Just as the Chairman predicted, the  incoming data have prompted us to raise our sights on the pace of  structural improvements in output per hour  We’re now putting it at  32 percent per annum for the nonfarm business sector this year and  next--two-tenths more than the already elevated figure embedded in  our prior forecast  While the better than 7 percent fourth-quarter gain  in real GDP is to some extent suspect, even when we pare away the  questionable defense surge, we’re left with an impressive increase in  productivity for the year--close to 3-3/4 percent  Some of that  probably was cyclical, in the sense that it reflected a stretching of the  work force in a period of surging demand Anyone who went to a retail  establishment during the holiday shopping season and had to wait in a  check-out line will attest to that!  But we also think that the sustainable  improvements in efficiency coming from the use of more and better  capital equipment and from operational changes likely are coming at a  faster pace     The result has been an absolute decline in unit labor costs that   evidently has restored most of the squeeze in the profit share of GDP  that occurred as the world economy weakened in the wake of the  Asian crisis  At the same time, competitive pressures have translated a  portion of this reduction in costs into subdued core price inflation-- especially in goods markets, where at least physical plant capacity  remains ample here and abroad  The unmentioned factor in this  arithmetic is wages  It seems to me that the anecdotal accounts in the  Beigebook and elsewhere are telling us that it’s costing employers  more to hire and retain staff--if not in straight wages, then in bonuses,  stock options, and other fringe benefits  Still, the aggregate statistical  data we have in hand don’t reveal any significant pickup in the pace of  compensation increase  Perhaps it’s a reflection of the measurement  problems to which we’ve repeatedly called your attention  But, when  we look at the behavior of prices and profits, it really is rather difficult  to argue that the data have been giving us a misleading signal about  the general direction of labor costs     This is not to say, however, that there are no inflation risks in the   near-term outlook  It’s quite possible--indeed, in our view probable-- that the reports of compensation pressures will be mirrored in an  accelerating trend of wages and benefits in the coming months  Apart  from the tightness of the labor market, we would expect the now 3-1/4  percent year-on-year CPI inflation to show through in the wage-setting  process, and there are no signs of an abatement of the step-up in  medical insurance premiums              - 30 -       The run-up in oil prices was, of course, the major factor in the   CPI acceleration I just mentioned  We’re hopeful that the price of  crude has crested, but even if that’s so, there’s the possibility that-- apart from the wage effect--the increased cost of fuel and energy  inputs will begin to show through more than they have to date in the  prices of finished goods and services  There are many reports of  transport charges being raised, and the imprint of higher petroleum  costs is visible in a wide range of materials prices; but one is hard- pressed at this point to identify the pass-throughs at the consumer  level, aside from airfares  This is something that bears close watching,  however  And so, too, are indicators of inflation expectations; in this  regard, Friday’s preliminary results from the March Michigan SRC  survey, showing a noticeable rise in average short- and long-run price  expectations, may be a worrisome sign       Speaking of worry, the SRC survey also showed a drop-off in the   overall index of consumer sentiment  That said, though, people still  appeared to be in an extraordinarily good mood  And the downturn in  fuel prices that we’re anticipating will begin in a few months should  help buoy their spirits--and their real incomes  The moderation in  domestic demand in our forecast thus continues to hinge largely on the  influence of the less accommodative financial conditions that we’ve  anticipated       Peter has covered much of what has occurred of late in fixed-  income markets  I won’t subject you to another lengthy recitation of  my jaundiced view of what has been transpiring in the equity markets   I’ll just say that, despite some movement toward reconvergence in  recent days of “old economy” and “new economy” stocks, I still find  the valuations of many so-called tech companies--and the rationales  analysts give for them--rather wacky  The fact is, though, that at  yesterday’s close the Wilshire 5000 was up fully 4 percent from the  13,500 level prevailing a week ago, when we locked into our  Greenbook assumption of a flat stock market through the projection  period  Whether this is just noise or a significant signal of a different  direction for the equity market than we’ve assumed, I’ll leave for you  to judge  As you know, we’ve judged that it could well take a  substantial further increase in the fed funds rate to raise bond yields  appreciably and hold the stock market down       It’s possible that consumer demand will soften even if share prices   exceed our expectations; there undoubtedly have been some accelerator- type effects at work in the case of homes, motor vehicles, and other  durables, and these could abate more quickly than we have anticipated               - 31 -     But we remain persuaded--even if some other analysts are not--that  lagged wealth effects are important, and so we would expect that,  barring a sizable stock market correction in the near future, the tendency  will be for household spending to remain robust  Abundant capital that  is viewed as cheap relative to the anticipated return is also supporting  business investment  Consequently, we think that a considerable  tightening of financial market conditions is likely to be needed if this  economy is not to overheat more as a stronger rest-of-the-world  economy begins to leave its mark on our trade balance over coming  quarters     With that set-up, let me turn the floor over to Karen       Real rates have been more difficult to gauge than usual in this period   because of the distortions, if I can put it that way, that have occurred in the fixed-income market    We've seen Treasury yields come down substantially, while movements in others rates have been   something of a mixed bag  But in many cases long-term rates have actually come down a bit and   run below our expectations  In terms of inflation expectations, there are some hints--but only              - 35 -     some--of an upward movement, largely in response to what has been occurring in the oil market    And there are some counter indications, too  The TIP spread, for example, certainly hasn't been   moving up lately  Again, that might be confounded by the Treasury market illiquidity   So it is   rather difficult to gauge  Bottom line, we felt that while the stock market seemed to be on the   track we were anticipating--at least up until the time we fixed the number for our assumption   here--interest rate developments certainly were not on the tighter side of what we were   anticipating  The economy was showing more momentum coming into the year  And we felt   that some greater tightening of policy probably would be required to keep aggregate demand and   supply in a balance similar to what we had in the prior forecast  At this point, we have what I   would perceive to be a rather similar degree of tightening in the real funds rate because we do   have a somewhat higher inflation path  We have added only a 1/4 point on the funds rate  We   have long-term rates going up more than before in the corporate market, in part because my   sense was that we really had too much yield curve flattening before and more tightening will be   needed in the long end  Perhaps it will take more tightening in the short end in order to impose   an upward restraint on the economy and bring aggregate demand and supply back into balance       It’s not a major change  I'd say, on balance, that the picture might be a   little tighter in terms of the overall fixed-income market assumptions     I’m not sure which numbers you are looking at  The faster productivity   growth simulation has substantially higher real GDP growth; it’s 08 percentage point higher in   2000 and 14 percentage points more in 2001  So nominal GDP growth is much more rapid in   the high productivity simulation     Yes, I’m seeing that  I perceive this as a situation where policy is very   accommodative  It is taking this favorable shock in significant part through higher output and a              - 37 -     downward movement in the unemployment rate  Over time we will find ourselves in the   situation where the labor market has gotten tighter  People will perceive that they have not been   getting their share of this faster growth of the pie and there will be a tendency for inflation to   pick up  And thus you will need to tighten monetary policy significantly relative to the baseline   path  This simulation is generated by the exact same model that generated the other simulations    It is the same story we've told all along  That you have a choice in the short run of how to   respond--how much you are going to take in lower unemployment or how much you might take   in a permanent lowering of the inflation path by holding the line on resource utilization with a   prompt tightening of policy       Yes, that is almost always the case in these exercises       For us, the basic rule is that in the long run monetary policy is going to   determine the inflation rate  If you wanted to achieve the baseline path--while you might have to   be fleet of foot here in adjusting policy--presumably you could do it  But you would have to   move promptly or else you will get this short-run dynamic     It is a very complex question, and I'll try to be as brief as possible  Let   me cite our basic premises  One is that real interest rates and financial conditions in general are   not evidently so tight as to be very restraining on the growth of aggregate demand  I think what   we have been observing in the performance of the economy is consistent with that  Second, we   do believe--more so than was the case a few years ago--that we are in a period in which   productivity growth has improved and may well improve somewhat further in a fundamental and   sustainable fashion  And that may be giving us some favorable short-term dynamics in the sense   of an effective lowering of the NAIRU in the short run  The third basic point is that we think the   labor markets are unsustainably tight  If we were to maintain labor markets as taut as they are   now, we think that over time--and fairly soon--we would begin to see the real wage pressures   creep into the actual outcomes for compensation growth  And we believe that would tend to put   upward pressure on unit labor costs and ultimately on prices   But there are uncertainties in all of these  And what these simulations hopefully were   going to help you assess was what the outcome might be if one were more optimistic about some   of the assumptions  One might look, say, at the period since the middle of last year--when the   economy has grown very rapidly and we've seen a sustained low core inflation rate and a              - 39 -     relatively stable unemployment rate--and view that as consistent with even higher productivity   growth than we’ve put in this alternative simulation  Or we could be seeing the results of an   even lower NAIRU than we have contemplated  Is 4 percent a sustainable unemployment rate?    We don't have a way of answering that question  We've wrestled with this  We've looked at how   much can be explained by various models on alternative assumptions and so on, and this is our   best guess  But we can't by any means rule out more optimistic views of the current thrust of   productivity or of sustainable lower levels of unemployment  We are pretty sure that current   financial market conditions are reasonably supportive of an expansion of household and business   spending  There is no shortage of credit available  There are still people willing to throw money   at IPOs to finance just about any idea that anyone can come up with  Moreover, the cost of   equity capital seems to be very low for many firms and there are only hints that the rise in   mortgage rates has begun to bite on housing, the most interest-sensitive segment of demand     I don't think the B2B Internet connection story has been a very big   factor to date  There have been closer connections between firms and their suppliers for a while    It is an ongoing process that has employed various technologies  Our sense is simply that this              - 40 -     isn't just talk--that many firms are entering into B2B Internet arrangements that will facilitate a   continuation of this process  It will enable them to have tighter control over inventories and   continue the downward trend that has emerged in the inventory-sales ratios in the last few years       It's using a somewhat different technology, one that has more   flexibility  It seems to be enveloping an increasing proportion of our business firms     Mr Chairman, may I just put in an informational note here?  I think the   ECI is designed to capture the kind of medical cost phenomenon you described, President   Jordan  It's very difficult, I suspect, to get it just right, but it may be one of the reasons why we   have not seen an acceleration of medical insurance costs in the ECI commensurate with the huge   price increases that we've heard businesses talk about      I’ve missed a few     Thank you    Vince will begin     As you know, two major statistical releases came   out this morning housing starts and the CPI  We’ve distributed a table  summarizing those reports     Total starts were up about 3 percent in April, reflecting a rebound   in multifamily units from March’s low level  That single-family starts  were stable, rather than falling off, runs counter to our expectation, but  the significance of that reading is called into question by a 6 percent  decline in permits  Thus, the pattern of indicators in this sector  continues to be ambiguous, with just hints that the residential building  cycle is about to turn down       As for the CPI, the overall index was flat and its core component   rose 02 percent last month  Food prices increased less than we  anticipated, but energy and core prices were in line with our  expectations--the latter admittedly with a surprising jump in the tobacco  category  The 12-month change in the core backed off to 22 percent,  after spiking to 24 percent last month  That number is the same as a  year ago, but still about a quarter point above the cyclical low      At this stage of our analysis, I don’t see anything in today’s news   that would require us to make any fundamental change in our Greenbook  forecast  If I were to summarize that forecast briefly, given my  imminent departure--and with apologies to Madame de Pompadour--it  could be apres moi le deluge  Maybe that’s just a tad overly dramatic,  but the picture we’ve painted of what lies ahead certainly is less  attractive than the landscape of the past few years     To be sure, our baseline projection is that, with only a moderate   policy tightening--just a little more than the markets already anticipate-- aggregate demand growth will slacken appreciably and overall PCE      22  inflation will run only in the low 2 percent area in 2001  But that result,  in our analysis, hinges on a flat stock market and a considerable decline  in oil prices--two notions to which the markets have proven notably  resistant in the few days since the Greenbook went to press  And,  importantly, our baseline projection indicates that, as you exit 2001,  you’ll find yourselves confronted with still extremely tight labor markets  and an uptrend in core inflation      We, of course, offered a simple solution to the projected inflation   problem in one of our alternative scenarios a bigger rise in short-term  interest rates  The model simulation suggested that, if our baseline is  correct, then a sharper elevation of the funds rate, to 8 percent by year- end, would check the pickup of core inflation  Indeed, this scenario  might be characterized as akin to the “reverse soft landing” that has been  mentioned so often  Another, perhaps less appealing, way to describe it  would be a “growth recession”       The central point is that we think the signs are clearer now that the   labor markets have become unsustainably tight and that an appreciable  rise in the unemployment rate probably will be required to hang onto the  bulk of the disinflation progress that you’ve made in recent years     If our analysis is correct, even a further escalation of productivity   growth will only postpone the day of reckoning  As productivity  accelerates, you may get a temporary lowering of the effective NAIRU;  but once wages begin to catch up with the improvement in productivity,  the effective NAIRU will move back up and inflation will tend to rise   To be sure, it’s possible that the longer-range natural rate has fallen, so  that we may not have to see unemployment reach the level we would  once have thought necessary, but our guess is that the increase will have  to be noticeable  This is where an unhappy fact comes into the picture   There isn’t any precedent, at least in our modern economic history, for  realizing a substantial rise in our unemployment rate without a  recession--not just a growth recession, but a meaningful absolute decline  in activity     One may reasonably ask  Are we really destined to repeat history,   or might there be reason to hope that this time will be different?  I’m not  prepared today to offer you a full exposition of the ways in which the  cyclical conjuncture or the structure of the economy today might be  dissimilar from what it was in past episodes  I’ll offer a few, brief  comments, however       First, from the viewpoint of the simple macro model, there are no   logical grounds for ruling out the possibility of a fairly soft landing   One can envision a period of relatively slow--but continuously positive--     23  growth during which the pressures on resources are gradually relieved,  and inflation is contained and then brought back down  How far above  zero that growth might be on average would be a function of how large  the current output gap is and how high potential GDP growth is   Combine a low NAIRU and a high potential growth rate, and there could  be room for a distinctly positive expansion pace     But, backing away from the ethereal, it does seem as if our formal   models and even our judgmental analyses routinely fail to capture the  sorts of “nonlinearities” that come into play once the economy starts to  decelerate appreciably  Such phenomena could go a long way in  explaining why, when we’ve attempted to apply the brakes in past  expansions, we generally ended up skidding into the ditch      I think that at least part of the problem relates to the fragilities that   typically develop during the expansion phase of the business cycle  The  Chairman has, in effect, been addressing one source of such fragility in  his admonitions to bankers that they need to be more cautious  Loan  losses and capital impairment, their seeds having been sown in the  enthusiasms of the preceding boom, have often created credit crunches  that exacerbate the multiplier-accelerator effects damping private  investment  These difficulties can be especially great if banks and other  financial institutions have financed a construction boom, because an  overhang of supply in real estate markets--where the assets  collateralizing loans are immobile and long-lived--is not easily absorbed   At this point, I’d judge that the problems in this sphere aren’t as great as  they have been at some times in the past  And, if there are latent  problems, they may lie this time relatively less in the commercial area  and relatively more in the residential, where we haven’t had a cyclical  test of the underwriting standards that have made mortgage credit more  accessible in the past decade     I am still less sanguine about another asset market--that for   corporate equities  Share prices clearly are susceptible to exaggerated  swings as the balance of greed and fear tilts in a bearish direction--with  marked effects on the cost and availability of equity capital and on  household wealth  In the current cycle, there would seem to be a risk of  a particularly large decline in the market, given that, by many  conventional metrics, we’ve experienced a speculative bubble of  extraordinary proportions  The market-correction scenario in the  Greenbook--though involving a considerable, 25 percent decline from  the March peak for the Wilshire--may well understate the downside  potential here  But, even if you vastly increase the dimension of the  decline, our econometric model would still say you can avoid recession,  if you cushion the effects by backing off on your tightening          24  Is this realistic?  Maybe yes, maybe no  I certainly wouldn’t  question your nimbleness, but it could be challenging to gauge what is  required to avoid an undue weakening of demand and yet avoid igniting  another bull run  I personally am concerned, moreover, that consumer  sentiment could prove volatile  This hasn’t been much in evidence in  the past couple of months, perhaps because the NASDAQ slide reversed  gains that were enjoyed only briefly--and perhaps mainly by investors  who were riding what they must have recognized was a wild wave  But  I suspect that in recent years many households have been lulled into  complacency about the adequacy of their savings by the run-up in share  prices and that a major shrinkage of their nest eggs would severely dent  their spirits  On the other hand, though, it isn’t clear that we have seen  outsized wealth effects on the up side as consumers’ spirits have soared,  so perhaps we need not be greatly concerned about the consequences on  the down side      I’d be remiss if I did not mention one other likely reason that soft   landings have proven elusive  That is that, in part because of the lags in  the effects of interest rate increases and our foggy crystal balls, we  probably have had a tendency to tighten too much or too long  This  undoubtedly would be an argument of those who would caution against  more aggressive tightening action right now, with the effects of your  first five policy actions still in the pipeline  However, I would raise the  question whether that pipeline has not sprung a leak, draining off some  of the restraint; I refer, of course, to the considerable further increase in  share prices, on net, since you began your sequence       This, to be sure, is not a comprehensive assessment of the risks   that lie ahead  Vince noted the potential ramifications of our external  imbalance  The interactions of all these forces could be complex and  certainly are impossible to foresee  However, I don’t think this adds up  to a prescription of hesitation in the move toward greater monetary  restraint  Indeed, one might argue that the pattern of too much, too long  that I noted a moment ago has been a byproduct of doing too little early  enough  The bottom line judgment I would offer is that, if anything, the  news of the intermeeting period has highlighted the basic imbalances in  the economy that probably will become more serious and more difficult  to deal with if aggregate demand is not reined in at least moderately   And I don’t think you can depend on the markets to do the work without  your participation  That concludes our remarks, Mr Chairman         It certainly wouldn't justify it, but one would hope that by getting   ahead of the curve, to use the parlance--      Presumably you never want to overreact       But as one perhaps gets frustrated in not seeing the desired response   and as the problem seems to be getting worse because inflation lags the changes in the output   gap, there is probably always going to be a risk of overstaying on the tight side     We get inflation continuing on up  This is all finely calibrated   through our judgmental forecast and then what the model produces, which is this upward   trend in inflation  Part of the problem in that scenario is that the funds rate is stable at 7-1/4   percent and thus it begins to decline in real terms  In essence you begin to have less and less   restraint and you're accommodating an acceleration of inflation  It so happens that running   the exercise with our model and holding the funds rate steady at 8 percent avoids that problem      26  and you have a stable inflation path  In fact, a couple of years down the road you probably   will find that the unemployment rate is drifting up above the steady state of the NAIRU and   you will need to begin to ease policy in order to avoid overshooting on the disinflation  But   how far you want to go down this road depends in part on where you want to end up  If you   want to end up at 2 percent core PCE inflation, then this 8 percent scenario might fit the bill    If you want to get inflation down closer to what we think is true price stability, that tighter   scenario and related output gap may need to be there for a while     Well, I'll confess that we did not extend the flat funds rate scenario to   the out years, but I certainly anticipate that it would be a much worse looking picture  The   extension of the 7-1/4 percent funds rate in our model extrapolation--and this involves some   extrapolation of the baseline forecast to begin with--results in inflation by 2002 moving into   the 3 percent area on core PCE     First, I would caution against taking any of these numbers as   seriously as we seem to be doing here     That’s a caveat I would issue about these long-run simulations, let   alone the shorter-run forecast  I guess I'd say that as we assess the trends in aggregate demand   and take as given certain features of the external environment, we don't see 7-1/4 percent as   doing the job of capping inflation  Now, if you were trying to figure out what strategy to      29  adopt if you had to make a decision today on where to move the funds rate by the end of the   year, I'd certainly characterize the 7-1/4 percent as a more cautious approach  That strategy   lowers the risk of so sharp a deceleration in the economy that you begin to set off the   momentum of these nonlinearities  But this conclusion is very speculative, and shocks could   come along that would significantly alter the picture  It is a gentler policy  Whether it's   kinder in the long run [Laughter] depends on how things evolve  If it merely delays what you   feel is going to be needed to catch up, thus producing a more violent response, it would not be   kinder in the end     No, definitely not  That is our thesis  As for whether it is correct or   not, I can't provide any guarantees        It is an installment, but we think you are going to need more   installments down the road to really hold the line on inflation  Inflation will be tending to   drift up as you move through the forecast horizon     Well, my concern--particularly in light of the developments in the   last few days--is that the markets are entirely too comfortable with the policy of gradual   increases in the funds rate  We may find that the stock market continues to trend upward and   we do not get the negative wealth effect that we have in our forecast, but rather a neutral or      30  positive wealth effect  That would create an aggregate demand picture that was much less   compatible with holding the line on inflation  So I would identify that risk  Vince identified   the risk that at some point the dollar could have a more precipitous decline, and obviously that   would exacerbate the pressures on domestic resources  I don't want to paint the picture as   completely asymmetric because, as I also suggested, the market might be vulnerable to a   significant reversal if the basic, positive psychology is shaken by some event  Who knows?    In that case the dollar still might look like the place to be  So, there are risks on both sides     Clearer!     We were expecting 5 percent nominal     We’ve made a few mistakes in the past!  [Laughter]  So we could be   making a mistake this time  We could be making a mistake this time even if we had been   perfect in the past  But in essence our judgment is that the rise in interest rates has to some   extent reflected the pressures of an extraordinary expansion in aggregate demand that is in      32  part a product of the run-up in stock prices  And, in all likelihood, it’s also partly a reflection   of an adjustment to a higher potential growth rate that has come with an acceleration of   productivity  As we look at what has been an accelerating pattern of economic expansion, it   seems to us that we probably have not moved interest rates up enough to curb that   acceleration of aggregate demand and real growth  So, we believe that we need to move rates   up still further for a period in order to rein in this expansion somewhat and restore a balance   between aggregate supply and demand  Whether rates will have to go as high as we forecast   and remain that high is difficult to say  Fiscal policy developments could play a role in   determining that  But this forecast is our best shot  And it's not one that is grossly at odds   with what the market seems to be anticipating, with one exception  And that is that we are   looking for a significant further rise in nominal bond yields because we don't think the market   really has built in this upward trend in inflation that we believe is commencing  So as we look   forward, we expect there will be a need for a high real interest rate, and we anticipate that   inflation expectations are going to be deteriorating somewhat in the environment that we are   forecasting     Well, that is all folded in there  That is a reflection of the distributed   lag of those effects      35    Were it not for those lagged effects we'd have a negative effect this   year on balance  But we still have a good part of the effect of the 1999 rise in particular   impacting the economy this year     The stable stock market means that the ratio of wealth to income is   falling  And that's the indicator on which one would base an anticipated drag on consumption     In the first half of this year we are getting a substantial effect  But at   this point it is decaying and in the second half of this year it will have disappeared  We   expect to get a very large proportion of the effect within the first year and a half, and it   diminishes after that     Roughly a percentage point      36    No, basically it's pointing to levels of resource utilization  Whether   we look at the unemployment rate or industrial capacity utilization, in both cases the level of   utilization has been rising  So, by definition in essence, the growth of aggregate supply has   been less than the growth of aggregate demand      37   I guess I'm more comfortable putting it the way I did   And as you   noted, one could also point to evidence on the wage and price side that is confirming this   increasing pressure     I will take half a loaf!
