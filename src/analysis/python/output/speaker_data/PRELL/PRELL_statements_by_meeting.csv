1150,1979-08-14, The repayment to income ratio is 23 percent roughly--at the record level   Consumer installment credit particularly has leveled off but I think the mortgage debt is still drifting up 
1180,1979-09-18," They’ve been shifted, I think, this month    The second quarter was also changed The numbers  are consistent What you have in the first half of the year in effect  was that households purchased a lot of Treasury securities at a time  when foreign central banks were selling off Treasury securities In  terms of the overall pattern of flows--  "
1492,1980-07-09, It asks for a statement of the Committee's plans and objectives with respect to money and credit growth 
1597,1980-10-21," We haven't put down a set of numbers Because of this very short time period, the differences in money stock expansion are minimal and we'd end up the latter part of next year presumably at roughly the same rate   That's the presumption we have with more generous monetary expansion "
1734,1981-02-02," Last time was the first time that the entire FOMC participated We asked for forecasts on two bases in terms of fiscal policy assumptions and with the basic money stock assumption we ultimately [adopted]--   Presumably   Well, in terms of the basic thrust of the Humphrey-Hawkins exercise, the assumption might relate somehow to what we thought the Administration economists were going to do with fiscal policy, which leads one to various indeterminate states at this time But there's nothing we can do that is going to be clean-cut in terms of the overall purpose of the [exercise]  -87-    2/2-3/81 "
1780,1981-03-31," ""B"" would be in the middle by September and then you'd have to decelerate slightly "
1883,1981-07-06," About 5,000 "
1920,1981-08-18," Well, there isn't really much more to be said than that We have essentially the same interest rate assumptions in our forecast as we did the last time In essence, for the current year we had some offsetting developments of greater weakness in the second quarter than we thought, which lowered GNP for the year in our forecast, and a lower money stock for this year in light of the Committee's decision to shoot for the lower end of the M-1B range And those effects were largely offsetting We do have on the long- term side some small decline but nothing very meaningful in terms of real interest rates "
2029,1982-02-01," Well, I don't know how large and how reliable the current data base is that we have access to I know much of the individual firm data that are available are dated and not very reliable But it might well be worth looking at Of course, as you mentioned, there are large companies in the agricultural machinery business and strings of suppliers to the automobile industry as well as strings of suppliers in the aerospace industry who are affected, given that commercial aviation is off So, there may be hard times for many industries What is different about this period versus 1974 is that we have very high real rates of interest as best we can measure them And that does have an eroding effect on corporate cash flows I think that's one of the fundamental differences in the picture now   Well, there are lags in these relationships, of course And within the time period, in essence we're getting a movement down the demand for money curve There is more money and people hold it only at lower interest rates So, within this time span, that does hold interest rates down And that also produces the stronger performance of the economy, the tighter labor markets, and the greater cost pressures on prices I think there is a clear consistency Now, perhaps someone who believes in rational expectations and is of a monetarist persuasion would say Well, if we know that the money stock is going to be growing 1-1/2 percentage points faster forever, then under the base forecast here, interest rates would adjust instantaneously That's conceivably an outcome But as we model short-term interest rates primarily through a transactions demand for money [approach], this is the outcome we get   You can see that just in that table for '83 and '84 on the high money alternative The 5-1/2 percent does have a bottoming out of the bill rate in the second year It's a perceptibly different pattern from the others   I'd make a couple of observations One is that, of course, that outcome on flows is the outcome of supply and demand And one of the things holding that flow down is our basic interpretation of the monetary target and the constraint it places on the supply of funds The other thing is that, indeed, if one adheres to this policy and sees the progress on the inflation front and a slowing of all the underlying indicators of inflationary trends, then one might anticipate some improvement in nominal interest rates reflecting a decreased inflation premium We've been cautious in that Given the short-term interest rates we see as in essence clearing the money market, we've been hesitant to put in a big drop in long rates at the same time that short rates are pretty much stable and at some points higher than they are now It's just totally against all history to have a pronounced drop in long rates when short rates are under this kind of pressure But it's not inconceivable in this kind of environment   Well, this is a short-term rate of interest And I don't think there's any clear evidence that as one models the demand for money one can find clearly a separate influence of the expected inflation rate In essence, the nominal interest rate captures the opportunity cost of holding cash balances and, therefore, there's not an obvious place for inflation expectations per se to enter into that But the farther out you get on the maturity spectrum, the more plausible it becomes that this kind of inflation expectations effect will have a significant impact   Not necessarily, using a traditional model That probably would tend to show rising long-term rates because short-term rates are rising  -11-    2/1-2/82 -12-   It [does use a long-term rate], but it has not been especially reliable That's one of the reasons we have not used it very much In fact, it has been underpredicting long rates over the past year   About 5-3/4 percent   And we have greater drift in later quarters   Mr Chairman, I think Steve has addressed the question, ""If you're trying to control M2, what would happen?"" To focus on the simpler question--the interest elasticity of M2--the work we've done indicates that it still has a negative elasticity of a minor dimension When interest rates fall, it grows a little faster The redefinition, taking out the institutional money market funds, should probably make it even less interest elastic because the lag in the money fund yields stimulated this kind of shifting of funds by institutions into M2 and out of M2 So, we say there's a very small negative elasticity on it   That's right   Well, as for the retail RPs, once again they carry a current market yield So, there are unlikely to be substitutions--a great shifting of funds from outside of M2 into M2-- when interest rates change Our supposition at least has been that    2/1-2/82  most of the money in retail RPs has been diverted from small time deposits Indeed, that's one of the rationales for putting retail RPs into M2 they are a close substitute for those things that already were in M2   The more attractive time deposit instruments that have been created will tend to limit that effect [on M2] in any event   Mr Chairman, there are a number of factors involved here Arithmetically and I think analytically, one is the way the banks financed their asset growth It was much more through the issuance of large time deposits and much less through Eurodollar borrowings and the--   That is one factor Another factor--   That is right   The money market funds are another factor contributing to the divergence "
2293,1983-02-08," It covers off-budget items in the sense that it includes all US Treasury borrowings It doesn't include sponsored agencies, loan guarantees, and other federal credit programs   There is a complex of things here In terms of the way the chart looks, plotted as it is, we picked up this sharp rise in the latter part of the recession The large amount of borrowing that occurred in the latter part of 1982 is at a rate roughly comparable to the kind of borrowing we're anticipating will continue over the next couple of years of financing $200 billion deficits At the same time we have some slight increase in the  -17-    2/8-9/83  overall size of credit flows Total borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors was $413 billion in 1982 and we have it going up to $452 billion in 1983, which is essentially just the increase in government borrowings And then it's up to $497 billion So the flow is growing, but its growth is slight The proportion remains rather fixed  But returning to the question that President Balles asked, I think our whole projection has to be recognized as being in the context of a monetary policy that we still regard as reasonably restraining on the growth of nominal GNP We do have continuing pressures sustaining what are, in effect, high real short-term interest rates And that does lend itself to an unusual type of economic recovery We have reasonably weak investment in the first half of this recovery Housing starts do move back up, but it isn't a tremendously robust improvement we see going into 1983 and 1984 So the composition of risk and the credit flows that we have do reflect, I think, this crowding out phenomenon in the context of a restraining monetary policy that's still aiming at, and should achieve, some deceleration of inflation in the context of moderate growth   The short-term interest rates in our forecast recede only very slightly at the same time that the inflation rate is edging downward At current levels one would assess short-term real rates as being rather high And if it's hard to assess the long rates, then certainly relative to the current inflation rate those too are very, very high So, we have a rather restrained outlook for capital spending   It is shown on the chart on page 9 in the credit aggregate memo where we did take it back to the 1950s "
2318,1983-03-28," I don't think we have There is a cumulative tax increase of note going on It's probably several billion dollars this year in total, which doesn't loom large necessarily against the kind of tax cut that's going to occur at the federal level, but it is substantial Clearly, many state governments have run through all of the surplus funds they had and are having a drain in spending as well  -27-    3/28-29/83  as an increase in their taxes, so that we're getting an unusually weak cyclical contribution from the state and local sector in this forecast   This is news to me, I must confess It could simply be sampling errors   A 25 basis point change might not be something significant in terms of the aggregate    3/28-29/83   Is this our survey?   That would be less than market rates in general "
2392,1983-07-12," These are the operating budgets, taking out those retirement plans I think what has happened in many locales--New York City, for example--is that the financial situation has improved much more rapidly than had been expected Of course, there have been sizable tax increases; in the aggregate I think they're on the order of $5 to $6 billion And the cumulative effect of all this has been a significant swing into what is a relatively sizable operating surplus, according to the data we have   This measurement is borrowing by the US Treasury, which covers both the unified deficit and the off-budget deficit It does not include government guaranteed or sponsored agency issues   In mechanical terms, if we move above the cyclical trend in the early part of recovery, as the recovery matures we are going to have a period when productivity growth is somewhat below the trend rate of growth so as to return to the trend line   We go through this on a sector-by-sector basis, as well as looking at it in the aggregate Taking existing balance sheet positions as a start, trying to maintain reasonable levels of liquidity in the business sector and building up all these flows, this is what we come up with Going back and then looking at that again and asking whether we are comfortable with this, I guess we've suggested before that we don't have any great theory of credit aggregate behavior What we're left with is the feeling that given the size of the federal deficit and the kind of spending and borrowing relationships that might come from that, this relatively rapid growth of debt is sensible I would note that we were expecting a somewhat bigger gap than seems to be materializing this year But there is, nonetheless, this gap We don't see the development thus far this year of what would be a normal pattern where, on average, credit growth is falling short of GNP growth by a couple percentage points in the first year of recovery We think it probably has something to do with this very large government borrowing   Well, it could be that there is something going on in the disinflationary process, for example, that makes people want to hold more financial assets relative to income than had been true previously Essentially, we had a very big accumulation of financial assets relative to income last year There's an enormous gap, and we're carrying this through; it's not going away We have in our forecast a continuing moderate inflation picture; we have regulatory changes that make some forms of financial assets more attractive on the whole   Implicitly--in the same way that we don't have a tremendous reversal of the velocity behavior of the last year   As Jim was saying, it's largely an analytical study as opposed to an econometric one   That shows a proportion of credit   The credit aggregate excludes foreign borrowing   No, it doesn't Indeed, part of the counterpart in the current account deficit will have to be a substantial flow of funds into the US Treasury   Well, it's the supply side, and--   That's right "
2473,1983-11-14," Interest rates are declining in the latter part of this projection period and that is giving you some decline in velocity--some stronger demand for M2 relative to GNP That wouldn't be a continuing factor, if you extended this out beyond 1988, but it's a factor in 1987 and 1988 "
2529,1984-01-30," That indexes the dollar volume of borrowing relative to personal income at 100 in any trough and plots the movements from there The shaded area shows the range of experience in the earlier--   That is the outstanding debt relative to personal income This is the level of indebtedness The other is the flow of borrowing scaled by disposable income; one is the flow and one is the stock   No If debt is growing at the same pace as income, which is what the bottom panel shows, you would have an upward movement as shown in the top panel   Well, let me restate it The volume of borrowing has grown relative to GNP, but the [percent] increase in debt has been the same as the [percent] increase in income   Well, as you can see, that line has edged off very slightly If one looks back at 1975, one can see also that it was a while before that rate dropped very substantially Clearly, there has been, and even now still is, a great deal of unemployment, and that could be a factor holding the rate up And there may have been some problems among people who had short-term loans that they got earlier at low rates which they have had to renew at higher rates than perhaps they could handle We don't have any information suggesting that that has been a major problem, but that's a special feature in the current period   Plant construction is not a whole lot of dollars in the investment total We think our forecast is consistent with a rate of increase in that kind of spending of maybe 4 to 5 percent over the forecast horizon, which is not very substantial   Well, I think Mr Axilrod in all likelihood will be saying something, at least implicitly, about velocity behavior in terms of our short-term rates We think the short-term interest rate picture that we have is consistent with the monetary assumptions and the GNP pattern we have [forecast] And the long-term rate picture that goes with that we also think is consistent We believe the pieces fit together in a plausible, rational way   It was up 06 "
2611,1984-07-16," Ratios? Are you referring to the bottom panels?   That is, of course, what I plotted in the bottom left panel That is both debt and equity So that is the total funds raised or the total external financing   Are you referring to the nonfinancial corporations?    7/16-17/84   The way we got the adjustment, in essence, was to make an estimate on the basis of all that we know about the equity flows and all the merger activities And we came up with a net equity absorption number There was a net decline in equities of something like $60 or $65 billion in each of the first two quarters We then would hypothesize that, in the conditions that prevailed, that would be the relevant number We know that new equity issuance is something slightly positive--say, on the order of $10 billion So, the [gross retirement] is on the order of $70 or $75 billion   That's right--a number of that magnitude It would be a shade over a percentage point of the total debt flow   Well, that shows that net equity liquidation is about $60 to $65 billion by our estimates Then the borrowing is the total height of the red part   That's right This [chart] is defective I'm sorry The total funds raised is the height and the borrowing really should be the entire length of that bar That is not properly plotted   If you put them both together, it's 12 percent The debt was--   If there had not been any mergers, the debt presumably would have grown by 12 percent I guess the right answer to your question is that the number would not be far different from 13 percent to the extent that equities are not a gigantic sum of the total liabilities in the economy They are a significant part but the debt is much larger, so that absent the mergers you would have a figure approaching 13 percent, I think I stand open to corrections I'm having a hard time--   That's the problem That's one of the reasons we have not created a total financial aggregate It's an arbitrary assumption   Well, that's what we've had this year   Well, we tried to calculate every merger and make allowance for those that we can't itemize So we really do think it is our best guess of the total It could be short; that's clear because there's so much that is below the surface "
2754,1985-02-12," Governor Wallich, the unit labor cost increase last year was 2 percent and, as I said, goes to 3-1/4 percent and then to about 3-1/2 percent next year A quick inspection of that chart indicates that there has been a very large gap between price increases and unit labor cost increases over the past couple of years The increase in markup that has occurred is extraordinary in historical terms; and we're basically just seeing a narrowing of this gap in the period ahead The unit labor cost [increases] will still be running a little lower than the price increases   Well, we've been investing some special effort lately in trying to explain the behavior of debt The major ingredient here is the consumer installment credit; its growth relative to income has been so sharp over the past couple of years There are a number of factors that seem to be at work One, as I mentioned, is that durable goods spending has been exceptionally strong, and that presumably is an area of spending that is relatively debt intensive Another factor is a rather mechanical one For a year or two after the period of credit controls, people seemed to be quite reluctant to use debt [Credit] extensions during that period were depressed and it takes a while for the higher level of extensions subsequently to leave its full imprint on the repayment flows Right now, and over the past couple of years, we've had a relatively low repayment flow from these past extensions, though we have a higher level of extensions currently And as I indicated, in our projection we're expecting a catch-up as the more recent debt is what is mostly reflected in the repayment flow There may be some demographic characteristics involved here Clearly, over the postwar period as the population has aged, the younger generations have been more inclined to use debt There's some evidence of that over time and there are a number of other minor factors But this mechanical matter of extensions and repayments alone, according to some simulations we did, seems to explain a great deal of that debt growth We don't have data anymore on extensions or repayments, but our inference would be that a fairly normal pattern of debt usage relative to the spending that has occurred would have produced this acceleration and should also produce a marked deceleration As to whether it imposes a constraint, the logic would suggest that those individuals who have drawn upon their credit lines and so on and built up some debt may have some marginal constraint on their further spending But this is a widely distributed debt The evidence is that over the past several years it has been people in higher income brackets that have taken on most of this additional debt They presumably have more flexibility and probably have more assets, so it should be only a limited constraint   Well, I confess I have not done the calculation for the residual component of producers' durable goods It's a very logical concept; I wish I had done it This aggregate here includes office and store machinery, communication equipment, scientific engineering equipment, and photographic equipment It is a pretty good piece--almost half--of producers' durable equipment My sense is that if you looked at the rest of the numbers, you would see a much more moderate advance But as things progressed last year, we did see some fairly substantial increases in the heavy machinery area and so on There is the distinction between production and purchase of this equipment Clearly, the share of equipment sales that is going to foreign producers has increased very considerably So the implication for domestic firms and the capital goods industry is one that is not quite as rosy as this picture   Maybe I have those numbers The figure we have for 1984 was total purchases of business capital goods excluding motor vehicles rose $18 billion, of which $10 billion was foreign And the overall penetration is about a quarter   We had some discomfort about the overall debt growth relative to GNP But we also know, as President Corrigan pointed out, that we have had this very strong trend over the past two years In arithmetic terms it seems to have been related to this unusual Federal borrowing, and that will continue We just couldn't really find the basis--in terms of a set of credit flows consistent with our sectoral picture and the GNP forecast--for squeezing out much more debt in the household sector and the business sector I must underscore that the assumption we made about mergers and acquisitions and so on is rather arbitrary We don't see the pattern clearly yet, and it's not inconceivable that we could get a larger amount   There's no model; this is purely judgmental   It's a comparable excess over GNP growth "
2802,1985-05-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, for brevity, I eliminated a sentence in which I was going to refer to gross domestic purchases   For the first quarter, it was 4 percent; and final sales to domestic purchasers was 3-1/2 percent   Yes, I believe so   Ted tells me the 3-1/2 percent final sales to domestic purchasers is unchanged   Well, it is certainly the case that their operating capital account budget surplus position has improved over the past year, and we think it will stay reasonably positive Last year there was some spurt in construction outlays, but on the whole there was not a tremendous growth of state and local expenditures The first quarter of this year doesn't look particularly strong And while there is a lot of talk about a backlog of repair and renovation work that needs to be done, we just don't see the evidence of it I think there is a great deal of caution on the part of many state and local government units about forging ahead with spending programs partly because, given taxpayer attitudes, they don't think they are going to be able to keep all those tax revenues that they got from increasing taxes in earlier years Then there is the question of what will happen both with tax reform and federal spending Both the House and Senate proposals spell the end of grants to state and local government revenue sharing by 1987 So, I think there is a good deal of caution being exercised "
2826,1985-07-09," Well, it is very, very difficult In a sense it conflicts with the wealth figures; on the other hand, one of the    7/9-10/85  things that has prevented wealth from growing so fast has been the mild increase in housing prices, which had been a significant ingredient earlier in wealth growth It appears that there is a combination of factors involved in mortgage delinquencies One is that unemployment is still quite high in an historical sense, and considerably higher than the average in some locales Income growth obviously varies across individuals, so those who took on mortgages earlier perhaps with adjustable rates or with very aggressive underwriting terms--graduated payments or whatever--may find themselves with a greater burden than they can handle readily The fact that the equity in their homes has not built up appreciably or could even be negative, where there is negative amortization, has led them not to fight too hard to hang onto their homes So it is a very complex matter, but those all seem to be ingredients in this picture On the consumer side, the ratio is still fairly low historically but it could easily move higher, given what appears to be rather aggressive lending and very aggressive borrowing in many cases   That's right We don't have any anecdotal evidence that would suggest that the second quarter is going to look worse We polled the senior loan officers at commercial banks last month and they suggested that the first quarter run-up had a bit of a seasonal in it and that they weren't seeing a further deterioration In fact, they did not seem to be very concerned about delinquency rates   We talked to the auto finance companies and they suggested that the next figures may look a little better than the last figures So, we don't see a reversal of the upturn, but there doesn't seem to be a continuing deterioration   I might say, as a cyclical indicator, that many times in the past one of the elements in the downturn of consumer borrowing and of activity in general was a constraint on the supply of credit As rates went up, usury ceilings began to bite and the supply of consumer credit began to diminish So it is a very complex issue, looking at the cyclical history   We felt it was sufficiently important to mention it   The arithmetic is that we have compensation per hour rising a fraction over 4 percent from here on and we have productivity growing at something over one percent on average over the next six quarters So, net, you come out with unit labor costs rising something over 3 percent on average It's conceivable that price movements would move closer to that of unit labor costs and thus give us a bit better inflation performance On the other hand, to the extent that the depreciation of the dollar permits businesses to improve their margins a bit, that will tend to maintain some spread over that period In general, we have things moving fairly closely together--a fairly normal cyclical path   The dollar is depreciating at an 8 percent rate and you are getting an additional price effect You are getting something less than that reflected in import prices   About 12 to 13 percent   Between compensation and labor costs? Yes, approximately    7/9-10/85   A 10 percent decline in oil prices beyond what we have already built in?   We estimated that a $2 to $3 a barrel decline in the oil price could have an effect, over a couple of years, of about one-half percent on the consumer price level   We have a decline in the oil price of $275 a barrel That is worth three-tenths of a percent in the inflation rate next year That's not inconsistent with what I was saying, given the lag structure--about one-half percent for two years   I guess I nailed myself! I think we are being fairly consistent I showed last time, for example, that the stock of non-auto durables for households had fallen off during the early 1980s and had come back considerably through 1984 And in the first half of this year we had continued very strong durables spending So, we think we're pretty near the historical trend line, if that's any indicator of those pent-up demands On the auto side, it is very hard to read It looks like the age of the auto stock has leveled off The level of auto sales that we have in the forecast is historically quite high We have almost 11 million units in total this year and we have it going down to about 10-3/4 million units next year While that does not imply growth in consumer durables spending, it does mean that some of the aging of the auto stock will be reversed probably to a slight degree But we are not seeing any likelihood that supplies are going to be such that we could have very much stronger auto demand And given the income growth that we are projecting, we don't see the basis for projecting very much stronger spending on consumer durables But it is simply a question of how much is behind us Our judgment is that a good bit of that durables pent-up demand is behind us now   It probably has risen considerably further   At BEA Allen Young is Acting Director "
2852,1985-08-20," Yes   Well, it is one of many forms of double counting that are in practice unavoidable because there are many layerings of borrowing and lending in the accounts They are included and they have been sizable this year   There has been about $20 billion worth of refundings thus far this year   That is right   Let's see The [monthly] flow is about [$1700 million]; if it ran [$20] billion for the year, it would be about 1/2 of a percent "
2927,1985-12-16," Governor Martin, I might mention that venture capitalists in various paper surveys have indicated that the relatively low capital gains rates are very important to them With these tax reform proposals, the capital gains taxes would not be as relatively low as they are now, so that some shift--according to these views--might be in store in terms of that kind of entrepreneurship   Even indirectly, to the extent that corporations can recapture some of that So it's a murky area   Yes   You can't really couple the two series that directly, but it sort of looks that way   But it's a different statistical basis "
2952,1986-02-11," It depends on how you do the accounting Our rough estimate is that the impact of the accelerated financing activity last year that was attributable to the concerns about tax reform would tack on roughly a percentage point If you wanted to include all advance refunding activity, much of which was stimulated simply by the fact that interest rates were lower or by other technical considerations, that would move in the direction that President Morris was talking about and you would get a slightly larger figure; it might move toward 1-1/2 percentage point   Well, yes; I think there's no end to this And that's the problem, ultimately, in having an adjusted measure All sectors of the economy tend to borrow and build up assets at the same time Sometimes we can identify special financial strategies that are peculiar, like advance refundings or seasonal debt by corporations, where if we had the data we could chop those amounts off But the    2/11-12/86  fact is that homeowners may borrow more than they need to when buying a home and use that extra cash to build up their liquid assets So if you start taking all these things out, you get down to fundamental sectoral balances which you really can't identify with growth of a debt aggregate   It's hard to choose where the lines should be drawn   Mr Axilrod may want to speak to this, but there were no major deregulatory steps last year that had the immediate effect of shifting funds from one category to another The more cosmic issue in this context is what the cumulative effect of deregulation has been on the character of the aggregates and the associated interest elasticities We think it has altered the character and may explain why there was such an apparent sensitivity to the declining interest rates "
3002,1986-05-20," Mr Chairman, I'd like to just note that L rather consistently has grown a little faster than M3 over the past 3 years and that the first-quarter pattern is the same again It was one half percentage point faster over 1983; 14 percentage points faster over 1984; 08 points faster in 1985; and 07 points faster in the first quarter So the trend really isn't any different thus far this year "
3027,1986-07-08," We approached the second-quarter projections from two sides, adding up all of the available expenditure data we could find--and for inventories that's very limited, given that we have [only] partial data for May in a lot of the real sectors On the other side, we look at the labor input that we have The labor input suggests a rather slow growth, pretty much in line with our forecast The expenditure data are a mixed bag and we come out in the end feeling that that's reconciled with this kind of slight moderation in inventory investment As we look at the industrial sector, we try to guess what's coming in from abroad, and that's very difficult to say I think what is important for the outlook is that even though automobile inventories still seem rather high, the manufacturers seem intent on continuing to produce at a fairly high level They have all of the parts and they will run them out through the end of the model year In other areas of the economy, manufacturers' inventories have declined and don't seem to be a great impediment to growth We just feel that in the trade sector, in retail trade particularly, there is    7/8-9/86  some hint of weakness so that ordering may be a little on the slow side there for a bit But it shouldn't take a major correction   Indeed   Well, state governments in particular Around 30 states, as I recall, have a tax form on which the state's tax rates are applied to the same income concept as the taxable income, or adjusted gross income, that is on one's federal tax return With the changes that are contemplated in personal income taxes--with fewer deductions and so on--that number will be larger Thus, unless the states lower their tax rates, they will experience an increase in the revenues they derive from income taxes There is already some discussion in some states about preventing that from occurring But I think as time progresses and they look at what their budgets are dictating in terms of revenue needs, undoubtedly some of it will be retained That's implicit in our forecast It's a minor element   Those numbers include the direct payments, that is, largely the deficiency payments There is a certain amount that the government is committed to making up if the farmers' prices are below a certain level There is also the dairy cow reduction program [Our number] doesn't include CCC and some of the other programs that Governor Angell was mentioning "
3079,1986-09-23," Yes, that is true   They indicated in their release this morning that those orders still aren't showing up in these latest figures   It's more on a linear scale than a log scale It wouldn't be much if you did it on a log scale "
3104,1986-11-05," He will attempt to Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, let me just say a couple of words, and I know Ted Truman will want to address the broader issue The more interesting recent data on import prices were the BLS figures that were released just last week They showed a substantial increase in the prices of a number of commodity groups--something on the order of a 12 or 13 percent annual rate of increase On the consumer price side, it's very hard to trace these changes in import prices through to what is happening at the retail level It's apparent that some of those groups that would seem to have relatively large import components, say, apparel and automobiles, are showing relative strength in terms of consumer price movements But it's very hard to pin this down Let me let Ted say something about the broader analytical issue on the pass-through of that sort   It's 07 This is one of those quarters in which the movements in imports and import prices do something very exotic to GNP prices and, particularly, the deflator As you can see, the third quarter was 36 percent It was above the recent trend and [the fourth-quarter number] is essentially offsetting that, given the gyrations of imports and the effects of changes in the relative importance of oil prices   All things equal, rising import prices drive down GNP price measures in the short run because imports are subtracted That is one of the recurring novelties I think if you look at the fixed weight measures we are getting some of this showing through   But it's smaller in effect there   Let me check Yes We have a $4-1/2 billion increase in CCC inventories That's roughly the range we have been seeing the last couple of quarters, so there is no gyration in that Basically, it's something that goes through from our overall output estimates   Defense spending in the third quarter was flat and we have a noticeable uptick based on what we would perceive to be the deliveries Obviously, there is some very erratic timing; some procurement items show up or don't show up in any given time period   We don't really have much to go on there There is some elusiveness in tracing the data that we do see to the BEA's translation We can track what is published for construction put-in- place in the state and local sector, but BEA does considerable massaging of those data in estimating the structures component of state and local expenditures Basically, in terms of the overall budgetary situation, we just don't see the likelihood that that kind of growth can be sustained In fact, we have been averaging something like a 45 percent annual rate of growth in state and local construction over the past two quarters; it has really jumped up very rapidly So, we are looking for that to level off quite a bit   Well, we have [unintelligible] this tax effect built in It's rather small but when you annualize these things they begin to look bigger In effect, we have a small payback on the equipment side in the first quarter of next year because we are assuming that they will succeed in accelerating some of their purchases into this quarter and thus capture the more liberal depreciation allowances   We perceive that there is some increase in the cost of capital The tax law changes, if nothing else were changing the outlook, would be tending to depress capital spending But all the other considerations--including the fact that, as we perceive it, real interest rates have declined considerably over the past year or so and there is a long lag in the effects of that on spending--are tending to offset that change Furthermore, we think that as output [unintelligible] demand, firms--particularly in the manufacturing sector--will be more inclined to move ahead toward modernization,    11/5/86  replacing their older equipment, and continuing their efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity It's not really a very rapid growth of investment spending, but we think there is a reasonable foundation   We are still in a situation where it's hard to assess the effects that have already occurred because of anticipations or uncertainties relating to tax reform--whether some of the hit already has been taken or whether people now will move ahead knowing what the laws will be It is very hard to read the current situation   These annualized growth rates for residential investment tend to exaggerate, I think, the movements in housing starts that are in the projection But we have the single-family sector improving a little as 1987 progresses   Well, part of is, I think But it's not really a significant interest rate effect It's more a come-back in terms of the underlying demographic factors And, as construction in the multifamily area winds down and rents begin to show the effects in that area, it's just going to tip the balance a bit further in favor of single-family home ownership, which we think the demographic factors already are going to be favoring But we don't have a tremendous change in the overall affordability of single-family homes   On the single-family side, we move from around 115 in the third quarter up to just over 120 in the second half of next year, so it's not really a dramatic change The multifamily side is continuing to trend downward through most of next year   I'm sure it won't turn out that way Short of forecasting every twist and turn in marketing strategies, we have sales coming back toward what we think will be a reasonable overall pace for the year But yes, [unintelligible] and is consistent with the payback largely being through by the end of this month and things beginning to turn up a bit--perhaps with some renewed incentives, if necessary But we don't at this point anticipate that there will be gigantic incentive programs put in place in the near term    11/5/86   We see them trying to keep things on a stable level, [given] the actions they took in October to cut back their production schedules The [unintelligible] of what we pick up suggests that maybe they are going to move toward a somewhat more realistic approach to their production, so we might see something that is a little smoother, in fact, next year without them pushing so hard to maintain what seems to be an unrealistic market share expectation   Yes   Well, we have certainly attempted to do so Our assessment is that there may be a very small effect A number of factors lead us to think that it will be small One is that many people may already have made the big move to buy an automobile before year-end--in September when they could also get the big price cuts and the rebates and the other financing arrangements A second factor is that, in most states, that sales tax deduction does not bulk very large as a percentage of the price, even for automobiles And what one can bargain with a dealer for may be more important than that Many people [don't] itemize their deductions; furthermore, for goods other than automobiles, people generally are going to be using tax tables and this specific purchase doesn't become an important matter in further deductions So, putting all of these things together, we're looking for just a very small effect in the consumer sector   It moved down   Three things seem to be the major factors there One is that farm subsidy payments were much smaller than they were in the second quarter Those have been a considerable short-run swing factor this year The second factor is that consumer prices were up in the third quarter because oil prices [were no longer] going down or flat as in the first half of the year The third factor, which is also very important in these numbers but is rather obscure, is a substantial increase in personal tax payments that wedges between income and disposable income We have tried hard to track this down with parties elsewhere in the government, but it remains a somewhat obscure area It is something that has been a factor in bouncing the    11/5/86  disposable income numbers around over the course of the year Basically though, we think that underneath all of this is a deceleration in disposable income growth in large measure related to the end of that oil price effect   It seems like whenever I'm up here giving a briefing the same question arises about the productivity figures I think many of these collective bargaining agreements involve the manufacturing sector where the data would indicate that we have been getting fairly substantial increases in productivity--maybe not as much as the anecdotal evidence for individual companies would suggest but, on the whole, quite good gains For this cycle the gains are much more favorable in comparison to past cyclical experience than for the rest of the economy   Well, I guess at least as favorable as--   --previous cycles in contrast to the overall picture But, as you know, the total for the nonfarm business sector has been less favorable and the data, such as they are, show that in a number of the more service-oriented sectors we just aren't seeing productivity improvement   A different aspect of quality in a more secular rather than cyclical area is the question of quality of the labor force Some researchers have suggested that [taking account of] the quality adjustment in the labor force--[based on] indexes like SAT scores or mix of workers or whatever--you find that our labor productivity growth trends have not been as bad in historical context as they look It's a very controversial area   Well, if you wanted to use SAT scores and--   The CPI measure hasn't shown any significant change in the rate of increase recently   Well, I'm not sure we can One thing that may be a source of concern about that measurement is the treatment of vacant units They evidently make some adjustments for the discontinuous movements in rents that occur after units have been vacated While we can't manage to get into the details of how they're actually doing these adjustments we think there could be some upward bias in the measurement of rent increases recently   That's another point The sample may not be capturing the developments across the country correctly because it may not be representative of the current regional mix   Over the next few years foreign car producers are going to have substantial amounts of added capacity   It seems to me that I have seen figures that by early 1990 it will be 1 million units a year; that's a vague recollection   Some of them are creating their own parts- producing facilities "
3128,1986-12-15," That wouldn't enter into President Parry's question because, as you know, it would affect the GNP growth as well It wouldn't affect our estimate of the likely effect of the growth numbers that we have on unemployment   Page 17   Another facet of the recent data is that the household employment series is not showing gains as strong as the payroll series If there were some catch up, as there might well be, we could see the unemployment rate tick down and be more consistent with this pattern that we have seen in the claims recently   I gather, though, that once they have been severed, even if they have gotten some payment, you can expect to see them listed as unemployed and eligible for unemployment insurance   Well, that is assuming--   [Unintelligible] I think we are lower in compensation than they are but less optimistic about productivity growth   The symmetry of the response of the banks to this is a further complication  -15-    12/15-16/86 "
3152,1987-02-10," [Statement--see Appendix] Mr Kichline will now conclude our presentation   Well, the periods in which you find sustained low saving rates are not periods that you would necessarily want to use for purposes of analysis at this time--the Depression, for example, or the early postwar period I think you put your finger on one of the factors in our thinking that as real wages are eroded, there will not be an immediate adjustment of spending patterns We have durable goods purchases growing at a very low rate Our consumption growth is historically very low and we are assuming that this wealth increase that we have seen at least is not erased So, on the basis of those wealth and income levels, we ought to be able to sustain a relatively low saving rate But certainly, we are in somewhat uncharted territory and it's a potential risk in the forecast We decided not to look back at [unintelligible] and say that's a potential risk They are two sides of the same coin   If you look at the annual totals it's gyrating around   This is where we were a year ago; it was essentially the same sort of situation It has happened repeatedly that they find income and the saving rate does go up   We always run into a lot of uncertainties at that time in terms of how fast tax payments are made And this time we will have capital gains taxes that will have to be paid, so it's a very uncertain period   It could, depending Last year, if I remember, we also had a delay in tax refunds due to IRS processing speed "
3177,1987-03-31," If the circumstances that we presume will bring that about didn't occur, real disposable income would be a bit stronger and there would be at least some offsets So we have to look at it simultaneously   For example, if we didn't get the great improvement because import prices didn't rise substantially, then consumer inflation would be less and, in the first instance, real disposable income would be higher so that consumption wouldn't be affected as much Basically, our weak consumption is part of an overall adjustment process that is shifting resources away from domestic consumption   Well, interest rate [unintelligible] and a whole assortment of different variables   Domestic final sales   That's private domestic final sales   Private domestic final sales, consumption and investment   Well, government purchases are down 03, so adding them in would make the number a little lower "
3236,1987-07-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman As usual, we've distributed to you a set of charts; they are entitled ""Staff Presentation"" [Statement--see Appendix]   We've made assumptions about both short- and long-term interest rates As I indicated, we see Treasury bond rates moving back above the 9 percent level that we saw just recently On the short end we are looking at federal funds trading above 8 percent by some time in 1988 That would be a shade less of an increase than you're talking about but in the same general ballpark   I think the answer is that much would depend on such things as what happens to the dollar in the latter part of the current projection period and into 1989 Another uncertainty is, of course, what the implication of any unemployment rate level might be for inflationary pressures But our forecast certainly hints of ongoing pressure on compensation coming from the price increases that we have forecast and the risk that if the dollar continued to decline substantially into 1989 there would probably be some further acceleration in general inflation   That's why I mentioned it for the latter part of 1988   Well, we have some modest growth in manufacturing employment going with the stronger industrial production but those gains are not large by any means We see overall employment growth slowing from the pace of the last couple of years Layered on top of what would be moderate growth in nominal personal income would be more sizable consumer price increases--not more sizable than we've seen in the first half of this year but more sizable by far than we had over the past year or two And thus, that's eroding real income, labor income, by a substantial amount So, as I pointed out, we have gains in income and expenditures of a similar magnitude This is very low growth in consumption expenditures, particularly in a nonrecession period But consumption expenditures have been very high relative to economic activity And consumer durables have been growing very strongly There's probably much less pent-up demand for consumer durables than there has been We think the financial situation on the  -16-    7/7/87  whole is one in which we probably will not see the kind of aggressiveness of spending relative to income that we've seen over the past few years So, that is the story behind our admittedly very weak projection of consumption expenditures   Governor Seger, if that was the impression we left, that was not our intention As I've noted, we have in fact very modest growth of domestic spending in the forecast period We think things may pick up a bit in the near term on the consumer side, but only because there are some autos that have to be cleared away before too long--before we get well into the '88 model year I suppose the recent indicators on business fixed investment have been a bit cheerier and, indeed, if one wanted to be optimistic one could see some upside potential there relative to our forecast Certainly, our forecast is considerably weaker than any of the major surveys-- Commerce, McGraw-Hill, and Merrill-Lynch--would suggest for the remainder of the year If one became particularly bullish on the basis of recent stories about the computer industry maybe we could be on the brink of another resurgence of high-tech spending But basically, our thrust is not toward a boldness in the economy such as you've referred to  -18-    7/7/87   Well, I was thinking of the nominal [GNP], but yes, the Commerce Department takes the experience over the most recent four quarters and applies that as the deflator for the current calendar year's spending That gives us--   We're expecting a fairly low inflation in fixed investment prices this year In fact, that computer factor that I mentioned for the second quarter would put equipment price inflation at essentially zero in that period So it may be that they're not that far off; but looking at nominal spending, the trajectory implied to get their annual total is far steeper than we have in the forecast   Total auto sales next year are a shade over 10-1/2 million units We have about 103 million units for the current year The difference there is something of an artifact of the bulge that we had in the latter half of 1986 which borrowed some from 1987 Looking at it in terms of the year from the fourth quarter we have 107 million units in both years; auto sales provide essentially no contribution to growth for the period from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988 I would note that cars are not the only element of motor vehicle purchases by households at this time The sales of vans and trucks and light trucks are really running quite strong and may persist; that's not something that should be ignored There's little more I can add to what I said earlier about our consumption forecast It's not inconceivable that consumers will not get over their increased bent for spending and that they will continue to spend The short-run income developments, transitory for May, [could lead consumers to be] very optimistic about the future and push consumer spending up further But we think that's not as likely as what we have forecast; we feel that the strength we've seen has been, in part, a reflection of those currents of trade movements or availability of imported [goods] at attractive prices and that has influenced a shift in the direction   Oh, I don't know I'm always very doubtful about the part that Ted is most [unintelligible] But consumer spending is a very big sector, so a small error in one's thinking about it could have a big effect on overall GNP    7/7/87   There is a complex of things involved here Clearly, our overall nominal GNP growth is not very rapid relative to the kind of money that we have built into this forecast It doesn't imply a large amount of interest rate pressure, certainly not more than we have built in On the outlook for the Federal budget, the situation does look less favorable to us now than it did previously In part, that's a result of our ongoing attempts to interpret the effects of tax reform; the pattern of movement from year-to-year doesn't look as favorable at this point as it did before And, of course, with the kind of nominal income growth we have, we're not generating a tremendous growth of Federal revenues Our Federal spending projection is not terribly robust but when we put all these things together, we come out with 1988 much closer--in fact almost identical--to what we have for 1987 now   Yes, I think that's a possibility We have built into our thinking some stimulus to investment coming from this improvement in manufacturing, and that's associated with the trade improvement As we said, we think equipment spending will be fairly strong and we may see some increase in industrial construction, too, as time passes I should note that one other factor that has changed in our thinking from earlier in the year with respect to the 1988 fiscal year budget is the higher level of interest rates that we have seen come about We have that extended a bit into the fiscal 1988 period, so that is adding to the deficit But in a sense that's sort of an artifact; many people would want to look at the so-called primary deficit without interest to get a better guide as to what the underlying movement is But it's adding something significant to these numbers   Well, I must confess I don't think we have specific numbers on the surplus It's clear that the trend over the next decade or more is going to be in that direction; and for the 21st century I assume it's moving in that direction It would be helped by the increase in Federal taxes that will occur the first of the year   We think there's--   Don Kohn has an exhibit that he'll be giving for these--   But if you look at the numbers on a quarterly basis you would see, for example, that our NIA deficit is moderating over the forecast period to the end of 1988 We have about $158 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988; and we have a projection of $187 billion for the current quarter So there is a perceptible downward movement You are quite right about the surplus of the social insurance funds in the state and local sector which is running about $60 billion and edging up in our forecast That sector as a whole, at least as measured in the national income accounts, is moving in the direction of additional net saving to offset some of the Federal deficit   I have to do the arithmetic to get to the net Looking at the government sectors combined, as a percent of GNP we have a 33 percent deficit last year moving down to 26 percent this year and then to 23 percent next year So there's a significant movement this year and then some modest further movement next year while net foreign investment declines by 07 percent over that period That is almost, I'll say, 3/4 of the movement in the government sector In gross terms private saving is about unchanged for 1987 and 1988 in our forecast   As a percent of GNP   Net, right   Well, I think we would have tendencies toward greater inflation and a weaker dollar And the kind of acceleration we would see in the inflation rate next year would be a significant change from what we had I think you would notice it; that up-tilt would be considerably greater These are matters of degree We haven't changed our interest rate forecast from last time to this time The change is not drastic, really, by comparison to what we were looking at earlier in the year [but] we have a substantially greater increase in rates than we anticipated at that time   Yes Maybe you were out of the room when I gave the numbers earlier We have federal funds, for example, rising above 8 percent by some time in the latter part of 1988 We have long-term Treasury bonds moving noticeably above 9 percent   We have them moving back to the highs--maybe toward the 11 percent area   Well, it's clearly an ingredient in the damping of GNP growth in our forecast The fiscal side is one factor; but the financial environment we think will tend to damp domestic demand, and overall pressures on the labor markets will not increase And so--   I can't quarrel with that I would just reiterate my statement that there has to be a considerable uncertainty assigned to one's reading of the implications of a given level of the unemployment rate We think it has gotten in the territory where it will [unintelligible] There are areas of greater tightness; in nondurable manufacturing, for example, there are industries right now that have very high levels of capacity utilization and price pressures are evident there But there's clearly a significant range of uncertainty around it   We did in the early 1980s, I believe We were under the M1 range, and probably ended up--  -33-    7/7/87   We are going to try to reflect the discussion  -49-    7/7/87   We had really good evidence, hard evidence, on the proportion and lots of input on the growth of bits and pieces of--   That also was the last one, August "
3261,1987-08-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we won't know for sure what the second quarter looked like even in next week's numbers At this point, the incoming expenditure flow numbers don't point clearly to an upward or a downward revision For the third quarter, I suppose if we were to recalculate today, our best guess is that our number would be fractionally higher; I would say that it would not necessarily differ significantly from the second quarter But, just on the basis of the retail sales data, we could see a number that would be closer to 3 percent   Well, if we dissect the forecast, the deceleration is primarily in the consumption area and, in part, that reflects better food prices, as I noted And, unless something goes seriously awry, the increase in energy prices in the second half will be distinctly slower than in the first half We may get a little    8/18/87  bulge in the near term, but for the second half as a whole, we are expecting considerable slowing Also, we have been moderately encouraged by the trend in the non-energy services area for consumer expenditures; it seems to have decelerated a bit over the last 6-12 months, so that has carried through for a little while longer in our forecast   Of course, part of that surge in consumption expenditures--and certainly a large part--is in the automobile area where, to get that surge, they're going to have to give some concessions in the way of lower interest rates or a more generous rebate program   Well, I did try to highlight some of the geographic disparities in the chart show [presentation to the Committee] last month, where I showed that, regionally, the unemployment rates are substantially different and we have been seeing different wage trends Clearly, the Northeast is the area where the average unemployment rate has been distinctly lower, and we have not been seeing the wage deceleration, judging by the employment cost index, for example, over the past couple of years Historically, obviously, the economy has never been perfectly level We try to compress this into one statistic, but there are always disparities in unemployment rate levels At the present time, the disparity might be a little greater than it typically has been But, when you get into the question of where the pressure points are going to be, this is hard to say Clearly, there is some slack in some of the prime heavy industry areas of the country On the other hand, some of the industries that may benefit from the improvement in trade are located in areas of the country where the labor markets are a little tighter For example, some industries in the Northeast will probably be benefitting from increased competitiveness We approach this question with a degree of humility We can't state precisely what the natural rate of unemployment is; we assign a fairly broad band, and we recognize that the question of bottlenecks or fortuitous precise matching of the increase in demand to the areas that have the most slack could create some variation in those spots Basically, though,    8/18/87  we think the anecdotal evidence is there It's sort of a Sports Illustrated story Once you're on the cover, it's the kiss of death The Business Week type of headline that we are now in a crunch is overblown a bit We have a sense that the labor market has tightened, though we have not seen the pressures on wages in--   I think if we were to identify the areas in which we would be most likely to get some upside surprises, that is one Our forecast for this year for nominal business fixed investment continues to be below what the surveys were indicating a few months ago, and it's clear that orders are picking up Basically, we have a    8/18/87  forecast, though, that seems in line with historical patterns, giving consideration to the cost of capital and what presumably would be a rather modest accelerator effect here We don't have output growth on the whole as all that strong, so we have a moderate increase in fixed investment But that certainly is one of the areas where a surprise would be less shocking to us   If I may turn briefly to Mr Morris' question, one thing that we've had in our minds as a sort of cautionary note on these orders figures and so on, is that we can't tell how much of that might be potential exports; so, at this point those numbers need to be read cautiously Our view on the oil situation, as I tried to suggest, is that we could see a downside risk Evidently, there has been a considerable move to stockpile oil If we get into another one of these swings where there's a movement toward destocking, and the OPEC swing producers don't cut back promptly enough, we could see at least a temporary drop in crude oil prices, maybe to an even lower level than you've suggested But, basically, we think we have perceived, since the end of last year, a reasonable enough coherence in the OPEC countries in containing production within levels that enable them to sustain prices at their target level So we tend to think that any crunch is likely to be relatively short-lived and would, perhaps, introduce some [unintelligible] in prices of final products, petroleum products But we would be quite surprised to see something that was permanent enough to produce a significantly lower trend in energy prices over the forecast horizon   Mr Chairman, of course, [unintelligible] Governor Seger, if you wanted to adjust your thinking on this in terms of our rule--   But in terms of our rule-of-thumb, $5 a barrel is worth something like a percentage point on the CPI over the course of the year, and significantly less than that, obviously, in GNP prices, in domestic output prices   Effectively   That's the key factor   Well, maybe we didn't successfully answer this, but the productivity numbers are being bounced around by our expectation of what the timing of Labor Day will do to the hours numbers in September We feel that this is a sound enough arithmetic point, in terms of our understanding of how the data have run over the years We have a very low September level in these numbers, which affects the average level of hours in the fourth quarter; so we have this gyration of 2 percent growth in productivity in the third quarter going down to 1/2 percent in the fourth On the compensation side, we have the beginnings of an acceleration in compensation over the second half of this year, but there isn't a big third- to fourth-quarter jump; the big jump there is in the first quarter next year when higher payroll taxes take effect   Well, I'm not sure what kind of analysis you have in mind It's clear that it has been a very significant factor For the year as a whole, we have energy prices contributing 2-1/4 percent, roughly, to the acceleration in the prices of consumption and investment goods It's clear, though, that the first-half acceleration in consumer prices is largely in energy prices; food prices haven't done so well, but that's a rather small contributor to the first-half acceleration; it's primarily energy prices   Short- and intermediate-term business credit?   Well, part of it, we think, is the move to longer-term financing after we had an interruption of the flow, so to speak, when rates backed up earlier this spring The rates came down a little, and maybe [unintelligible] corporate treasurers began to think that they shouldn't be waiting for still more decline They seem to have come to market in significant size As best we can sort these things out, that's the one thing we can put our finger on that the data would seem to support very clearly We don't see it as reflecting a sudden drop-off in inventory accumulation, for example; the data just don't show that   I haven't had an opportunity to commit all this to memory yet You're focusing on which year?   Basically, we assumed, in addition to some Congressional action that has already occurred, that something akin to their program will be adopted--an action which gives you on the order of $35 billion in deficit reduction That's on a par with the Congressional budget resolution number as well The outlay number for 1988 that they have now is $8 billion a month above their January estimate Obviously, the revenue is the other thing, and the receipts number is $7-1/2 billion below the January estimate That's largely a reflection of the downward revision in their forecast of corporate income tax receipts That's the major [unintelligible] On the outlay side, they have had to respond to the higher interest rates they have seen They're expecting somewhat higher interest payments and they're also responding to the higher inflation that we've had, which will feed through to a larger cost-of-living adjustment for social security recipients and federal pension recipients These are the major features of the changes of the baseline for the 1988 budget number "
3285,1987-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I can be relatively brief this morning [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the greater strength is clearly on the export side As we go out through the forecast period to the end of next year, we have very modest increases in imports; indeed, we would expect that real merchandise imports, not only [nominal] merchandise imports, will be going down slightly, largely in response to the past and prospective depreciation of the dollar We are also anticipating, of course, that domestic spending--consumption, in particular--will be growing rather slowly, so we won't be sucking in great volumes of imports because of the continuation of the kind of demands we have seen previously   That's very difficult to get a handle on The anecdotal evidence--or if you want to characterize it in more solid terms than that, the kinds of survey information that are gathered by McGraw Hill and others--suggests that vis-a-vis historical experience, a distinctly above-average percentage of this planned spending is designated as being for replacement, modernization, and so on Clearly, in many industries there is plenty of capacity; in others there is less And one can identify some areas of significant expansion of capacity, with additional plants being built But, generally, as we are looking at it, the major thrust will be on continuing to reduce costs, to modernize product line, and so on   For materials, the lead times have been lengthening I think, implicit in your comment, is the question of whether they have increased to levels that are not comfortable, and I suspect that the strategy in many firms has been to run with a little tighter capacity than they might have in the past And they may not be uncomfortable with what they are seeing In the capital goods area, average lead times don't seem to have lengthened much yet; and that is probably consonant with the evidence that the capacity utilization in equipment producing industries is not especially high-- not what one sees in some nondurable material areas, for example   I take it you are going to zero on the deficit reduction action with that   I think that is probably a little higher than our normal econometric results would give us, but it is clearly the direction in which we would go At this point, the $25 billion looks like a reasonable ballpark figure, given what is being discussed currently in a compromise--a Gramm-Rudman revision that would be something like $23 billion, with no loan sales or that sort of thing But I suppose there are still some risks that it would be less than what we have and the result might well be somewhere in between that zero and the $25 billion that we have   Well, the forecast isn't generated by a model, per se As we go through and estimate the income flows, we definitely do take account of the interest rate path that we've assumed and projected And we do have substantial growth in personal interest income over the projection period   I guess I wasn't clear The assumption is that the dollar will decline further over the forecast period For our purposes, we put in a straight line path that averages about 10 percent, at an annual rate   It isn't necessary that there be a precise course We put in a smooth trajectory that moves the federal funds rate, for example, into the 8 to 8-1/2 percent range by next spring   We would be approaching it by the end of the first quarter I don't want to be too precise about this If there were flatness over the next few months and more increase later on, we wouldn't be able to distinguish the economic effects in the forecast for the period as a whole But we do have a gradual rise here   There's a difference in our forecast between the deflator and the fixed-weight GNP measure In the fixed-weight index, we have 3-1/4 percent for the third quarter and 3-1/2 percent for the fourth, whereas there's a deceleration from 3-1/4 percent in the third quarter down to 2-1/2 percent in the deflator The difference there is the peculiarities of weighting shifts that occur in the GNP deflator; and the decrease in oil imports, which have a relatively low weight in the deflator, actually tends to depress the GNP deflator relative to the fixed-weight measure Basically, we have a fairly steady second-half inflation, as we see it; it's lower than in the first half, in large part because of lower food and energy price inflation   In some underlying sense, there is a fairly stable picture between the first and second half, but that's in this game of stripping away food and energy prices, which obviously are affected by special nonmacroeconomic influences in the short run Of course, there are peculiar things that affect other sectors, as well But, basically we have a fairly stabilized underlying trend, and some increase next year in the rate of price inflation   Some people would take that as an indicator of the underlying rate of inflation And yes, we do, as compensation accelerates significantly next year In that sense, the underlying trend is picking up   It's purely conjectural at this point Various econometric models would suggest that, over the relevant horizon here, you are probably dealing with an interest rate elasticity of about 1 We have a rise in mortgage rates from around 10-1/2 percent to something in the high 11's, [an increase of] roughly 10 percent We have roughly a 10 percent decline in housing starts, from 16 million to something around the 145 million area In that sense, it's well in line with the historical patterns The other thing that provides some comfort--   Well, I'm looking at it in the aggregate clearly, they are both to be affected by the change in interest rates Looking at it from another angle, mortgage rates are back up to levels we saw in 1985, and we had considerably higher housing starts then--in the 17 million area Now, we've probably gone through some catchup period in home ownership, but that number seems fairly reasonable to us, looking at the response we've seen just so far to the substantial increase in mortgage rates It hasn't made the market fall apart entirely We may not have it quite right, but this is a stab at what we think is a normal response   Well, clearly, we felt that we would be seeing much of that response by this summer, before we even elevated our rate forecast beyond what we had earlier We only had a modest further decline below the 16 million level in our previous forecast As we have taken the mortgage rates up more, we have lowered the housing starts further It's very difficult to say As you noted, there are other influences at work, and there may still be some adjustment to the tax law changes There are still some problems of high vacancy rates in home rental properties in various parts of the country Again, when you look at house prices, there too, the evidence suggests that, at least in many markets, there's still a pretty robust demand at these interest rates And there is just no anecdotal evidence to suggest to us that we are way off the mark in our assessment of demand positions Even the survey information suggests pretty high numbers  -10-    9/22/87  of people whose attitude is that this is a good time to buy a house That may be surprising, but that seems to be the pattern   One of the main comforts we can find in the numbers is that it looks to us like the trend in real exports has been quite strong thus far And based on our exchange rate projection and the assumption that there are probably still lags in the order and delivery process, that means that some of the improvement in exports is still not fully evident We think that we are forecasting, basically, a continuation of patterns that are already perceptible In some respects, I think a greater concern, given our outlook, would be that we get both the improvement in the net exports somehow, and also get greater domestic demand growth That puts still greater pressures on resources than some people would have thought in the past We have two years now, in our forecast, of consumption growth that is really subpar historically So, in a sense, we have these things put together in a way that gives you a rather smooth adjustment to the picture   That's what characterizes our outlook and I think some of the comments around the table suggest that there is a hopeful aspect of this--that everything falls nicely into place   In other words, the dollar--I wasn't clear what--   Well, it's difficult to dissect this precisely, but I think we are dealing mostly with a process that looks at the real first, infers from that the pressures on resources, which then feed back through a short-run Phillips curve relation to the wage and price side That's a stylistic characterization   I might just note that, while industrial production is growing much more rapidly than we think GNP is growing this quarter--and the IP numbers must be regarded as still quite tentative--that growth is well within the range of variation in that relationship And for the year as a whole, the gap is rather moderate So, at this point, we don't see a big disparity in the signals coming from the industrial sector or industrial production estimates and GNP, particularly when you start [unintelligible] GNP goods output that most reasonably can be compared in industrial production  -14-    9/22/87 "
3317,1987-11-03," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, both of them were down The Michigan survey's sentiment index was down, as President Morris noted, in the period after October 19th Basically, they had about a third of their month's sample in that period and they looked at that group alone Obviously, the statistical reliability is less, but they felt that the sharp drop was statistically significant That put the level well below the plateau we have been at, and that is the clear distinction from the picture that one gets in looking at the very limited poll that the Conference Board did after October 19th That showed a drop, but it was only a small departure from a very strong uptrend in the last several months; it seems to have reflected people's perceptions that the job opportunities were very good, and that propels that index directly in a way that the Michigan index doesn't reflect   Clearly, one of the things in our forecast that all along has been a key factor affecting the pattern of output growth happened we believe, in large part, because of the exchange rate depreciation Partly because of the oil price movements earlier, we believed that we would have some erosion of real disposable income  -11-    11/3/87  growth and thus some damping of consumer demand, which would release the resources to support the substantial improvement in real net exports I might just say that the pattern we are projecting is not a departure from what we have been seeing over the past year or so Rather consistently, PCE prices have been rising faster than GNP prices in a period in which real disposable income growth has been considerably slower than real GNP growth We have a continuing decline of the dollar in our forecast and we have a continuation of this pattern of relative price movements We looked at the historical record We think there are perceptible relative price movements that can be seen during a period of the dollar's appreciation--an interruption of a previous trend We have seen this ratio of PCE prices to GNP prices rising rather markedly over the past year and we expect that to continue Clearly, if somehow this didn't occur, there would be implications for income shares and output patterns that could significantly affect the outlook We think this really has been a perceptible trend recently and that the conditions that brought that about will be prevailing still in the future   If I could just cite some figures Going back to the third quarter of 1986, the PCE fixed-weight price measure rose 1 percentage point faster than the GNP prices; in the fourth quarter it was 07 faster; in the first quarter of 1987 it was 12 percentage points faster; in the second quarter it was 11 faster; and in the third quarter it was 08 faster We have a more moderate relative movement in the forecast than we have been experiencing We also have looked at outside forecasts and, generally, they have this relative movement in a similar range; some of them have it less than ours, some of them have it considerably more than ours When we look at the fixed investment prices and what might be going on there, there may be some wrinkles in terms of the construction of the index As I understand it, that is constructed largely out of PPI data, which would be the domestically produced goods You might not have the direct kind of import price measurement in the way these numbers are    11/3/87  constructed as you do with consumer goods, which would sample imports directly as well That's a minor factor   We would certainly be happy to consult further with your staff In the second half of last year, energy prices in PCE were falling rapidly   Well, I guess we differ on this We have had some discussion with your staff who raised the question with us and--   Obviously, as you know, it's a confluence of two things One is how fast industrial output is growing, which is quite sensitive to the mix of output in the economy; and the improvement in trade is reflected in growth of industrial production and a manufacturing component that is stronger than overall GNP growth by a point or more next year The other component in this calculation, obviously, is an assessment of capacity growth Business fixed investment, which had been weak for a while, rebounded in the last couple of quarters; some of this rebound reflected a spurt in automobile sales which presumably will not be sustained Of course, it takes a little while for growth in PDE to feed through the substantial increases in the stock of capital goods We have a relatively weak investment outlook, so from that side of things we wouldn't see tremendous additions to capacity over the coming year We have a relatively moderate growth in capacity--about 3 percent or a bit below--   It's higher than GNP but it is in line with the growth of industrial output and slightly below the manufacturing growth rate So we get this very slight inching up--it probably should not be called inching but milimetering up--of the capacity utilization rate Assessing capacity utilization is always difficult As you know, we recently put out our annual revisions; the revisions didn't really adjust the overall level very much but there were noticeable changes in some of the industries We have to be alert to  -13-    11/3/87  whatever we can pick up on what is going on in actual capacity The linkage between investment and actual capacity is not all that tight   Well, I hope so Of course, to the extent that they are currently lean and have not been hoarding extra labor, as there are dips in output, there is not going to be as much room to reduce employment Of course, once we have determined how aggressive they are, then we would [know more about] how persistent the effect of weakness will be We have distinctly slower employment growth in our forecast than we have been experiencing; and we do have the unemployment rate going up, read literally here, 04 of a point over the next couple of quarters from the 59 percent level we saw in the past month It's hard to say how far this would go once the process is underway; but our forecast is one in which we have only a brief interruption of the recent growth path And under those circumstances, we presume they would not have unloaded tremendous amounts of [unintelligible] labor   Many of them clearly have more flexibility than in the past because of their use of workers who were not strictly on their payrolls but were hired through temporary help firms So, those workers probably would be laid off during--   Mr Corrigan has probably perceived one of the sharpest jumps in unemployment   Well, it's very difficult to assess precisely what the demand and production adjustments are going to be in this short period of time As I suggested in my remarks, we built in a fairly prompt response of consumption and we also built in a fairly prompt response of production The inventory accumulation we have is a combination of the automobile inventory rebuilding that is occurring as sales have dropped off after the special incentive period, and the automakers' having moved up their production a bit from the very low third-quarter level We also, though, have some significant accumulation outside that sector Some of that is involuntary but, going into the early part of this quarter, some is still voluntary in the manufacturing sector where it appeared that inventories were very lean and that there was some desire to at least keep the stocks in line with sales So, I think it's a mixture of voluntary and involuntary elements that leads to some adjustment early next year in production But, we have assumed a relatively smooth path for developments in the next several months   Apart from the auto situation   Well, we don't rely totally on our econometric models, of course Sometimes we depend on them very little when the circumstances suggest that there are just tremendous departures from the historical norms--shocks that would disturb recent trends But, I guess in this case I'd say that they are reasonably supportive of this kind of view It's clear, though, that there are downside risks in this forecast, should the stock market have a more dramatic effect than we have gauged it to have at this point   I did try to highlight the fact that this might have greater shock value than it otherwise would have, if that's possible   I think the amount of courage that is required is far less for the staff than for the policymakers "
3341,1987-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] Mr Chairman, I think I'll conclude on that decisive note   Basically, we have both long and short rates declining between 1/2 and 1 percentage point by the middle of the year   Given the elasticity of response of some of these sectors, that's not an enormous amount; but it's certainly noticeable in terms of the increments that we have been talking about around the table   Yes   We used our quarterly model to try to answer that question and, essentially, if we just held the funds rate where it is, that tighter monetary policy would chip off a fraction of the GNP growth over the coming year Most of the effect would be in the second half of the year, so that we probably would not see a very noticeable pickup in the second-quarter rate For the year as a whole, growth would be somewhere approaching 1/2 percentage point less, according to the model   I wouldn't--   That is just an experimental tool that has been under development for a while and we don't approach our forecasting by add factors, so to speak, to that model That model was done with a minimal amount of judgmental add factoring and tended to be very responsive to incoming data, and we've been working to moderate that As a matter of fact, the one that you have doesn't incorporate the inventory data we received or the housing starts released today, and it has a fairly strong short-run sensitivity to the stock market I think that is one of the factors that yielded the negative result for the first quarter But let me just say that, given those confidence intervals, I wouldn't want to try to distinguish very much between that reading and growth in the 1 percent neighborhood in the first quarter of next year  -47-    12/15-16/87   I think that model has difficulty picking up such things as incentives in the automobile market and many other things So, I wouldn't want to make much out of that difference As I suggested, if you apply any reasonable confidence interval around our projection, you certainly can't rule out a negative quarter in the first or second quarters   I think that the permits number was about unchanged in November from the October level   Given the volatility of these numbers, that's certainly an insignificant change Basically, the number doesn't appear to be inconsistent with the starts level running somewhere between 15 and 16 million over the next couple of months So, I think that's very much in line with our sense of not very much going on at this point in the housing market Our forecast doesn't show much of a movement in coming months   I suppose it is possible, if the outcome is similar to our forecast, that people who would want to read the money stock numbers as having those kinds of implications would feel that they had been vindicated; that would be a noticeable slowing from what we have seen over the first few quarters of this year We don't approach the forecasting process with that kind of simple connection of money stock to nominal GNP and real GNP outcome But obviously, if we had forced money stock growth to be faster this year, then we would have had, at least for a while, lower interest rates and possibly a lower dollar, and a number of other events which might have strengthened the outlook for nominal GNP in the coming months So I don't see an inconsistency; but we're not putting a heavy weight on that monetary deceleration per se now   Well, I think much depends on money demand behavior Our forecast is not built on an assumption that we will  -48-    12/15-16/87  continue to have that kind of slow growth We have M2 and M3 growing at rates that are well within the target ranges tentatively set for next year So that would represent, particularly in the case of M2, a noticeable acceleration from what we've been seeing   I don't think we have a really current set of numbers from the Administration I suspect that if the Administration is right, in essence it would be because there is a stronger [economic] performance That's the answer itself I think that's largely where we differ with the Administration in terms of their mid- session review prognostication for FY 1988   Well, we built into [our forecast] their succeeding, in essence, in what they agreed to in the compromise session That is a moderate restraining influence on aggregate demand in the coming year, but it's not an enormous effect It's one more ingredient that one wouldn't want to overlook It's a magnitude of roughly half a percentage point on GNP   I tried to suggest that if indeed we get that kind of greater weakness in consumption expenditures, there probably would be some higher level of inventories, which would tend to weaken the early part of next year At this point, given the uncertainty of these numbers, I am more inclined to think of it as enhancing the likelihood of our getting the kind of deceleration that we forecast in the first part of next year rather than influencing the [unintelligible] level we forecast But I think we had a rather brave forecast in that we were looking for a very noticeable slowing in production growth without having any real sense that there was an inventory accumulation going on to trigger it Basically, we have a very rapid response of producers to that incipient weakening If it turns out that consumption is weaker in this quarter than we think it has been, it's almost certain we would get that kind of slowdown   As I said, we would expect a fairly prompt response in which production would slow down considerably in early 1988 if we do get that pattern I must say, some of it would probably show up in reduced import demand, thus not affecting domestic production so heavily But at this point I just don't have the feeling that the inventory position, by and large, is that uncomfortable Certainly, it didn't show up in the Beige Book, which is the information from two or three weeks ago While you hear these stories, and they vary in the retail sector, there isn't much else to suggest we're getting massive inventory accumulation   From my less informed standpoint, the anecdotal evidence and the manufacturing employment numbers and physical products data that go into our industrial production index just don't jibe with that kind of disappointment on the export side I think everything is pointing to substantial export growth In fact, that gives us some confidence that probably this will turn out to be noise and that there will be some offsets in coming months   Just to cite the numbers in our February Greenbook we had forecast 10 percent growth in real exports, and we have 15 percent at this point And our confidence has definitely increased since [several] months ago   Looking at the labor market data, we could easily see 3 percent [GNP] growth But I recall that a year ago in the fourth quarter we were looking at very strong labor input, and even after GNP revisions we only ended up with 1-1/2 percent So there's considerable looseness in this; but there is the potential for it being strong if, as we hope, it wasn't all inventory "
3377,1988-02-09," As we see this, we don't believe that the overhangs are widespread or that they are very large  SPEAKER(?) I agree with you   As for automobiles--indeed, the automobile inventory reduction is progressing a bit faster than we had anticipated, since auto sales in January were stronger than we had built into our first-quarter forecast  SPEAKER(?) Yes   It's conceivable, certainly to the extent that there isn't a response early on to any excessive inventory accumulation, that we could build up a larger problem, which subsequently could give us more of a cycle [Unintelligible] we'd have an even more dramatic inventory correction earlier in this upswing--and we have been through a number of short-run corrections-- and, of course, that's a critical ingredient  SPEAKER(?) Following up on that inventory question--the distinction between manufacturing inventories and retail inventories I think what you show here in the charts is consistent with the anecdotal evidence that one picks up However, there's one area where I, at least, haven't been able to get very much anecdotal evidence You mentioned it and I've heard it elsewhere And that is that some of the accumulation in retail inventories was planned--was desired in effect--to beat higher prices for imports Could you expound on that?   Well, I think that's very hard to pin down And it isn't just prices, but also perhaps in the case of apparel in the    2/9-10/88  earlier part of last year, the concerns about quota restrictions The more general issue on prices is whether manufacturers, for example, saw the materials input prices increasing very sharply in some cases, and [since] interest rates looked negative in real terms, whether one saw some effort to accumulate inventories in the manufacturing sector There was accumulation It wasn't any faster; in fact, it was slower, than the increase in output And it's not inconceivable that there could still be some significant desire to build up inventories further We do have some moderate accumulation of manufacturers' stocks For example, in the latest purchasing managers' report for January, there is explicit comment to the effect that there was some reaction not only to some shortages of goods and the lengthier delivery times, but also to some anticipatory price increases   Well, I suppose that is certainly something fundamental to the Committee's decision-making I don't think we've misread how the Committee has behaved in terms of putting a significant importance on maintaining growth and avoiding increases in unemployment In terms of overall resource utilization to have anything significantly slower than the GNP growth we have would basically bring about some greater degree of slack It is conjectural whether we have precisely captured the desires of the Committee, but ultimately, we ended up with a forecast that sort of gave you about as much growth as we think you can get without putting enough pressure on the economy to get a real momentum developing in the inflation process   Indeed, the plant and equipment surveys would suggest a stronger year-over-year gain than we have for nominal business fixed investment Those surveys, as you know, were taken before the stock market [developments] were probably fully assessed The Commerce surveys overlap that We think this is consistent with    2/9-10/88  the general output growth path that we have in terms of the usual accelerator effects We don't have any particularly favorable developments in the cost of capital We think there will be areas of significant strength, and I've tried to relate that to those areas of capacity utilization On the other hand, there are other areas in this economy, if we are right about the overall level and pattern of demand, where the stimulus to investment will not be as great Obviously, in the financial sector, which is shrinking, they probably are not going to be buying as many computers and other office equipment Demand for office space may be lower There are drags in a number of sectors of business fixed investment as we see it the office area in general, hotels, and probably areas that we have missed in other commercial construction So we have balanced these divergent elements in what we think is a forecast that is really consistent with historical patterns, given the overall level of growth in final demand and the financial commitments   The question is whether this is indicative of what's going on in domestic demands   I think the Chairman's remarks do raise a very important point on this trade picture If you look at the nondefense capital goods orders, the average lead time--when you take out the aircraft, which really has enormous backlogs that will keep them in business well into the 1990s--showed very substantial growth in the earlier part of last year I think we may have shown this in the Greenbook But then the fourth-quarter increase wasn't really very great So with that caution--  SPEAKER(?) I'm skeptical about that fourth-quarter number   It's a volatile series from month-to-month But I think, perhaps in terms of its leading indicator value--and it probably doesn't point very far into the future--that it's one little hint that there may be some moderation in that area    2/9-10/88  SPEAKER(?) Isn't the consensus forecast of the P&E probably in excess of 5 percent growth? Most forecasts, that I've seen at least, have much more strength   I'd have to look But I think our BFI forecast is not much out of line with some of the other major ones For example, for our 1988 forecast, we have 45 percent--[turning to staff] is that an annual average? DRI has 51; the Bluechip indicators 51 They're comparable; it's a very small difference   Governor Angell, let me just say--I don't want to be unduly defensive about this assumption--we aren't making this a normative prescription for the Committee As I tried to emphasize, we saw the economy and its current position, and looked at this question of how much room for growth there was But in a sense, to us, the issues in the forecast and in this context are sort of asymmetrical-- we were looking at how much room we felt there was to grow without moving the inflation trend much away from what it has been That's all we were trying to communicate with that assumption   Well, for one, I think there is this question of dynamics in expectational effects I think we always run into this question when we take into account a tighter policy It always requires higher interest rates in the short run And you have to get the lower growth to have money balances in line with desired levels, and you could then get some different paths thereafter But this is our best guess, using our models, of what the difference would be from the forecast we have made And yet it's not prescriptive; it's just trying to give some sense of the sensitivity of our forecast to the assumptions about exchange rates and monetary growth   It certainly wouldn't put rates out of the range of recent years   There has been a great deal of commentary on this number 1 think we pointed out, perhaps in the Greenbook, that there were subsequent shipments data that on the surface looked stronger than BEA had on this But the translation, with the limited data they have, is a very complicated one There are shipments of exports as well as domestic purchases; there are intermediate goods, which shouldn't show up in the end; there are questions about the seasonal patterns and the seasonal adjustment that goes into this because of tax law changes And the P&E number was dragged down by automobile sales, which are not part of the shipments data So, it's a very complicated calculation And I guess, while we certainly expect it to revise to some degree, it isn't clear that we won't still end up with a decline in P&E in the fourth quarter   The PDE decline was 7 percent It's 36 percent for total BFI for the fourth quarter I'd just like to emphasize that this seasonal adjustment phenomenon will bounce the numbers around for some time in the future Under the old depreciation rules, a company could buy something in December and get, I guess, a half year's depreciation With tax reform, if you pile too much into the fourth quarter for tax purposes, you are penalized And so the seasonal factors in the last several years--as you may recall, we have seen wild fourth quarter-first quarter swings--were probably beginning to capture that at just the wrong time, when this incentive was eliminated And that could bounce the numbers around in the future  SPEAKER(?) That's a good point    2/9-10/88  SPEAKER(?) [It could affect the] third-quarter/fourth- quarter swing now, because you have the third quarter up about 26 percent  SPEAKER(?) Yes   We don't exactly go into this with a clean slate each time There is a certain follow-through from earlier [forecasts] But I guess we didn't have the feeling that overall production growth was going to tail off quite as fast as we had built in [earlier], just based on the orders trends and the employment data at the end of the year We had the sense that consumer spending was not falling apart as the year ended It was looking very weak in the early fall and didn't show much growth at the end of the year, but it didn't seem to be falling apart We surmised from that, and everything else we could look at, that probably the stock market psychological effects were not as great as we might have feared they would be This forecast is not a drastic change by any means from our last forecast; we're talking two-tenths of a percent on overall GNP And there is a certain amount of arithmetic momentum in this I don't view the change in the first half as being a very great change As I noted last time, we perceive the slowing in the first half to come about in two ways either that final demand will be weak and producers will react really fast to that before inventories build up; or that inventories would begin to build up and we'd see some adjustment of production in this process And we sort of got the second [from the] emerging data; final sales in the fourth quarter were somewhat disappointing So we have about the same outcome, but there's a slightly different story   Well, I don't think history identifies clear trigger points Indeed, econometrically, our efforts to identify capacity utilization effects on investment turn up only modest positive results on that score We tried to look beyond any econometric evidence, and sift through what stories we could find and conversations with people I think there is something, as I indicated, to the story of some hesitancy on the part of some companies to expand capacity aggressively But on the other hand, we can also uncover stories that, yes, at some plants operating at high levels of capacity, capacity is being expanded by removing bottlenecks We are expecting some fairly sizable gains in paper and chemicals   Yes Even a couple of years ago there were probably already signs of movement in the paper industry, involving plans for putting more production [capacity] in service   This is a very difficult question We sorted through some of the data and tried to put our finger on how many dollars' worth of imports there are in this inventory overhang At least arithmetically, that appears to be presently in the retail sector; it doesn't amount to a lot of dollars, as best we can assess It's probably a small proportion and would not be a significant factor   We think the domestic industry, on net, is not going to benefit from this It's a complicated story, but as best we  -10-    2/9-10/88  can tell, it's probably the domestic industry that will experience the greatest negative effect from the inventory accumulation If you felt that there was the beginning of some shipping [unintelligible] into domestic firms, then the effect is going to be felt more by the domestic firms, even if the inventories on the shelves have a relatively higher import ingredient So it's very complicated And I think that, in terms of foreign economic activity, it's probably at most a second-order factor   Let me address that from the way we started this forecast, rightly or wrongly If, for example, foreign activity were  -11-    2/9-10/88  to be weaker, and from that we got weaker demand for US production, it would naturally follow that we would tend to have more monetary expansion, and initially at least, a movement to lower interest rates That would produce some offsetting boost to domestic demand We haven't needed to do that, in a sense, to get this kind of growth, because we have the assumptions we do about foreign economic activity and the dollar As we view the saving rate question, I think picking out the first quarter probably overstates what we would perceive to be the movement in consumer behavior The fourth quarter had a very big increase in farm subsidies, and farm proprietors' income was up very sharply We think that group tends to have a comparatively low marginal propensity to consume, so that tended to boost the saving rate We may also have a somewhat similar phenomenon in the first quarter, with a big increase in government transfer funds from the social security COLA increase Unless that is spent very rapidly, we would tend, in the short run, to have a slightly higher saving rate I think the potential would be a fairly high marginal propensity--   Yes, but I think it's a question of just how quickly that occurs If one looks at the average saving rate for this year versus the average for last year--let alone what it was in the middle couple of quarters last year versus this year--I think there's a noticeable increase in the saving rate And it's one that we do view as being generally consistent with the kind of wealth effect that we are building in from the stock market Crudely, the general model results would suggest that you might get something on the order of a 1 percent higher saving rate for a period of time--well, there would be a gradual adjustment to that I think we have some reasonable comfort with the range we're showing--tailing off next year, as it came out in our forecast We can't really provide any particular explanation for it The saving rate is to some extent a residual in the forecasting process, though it's a check We don't view it as a really significant movement from what we see in the latter part of this year to the latter part of next year But if consumers do retrench, and they're a very big segment of the economy, then it would take a substantial offsetting action of some sort to keep the economy on the same track So, in that sense, it is really crucial "
3401,1988-03-29," [Statement--see Appendix]   Mr Chairman, I might just apprise the Committee of the data made available this morning One is the leading indicators series, which shows an increase of 9 percent in February, compared with a 11 percent decline the previous month We also have new home sales which were up 20 percent in February, but to a level that's just around the fourth-quarter average That's consistent with the other housing data we see   It wasn't significant, but it was 3   The current number for the fourth quarter on nonfarm inventories is $57-1/2 billion, at an annual rate We had $53-1/2 billion in the Greenbook, which went out before the GNP release It's not very much different; there's a slightly different level of auto inventories primarily In our forecast, the rate of inventory accumulation declines by $20 billion in the first quarter to around $34-1/2 billion That is, in a sense, a significant drag on output growth in the first quarter, and it occurred basically in the auto industry We had, essentially, a $20 billion dollar swing in the rate of inventory investment in the auto industry and that accounted for something on the order of a percentage point on GNP But the surprise for us--as the data look at this point, and that's what we're building into our forecast--is that outside of automobiles the rate of inventory accumulation does not seem to have slowed in the first quarter In the last forecast, I think we put in something on the order of a $10 billion decline in the rate of non-auto inventory accumulation So, in that sense, to the extent that businesses weren't as anxious to reduce stocks, you could view that as something of a plus for the economy in the first quarter relative to our expectation   I think we feel we are in a zone where there is considerable uncertainty The capacity utilization rates are not even across industries We already have seen price pressures in some industries that we think are a function not just of the dollar decline but of actual pressures on capacity, with a backlog in orders that has built up There are many manufacturers who have their customers on allocation They seem to have been rather restrained, to date, in their pricing In fact, in some cases, they could probably be more aggressive but don't seem to be moving that way because of longer-run considerations, such as their customer relationships and so on But the kind of increase we've had in capacity utilization doesn't signal to us a major change in that picture At this point, we think there are risks If we were to write down a still higher number, our degree of discomfort, or our worry about pressures, could materially change   That's a hypothesis I don't want to test!   I think that's what is suggested by our forecast, but there is uncertainty about many elements of this One is on the labor markets side As I suggested, our work to date has failed to find convincing evidence that the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is lower than we currently are The range of our estimates is from around where we are to a higher level Others have looked at these things differently and have come up with conclusions that may give us a bit more room on the downside So, for the labor market side, maybe it isn't quite the razor's edge that this kind of forecast suggests On the capacity side, [unintelligible] just how things turn out in the mix of demands and how rapidly expansion of capacity occurs in the particular industries where demand is strongest So, I would characterize the picture as being a little mushier than these precise numbers suggest; but we do think that we're pretty close in our bottom line assessment   In the models, it generally would be constructed with some discontinuity on this, so when you get there, then things emerge But we also know we can't pinpoint it Looking at different variations on structural models and different estimating periods and so on, we can get a very broad range of estimates   For last year, it's a matter of interpretation to some degree To put it in mathematical terms, there are other terms in those equations One of them would be expectations about prices, and that could have given us the surprise we had last year, as opposed to the natural rate being different than we anticipated in our models That is something we have taken into account in our forecast, in that individuals may not be setting their expectations as high as the recent inflation experience would suggest is necessary to maintain real wages, because they are fearful about losing their jobs in the very competitive international marketplace particularly   It could look that way   It depends on which terms you want to adjust here, and it's not entirely clear That's one way In fact, if you back out the natural rate from our recent experience it suggests that what we built into our forecast--if you take the price expectations being developed in the usual way--could be a natural rate that is around 4 - 45 percent That is the calculation; but we don't really think that the natural rate is that low So, we think there is something else going on in terms of the expectations of labor and management at this stage [unintelligible] consistent with our forecast   I guess it's a question of whether the glass is half empty or half full--how much of these price increases you see coming in materials and so on that you view as part of a broader phenomenon or as one-time relative price adjustments But the list of items that purchasing managers report in short supply has lengthened considerably; and there seem to be lots of reports of supplies being tight and various materials and components [unintelligible]   They don't seem to be terribly anxious about getting goods They're not ordering very much farther in advance than a quarter So, your bottom line of there being some areas where we should look at this carefully is, I think, [right] We think things have tightened up, but it's not clear to us that there is imminent danger of broad acceleration   What we do see is a mixture of things We have capacity utilization at the point where product markets have gotten tighter; there is more pricing discretion on the part of many manufacturers If we do continue to get the effects on import prices from the decline of the dollar, if wages do begin to pick up as a lagged adjustment to the price increases that we have already seen and the lower rate of unemployment, that is an environment where I think pricing could firm considerably   Well, I guess we have the usual forecast We think that thrift earnings might be cyclical [unintelligible]--I'm sorry, I just don't have that "
3424,1988-05-17, Do you mean April to July? Because we don't know-- 
3447,1988-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman We shall be referring to the materials labeled ""Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee"" [Statements--see Appendix]  [Secretary's note No transcript exists for the remainder of the afternoon session, which presumably included questions to staff following this presentation]  [Meeting recessed]    6/29-30/88  June 30, 1988--Morning Session "
3489,1988-08-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman Ted will be following me with some comments on this morning's trade data as well as some remarks on the implications of recent foreign exchange market developments  [Statement by Mr Prell--see Appendix]  [Statement by Mr Truman--see Appendix]   If we look at the next couple of quarters, real BFI accounts for a third of the GNP growth in the third and the fourth quarters Over the course of next year, it accounts for about 20 percent of the growth   It's clearly a key dynamic income-generated sector in this forecast   As I noted, we now are looking for inventories, at least over the second half of this year, to be positively contributing to GNP growth And we are looking for it to be significantly in the manufacturing area, related in part to this durable goods strength in business equipment in particular   It's the bulk of it--if not more than that if we are right in our forecast of negative nonresidential structures over the second half and essentially flat next year So the whole story is producers durable equipment And a large part of that story is our reading of the current trend in the computer and office equipment area, which has been growing very rapidly While we had it tailing off noticeably over the forecast period, it remains a strong element in the forecast   I think that would overstate the contribution that makes The PDE deflator is declining--   Indeed, but looking at the total PDE number--   The total PDE deflator is declining at something over 2 percent a year in this forecast Given that we have PDE rising at 14 percent this year and 6 percent next year, it isn't the whole story by any means   It's not so much I think the fixed-weight as the question of whether you want to really deflate those computer expenditures at that rate   I don't--   I think the other thing to consider is that, in a sense, your potential and actual growth would be lowered by the same token Your measured real growth would be slower and your potential real growth would be slower, but resource utilization quotations in the short run wouldn't be materially different So, I think we are getting distortions of some of the numbers, in effect, by this base- to-base year against which we are measuring PDE prices--computer prices in particular But I think the real crux of the matter is that no matter how you slice it, we are at levels of resource utilization much higher than they had been or than we had expected That's what's really driving our inflation forecast   Well, if you were to assert that GNP growth has been overstated by the use of these 1982 price deflators, then presumably potential GNP growth is also being commensurately overstated So it doesn't give you any more room to maneuver I think it's important to have some handle on what's happening with the  -10-    8/16/88  capital stock for one's assessment of productive potential But that's a much longer-horizon issue This is sort of like those other questions relating to the possible mismeasurement of output whether it's [unintelligible] or anything else that affects both actual and potential output [unintelligible] And it doesn't do much for the gap   Well, this gets into very complicated, almost metaphysical, issues I'm not sure that there really is a problem in the sense of overestimating   I'm not sure; it depends on the question   We've thought about that I must say the amount of quantitative work we have done to date on this is not as much as I think we want to do over time It's hard to get a fix on the household portfolio Our assessment is that probably the amount of what I might call rate-sensitive assets does not exceed the amount of rate-sensitive liabilities in quite the same proportion as it previously did But, on balance, an increase in interest rates tends  -11-    8/16/88  to augment household cash flow We don't think the changes that have occurred really would make a big difference in the responses of the household sector in the short run But it is a new ball game to some extent, and there are distributional questions that we don't have a real good fix on So I think it's something worth giving further thought and investigation to But our basic assessment is that it doesn't make a big difference   Well, there're two things I should say One, the quarterly pattern between now and the end of next year reflects in significant measure the quarterly pattern of food price increases, which are strong until next spring and then are tailing off toward the end of the year The second thing is that it reflects the particular pattern of oil prices and energy prices that we have assumed in this forecast And that is an element that contributes to inflation in the first part of next year, after having been essentially flat in the second half of this year So the bulge there is somewhat misleading More fundamentally, we think the trend is one of acceleration at least through much of next year, and then tending into 1990 with an ever so slight upward tilt to compensation and underlying price trends We assume that interest rates will continue to move up over the next couple of quarters and we essentially have that 9-1/2 percent area funds rate being reached by early next spring   Again, I express that we recognize the uncertainty about these things and wouldn't want to be excessively precise in our characterization of what is involved in this forecast But basically, we have the rates getting up to that level by the second quarter of next year and staying there   We've made only a modest downward revision in housing starts as we get out into 1989 some ways We've made some upward adjustment in the mortgage rate forecast Mortgage rates have been running a bit tighter to the Treasuries than they had previously We have mortgage rates getting up towards 12 percent in the second half and very possibly around 12 percent   Nominally, for the current quarter, we take the existing funds rate as given through the end of the--   Yes, but basically for the GNP forecast, we are more interested in the drift over the next several quarters  -30-    8/16/88 "
3513,1988-09-20," Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   I might note that this morning the Commerce Department released revised second-quarter GNP figures where the second-quarter growth rate was revised down from 33 to 30 percent    9/20/88  That would still leave, after the drought effects, growth in the nonfarm economy in excess of 3-1/2 percent in the first half   Sure Both the deflator and the fixed-weight price index were revised upward The fixed-weight price measure was raised from a 47 percent to a 50 percent increase The deflator largely reflected this; it was up from 51 to 55 percent It's a little bit of an unfavorable mix shift   We don't have the full detail yet, and we haven't had a chance to talk to people about enough of the details We're flying a bit blind at this point   Yes There were, of course, small revisions in a number of categories The most dramatic revision in growth rate was in nonresidential structures As we had noted in the Greenbook, the construction-put-in-place showed a substantial revision in June So this isn't a shock There was a modest upward revision in consumer spending There was a small change in net exports There were just small changes sprinkled around   We still have the federal funds rate rising to something in the vicinity of 9-1/2 percent by next spring We have the long Treasury bond rate moving a bit above 10 percent   No, but our thought is that even after we have absorbed those, that we will not open up enough slack, so to speak, or reduce the pressures on the economy enough, to relieve the inflationary pressures Therefore, we need to hold growth below potential for a period of time What we have in our forecast is a very slight shortfall of actual growth from potential and very slight easing pressures on resources And we think that, given the underlying tendencies in the economy, we are going to need a bit more restraint to keep things under control over the last two or three quarters of 1989   I don't know that we have an optimum growth rate Basically, we sense that the pressures on resources are too great at this point to hold the inflation rate down to recent levels And we feel some easing [of those pressures] is necessary We believe the trend of real output growth is somewhere around 2-1/2 percent Therefore, we believe that we've got to grow something under that in order to ease those pressures We recognize the uncertainties about where the natural rate of unemployment is, if that's the operative concept We recognize that the composition of activity can make a difference of-- This is a rough judgment, ultimately; I don't want to get too precise about it, but basically we think we need some additional restraint to get the economy below potential, and we believe that that probably is necessary   I think I cited a number of 2-1/2 percent, Governor Angell, as what we believed potential GNP growth is Therefore, it depends how fast you want to get the inflation rate down If--   Well, you're asking me to make a policy judgment, a subjective judgment about the short-run costs and benefits of a policy you have in mind What we have tried to make is a positive statement That if you want to avert some acceleration of inflation, we need to reduce the pressures on resources The more that is done, the greater the chances are you will see no acceleration at all in the underlying inflation rate next year and that you will be able to tip it down noticeably in 1990 I think it will take more than we have built in here to make a decided move towards restoring a disinflationary trend by 1990   Again, I don't feel I'm in a position to declare the best adjustment I suspect, going around the table here, the policymakers would have some different views about the risks they would want to take and how rapidly they would want to move to bring down the inflation rate If I were to aim at the kind of inflation trajectory that you've outlined--declines of 1 percent a year in the inflation rate--I would suggest that you would need a substantially greater tightening You would need to bring growth down substantially from what we have in order to get back on that track I don't think we're on that track now, and I think you'd need substantially greater restraint--probably close to or even into recessionary conditions--in order by 1990 to have an inflation trend down to 3 percent at an annual rate   We're looking for around 9-1/2 percent Again, I don't want to be too precise   A significant increase from where we are   Just about   As you know, some of this extreme flattening is a very recent phenomenon Earlier in the year, you were getting more substantial increases in long rates as short rates rose I guess underlying this projection, at least in my mind, is a sense that the markets may have overdone things recently and that part of this may be the lack of long bond authority and unusual tightness in the long end of the market at this point But we do have what would be a fairly substantial rise in long rates along with the short rate increases in this forecast, partly on the presumption that the market will be surprised to some degree by what it takes in order to damp inflationary pressures They would come around more to our view; there's a strict internal consistency in these forecasts   If the rates don't rise--, they might not rise as much for a number of reasons One could be a change in inflationary expectations We may have had some of that recently, where the apparent willingness of the Fed to move earlier than some would have thought may have helped to hold down long-range inflation expectations To the extent that that's going on, you're perhaps not getting a significant real rate effect and thus the damping influence on demand If events transpire that cause real rates not to rise as much as we would anticipate in this forecast, then we might have a different outcome where investment demand may be sustained a bit more than we have [in the forecast] There are innumerable scenarios that one could draw where the movement in long rates would have different implications   You're saying that if the flattening occurs entirely because of reduced inflation expectations--   It would depend in the short run in part on whether it was a change in the long-run perception of what inflationary trends would be and in part on whether it was a reflection of a sense that the economy might be headed toward recession Clearly, in other historical experience we've seen a marked flattening of the yield curve just before downturns in the economy If we were to move up short rates as much as we're talking about here and the long rate didn't rise at all--that would be a very steep downward slope And I suspect it would only occur in    9/20/88  circumstances where people would perceive that there was a significant likelihood of a near-term weakening in the economy   That's basically what we're assuming It's very difficult to psych out the market at this point One can come up with a number of alternative hypotheses about why the market has behaved in just the way it has recently--in interpreting recent news and so on Another factor is the dollar situation, in terms of our longer-run external position and what we think ultimately we need to correct that That's probably a factor that's going to be less favorable as we move along in the projection period And, as I suggested, we're presuming that the market will perceive that a greater degree of restraint is necessary to rein in inflationary pressures than perhaps it currently is They will come around to [unintelligible]   Right   I hope I wasn't too persuasive because there is a range of uncertainty about our forecast For example, one of those areas of uncertainty obviously is the sensitivity of investment demand to what has already occurred in interest rate movements and the dollar There's been some perception already that the future competitiveness of some US industry will be less than people thought previously; perhaps the momentum of investment might not be as strong as we have in this forecast Fiscal policy we have interpreted as providing a degree of restraint on aggregate demand That is always difficult to interpret and it's conceivable that our underlying policy-action assumptions could turn out to be wrong And we could have a greater degree of restraint being applied, damping activity more than [unintelligible] Consumer spending has fairly consistently surprised us in this expansion by its strength, and as this has occurred, consumer debt levels have risen We've outlined for you what we think the cash flow consequences are of rising rates on households We feel this isn't a big problem, but again one would have to admit the possibilty of some surprise there The oil price situation is something imponderable and that's a very difficult    9/20/88  situation to sort out, because it has underlying aggregate demand effects if we were to get a change in the price from our assumption I feel reasonably comfortable with the inventory situation, but there too, there may be some pockets in the retail level that could exert more of a drag on output in coming months than we have [assumed] But I don't see that as a very great problem So, I think there are any number of areas across the economy where conceivably things might turn out weaker than we have   Well, I'm not sure that that recession would appear soon enough to greatly affect the discussions about the 1990 budget But it's conceivable that, in your hypothesis, the picture could change and then one has to make a political judgment There are many people, obviously, who would question the ability of the Congress to institute significant further deficit reduction measures if the economy appeared to be weakening And the actual budget deficit in those circumstances could become very large in 1990, which in effect would exacerbate the long-run problem by adding further to the level of debt So, it's a pretty dicey situation I think it's clear that they will have an easier time putting together a budgetary package that makes substantial ongoing progress in reducing the deficit in an environment where the economic outlook appears to be reasonably satisfactory   Basically, if we strip away farm and strip away autos, which are in good shape now--though there may be some accumulation over the remainder of the year But I think that's a sort of a separable situation Outside of that area, we're looking for a bit faster accumulation than we saw in the spring over the remainder of this year and then some slight tapering off It's not a dynamic factor in this projection And as the Chairman has pointed out, in an environment where business activity is fairly robust and capacity is getting tighter and prices are rising fairly rapidly for materials and so on, it's not inconceivable that at some point manufacturers will become more aggressive than we've put into this forecast We have manufacturers increasing their inventories over the coming months; but there could be an outside risk, as I noted in my    9/20/88  comments, that if things got out of hand on that score it could add perhaps to greater near-term strength in the economy But it would set us up perhaps for more of a shakeout later on in 1989 "
3556,1988-11-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   We wouldn't have expected the lower long rates that we've had to have any significant influence on recent economic performance So, I wouldn't want to connect those things quite the way I think you were suggesting It does appear to us that the decline in long rates reflects some reduced concerns about how robust aggregate demand will be and thus what the future pressures will be in credit markets Our assumption is that if things unfold as we are suggesting they will, there will be an element of surprise for the market They will, therefore, tend to raise their expectations somewhat about the future course of interest rates And with such expectations, we will get somewhat parallel increases in long rates as short rates move up We have trimmed a small fraction off our long- rate increase over the coming year, in part expecting that the better price performance will be extrapolated to some degree But basically we don't perceive that the real rate movements that have been implied by the recent nominal rate behavior are going to be imposing sufficient restraint over the coming year to keep the economy in check in the way that the markets may now be anticipating   Well, we don't expect housing to be as weak over the next quarter as we previously thought it would be But that's going to be the most visible effect   We think it will in the housing area and nominal rates may have some greater role there than they might in some other areas as opposed to real rates alone That's a possibility   Well, I think it's debatable what's happened to real rates We don't think real rates have changed a great deal basically, even over a lengthier period of time than the last few months We don't see that there has been a tremendous movement in real rates   Indeed  -25-    -26-   No, not necessarily What the norm is in the market here is hard to assess, but I guess we may be a bit less optimistic about what would happen with inflation if we maintained current levels of resource utilization in some markets There is also a considerable view in the market that we're going to have a recession in 1989-1990, that we will see rates coming down significantly Many of those people don't anticipate that it will occur with a further rate increase but just somehow will happen spontaneously Others think that small temporary further rate increases will trigger this Our view is that there is more underlying strength in the economy and that a small, further increase in rates would not have the effect of tipping the economy into recession It's a very difficult process of figuring out what various segments of the market population are thinking, and what they're thinking we will do, which is another element that affects the term structure If we devote more attention to the term structure and if that's our policy-making [tool], this would go back to the Lucas critique It changes the structure of expectations formation of the markets to mean that the term structure has different implications in terms of reflecting market expectations of the economy than it did previously So, we're in a very difficult expectations assessment   But if you look at a very long period though, you would see that long rates are [quite close to] cyclical lows, [while] short rates have moved up relative to their cyclical lows I think there is this recent phenomenon which probably has been exacerbated-- maybe more in my view than in Peter's and Don's--by questions about Treasury bond authority and the flight to quality from the recent LBO developments that may have proved somewhat more depressing for the Treasury bond rates than otherwise would have been the case   President Morris, can I just clarify? We're not projecting lower oil prices but we are no longer projecting an updrift in oil prices We're essentially saying they aren't going anywhere from the current level  -27-    11/1/88   Relative to greater--   Well, we do have a pickup in the fourth quarter which is largely the expectation that automobile stocks will increase somewhat with these higher assemblies Looking ahead, we're expecting to see some moderate accumulation in manufacturing and where inventories still look to be on hold very little We would expect to see some significant accumulation, not very large though, in the trade sector This, given the scale of the economy now, is not a tremendously high rate of inventory accumulation and it doesn't really result in any substantial change in inventory-sales relationships So we think this is easily consistent with the kind of overall growth and final demand we have, so long as it's perceived to be in an environment of sustained growth and businessmen don't begin to get as comforted by it So certainly there's always a risk on the inventory side from our current assessment where some bumping could go on, but it doesn't look like a very aggressive forecast and there are quite a few forecasts out there that would be higher and others that would be about $20 to $22 billion   Early next year Yes   We have them going up about the same amount   The events of recent days have pushed the Treasury bond rate to its current low, but if that rate is representative of the lower constellation of all rates or what's happened to other dealers on that track--and that I guess is what Governor Johnson was referring to--we have an essentially parallel movement of the rates   Well, we still think that business fixed investment, has a certain head of steam--not quite as [much] as earlier this year but still providing some forward thrust On the assumption that we will continue to see a softer dollar than we've seen earlier this year, we see some stimulus to domestic production from the trade side A basic point that I was trying to make was that there's no reason for an economy to gravitate to rates below normal in essence unless something is there to restrain it And while we see fiscal policy as mildly restrictive, it is not a big powerful force as you look out at the year ahead We don't see the inventory situation as being one that suggests there is going to be a retrenchment in orders and production imminently And so in this kind of environment, unless we assume that there was still some monetary restraint at work going out over the next few quarters to further damp things down, the tendency would be for the economy to tend to grow at or above potential And in this projection, if you want to turn the inflation trend back down again, you need to tip below that for a while and open up a little more slack in the economy All of that is conditioned on some assessment of what this level of resource utilization means for inflation pressures Basically, a crude reading of the experience over the past year would be that as capacity utilization rates have risen to their recent range and unemployment dropped below 6 and toward 5-1/2 percent, there was a general acceleration in wages and prices Basically, we're saying you've got to try to reverse that if you really do want by 1990 to be moving back down on the basic inflation rate trend   No, I talked about interest rates and I said--   I don't remember such a sentence But we have a somewhat lower rate of inflation in the near term overall because of the change in energy prices   I'm sorry, would you repeat it, please?   Well, I have a sentence here that says because energy prices will be damping inflation in the short run, we built a more gradual interest rate increase into our current forecast   You're welcome to I'm not--   I didn't say that, but the fact is that our inflation rate is lower than it was previously   I'm surprised, too Certainly, the fact is that because of the energy price change we have a lower rate of inflation in this forecast than we did previously What I suggested was if you stripped away that energy price effect, which presumably will be largely transitory [though] it could develop some momentum as it feeds through, but if it does it would serve to lower wages and so on But if you look excluding energy, prices rise more rapidly next year than this year And so in that sense, and looking at the compensation numbers as was noted earlier, there is a sense of a slight upward trend going through 1989 with a slight tightening and the economy growing at a slower pace   It changes and there's two rarts of the sentence  -30-    11/1/88  SPEAKER(?) Maybe you can help solve the problem by telling us what 1990 looks like; that way he'll have a trend   Well, for 1990 one needs to make some policy conjectures and so on We will present 1990 next time and basically we would at this point expect to show a forecast with rather slow growth in 1990, possibly some slight further edging up in unemployment [unintelligible] utilization, and some indication of a downward movement in excluding energy prices and compensation So, we're looking toward 1990 really in our thinking here about the interest rate path at this point of projecting "
3593,1988-12-13," [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you   Well, we went down on our oil price assumption for the November meeting At that point we had consumer energy prices falling about a percentage point from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year Now, we have consumer energy prices rising almost 2 percent from fourth quarter to fourth quarter That largely reverses the change we made last time, puts us back in roughly the same territory as we were in the meeting before last   We have a little lower food price forecast than we did last time   The net is a plus on the inflation rate We just have a very slight slowing fourth quarter to fourth quarter from our last forecast in consumer food price inflation We got a little bit better performance recently and so the fourth quarter of this year has been knocked down a couple of percentage points on consumer food price inflation   Well, there are shocks, if you want to call them that, the nonsmoothness that might arise on the real side For example, on the inventory side of this forecast we have a rather smooth course--a little bit of a rise in inventory-sales ratios, but mild and very smooth And in essence we have businessmen recognizing fairly promptly this slowing in the pace of sales and tapering down their inventory investment Historically, things have not normally moved with such precision, though in this cycle we've been impressed with the rapidity of inventory adjustments through production adjust- ments when inventories might have piled up [unintelligible] in that very early stage in 1983, early 1984 So, there may be reason for optimism, plus what seems to be a rather cautious attitude that businessmen have looking ahead at this point So, that would have to be one possible disturbance  Now, there are things that could happen on the financial side; exchange market developments, bond markets, stock markets that could create gyrations in wealth and cost of funds that make a more irregular path than consumption and other spending and then in turn give rise to inventory problems and so on that gives you a little more irregular path Then there are those risks that one has to recognize as being associated with this kind of rise in interest rates and decline in profits--that in the nonfinancial sector, business finances could deteriorate We would expect in this forecast a substantial deterioration in interest coverage And everyone is mindful of the  -28-    12/13-14/88  LBO situation and what that in turn could lead to, if there are firms [that] fall into some problem and lenders who might react to what they see as the emerging risks in lending to nonfinancial customers That could have some effect beyond what we are anticipating And of course the thrift industry situation deteriorates substantially in this picture The earnings will be deeply negative, will be even sizably negative for the currently solvent institutions who have the smaller interest rate gaps For the insolvent ones, with their larger gaps, this just exacerbates their problems So, whatever risks there might be of some liquidity problem arising from a wide loss of confidence and [unintelligible] in thrift institutions, it's awfully hard to calibrate what kinds of real side effects there would be to that kind of development   We don't have them yet; we get them later this morning But I think the main pieces of data we've had, which are both very noisy series, are retail sales and the trade figures As I noted, retail sales were a shade stronger than we anticipated Ted noted the trade data looked a shade weaker without knowing the prices that go with them and all of that On balance, it doesn't look like a substantial difference   The rise is pretty steady But again, it's somewhat the same story as Ted described with the exchange rate We don't have any particular impressions about what the optimal quarter- by-quarter movement would be nor what would be plausible to assume the Committee would want to do at various stages But we assume that the  -30-    12/13-14/88  movement begins promptly and is significant over the next half-year and fairly steady into early 1990  PARRY Then it flattens out in 1990?   Then it flattens out All of the rate increases occur by early 1990 And you can perceive the hint of this in our real forecast in that the most interest-sensitive sector like housing is beginning to level out by the end of the year Our notion is that we are not trying to drive the unemployment rate up toward 7 or 8 percent in an effort to slow the inflation, that a more modest softening of the economy in terms of resource utilization levels is needed, but our design is that you want to get there fairly promptly so that you begin to turn the corner by 1990 Many different paths could be described; and, as Governor Angell suggested, if you went sooner with large interest rate increases, we presumably would anticipate, all other things equal, a slowing of the economy more quickly and an opening up of that degree of slack that we perceive to be needed   No, not in my decade of memory of this And I think, Governor Heller, we have attempted on many occasions to present this at the Committee meeting There are many questions that arise in terms of what should be put in the Greenbook, in part recognizing that this document goes outside of the Federal Reserve But you know it's up to the Committee and the Chairman to tell us what--   Well, let me be slightly defensive on this, though I probably shouldn't be We have presented alternative forecasts--   --a number of times And the message is the same every time, and I think you all know it and I communicated it in a rough way yesterday So, you are not going to get revelations each time we do this And I have a feeling that the information we've been providing is being somewhat slighted in this discussion We have on several occasions in the past year presented alternative forecasts, quantified the effects of different interest rate assumptions and so on, and you will [continue to] see the same thing unless our general perception of how the economic system works changes each time we do that So, there are going to be very rapidly diminishing returns   I guess we are questioning your interpretation of this year's events, so there is room for alternative interpretations Basically, we've seen a substantial acceleration of compensation this year as the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent Now, we are not taking a rigid view that the NAIRU is 6 percent in this forecast; far from it But I guess this is an issue that certainly comes to the fore as you look at the experience of the past year As to alternative years, you're quite correct that fundamentally we are taking a sort of short-run Phillips curve view of the world One of the reasons that alternative forecasts got presented with diminishing frequency over the last half dozen years or so was the fact that the Committee frequently said that these are not very meaningful because they are based on this kind of wage-price structure, and we will get much better effects because there will be Fed credibility and so on Now, what we find in actually looking back at the experience of the last several years is that the sort of short-run Phillips curve formulation of expectations built into that works fairly well in explaining the wage-price deceleration we've had without any obvious add-on of credibility We have experimented, and we are trying to develop an econometric representation of more forward-looking expectations Most of the rational expectations models have been constructed on very small non-structural models We have tried to work with what resources we have to build a fuller model that has a more rational expectations sort of sense to it At this point we really don't have something we can implement But there's always a proviso you would say in this that this is how things would turn out if we had the structure right, and if there were credibility effects you could get a bigger payoff for monetary restraint without the real side damage   No, we don't think so Not certainly from the 155 million housing start level we saw in the most recent month's data We have what we think is a reasonable decline in housing starts given our assumption that mortgage rates will be rising from the current 10-1/2 percent area to something between 11-1/2 and 12 percent by early 1990 This is not an exotic movement in terms of the models that exist It's not just the mortgage rate that would be working against housing starts in this forecast By 1990, the slowing of income growth begins to become a significant factor, and so we do have a fairly substantial decline, particularly in the single-family sector Basically, looking at the demographics and the damage that's already been done in the multifamily area, we think that the single- family side is likely to be hit fairly substantially over this period   Well, there is a substantial range of uncertainty around every number in this forecast   This is not a very high number--in the area of 135 million starts--that we have in 1990 It's not as low as we saw at the depths of the last housing downturn   But you'll recall how high mortgage rates were at that time   So this seems reasonable to us, obviously, or we wouldn't have written it down But there has to be some confidence interval around it   That's a good question   The question is why does the real rate only rise that much as the short rate is rising If it is because of an expectational effect wherein the marginal efficiency of investment in a sense shifts, people perceive there is weakness ahead, they pull back, and they don't want to sell bonds to finance investment and housing construction or whatever; you might have in essence the same real outcome for a downward sloping yield structure So, I guess it really depends what the circumstances are that produce that interest rate environment    12/13-14/88   The more you surprise the markets with restraint in the short run as you're suggesting, the greater, I would think, [the probability that] you are going to get some adverse effect on the bond market in the short run But you're probably more likely to generate in due course more of a downward-sloping yield structure as people's expectations of future economic strength and credit demands are weakened "
3617,1989-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman You should all have a packet of charts here with a red title on it [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, job growth is much slower; thus, you're not generating the nominal income fast enough to offset the more rapid increases in consumer prices   I'm not sure what the nominal personal income increase is   But we have very slow employment growth  SPEAKER(?) You get zero   Governor Heller, just to clarify those figures were compensation for hourly wages We have total nominal disposable income rising just over 6 percent If you take off just over 5 percent consumer inflation you're down to about 1 percent income growth in real terms   That's right   If you looked at the exchange rate implications, as I suggested earlier, of that faster money alternative that I have, that showed--  SPEAKER(?) If interest rates are fixed   You have that dollar depreciation   This is compounding degrees of uncertainty, let's say  SPEAKER(?) Yes   I don't think so, President Parry, because I think the value of this indicator is relatively short run The lags that one measures in the relation of orders to shipments tend to be a matter of several months And in the case of aircraft, with the current situation being what it is, the lead times are so long that the placing of orders has no meaningful--   That's apart from the fact that there are lots of intermediate goods in there--parts [for example]--and a lot of that goes to exports It's an even bigger problem there than it is for translating the other orders to business fixed investment So, there's a great deal of slack for that   Second chart   That is a good deal of the story In 1990 that is worth roughly $25 billion of the difference, all other things equal, between the Administration and Greenbook budget assumptions   If you mean by that the federal funds rate, that is the ""more money"" alternative   It was intended to answer the question What if short-term interest rates don't rise?   We have non-motor vehicle durable goods increasing 3 percent in 1989 and then flat in 1990   Within the durables? We have not done a greater level of disaggregation on this   It fits in to some degree There is some relationship there, though if you just look historically to the simple econometric relation you find it's pretty loose In 1988 we had 6 percent growth of durables other than motor vehicles So that [1989 rate] is a significant slowing This level of housing activity is still enough to generate some reasonable demand and then there is all the replacement demand for appliances and furnishings and so on So it wouldn't fall entirely in that type of--   In 1989 it's a very small part; in dollar terms net exports improve $22 billion and GNP is improving $122 billion-- that's roughly 1/2 percent on GNP In 1990 net exports are accounting for roughly 3/4 of that 1 percent growth   I must say that in terms of absolute levels these movements in the compensation numbers over 1988 give us some real problems in judging where the takeoff point is There was an extraordinarily low increase in compensation per hour in the first quarter of the year; whether the fairly sizable numbers in the second half were just offsetting a seasonal adjustment problem we can't say In essence, we are discounting the level at the end of the year, and we have a very mild acceleration, as we perceive it, in compensation per hour over the forecast period As I said, we think this is a reasonable forecast I guess I would see the tail of the distribution being longer on the up side than on the down side at this point It's hard for us in this kind of economic environment to see a sizable shortfall from this compensation forecast But one can see a larger range of risks, I think, on the up side As a best estimate, this is our shot   Well, a lot of cars have been bought in recent years but that hasn't brought the average age of the stock down to low levels by any means I'm not sure we totally understand the scrappage rates that we're seeing--whether there really has been an improvement in the quality of automobiles and they last longer or what I think we have a fairly sizable decline The automobiles are declining more than light trucks and vans, which we have not yet incorporated in our tables and are now almost half as large as the car sales So that's something worth recalling The main factors are the slower income and employment growth One couldn't point to the interest rate increases we have here as having a tremendous effect on automobile sales It's    2/7-8/89  more the general atmosphere of confidence and the growth in purchasing power that is behind this decline   1990's or 1989's?   If you had a crop year like 1988 in [1989 or] 1990, all other things equal, it would subtract 07 of a percent or so from output and would get you very close to zero I think the bigger concern--one that we just don't know how to cope with in terms of inserting something in this forecast--is that in many areas, although it's spotty, there seems to be a shortage of soil moisture The reports about winter wheat are not particularly encouraging And with inventories of many of these grains and soybeans and so on as low as they are, we can't afford to have anything like the 1988 crop if we're going to stay anywhere near this inflation path It's likely that we will see much more sizable food price increases than we saw in 1988 So I think it's something that's hard to cope with in monetary policy terms and economic forecasts here But it is something that one could be concerned about   That observation seems to have closed down all the discussion I want to express my appreciation!  SPEAKER(?) You want a second or what?   The rate of increase?   Well, as you know, we have about a 3-3/4 percent increase in food prices this year and next And we're looking at, for example,--   I'm splitting it more thinly; it's a little below 4 percent We're talking about consumer prices, excluding energy, rising 5 percent or more That is a considerable differential and not out of line with that historical pattern to which you referred of the relative movement in these inflation rates Beside the drought effects there was already in train some tendency toward reduction in cattle herds; and we're likely to see some considerable pressure on meat prices that offsets the relatively small benefits you can get from additional grain supplies, given the very large labor component in most of those food prices   I think that's largely there and that it would really take some tremendous moves in crop prices to move these overall food price measures around I think that's evident in what happened last year   That's a very large ingredient I think that's the case We have an authority here on the subject John Rosine, do you have anything you want to add?   A couple of tenths And that's essentially what we got in 1988   I know where he lives   I would like to underscore that the comparison you were making was not totally accurate in that the base line, or what was presented in the Bluebook, is the staff's judgmental forecast   We use the large models, in fact a combination of several models, to create all the alternatives from that base line   The number we have here is 3/4 of a percentage point faster in 1989 and 2-1/2 points in 1990 and then another 3-1/2 points in the next year   No velocity assumptions go with it, but one could calculate velocities roughly from these real GNP and price numbers that we have here Doing it rapidly in my head it looks like a drift toward declining velocity   Yes I guess there would actually be a small velocity increase in 1990-91   Well, basically we've got stable short-term interest rates, so we don't get any meaningful velocity movement one way or the other And as you look out over time--after you get through the lagged effects of past interest rate changes moving the velocity--as the stable rates are essentially reflected in the deposit rates, you wouldn't expect big movements in velocity   Right   It says money and credit aggregates   You probably have to have a credit measure of some sort unless you could persuade them that it was built into this It's in the text   Mr Chairman, one could remark that we're low at this point in part because of the lagged effects of previous interest rate changes So that might give you some leverage to get some of that--   They didn't come out today, Mr Chairman   Tomorrow   About 150 basis points by a year from now "
3643,1989-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Let me say first that it takes a period of below potential growth in order for some slack to open up in the labor market in particular But also, we'd expect to have some slack--   But, as you know, in our forecast that only brings the unemployment rate up to about 6 percent The maybe ""worst case"" interpretation of the events of the last two years is that that's only getting us back to the natural rate--if you want to use that framework for looking at this We have been implicitly a bit more optimistic in the sense that, as we move up to the 6 percent neighborhood and edge above it by the end of 1990, we are anticipating that we will begin to see some tendency toward moderation in the underlying inflation trend And thus in 1991, if the unemployment rate remained in the low 6 percent neighborhood, by bringing growth up to, say, the 2 percent range we would anticipate that we would begin to discern a very gradual deceleration of inflation But it would be measured in fractions of a percent for a year at that level   Well, to raise the unemployment rate you have to move below potential growth In recent years it has been very clear that on average the economy had to grow less than 2-1/2 percent in order to produce an upward movement in the unemployment rate   Our judgment is based on what we've seen in wage and price behavior All the anecdotal evidence over the past year or so suggests that in essence we have overshot a level of resource utilization that's consistent with stable inflation   Well, in 1991 we'd expect to see a fractional decline in the inflation rate barring any exogenous shocks that we obviously can't anticipate at this point   I don't think we're totally outside the spectrum of outside forecasters, but there continues to be some difference of opinion between the staff and that average in terms of how much weakness is likely to occur in aggregate demand as a consequence of the tightening that has occurred already I noticed in the article in The Wall Street Journal the other day on the difficulties in economic forecasting that one person commented that it appears that the business forecasters keep predicting recession about a year out and then moving it back as it doesn't materialize In essence, there's a large element of that a sense that we have had a long expansion; things have gotten tight; and it's more likely than not that we may have a downturn And they perceive it occurring by the end of this year, in many cases with interest rates moving down along with it They also tend to have a seemingly relatively rapid disinflation response to that softening--greater than we would anticipate And that's part of the difference in our views   And vice-versa  SPEAKER(?) One of you is making a mistake   Well, there's a lot of uncertainty on all aspects of the forecast   Well, we wouldn't want to be any fancier than that We just have a gradual further rise   I think what we have built into the remainder of this year is not very large In fact, I will venture to say that it might not be large enough, given the range of possibilities one can see here But to make distinctions on whether you've gained this increase of roughly a percentage point through a 3/4 point rise over the next three months and a 1/4 point rise thereafter versus 1/4 point and then 3/4 point I think is going well beyond anything that economic science can discriminate between   Well, I don't want to speak of models per se here The models we have been looking at have a longer history of price/wage behavior and would suggest that the natural rate is above 6 percent However, our interpretation of the errors those models have made recently and of recent evidence leads us to put together a forecast that, if you forced it into that kind of model, would imply a considerably lower natural rate So, we are in the vicinity of that implicit natural rate by the middle of next year   Well, there's hardly anyone who runs an unfettered model forecast You're always confronted with the fact that models have imprecisely predicted the recent past and you need to make some corrections in order to move forward in the forecast period Our models, for example--the quarterly model and the P* model--have tended to underpredict the strength of aggregate demand in the economy over the past year or so If you immediately eliminated that and had a pure model forecast moving forward it would suggest a sharper weakening than we have in the forecast But whether that's the most plausible assumption to make is a question Certainly, we [would] be inclined to make that kind of adjustment The basic question, though, is whether the outlook contains a significant risk of recession In this Greenbook we deviated from what we had done the last couple times--just to avoid needless repetition perhaps--but maybe it is useful to state again we are skirting zero growth here by a small margin in what we've written down And certainly a small hiccup in the economy in an adverse way could tip this into negative territory So I would say that with this kind of outlook there is a non- negligible risk of at least a mild downturn in the economy   It sounds like we're somewhere in between those two in our '90 forecast in nominal GNP   I'm sorry I didn't catch the change that you were referring to   Well, there are some special factors boosting the first quarter and some of those, like drought relief payments, won't recur in the second quarter The growth in the first quarter is also boosted by things like Social Security but that's a level adjustment, so to speak We are expecting a considerable slowing in employment growth and in hours in the months ahead And that plays a significant role in the outlook for income growth   I think it's fair to say that the recent data-- and as I indicated we've raised our forecast of the price indexes for the current quarter--leave us with the impression that the inflation pressures at these levels of resource utilization may be a little greater than we had anticipated But we haven't made a dramatic change here We have tried to read through some of the noise in these numbers And we've only passed through a modest bit of this surprise into the forecast for the next two years I characterized the situation last time as being one where we think this inflation forecast represents our best point estimate But if I were to draw the probability distribution, my sense is that the distribution has a longer tail on the up side than on the down side I could envision a percentage point more inflation more readily than I could envision a percentage point less inflation over the next year or so That doesn't mean that there's a strong likelihood of that happening; but in that sense I think the risks may be a bit on the up side   I can't slice this too finely; it's very hard to trace that In the Greenbook we referred to numbers where we've taken away the large corporate merger transactions that we can identify and gotten some additional information there There are so many corporate restructuring transactions going on that there may be a lot of other things going on in the numbers besides basic financing and capital expenditures and so on Our reading is that there has been some strength in short-term business credit apart from the RJR/Nabisco and other major merger transactions And that probably is reflective of the underlying need for funds and the deferral of long-term financing Some of the long bond issuance that Peter talked about earlier really isn't very long term; much of it has been swapped into floating rate obligations It just appears that businesses are not anxious to lock in these current long-term borrowing costs which, again, is consistent with the term structure picture and these forecasts of weakening in the economy and lower interest rates down the road   Well, to date, the effects on housing starts have been negligible I think housing starts were confounded a bit by the weather that boosted the January figure to such a high level February is in the area of more than 1-1/2 million Interest rates have already risen a good bit We don't have a gigantic further increase in mortgage rates in this forecast, so this kind of decline-- given the underlying demographic influences and so on--looks to us to  -18-    3/28/89  be fairly reasonable I don't think we are all that far off Given what other forecasters have been anticipating in terms of interest rate movements, I don't think we're that far off the beaten track on the housing starts outlook Perhaps we're being a little optimistic If we had a much larger mortgage rate increase it would obviously make a difference But it's not very large at this point   I think we've seen in some parts of the Northeast that this doesn't go on forever--that you get an affordability problem after a while because the mortgage payment just is unmanageable But it is a mixed picture regionally, and that's one of the problems in forecasting housing activity It clearly has been a problem in the last year We've had very divergent and changing market conditions We try to sort through all of that as well   I might just note one of the surprises recently we haven't gotten too excited about this yet, but we have been surprised by the firmness in the multifamily sector And we notice that there has been some downturn in vacancy rates in some locales We have a sense that there is a very old stock of apartment buildings out there and some demographic pressure It may be that there is some considerable resilience in the apartment part of the market   We haven't really made much of a change from our last projection Using the model--which I've already indicated is an imperfect predictor of these responses--if you took out the interest rate increase and just held the funds rate stable the model would take off maybe 1/3 of a percent in real growth this year and something over 1/2 a percent next year That means that we still would have a perceptible weakening in growth and likely some slight edging up in the unemployment rate   It only had one observation in 10 years You'd have to look back "
3670,1989-05-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   With our baseline Greenbook forecast--extending it informally at this point into 1991 and assuming that growth isn't so rapid as to move the unemployment rate back down in that year but that it will stay in the 6 percent or so neighborhood--our expectation would be that in that environment we'd see a fractional decline in inflation in 1991 But the trend would be turning discernibly downward Using our quarterly model and not doing a particularly elaborate exercise but leveling out rates--or keeping the federal funds rate about where it is now--the result is that, in essence, we eliminate that downturn in inflation in 1991   In 1991 In our current forecast we're talking about, in the greater scheme of things, a rather small further rise in interest rates But it's enough to make a slight difference in output growth in the near term, building to something a little more noticeable in 1990 And we end up with a lower unemployment rate and eliminate most of that slack that would otherwise emerge    5/16/89   Yes, I think that's right And we're reading these numbers very finely That's probably the predicament that we face, in general, in interpreting the incoming information If we are on the kind of track that we have projected, I think every meeting here we're going to go through a sort of Chinese water torture in trying to judge whether the latest data are suggesting that we're moving up or moving down To use these econometric models to come up with some precise notion of whether we will go up a little or down a little on the inflation rate from the current level is probably pushing things I think the uncertainties are greater than that But running it through [the model] in a straightforward way, that's the kind of conclusion we get   Basically, we need to have a decline in order to see the kind of moderation in final demand that we feel is necessary, in essence, to diminish inflationary pressures Unless there is a substantial slowing in the rate of inventory accumulation, inventory/ sales ratios are going to move up With what we have been seeing we're going to get a growing imbalance In terms of structural changes I'm reasonably impressed by what I read and hear--particularly in the manufacturing sector but in the trade sector as well--about the kind of inventory management changes that have occurred It's clear that there are efforts underway and that manufacturing firms have been quite successful to date in reducing inventories relative to their shipments I think they will try to maintain those trends So in that sense, even a leveling out might imply in some cases some undesired accumulation relative to plans So, we feel we really need to see a substantial slowing here if we are to avoid an imbalance that will create the need for even bigger production adjustments in the [future]   Well, I think there is a diversity but the central tendency of the private forecasters, as I read it, is for a softening that is probably at least as great as what we have in this forecast My sense is that the disinflation payoff that is seen is fractionally greater than what we have I think many of those people as they look out into 1991 also see the likelihood of a pickup and, in essence, an impatience with any Federal Reserve [forecast] that looks like the possibility of a recession In a sense, we may have a smoother track in our forecast than some of them But I think we are, on balance, a little less optimistic about the inflation payoff of the slack that is predicted to emerge, and we're expecting interest rates to have to stay a bit higher   Indeed, that's really more an end of this year/ early 1990 story We feel that even if things did slow to a rate somewhat less than we have in the second half--barring some major inventory imbalance or something like that--we probably are not going to continue on a slow enough track to open up the kind of slack in the economy that we still think is necessary in order to really turn the inflation rate down   We're very close to recession in this forecast in the first part of 1990 So an error of that dimension, so to speak, could make that kind of difference as to the sign--whether we're in slightly positive territory or slightly negative territory I wouldn't want to suggest that we think we can predict these things with that precision We have tried to raise the flag repeatedly that we feel this is at least a growth recession In essence, we have a fine-tuned forecast Whether policy can be so finely tuned is another matter   Sure   We put the federal funds rate by the end of the year up to or approaching the 10-3/4 percent level   I said we had the federal funds rate somewhere in the 10-1/2 to 10-3/4 percent range   We're neutral   We're neutral at this meeting   The Greenbook doesn't slice it that thinly, but we didn't assume anything in the next few weeks "
3712,1989-07-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman Everyone should have found by his seat a copy of this package of charts entitled ""Material for Staff Presentation"" [Statement--see Appendix]   In terms of precisely what we were projecting back in February, we did indeed have a rise in short-term rates We had the federal funds rate moving up to 10-1/2 percent or so I must say, actually, that the federal funds rate rose more in the first half of the year than we anticipated At the same time, we had bond yields moving up and approaching 10 percent and on long Treasuries we had some slight movement upward to around 9-1/4 percent in the second quarter of the year We flirted with that [level] Clearly, with the recent drop, they dropped below the trajectory we had at that time We also were not anticipating a dollar on the path that we have seen My suspicion is that that's an important element in this whole story Now, we could probably go on for hours trying to dissect what has happened and determine which way causation ran I personally find appealing the notion that we may have had an autonomous increase in demand for dollars which expressed itself to some degree in depressing bond yields Be that as it may, the dollar has been on a different path And as I suggested, we think that has been a significant    7/5-6/89  element in damping inflationary pressures even though there are some lags in the process, looking at the composition of price movements and so on We think there is something to be said for the argument we presented in the Greenbook dissecting the price measures On the demand side, I think we have had a surprise on consumer spending To an extent we were looking earlier at that pattern of household net worth and discounting it a bit We could see that there was an argument for a higher saving rate Maybe that indeed is what has happened We wouldn't have anticipated the stock market being as strong as it is now but the level, as was already suggested, may be driving [unintelligible] and be a drag on consumption Where we come out now is that we are looking at short-term rates and long-term rates that will be below our expectations And we think the dollar's higher level will be something of a drag on domestic production growth over the next few quarters and, therefore, something of a depressant on price inflation We are interpreting this recent decline as having a significant real element, which will help to boost the interest- sensitive sectors of the economy in the months ahead, particularly housing   I don't see a declining trend in long-term rates, really I think they fluctuated in the 9 to 9-1/4 percent range for quite a while and then we had a very sharp drop I don't think we've had enough time to see the response [to that]   I will admit that the anecdotal evidence does not suggest a tremendous change in the mortgage market and housing demand at this point--or I should say on the home building side Clearly, there is evidence of a flurry of refinancing activity And maybe if people are rushing out to refinance they also perceive rates to be more attractive for buying homes There is naturally a lag in this process and sometimes a tendency to hold back until one thinks rates have gotten as low as they are going to go So, we would expect to see homebuilding improving in the next couple of months   I think it's partly because we have had the weaker GNP I think the markets were surprised, in part, by how quickly the deceleration in the economy occurred They became less concerned about an inflationary overshoot and I think that has been a factor; that probably has contributed to some diminution in the inflation premium At the same time, we think that the real rates will come down   If you look at our housing forecast, particularly this time versus last time, you see a different tilt To that extent there is some stimulus coming to domestic demand Since our last forecast, the major change, in a sense, has been that we now have the dollar doing some of the work we formerly thought that interest rates were going to have to do We've had a shift toward a lower net export contribution to GNP growth than we had previously, which is offset by some contribution from interest-sensitive domestic demand sectors   This may be evaporating by the minute Logically, if we're going to go incrementally from forecast to forecast that pushes one back in the other direction But I don't want to make that much of a small movement The level adjustment has been considerable in the picture--   In our forecast there is some backup, for example, in 3-month bill rates and Treasury bond rates but--   Well, I've written down about 1/4 of a point this quarter It's not as large as I think you're alluding to   Well, I'm not sure I want to let models run on this because, basically, what really has happened, according to our models, is that long-term rates are now where they should be relative to short-term rates given a term structure equation that has its long- term rates determined with a lag by short-term rates The mystery earlier had been why long-term rates were so high given that we had had the sharp descent of short-term rates That should have fed through I don't know that the models capture the forward looking expectations formation that seems to characterize financial market behavior today I do concede the point that there would be a risk of a bigger backup on this I was disinclined to be any fancier about this, having made the mistakes in the past that Governor Johnson was so kind to point out again   The term structure equation has worked remarkably well over--   Well, I think the market is expecting further easing in the funds rate; there's no doubt about it   Indeed  -12-    7/5-6/89   That's what Don has argued in the Bluebook that because that movement in interest rates isn't going to affect the path of economic activity in the next couple of months that path of economic activity is likely to look soft enough that people will probably still be expecting some further ease--unless they take the view that the Fed is really bent on fighting inflation and taking sizable risks on a soft economy, in which case the bond rate rise, if any, might be negligible So, I think you get into a very complicated kind of guesswork about expectations against various events in the economic news   At the risk of beating this too far into the ground I would just say, given our uncertainties, that if the 3-month bill rate were to go up to 8-1/2 percent or a shade higher versus what we have here we wouldn't regard that difference as all that material for the economic outlook I don't want to hinge everything on a quarter point or so on the 3-month bill rate  SPEAKER(?) Makes sense   We really don't have much to go on Perhaps Dave [Stockton could address that]   Our guess at this point is that the unemployment rate will edge up and that we'll have an employment increase of less than 200,000   This is a quarterly-average number that we have in our forecast One could even reconcile a bigger movement in the near term of some easing   There have been a couple of negotiations and there is one ongoing, which was referred to earlier Those may have been what they were looking at--Bethlehem and some others   Actually, I heard those stories some months back as explaining the strength in steel production, even in the latter part of last year It has been a pretty murky matter as to what was going on and the timing   We welcome you    7/5-6/89   The ones that I showed throughout that range--   We'll have to look at this again and see how the group decision was reached after we've seen the revised numbers "
3738,1989-08-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   I must admit you know more about this from your conversations than I do Larry [Slifman], have you--?   I think the more important question is what effect this will have on the employment and hours numbers for August I suspect there will be considerable [doubt] when we see, on net, a very low employment growth number But we've also assumed that there isn't a lot of lost output with this [strike] There will be a few phones that won't have been installed and so on, but the calls are generally going through So this looks like something that won't have a large GNP effect  SPEAKER(?) On the payroll numbers themselves, we estimate that during that survey week of the 6th to the 12th of August about 150,000 telecommunications workers were on strike   We do think there will be an upward revision As best as we can do the arithmetic--making guesses where we need to about how BEA may interpret some of the data--we think an upward revision of about a point is in store Basically, our forecast is a [net] change forecast and thus isn't affected by this That means that the levels of some of these variables--if we were to redo the forecast with the revised second-quarter numbers--would look different But in terms of the GNP growth path, it wouldn't be a factor   It is true for inventories as well If inventories were revised up, inventory investment throughout the forecast, all other things equal, would be revised up That means it potentially affects inventory/sales ratios   To the extent, though, that we digest the incoming information and are aware of whatever surprises there are for BEA in the latest inventory data, for example, that conditions our thinking about whether inventory levels are too high or too low   This is an issue that we've debated many times In fact, recently, we have been debating whether we ought to anticipate changes in BEA's numbers and put down our guess instead of the last BEA number But there's a long tradition; this problem has been going on for decades here and we have been discussing how one ought to approach this issue   Well, a lot of those differences come from policy assumptions We think it is unlikely that this agreement is going to fall apart entirely; but if it did, then presumably we'd have somewhat stronger aggregate demand over the next year in this forecast and less restraint coming from the fiscal side Relative to GNP, I don't think that we're talking necessarily about numbers that are night and day differences; but they are potentially of some significance Let me just add one thing One of the reasons CBO is higher reflects their assumption that the thrift resolution expenditures in this fiscal year will be lower than the $20 billion that we've built in That's largely a paper shuffling transaction, as we've interpreted it, so that would be of no effect in--   Their report suggests that they are aware of some question here, but they've interpreted this as something that can be carried over and will show up as a budget outlay next year   You have your work cut out for you   We have in our forecast a $32 billion end-of-the- quarter cash balance, so there's [room]   As all of these revised data washed through, the revisions really didn't have much effect on our assessment of trend productivity growth Our guess about the trend growth in real potential GNP is still close to 2-1/2 percent, maybe 26 percent at this point   Yes, they came out; I must say that based on the data we have it's a little hard to interpret these things The overall durable goods orders were down almost 2 percent Nondefense capital goods orders were up 5 percent and June was revised up to 5 percent from about unchanged But there are--   Ex-aircraft it is down 10 percent But last month was revised up to 66 percent The big swing factors in the last couple of months seem to have been a category called ordinance, ship building, and tanks, which is part of nondefense--  -14-    8/22/89   So these numbers are pretty murky at this point It looks like there's a touch of weakness in orders for computers, and that doesn't come as a great surprise in light of the anecdotal evidence about what's going on in that industry On the whole, though, at this point I'd only venture the guess that this report doesn't suggest a very big departure from what we have been tracking here Overall, unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods continue to rise substantially month-by-month, really   The release indicates that the average revision for new orders is about 2 percentage points, so this constitutes a pretty healthy revision But this is a series that's very volatile, and on top of that you get these--   The market is going to be handicapped in interpreting this because some of the crucial detail isn't going to be available until the final release of manufacturers' orders and shipments next week   It's really difficult to sort through these numbers   We don't perceive this as a simple relationship Obviously, there is interaction here, and there are price surprises that could affect the inflation expectations that could in turn affect compensation And then this all cycles around Basically, it depends on what model you look at as to whether there has been a very big surprise in the behavior of wages If you refit your models through the recent experience and you capture all the data revisions that have occurred along the way and you select your price expectations variables correctly, you can pretty well capture what has been going on in compensation inflation over the past couple of years--not quarter-by-quarter, but the general drift   Percentage point lower?   No In fact, there hasn't been much change in our compensation forecast since last fall We have been projecting pretty much the same compensation increase this year as we have all along   My feeling is that it depends on which data you look at There's the compensation per hour series, which has been showing about 5-1/2 percent increases over the past year There is the employment cost index, which has been showing 4-1/2 percent or a little above that That number looks rather low against the kind of consumer price inflation we've been having in an environment where we think the unemployment rate is essentially in line with the natural rate--fairly tight labor markets Judgmentally, we would have expected to see that 12-month change in the ECI creeping up over the past year, and that hasn't occurred On the other hand, I think the basic tenet of this forecast is that there was an acceleration here We have not turned down, in terms of this trend; the labor market is remaining tight It is very difficult, barring some significant price shock, to see why we would go lower on wage inflation In light of the large increase in consumer prices over the past year, in particular over the past half year, we think there is going to be some pressure--self-inflicted or not--on employers to boost their wage increases a bit to keep their employees whole And we think we're going to see some slight further upward movement in compensation per hour over the next couple of quarters Then next year we have the hit from the legislative increases, which accounts for almost all of the further increase in 1990 So I'd say we are comfortable that we have assessed the risks properly and that it's most likely that we're going to see some edging up rather than stability or a downward movement  -16-    8/22/89   Well, but there could be a mix factor here   I don't think we can fully explain this; we're not entirely comfortable with this   There are possibilities One is, since the compensation per hour series doesn't collect the same kind of direct information on benefits, that it's missing something in that area We have seen significant revisions in the past as, with a considerable lag, they incorporate that information But it is a source of some discomfort Looking at the ECI, I suppose we might feel that there is some upside risk because of the low level of that increase over the past year or so against the kind of consumer price inflation we have had   Well, I must confess that in all likelihood there will be some decline in the inflation rate in 1991 in our forecast by design   Because we are assuming--   --that it is an objective of the Committee to make some progress in that direction, while avoiding recession The question is what kind of economic environment it will take If we assume that the dollar continues to appreciate, that argues all the more for our assuming that growth in 1991 will have to remain on the soft side That will be the kind of forecast we most likely will be presenting; and that's in line with what we presented in our previous simulation, for example, in the Chart Show   We have a very pronounced drop in the profits share in our forecast We think it is ongoing at this point; and by the end of 1990 in this forecast, the profit share is historically at a very low level That's one of the factors in our thinking about the investment outlook Overall cash flow will be constrained; the current profitability of businesses won't look so great So we think there is going to tend to be some drag on investments going out through 1990 It's very hard to get a handle on what is happening in the aggregate from the stories about these [unintelligible] on unadjusted earnings and so on But we think it is weak at this point   I'd rather not look at the quarter-by-quarter numbers that closely   As I look at it, the fourth-quarter number is up less than $1 billion   Right off the top of my head I'm hard pressed to identify all of the factors here that explain that But I think that is too fine a reading of these numbers   Yes Gyrations from quarter-to-quarter in the rate of output growth in productivity feeding through here can lead to some bounces But I think the real story here is that we are projecting a rather weak profits picture It may be that private analysts have come around more to this view than previously We felt we were much more pessimistic than most private forecasters previously I think there is a greater sense now that, in terms of economic profits, there's something going on from the effects of the 1986 tax law on depreciation allowances--that operating economic profits are going to be relatively weak as one looks ahead  -18-    8/22/89   Indeed   [Unintelligible]   In the very near term I think it is much affected by the revised retail sales data, which puts it on a distinctly different path than we were on earlier   It affects the growth rate of consumption in the third quarter because of the level [unintelligible] path and so on   We're at a much higher level and relative--   In a sense But beyond that, a month ago when we were looking at this before the GNP revision we were looking at a very steep drop in nondurables in the second quarter I think I suggested at the time that that looked really peculiar and that we wouldn't be surprised to see a revision When the GNP numbers came out they eliminated some of that decline; I think it went from minus 6 for nondurables to minus 4 Now, those numbers are going to go up still further There is still going to be a pattern of about three quarters where we're running at rather weak nondurables expenditures History suggests, statistically, that this sometimes occurs in the gasoline area when we've had a big run-up in gasoline prices and then you get a reversal as gasoline prices fall It may be merely a statistical measurement problem Be that as it may, the trend there just looks to be weaker than one would anticipate over time; so in the second half we do have, in effect, a bit of a catch up But looking at next year we only have a 1-1/2 percent nondurables increase; this year as a  -19-    8/22/89  whole we only have something in that vicinity, after the revisions for the second quarter So, the outlook is for a very modest growth of nondurables   [Unintelligible] be at something in excess of 3 percent So this is a fairly buoyant, as we characterized it, demand picture And it's only in small part an automobile story because, while we get a burst from the third quarter, in the fourth quarter we're expecting a pay-back So on net over that span it isn't an auto story In fact, in the GNP forecast the automobile assemblies are taking a fraction off of GNP growth in the third and fourth quarters   You take out the government Then, with the private domestic final purchases you're getting down to just consumption, residential investment, and business fixed investment   Well, for the single-family sector, the time differential between the permit and the start is very short Statistically you cannot find any lead-lag relationship in that data I think our permits tend to be less volatile from month-to-month   Statistically, [permits] in level terms [don't tend] to be all that far different from the starts story   Indeed But I think if you look at the new home and existing home sales in June, the housing starts for the last couple of months, the single-family number in July, and the anecdotal evidence in the press and elsewhere regarding builders' attitudes and consumer attitudes, all of these things point to some upturn And we have a modest upturn in residential construction beginning in this quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter   There wasn't much change, and they may not have declined much in real terms if you think there was some diminution in long-run inflation expectations   Well, I think I differ on that One, on the structure side, we really have discounted this If you just wanted to look at the data literally, there has been a considerable upturn in construction contracts in the last several months We think that's just a sporadic movement that is not likely to be sustained, but actually it has strengthened On the orders side it depends on how you want to look at the zigs and zags from month-to-month You can look at the zigs and zags for the past half year or so and say that--   --for computers it's no better than flat, and maybe has edged off some But remember, that nominal dollars there-- given the price declines--translate into a sizable real increase in expenditures So one needs to keep that in mind If you look outside of computers at the non-aircraft, non-computer component, either we have had a persistently strong uptrend or, looking at the zigs and zags in the least optimistic view, one would say it has been rather flat Somewhere in between is where we come out in interpreting this, particularly in light of the backlogs in that area So we think there is some further growth ahead   I don't want to get into a long debate, but let me refer you to the middle panel of the chart on page 16 of Part II of the Greenbook That is the chart to which I was alluding; that's other nondefense capital goods and the solid line is orders Last fall it looked like things were falling out of bed That orders figure turned down What we've had in the first half of this year is a tremendous increase in producers durable equipment outlays and pretty strong exports of equipment as well As you can see, the shipments just continued to rise In the first half of this year we zig-zagged on a flat path But one could easily do an optical  -21-    8/22/89  regression here and draw a trend line right through 1987-88 to the current numbers and say the trend is still intact It's a judgment--   As I said, the recent evidence has been rather mixed The anecdotal evidence--the reports that we are hearing from some of the producers of capital goods--doesn't sound all that great So, I don't want to make the case that this sector is unambiguously robust at this point   Indeed, but I think the history also tells us that one needs to be very careful "
3764,1989-10-03," I'll try, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think we expect to see any dramatic interest rate effect in the trend of capital goods outlays The lags there are too long The [interest] elasticity is too low We didn't really think that was going to move that series around very much It's true that the orders trend, as I suggested, has not been especially strong of late If you start dissecting the data and you take account of declining computer prices and so on, I think there is a sound case for expecting relatively moderate growth in real equipment outlays And that's what we have in the forecast We don't have an acceleration; we have a deceleration in the forecast   I don't think it has had a large effect, no We haven't had a large enough change in interest rate levels to greatly alter businessmen's assessment of the profitability of investment over the long run On the housing side, we have lowered our third-quarter forecast for real construction outlays We were disappointed by the August housing starts While the average in the past couple of months has been up a bit, it hasn't been dramatic by any means A lot of that weakness has been in the multifamily sector; that's a very  -20-    10/3/89  volatile number But the single-family starts in August also were a shade on the weak side What we think is happening, though, is that we see some pickup in housing demand as manifested in existing home sales And in new homes sales, the information from surveys about consumers' perceptions of home buying conditions has moved in a favorable direction with the decline in interest rates We're expecting a modest boost to overall economic activity in the near term, this quarter, from residential construction But that's a small sector And despite the secondary effects that it can have on consumer expenditures and so forth we don't think it's going to provide a tremendous thrust to the economy We do look for a positive number, though, in the fourth quarter   I think that's the case If you had super rational people who perceive that all of a sudden monetary policy was on a track that was going to hold nominal aggregate demand expansion in line with the trend rate of real output growth, then expectations would change and wage bargaining would revolve around that kind of expectation You could have an instantaneous downward adjustment in the rate of inflation without any significant cost in real output Of course, there are contracts and other impediments so that even if expectations adjusted dramatically--   I think you'd have a hard task to bring nominal aggregate demand expansion down immediately to that noninflationary level I can't envision that happening without an enormous jolt to the system   But if there were no inflexibility in the form of contracts and so on and if you had absolute credibility--if you could announce today that you are pulling on to this track and everyone believed you--then presumably everything would flow through and real effects would be minimal   Well, I think you put your finger on the appropriate facets of the system here that impede that kind of frictionless movement toward lower inflation   At this point we feel the economy is, in a sense, overemployed In that kind of situation the competition for resources tends to put upward pressure on wages and prices And until we develop a bit more slack, we think that's the direction in which things are going to tend to drift We've been generous, in a sense, relative to what the models would tell us We have not really taken a hard view that we're below the natural rate and that there are tremendous acceleration forces here We have rather modest acceleration in the forecast But the historical evidence is reasonably compelling that in the short run there is this kind of trade-off and you don't get the frictional movement to lower inflation rates without any output loss   Right, precisely   Well, that's why we are being reasonably optimistic We think perhaps there is some greater flexibility We think there is also some residuum of fear here about loss of employment and so forth that may not have existed in earlier years, but that workers are aware of because of the turmoil in the '80s and the exposure to international trade,   Sure This is not something we feel we know absolutely But we're hard pressed to explain what we have been observing without some sense that, as the economy got tighter, that exerted some inflationary pressure You could play some games here in guessing what inflation expectations were at various times during the last several years and make that consistent with the pressures in the labor market in terms of the unemployment rate level not having been a substantial explanatory factor But it looks to us that, as we got down into the 5 to 6 percent unemployment rate range, there was some pressure on wages and prices  -22-    10/3/89   So the question is How do you unwind that? If you could bring about a sudden powerful expectational change, that might help to minimize the need for any loss of output in order to move the inflation rate back down But otherwise we think there are going to be some frictional costs here   You're talking about the fourth quarter, right?   Yes, the fourth-quarter inventory picture is muddled by the aircraft deliveries and gyrations in oil inventories that we inferred will occur because of a surge in oil imports recently So there are those technical considerations Basically, we have underlying that a rather moderate rate of inventory accumulation On third-quarter growth, 3 percent or 3-1/2 percent is certainly within our confidence interval At this point, looking at the labor input, a number in the two's looks like a better guess But I know there are others who have looked at the data and come up with higher numbers This is our best guess at this point with a lot of data missing   Right, and they were up $12 billion at an annual rate   It was $50 billion in July   You're ahead of me on that; I don't have those numbers   Right, there was a pretty broad-- "
3783,1989-10-17," Well, Ted Truman is here and has the numbers I'll put it to him    10/17/89 -5-   President Corrigan, as Ted said, we don't have this fully processed, but I might just note that up to this point the expenditure data for the third quarter were running a tad stronger than we had been anticipating So, whether this in the end adds up to a substantially different third-quarter GNP increase than we were expecting, I'm not at all sure at this point "
3812,1989-11-14," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, for one thing, we actually did have interest rates rising through the first half of this year The surprise on the interest rate path has been essentially since the spring With the lags, one wouldn't have expected a very large deviation over the recent period As we look forward into the first part of 1990, we get the offsetting influence then of the lagged    11/14/89  effects of the dollar firmness on net exports Those are at least two things that come immediately to mind on how one might be able to explain this   Right, particularly [the funds rate]   They never rose very much; that's clear   As we look into early 1990 I think these are the two offsetting considerations affecting GNP growth in the first part of 1990 we have lower rates than we anticipated but we have a much higher dollar than we anticipated   I don't think there's any comparison Looking at the chart that we had in our pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, total nonfinancial corporate profits basically shot up in the early recovery phase and didn't really move much one way or the other through 1984 They began to give way toward the end of that year and have eased off since then almost continuously But there has been a very sharp drop recently Now, there are some rather peculiar things in the numbers because of the disasters; they eliminated some profits in the third quarter and we presume that BEA also will recognize the losses in insurance companies and so on in the fourth quarter So, that's giving us some one-time shocks But I don't think there's any comparison to that earlier period with what we're seeing now   I think we've had a very marked decline and we're getting to historically low levels of profitability relative to the scale of business   I guess I'm not clear how you're connecting the past two years with 1990    11/14/89   I don't think we're anticipating anything that is really extraordinary in that relationship We have personal consumption expenditures next year growing roughly in line with disposable income One might argue, looking at the rise in the wealth-to-income ratio that we have seen over the past year or more now, that you might tend to get a little stronger consumption growth than income We haven't put a great deal of weight on that argument But I don't think we have anything extraordinary, given our income path and that background on the wealth effects Looking at the gyrations and relationships over the past couple of years, one needs to be mindful of the short-run effects of increases or decreases in farm income--which probably don't feed through to consumption expenditures--and various other special features of the income composition But looking forward, I think we have a pretty steady relationship here between income and consumption   We're expecting rates of growth in those items that would look low by the standards of this expansion If you somehow felt that everything else was right about this forecast-- particularly looking into 1991 when, in our forecast, import prices become a significant factor in creating something of a wedge here in depressing growth of disposable income relative to growth of activity --then you get into questions about whether people are viewing these as transitory terms of trade changes or something more permanent In effect, we've assumed that people will take the permanent view and that they will reduce their consumption expenditures in line with that weaker disposable income growth If they persisted, then you would have a tension here, which I think is sort of in the vein of your question   This is a striking gap Larry [Slifman] can speak with expertise on this subject We have been around on this a number of times in the past and have argued with them about it; our raw judgment is that they don't really take a very careful view of the 10-day seasonals We have tried to, but that still leaves last month with a considerable gap between the monthly numbers    11/14/89   Given the recent numbers, I think we ought to go back and haggle with them about this some more   The product you get differs considerably   Looking at assembly schedules on our seasonal versus [theirs], on our seasonals you don't have this appearance of a significant gap Basically with [unintelligible] vendors implied significant inventory accumulation going on So it's an important question And this recent 10-day figure just amplifies this again We'll talk to them some more, but we've had many conversations with them and thought maybe--   I might say that in the past one of the things we have wrestled with BEA over is their willingness to adjust for the timing of model changeovers We have been a bit more flexible and adaptive on this than they have and that has created, in a number of years, some significant differences in pattern I don't know whether that's a continuing problem this year, where once again things were not necessarily perfectly aligned with the historical norms   That is the Boeing gyration It's depressing PDE in this quarter and increasing it in the next quarter; then you're back onto the trend of growth   Indeed, this is all assuming that the strike ends at the end of this month and then that production gradually gears up to full [speed] by the first of the year So, obviously, there is room for some significant short-run deviation   Offsets? At this point, since it appears that the suppliers are still providing materials and components to dealers, those are piling up You're not getting the value added of the assembly But that could change, too If the strike went on beyond our assumption, we would expect that to become a factor  -10-    11/14/89   We have a higher level gradually diminishing as we go out through 1990 But it is--   What we've got built in is not as much as the numbers that one hears--$5 billion or $8 billion that we're looking at in terms of damage and so on You don't know how much of that really will be replaced; you don't know in the short run how much will be squeezed out by that effort, to the extent that factors of production are reasonably totally utilized in an area The possibility of doing the repair work and still maintaining the other activity that would have occurred becomes a question So, I think there is some upside potential here from our forecast on the rebuilding   In productivity?   Basically, we have the stronger effect as the economy is decelerating And that's what one normally sees As labor is adjusted to lower levels of production, you get some bottoming out in the growth and some tendency toward slight acceleration--you move closer to the longer-run trend of productivity expansion   Something over 1-1/4 percent, maybe   Mr Chairman, the 18th is a Monday; there's a Board meeting I don't know what the agenda is to be-- "
3840,1989-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I just wanted to make a few brief comments before my colleagues make their presentation As we listened at the last couple of meetings to the remarks of various Committee members regarding their expectations for this session, I must say that we were more than a little concerned The potential scope of the discussion seemed to encompass not only more than we would have time to prepare or present but also more than we know or than anyone knows So, our first job was to narrow the focus of our presentation to the issues that were both manageable and relevant to the Committee's policy concerns We concentrated in particular on the question of the costs, in terms of unemployment and lost output, that can be expected to be incurred with an effort to achieve price stability within a five-year time frame Surely, our [unintelligible] not only are of importance but also [the degree to] which positive analysis as opposed to personal value numbers can be brought to bear One that comes to mind immediately is that of inflation measurements [and how] one wishes to quantify this price stability goal In the list of discussion thoughts we distributed were those other questions to which some theoretical and empirical analysis probably can be applied, although I must admit that research to date has provided few, if any, definitive answers Be that as it may, what we are presenting today certainly addresses some of the most urgent [concerns] facing the Committee, given present economic conditions and where we stand relative to the ultimate objective of price stability On that note, let me indicate that we have three speakers Dave Stockton and Larry Slifman from the Research Division, and Peter Hooper from the Division of International Finance Dave will begin  MESSRS STOCKTON, SLIFMAN, and HOOPER [Statements--see Appendix]   We were looking to you folks to address that I am sure you must sit around and talk about it and have views about it   You're [layering] on top of an ultimate objective the things that are in the targets and so on?   Clearly, we haven't always achieved our monetary targets; so whether that in itself would have a great additional effect isn't clear On the other hand, if [you look] back to the early '80s--a time in which we were perceived, correctly or not, to be on a monetarist sort of approach--maybe that will bring back the memories that what was needed at that time was a very hard-nosed approach   But then you will recognize that the structure of the system, the behavioral relations, are not normal--certainly in that in the short run you might get a variety of mixes of output and price movement given nominal GNP growth I suspect the more you seek to tie your hands in the way [policy] seems to be directed toward price stability the more it does [unintelligible] to credibility But as I said, rolling on top of that ultimate objective, [if] that [is perceived] to be strong, it's almost a sufficient condition in itself   It could be A sense of this financial upset that you refer to might be one of [unintelligible] or sharper adjustments [Unintelligible] you might get [unintelligible] by hitting the system without regard to the financial dislocations, affecting expectations more strongly You're just perhaps, with the financial effects, layering on another contraction of [unintelligible], which means you get more bang for your interest rate buck in slowing the economy and inflation [unintelligible]   Sure We [don't] make any strong claim for precision here The basic question is Is there any relationship between the slack in the economy and wage and price [behavior]?   Now, obviously, we're making our decisions as we go along Some notion of how much effect we're going to get for various--   Let me just say, and Larry referred to this, that we have had underway a comprehensive examination of this issue; had it not been for the overload we reached when you requested this briefing, we would have had it done by now It will be available before very long And it will explore all of these specifics as well as amplify what already has been indicated about the various tests that we did to see whether there were structure changes   Well, we know there's a reigning opinion on this Clearly, it has become much more fashionable in recent years to take the view that there is not the kind of correlation that has been conventionally [believed] The Board model, in estimating these relationships does find the more traditional [unintelligible] budget deficit does [tend] to raise interest rates We may live in a more [unintelligible] world but we can't detect it; it means [unintelligible] this correlation But if this [unintelligible], when there is a [big] increase in government debt relative to the size of the economy it does tend to raise interest rates In our baseline we've assumed that if the size of the government debt relative to GNP is [trending] down, it would tend to allow real interest rates to [decline]   Well, we don't deny the existence of differing views on this; and we view this as a legitimate area for continuing research But this is the model we have at this point and the one we've found best fits the historical experience But we [realize] it is an area of continuing debate   When we tried [unintelligible] we have to bring it down and you get an overshoot in deflation That's the basic [thrust] One could come up with an infinite number of year-by-year paths here But we have a couple of things that we think are broadly representative of the problem that you face   Well, a simple response to that is that you would then lack [a forum] to achieve anything by declaring your intentions   [Unintelligible]   We have made that assumption We clearly--   Those things fall roughly in a class of supply shocks, along with the oil price change process  -11-    12/18-19/89   But it really is It reduces the productivity that exists in capital in many cases or--   Yes; regardless, it shifts that labor cost function   Within our ability to incorporate these things in models, they are the same   One of the things that we know we didn't treat, for example, were distributional effects That's something you might want to take into consideration   I think we'd have a very difficult time bringing you any very concrete quantitative results on that That isn't to say it's not something we would want to think about   In essence, if you have 2 percentage points of excess unemployment for one year or 1 percentage point in each of two years, you have essentially the same effect in terms of this   Mr Chairman, I can't help but say that I think President Forrestal is leading up to your agenda as opposed to ours, but there is a nexus here And that is, if the public thinks that the FOMC is thinking this way, then that means there is no credibility to the disinflationary commitment   And what we were pointing out in the Hoey exhibit, whatever quality you want to assign to that, was that there doesn't seem to be an expectation of further disinflation out there  -14-    12/18-19/89  The basic perception seems to be that the Federal Reserve will resist acceleration [of inflation] but will not run the real risks of subpar economic performance to bring the inflation rate down So we're in that credibility bind, I think   You've got to look at that [as an expectation that the rate] will go below the actual inflation next year   [Unintelligible]   But it has come down toward the actual inflation rate That rate has been slower   Well, you don't want to extend this forever Basically, you had a period in which the short-run inflation was very much influenced by food and the price of oil, which I--  -15-    12/18-19/89   There's not an absolute [consistency] with the other forecast materials we provided We simplified some things and developed a baseline We don't necessarily capture all the [details]   [Unintelligible] But we make a certain assumption about the natural rate of unemployment and we mechanically derive things that probably we would want to modify judgmentally given all the other [unintelligible] about economic circumstances   Using the P* you get the same monetary growth as we have   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think we'd make very minor revisions at this point Basically, we had not received the retail trade inventories We had heavily discounted the wholesale trade inventories, which we received at the very last minute When we look at those data and at the trade data, our hunch is that the best guess is still in that 0 to 1 percent range--not appreciably different from what we have now   Well, we have been hounding those folks and evidently didn't hit the same person you hit because it sounds like you got much more information than we've been able to glean on the details of their scheduling   We have been trying and trying to get these facts pinned down and I have not heard through my colleagues--   What we've tried to communicate, President Parry, is that all of these are short-run factors, including the earthquake and so on Basically what we see is growth in the range of about 1 to 1-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter through the second quarter   There are a number of items involved here One is that the unemployment rate, while moving up faster in this projection than in the last one, doesn't really get to a level where we think it would have a significant effect in damping wage and price increases until we get well into 1990 In the near term, though, we think the smaller consumer price increases we have had in the second half of this year and that we anticipate in the first part of next year will be helping to damp wage increases So, as we look at wage trends--setting aside the self inflicted wounds of social security tax increases and minimum wage hikes--the underlying trend is beginning to turn down very gradually around the middle of 1990 and it continues on down A couple of other factors affecting the contour are the oil price assumption and the dollar assumption Oil prices in the near term are a helpful element in the picture, but as time progresses and we get into 1991 our assumption of no real change in the oil price begins to become a neutral factor as opposed to a helpful factor in the inflation trend Finally--and this is sort of what we demonstrated in the exhibits yesterday--the autonomous depreciation of the dollar, so to speak, does have some effect on that short-run trade-off If you took out the dollar depreciation that we have, the picture would be much more favorable in terms of the apparent trend Basically, next year's CPI probably would not be materially above 4 percent and might even be a shade below Looking out into 1991 it probably would be at 4 percent or a shade below So that might give you a little sense of movement toward a lower inflation projection   But in a sense we don't have any real sacrifice occurring until we get out into 1991   As we measured it   Governor Johnson, let me remind you that if you play this game of abstracting from the dollar's movements, particularly the ones that we don't see as tightly connected to monetary policy and other fundamental factors, you would have to elevate the recent inflation rates in gauging the trend So in a sense, you're working against these continuing price level shocks that affect how the year-to-year inflation movements look But if you want to do that--and particularly if you felt others would do that and be charitable in their assessments of the trends and in shaping their expectations--then the picture isn't quite as unfavorable as it looks   Well, we have And we can present that arithmetic again There is that question of how people, in shaping their expectations, are going to read those data and whether they are going to take the same sort of view  -67-    12/18-19/89   It looks to me like a cut of about a half point by next spring is the consensus forecast   Yes, I think there is a prevailing expectation of a decline in the funds rate But I think that most people's concerns about recession really are near term enough that they see the interest rate decline as being coincident with the period of greater softness What they're getting is a bigger boost to growth in the latter half of 1990 and on into 1991 And this goes to the point I made yesterday I think they perceive the Federal Reserve as being very loath to see low growth and willing to accept a 4 percent plus CPI rate of increase That is the projection for next year--something over 4 percent with no sign of any deceleration going into 1991   Well, as I've indicated before, this is a very complicated thing to try to sort out We did an MPS model run to try to address this, and at this point the 1989 fourth-quarter to fourth- quarter growth in real GNP is the same as what we had in February What has happened in this accounting is that the lower interest rates occurred only after a period of rise, so we haven't had that playing out entirely We've had a higher dollar and the combination of these two forces end up being neutralized So essentially we have a [GNP growth rate of] 2-1/2 percent, as we had anticipated Because of the pattern we have had, though, if you went back and took the dollar and interest rate paths that we had in place as of February and compared that to what we now have, the picture for 1990 should be stronger than  -69-    12/18-19/89  what we have I think we have perceived some areas of weakness compared to what we had been anticipating In housing, for example, we haven't gotten the kind of response we had anticipated And there are some other sectors that probably are a touch weaker fundamentally at this point than we had anticipated But basically in 1989 it's a story of lower [than anticipated] interest rates offsetting an unanticipated strong dollar   In the year 1989, Q4 to Q4   We had [forecast] a 12 percent increase in real exports of goods and services in the February Greenbook We have an increase of 7-1/2 percent now   Q4 to Q4   On the services   That's Boeing and reconstruction   There are a number of things that could go wrong, or even right, in the outlook If consumer demand, for example, is fundamentally weaker than we perceive it to be, [unintelligible] will be longer lasting and have worse effects If export demand isn't as strong or business investment isn't as strong, these elements of final demand could be a drag on output   We have a rebound in car sales in the first quarter as they try to get these inventories down   Basically, auto production in the first quarter is deducting something like 3/10ths of a percent from output growth So it's a decided negative, as it is in the current quarter But our assumption is that through a combination of very low production levels and expanded incentives they will be able to get the inventories in reasonable alignment by the spring As best I can tell from reports I have had from automobile companies they have budgeted very large amounts for incentives [next] year They have incentives in place already but they are well below what they have budgeted for the year as a whole So I would expect them to pull out all the stops in the next few months, unless there is a surprising pickup in sales without that   No, it's not   I'd emphasize that we still have production down But if the sales with the added incentives don't come up to our expectations that means there's a more prolonged adjustment necessary I think automobile companies have been trying to wrestle with the experience of the last few years in assessing what the price elasticity is and what the longer-run stock trends are They have seen strong sales of cars and light trucks over the past several years and they have been trying, as we have, to get a handle on the extent to which people simply have accumulated a relatively large stock of cars at this point On top of that there is concern about these very long car loans and how long people are in negative equity positions; they may be less inclined to buy a new car after the same interval that they previously did So there are a lot of things going on that are hard to sort through   We have January well below what they currently have announced We don't have [the production schedules for] all of the Big Three for the subsequent months but we have just a shade over 6 million cars at an annual rate in the first quarter, which is a low rate   We never assert that, if we could formalize it, the probability distribution is perfectly even on both sides But we think it's reasonably balanced We noted yesterday that if you look at the P* model, for example, with a sort of money approach, we're in balance essentially between the equilibrium level and the actual price level And our monetary forecast wouldn't yield through the P* model a distinctly different outcome for inflation than we have in the Greenbook   We might do better the second time around!   In 1980   It's just a correction of the language there I would recommend that it read ""Housing starts fell in November but for the October-November period were up somewhat on average from their third-quarter level"" It captures-- "
3867,1990-02-06," Well, there are a couple of pieces to that and they are both areas in which researchers have argued a great deal and have not reached definitive conclusions One is the influence of profits per se on business spending I don't think [the outlook for] that is favorable, and I indicated that profits and the cash flow picture are considerations in our weak investment forecast Whether that influence should be stronger and we should have an even weaker investment picture is an arguable proposition As it stands our forecast is considerably weaker than the Commerce Department's P&E survey would suggest and weaker than some other forecasts But that crunch in profits, I think, does raise some questions I would note that corporations are paying out a lot of their revenue to debt holders And if you look at the return to capital in forms of both debt and equity, this doesn't look as low in historical terms as profit share alone But it's a factor that one needs to keep in mind  Now, on the price side and the wage side, I think wages have a considerable momentum What one picks up looking historically at decelerations in wages that come with higher unemployment is that those are times when typically there is weaker profitability too Whether there's an independent influence here is the question But I would think that this certainly would steel many managers in their negotiations with labor They want to try to do something about improving their profit margins and one way to go about that is to be    2/6-7/90  tougher on the wage side That may lend itself to some contentious negotiations in the unionized sector But in general I think that whole complex of weak demand and low profits is going to be putting some squeeze on wages We have a gradual deceleration It's obscured in 1990 by the big payroll tax and minimum wage effects; it's less so in 1991 But we tried to take those factors into account   Well, as we factor all that, there are three things that have happened on the financial front recently The dollar has come down and, for the last few months, the dollar has tended to outpace our expectations on the down side Short-term interest rates have come down and they clearly are a borrowing cost for a number of businesses and households They probably have come down very considerably in real terms in the very short run We view that rise in long rates as being at least partially a real increase; it is more than that long-term inflation expectations have risen Governor Angell referred to one thing that may have some persistence here on the energy front beyond just the heating oil crunch in December But, basically, we've viewed that as being at least in considerable part a real increase, and it has shown through in our forecast, particularly in the construction area Mortgage rates, both nominal and real, are a factor in this forecast and, certainly, that was one element So, these things have all sort of balanced out in the greater scheme of things with our dollar forecast It has tended to buoy net exports as a contributor to GNP as we look out, but interest rate movements on net probably have tended to damp domestic demands somewhat We've come out with essentially the same GNP forecast   As I tried to suggest, without putting a fine point on this, we've assumed that the rise in nominal long rates is part inflation premium and part real It has been a big move and I think that real part is not insignificant   Well, actually, Hoey hasn't done a survey since this recent run-up of the curve So, for what it's worth, we don't have that one to look at   That's one of the problems with looking at real rates as a gauge of monetary policy It's an outcome of both monetary factors and expected returns on capital And, yes, this is a world- wide phenomenon in the sense that you were addressing before because growth prospects and returns on capital may be higher owing to developments in Eastern Europe It's hard to believe that's 70 basis points worth, but--   And with the stronger cyclical indicators--the orders figures and so on--maybe there is some element of elevation in people's expected returns on real investment   Well, I'm inclined to think that that's true There is quantitative evidence of the increasing role of foreign parts producers in providing inputs to the transplants It has become a very complicated international market The point I was making was that in terms of future employment prospects I don't think the Big Three are stripped down yet enough They are carrying a substantial amount of excess capacity, particularly at GM They're not operating as efficiently as they're going to have to So, while the transplants are probably going to be expanding employment somewhat over the next couple of years, the net may be a negative from this decline in auto demand because the Big Three really need to shrink some   Well, that's true As I said, I think the stock out there has become relatively ample There is that financing question and the fact that with long maturity automobile loans it takes a long time to build up any positive equity So the automobile manufacturers think that as a short-run factor there isn't the opportunity in many people's minds to trade in as rapidly That shouldn't be a big factor over time in affecting automobile demand But that is something they worry about; there's no doubt about it   Average life has been increasing and it may be because of improved quality   I was afraid he was going to say that! I must confess I have not developed great expertise on the natural gas bubble Yes, it is certainly widely discussed that the situation is changing, and in our forecast we have natural gas prices rising 4 to 4-1/2 percent per year in 1990-91 There is some firmness there in the long-run forecast Fortunately, there are people who provide    2/6-7/90  inputs to this process who are more knowledgeable than I I suspect there are others around the table here who can speak with more knowledge on that   If you look at the survey-based expectations for the foreseeable future or at Hoey's last survey, for example, he's looking at 4-1/2 percent or something like that for 10 years And that would not be grossly out of line with what is built into these numbers for the United States   I can give it to you on a calendar-year basis   The change in the high employment budget was $11 billion in 1989 and then we reverse sign to minus $34 billion in 1990 and minus $44 billion in 1991   Clearly, we'd opt for the high employment over the actual budget deficit as a measure But even that number has its shortcomings--the treatment of interest, for example There are a number of things that bother us about that and that's why we invested the effort in coming up with some new measures of fiscal impetus, which I didn't cite this time Basically those numbers are headed in the direction of restraint in '89, '90, and '91 and especially in '90   Senator Moynihan?   I don't know what the net of Senator Moynihan would be   Well, either the high employment measure or our own fiscal impetus measures would be looking at national income and product accounts data that would abstract the purely financial transactions So, that wouldn't be a factor in our thinking Basically, the $30 billion that I cited is roughly that in either unified budget accounting or national income accounting And that's in a sense a discretionary budget action and a reasonable measure of what we think fiscal policy is doing independently   Well, basically what we have is high rates and fiscal restraint holding growth below the long-run trend We're opening up a gap over that period of time But we do have the effects of the dollar working through here to provide some increased demand for US-produced goods And that tends to hold [activity] up while domestic demand is being more directly affected by the monetary and fiscal restraint   Well, we looked at that and asked ourselves the same question and, obviously, we ended up with these numbers after all of that There is a marked slowing of employment growth in this forecast; we have increases in employment in payrolls of about 1-1/4    2/6-7/90  percent in the two years We have another negative effect on real disposable income coming through the terms of trade effect as the price of imported goods rises relatively rapidly That tends to create some wedge between product prices and consumer prices It's a small thing, but it's tending to work in that direction This is an economy in which we have very slow growth We have some productivity increase and we think this is internally consistent But it is a very low growth and it raises some questions, I think, about how this kind of situation will be perceived by consumers We have not assumed that there will be any extraordinary change in their behavior, despite this prolonged period of slow growth One needs to keep in mind throughout this, as we look at the future, that to the extent the population is growing more slowly we're going to get [unintelligible] too   President Syron, if you carry that general phenomenon far enough in terms of greater credit rationing effects and some contraction in credit availability, then you begin to affect the general interest rate level; presumably, that's consistent with the given growth path of the economy   And then that tends, presumably, to work in the other direction We've built in only a modest amount of that sort of additional restraint in the forecast That's probably consistent with what most of you, I would judge, think is likely to occur So, there is a possibility of something more of a constraint   Mr Chairman, I might note on M3 that in our flow-of-funds forecast we're still assuming that there is some degree of restraint on thrift institution asset expansion and on that aggregate as a whole If you look at the long-term trend, it is one of a velocity decline So it does raise some question, if you have 6-1/2 percent as the top end, whether that would be sustainable over the longer run unless we did get nominal GNP moving down into the 4 to 5 percent range So, that's a possible reason for a precaution in how aggressively you move the M3 range   Well, I was addressing the concern that the Chairman was raising   Again, these things could be explained at each--   I think moving that rapidly would make a material difference We can probably infer something from the simulations that were presented earlier--that a 1 percent slower M2 growth adds only 1/2 percentage point to the interest rate level And you saw the consequences in terms of GNP growth So you'd be enlarging that It would make it a much closer call as to whether we had any significant [economic] growth this year   A no-growth scenario   Well, that's all off the baseline in the model Clearly, there are different views about underlying forces You might have an entirely different conclusion about the ramifications of that type of move   I'm not sure what study you're referring to   Well, really, the first and second halves average about the same "
3894,1990-03-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we've anticipated seasonally adjusted declines over the next couple of months in apparel prices, which would not have been the pattern with the customary introduction of seasonal apparel over the past couple of years So, in effect, the answer is that we are taking this as something of a special factor that should unwind over the next couple of months to some degree Indeed, we've lowered our forecast of the ex food and energy CPI increase for the second quarter from what we previously had But the cumulative effect of the last few months of data in this overall category--even though there are special things like transit charges and other items that seem to be one-time events--has been that the trend is a little higher It just seems to fit with the general circumstances of overall spending being stronger--knowing that that profit margin pressure was there, which businesses presumably would like to relieve to some degree [Unintelligible] the context of import prices turning upward, thus relieving a bit of the competitive pressure So it all seems to fit together in this direction We've raised [our forecast of] prices ex food and energy this year; they change Q4 to Q4 by 2 percent, a fairly modest change   That's by design of course I hope everyone--   Let me say first of all that in terms of the change in rate assumptions from last time, as you may recall, what we indicated at the February meeting was that we didn't anticipate any significant change but in terms of what we had written down in quantitative terms there was a modest upward drift in rates So the rate increase in this projection is not quite the 1 point and 1/2 point that I referred to It comes more quickly We had had rates just drifting up through the projection [period] pretty easily Whether or not one would characterize this as substantial could be debated Certainly, in terms of cyclical movements in interest rates that in the past have caused major changes in the direction of the economy, a 1 point change in the funds rate really wouldn't look all that dramatic Using our quarterly model and holding the funds rate at the current level throughout the forecast period, we would end up with a higher level of real GNP at the end of 1991 by about 7 percent And because of the long lag in the price effects, we probably would see an inflation rate next year only 1 or so higher than what we have in the forecast As we've emphasized many times, it takes some time for those inflation changes to reemerge One could--   We would have an unemploymnent rate about 1/4 of a point lower That's really not a very big difference, and I guess that's consistent with what I've said about the kind of shock that a 1 percentage point interest rate change at the short end imposes on the economy Clearly, if one wanted to move the inflation rate down, these can be applied in reverse You'd need a substantial rise in interest rates to make significant progress within 1991 to bring the unemployment rate up much more quickly and reduce capacity utilization The trajectory going into 1992, however, is an altogether different story If the unemployment rate were to go in excess of 6 percent next year, presumably we would begin to see some significant deceleration in prices in 1992, all other things equal   Well, last year was somewhat erratic; the course was generally in a downward direction even though interest rates came down in the latter half of the year I would say that we have had a very hard time getting the base level from recent months, given all the weather effects, so there is clearly a bit of guesswork there We've looked at the permits for the last couple of months, though, and they likely are not as affected by weather--particularly in the  -14-    3/27/90  single-family area where we haven't had the HUD effect Using that as some benchmark, we thought that something that had an underlying level roughly consistent with that pace would be appropriate for the coming months I don't expect some little payback for the faster starts of houses in January and February, but basically that's what guided us And we don't have very much interest rate movement this year So we're just assuming starts are going to be in that area This is the area where some of the other forecasters--mortgage bankers, the homebuilders, and others--are putting housing starts, so we have some company But, obviously, because of the construction loan issue, there's considerable uncertainty about these figures   I couldn't do that if it would make Ted's forecast wrong! I'd never hear the end of it! This is something we have to deal with every time we put together a forecast Essentially, we're trying to give some indication of how we think monetary policy probably will have to move in order to bring about what we discern to be your objectives One element in terms of how forceful an action we build in here is our assessment of whether the outcome we have would seem to be consistent with your objectives Obviously, you all have somewhat different objective functions to some degree; and I think the key feature of this is that as we get toward the end of 1991 we don't have a discernibly different inflation trend than we did in the prior forecast It's one where we feel the peak has been reached and things are turning toward a lower trend of inflation, but only very slowly Indeed, one might debate whether that is the proper objective and whether we caught that right  In terms of the timing of the interest rate increase, I suppose in this instance I've indulged in some effort to temper this somewhat with uncertainties that I've noted I've reached the judgment that, given that the real boost to domestic production is forecast not to occur until 1991, there was an interval here in which one could await some clarification of some of these uncertainties  -17-    3/27/90  before moving what I characterized as a fairly moderate amount If one felt you had to move 2 percentage points or 3 percentage points in order to rein things in, then whether it would make sense to have this all happening in about 3 or 4 months' time or to spread it out over a longer interval would have presented us with a different issue But in effect, we've tempered this in terms of timing on the basis of the many uncertainties that we think exist right now   We've always recognized that possibility I want to emphasize that matters of timing, given these small amounts, would not make a great difference in our projections That's maybe one argument for why we should always do something smoothly But we also try to capture the uncertainties and the policy realities that exist   Some of my colleagues would argue that we've been bold, in a sense, in not raising our wage forecast more than we have In that sense we have taken the lower unemployment rate and said it's not going to have a significant effect on the wage outlook because we've taken a fairly optimistic view of the incoming information And I suggested that that was a risk It's in essence saying we may be able to get by with a somewhat lower unemployment rate in the short run than we thought previously I tried to highlight that risk We mentioned it explicitly in the Greenbook And that's one reason why we didn't feel the compulsion to put in a more aggressive move in terms of timing on the--   We're always in this tough position and we try to be as neutral as possible, not injecting ourselves into the short-run tactical decisions   Well, I think we can look back to 1988-89 and see that the Committee really has moved significantly at times   Sometimes we have when it looked like you had to move a considerable amount within a short period of time in order to head things off Normally, we don't build things in immediately   But there have been times when we have   There are some sectors in manufacturing that one can identify as having suffered relatively more than others But it isn't only manufacturing where the profits have turned down One can see utilities and transportation, for example, as sectors where profits have turned down Within manufacturing it's a mixed bag, and we only have figures through the third quarter of last year Some of the areas that stick out are in the machinery and equipment area and, obviously, motor vehicles Chemicals seem to have peaked out Surprisingly, primary metals and fabricated metals held up fairly well last year So, there are many industries in which profits have been squeezed, but it's somewhat uneven   Well, we certainly have presented on several occasions specific alternative scenarios that will do more [on prices] We had the lengthy presentation in December about longer- range disinflation paths I think you--   Frankly, what we try to do is listen and hit as close to the middle of the Committee's expressed desires here in shaping our scenarios I certainly will listen to what I hear today and we will adjust accordingly As I said, my sense is that there are varying degrees of aggressiveness around the table with regard to going all out to bring down the inflation rate within the next year or so And I guess we felt that the highest priority was on establishing a trend, and that's simply what we've done But we can be more--   On the latter question, to the extent that you surprise people with your aggressiveness in responding to what might appear to be a stronger inflationary risk, then I think credibility is enhanced and maybe it does not take a large move but merely one that comes sooner than the market had expected So, I would certainly grant that point In terms of the surprise and what it would imply for prospective inflation, one aspect of the models would be that to the extent they have backward-looking expectations or lagged prices in their wage equations, that would tend to build the momentum in prospectively through markup models of prices In effect, in our case we didn't feed this through to wages Partly, it's quite conceivable that inflation expectations [unintelligible] a forward-looking expectations model in wage formation and that they really will not reflect the food and energy price bulges that presumably will unwind,  -20-    3/27/90  and we may not have as big a price expectation problem In terms of errors and so on, it isn't necessarily inherent in the models as to how one should translate that That's at the discretion of the model operator to decide whether to have negative or positive adjustments in future [unintelligible] to a surprise But as I suggested, we have taken a somewhat more optimistic view than models would of the recent experience And with [unintelligible] to prospects   You're not making my life easier! I badly feel [unintelligible] consensus here   We have only a few billion dollars of the--   Governor Seger, a clarification We have $8 billion of various tax [increases] in our '91 deficit reduction package "
3905,1990-04-11," Yes   Well, the employment report on balance didn't change the picture materially It was a mixed report with a lower unemployment rate, rather weak payroll employment, and no increase in hours But the flow of data we've received on spending would edge us up a bit; if we wrote down a number today for real GNP growth in the first quarter, I think it would be more in the neighborhood of 2-1/2 percent "
3926,1990-05-15," To add another two cents worth My own impression from talking to people who are with dealer firms and looking for some insight into what the business community is saying is that the traders and even the economists in many of these firms don't have all that much exposure to anecdotal evidence directly from the business community I have been disappointed regarding the paucity of such information, at least among economists in banks and industrial firms   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   No, we're thinking it's within a small fraction of 6-1/4 percent   Well, on the latter question, I'll offer a little anecdotal information on anecdotes I'll repeat one conversation I had with Bill Dunkelberg, who conducts the survey for the National Federation of Independent Business That survey has shown very mild, if any, changes in the credit picture for that constituency He related to me that he had been contacted by The Wall Street Journal before they published their lead story on the credit crunch and he had told them that If you look at that story, he wasn't quoted The reporter obviously thought it would be better to discuss the negative news than what Dunkelberg's survey suggested That isn't to say the Dunkelberg survey is absolutely reliable But I think one finds that sort of bad news orientation in the press reports One also needs to look carefully at the geographic detail and the sectoral detail that is being addressed Everything we have seen suggests that in the real estate area, particularly the construction side of the market as opposed to permanent financing of residential real estate, there has been a substantial change in the tenor of credit conditions And I don't see any conflict with the anecdotal information in that area As for small businesses, the senior loan officers opinion survey does suggest that there has been some tightening It hasn't been just recently; it has been going on for the last year or so perhaps And it's affecting small and medium size businesses, particularly in [unintelligible] It isn't showing up in rates; it isn't showing up as businesses not having any access to credit, at least not in terms of figures [unintelligible] cut back existing customers; but it's showing up in the standards that are being applied and the collateral that is being used The question is What does that all amount to in the end? In terms of GNP we think that the only significant effects are going to be in the construction area We would have had a marked weakening anyway in that sector, particularly in the commercial area, because of the overbuilding  On the inflation front, I don't want to repeat the entire presentation that we gave a few months ago, but this is basically consistent with that In fact, I'd say this could be regarded as a relatively favorable short-run sort of Phillips curve trade-off We are getting a lot of disinflation for what we perceive to be the gap relative to the natural rate It does presume that history is telling us that we can get there gradually, but the effects are not linear In a sense, you have to get sharp absolute declines in activity in order to get these effects, but we can do it gradually over a period of time I don't think we have historical episodes to go back to and say ""Yes, we had periods where the economy moved slowly, the unemployment rate was perhaps slightly above the full-employment rate, and we got a gradual diminution of the rate of inflation"" But the evidence that exists suggests that we ought to be able to get some progress over time As I hinted here and said in my briefing, we'd like people to perceive that it's headed in that direction and that the Fed is persisting--accepting whatever slack there is, presumably    5/15/90  leading to some rise in the unemployment rate to 6, 6-1/4 percent Frankly, people thought that was looking pretty good coming from where we were Maybe we will get to see some of that developing and the tradeoff will look better   The employment numbers led us to show a weaker second quarter than we might have otherwise We didn't feel comfortable pushing the numbers much further than this I must say that there certainly are arguments--looking at what's going on in the automobile sector--for a larger second-quarter number But this is something we feel comfortable with   Well, this is a complicated question, obviously Part of the issue would be whether this was just a one-shot effort to hit the Gramm-Rudman target for this coming fiscal year or whether it was something that would dramatically change the outlook for the next series of years and greatly change expectations When you open up that latter door you're somewhat at sea in terms of an econometric model One can come up with rather interesting results with that, such as long-term rates going down appreciably in anticipation of less pressure on credit markets throughout the coming years But if that opened the door to a great deal of investment activity and it happened very quickly, we could even in the extreme get a net increase in aggregate demand in the short run; and short rates might even have to rise some in response to that to keep things on a desirable path Falling short of that, if the Federal Reserve is accommodative in terms of trying to hold real GNP close to the path it would otherwise have been on, I think the fiscal shock has to be one that tends to lower interest rates The degree would depend in part on how much forward expectation there was and how much bond yields move as well as short-term rates   Well, in addition to that--   Correct Our suspicion is that if you hold to the current money market conditions, economic activity will gradually pick up You will not see the unemployment rate rise much, if at all, over the coming year or so And since we believe that right now the pressures are such that the tendencies for inflation point up, we would make a new course and head in that direction So, instead of heading south to 4 percent a couple of years from now, we feel the risk is that inflation would be heading north to 5 percent That's a significant difference and I'd hate to make it more precise than that But as we've said, we felt there was noise affecting the reading of the trends [unintelligible] a variety of special factors the surprising strength of the dollar earlier in the year and so on It's always difficult to read these [unintelligible] So, that's the basic thrust of our assessment at this point   That's what we are saying Now, there's a second part to this and that is Will the Federal Reserve obviously let financial conditions go, maintaining the historic growth path of resource utilization numbers where they are? And that's the second projection One is the implication of the resource utilization level; the second is about what financial conditions are compatible with resource utilization levels I guess I'd say I'm a little less sure about the second than I am about the first and there's a good deal of uncertainty on the first   My sense of the consensus of business economists is that the economy probably is going to run with 2, 2-1/2 percent growth going out the next year to 18 months and inflation is going to remain roughly in the 4-1/2, 4-3/4, 5 percent zone   No My sense is that they probably are expecting very little [change in] inflation, maybe some slowdown--   Let me just go back to a factual matter What we have built in here is a rise in the funds rate of about 200 basis points but then we have it coming off [some] in the latter half of next year as pressures begin to abate   Well, a large part of that revision is RTC- related and we don't think that's a real--   Our measure of this shows a shade less restraint in the current fiscal year than it did previously and that's mainly a reflection of our reading of the information on what occurs on the tax side It does look like tax revenues are running a bit weaker than we had anticipated What seems to have come out of tax reform, reading a lot into the 1989 experience, is that revenue falls a bit relative to what we previously had anticipated in our forecast So, we do have a little less restraint but it's a marginal difference, although that's [unintelligible] factor Looking back at the 1988-1989 experience, there are many things that are different; and one has to make very difficult judgments about the timing of various effects At that point we were coming off a dollar depreciation that was causing considerable improvement in our export growth Exports were growing much more strongly than they are now That probably worked against that restraint We didn't have, perhaps, quite the debacle we think we have now on the construction side, though office building has been going down significantly for a while now and it wasn't at that point Perhaps we are closer to demographic requirements in housing construction [unintelligible] some cushion here on interest rate effects The levels are somewhat different I think there are parallels in the two periods, but there are differences; and I have a very hard time drawing a particular lesson Our sense is, as you said, that we did contain the rate of inflation Whether that slowing in the economy and leveling of the unemployment rate that occurred was    5/15/90  attributable to the rise in interest rates or to interest rates and other factors is difficult to say   I wasn't trying to characterize the current money market conditions alternative as one which led to a take off, but merely a gravitation back to the recent trend of potential output--a sort of natural tendency in the economy in any event unless there are countervailing forces But in the short run we think that we could do a little better due to some pickup in inventory accumulation relative to the significant swing we have seen in a negative direction in inventories And without that, the final demands in the economy should show through ultimately to output growth If we didn't get the rise in interest rates, we would have in our forecast a stronger housing sector than we have If we didn't have the restraint, we would expect investment to be stronger So, if we start removing the restraint, the interest sensitive sectors would look a bit stronger across the board and we'd probably add on top of that some leaning toward a moderate, or higher than we have, level of inventory accumulation And if the dollar were to be weaker than we have in there--   Then, I'd begin looking for the fiscal policy--   That's the [unintelligible] shift   Well, as I suggested, the commercial real estate market may be more affected by this We have built into this [forecast] some effect, showing the availability of credit to builders at a reduced level in the residential sector I wouldn't say that it's large; it's not hundreds of thousands of starts in this forecast, but there is some mild effect We think that would abate over time as builders make connections with new lenders and as lenders find ways of participating loans and some other arrangements Over the next year or so we think we probably will see some abatement of these problems   My judgment at this time is that I don't see inventories as an impediment to the growth of production I'm not inclined to read it as a really strong bullish factor, in part for the reason that you suggested I think there's still some effort, particularly in manufacturing but in other sectors too, to decrease inventories in relation to order/shipment ratios And we view this as still having some way to go An industry economist at a meeting I attended recently said ""Boy, these numbers look great; but my boss thinks these inventories are still too high"" So, I think the target, in effect, is continuing to drift downward That was one of the reasons why in the past year when we saw manufacturing inventory/sales ratios essentially just level out we didn't move up [our forecast] very much I thought that was a concern and would likely lead to some effort to restrain inventories And I think as [it turns out] that's the pattern we've seen I think we're in much better shape now; but still, my enthusiasm for thinking we're on the verge of a boom is [unintelligible]   That would suggest the need to stock up in order to have supplies, so that's the argument against the big boom With the firming of materials prices in [unintelligible] sector, the carrying cost might not look quite as formidable as it did months ago, but it's still substantial "
3952,1990-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman We'll be referring to the charts in the package with the bright red lettering, which you should be able to distinguish from the other materials before you [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we don't have a quantification It is woven into the forecast and, as I suggested, is not a big effect If I had to quantify it, I'd say it's a fraction of a percent   It's just very hard to trace this through My guess would be maybe a little more than that Part of the problem is the semantic difficulty of identifying what is the credit crunch If you build in the recognition of all the declining investment opportunities in real estate and so on and call that a part of the credit crunch you have a bigger effect than if you are thinking simply    7/2-3/90 -3-  of the shift in credit terms offered to people of a given level Congress is--   Right Well, I think it's a fraction of a percent Implicitly, given the changes we've made over time as we thought we recognized this, I'd say it's considerably less than a percent   I think the difficulty with that, Mr Chairman, is that those effects seem to have been greatest for relatively small businesses And as best we can assess it, the role of smaller businesses in total investment, for example, is not overwhelming But then there are these secondary effects Looking at corporate bonds, if you took the--   [Unintelligible]   Well, if this forecast were spit out by a model, then yes, I'd have a better basis But, of course, we always are adjusting for various surprises, and to isolate this one would be very difficult But I think one needs to lay on top of those direct interest rate effects whatever allowance one makes for collateral requirements I suggested that perhaps the decline in consumer sentiment might have been affected to some degree by all of the press discussion of shortages of credit and the possibly bad effects on business That might be why consumers are less confident than they were before So I think it gets to be very, very difficult    7/2-3/90   I don't have an answer I'd like to, but it's very hard because there are too many things going on at once We would have to settle on exactly what categories these things would fall in The land price story, if it is significant, is another thing that affects people's thinking on a number of decisions, and that isn't obviously related to the credit crunch So, though I'd like to, I just don't have a good answer   We have to have substantially higher money growth in order to accomplish this Let me see, I must have those numbers here Let me check and give you some idea   I don't have the corresponding money numbers but, clearly, having a little higher nominal GNP level here and substantially lower interest rates implies through the money demand function much more rapid money growth over the period   Well, longer term, perhaps one begins to look at things differently But it's a matter of many years before these fiscal effects presumably would die out We need to make some assumptions about what would happen to fiscal policy beyond this period But in this period, obviously, we have to have that accommodation And in this period, because of the balancing fiscal contraction, aggregate demand isn't growing much more rapidly and we don't have that inflation effect If you maintain consistently higher    7/2-3/90  money growth throughout the future--sort of along the lines of the Bluebook simulations--then you do begin to see these effects mount   Several things were involved One was the fact that in the near term the economy seems to be weaker in an underlying sense than we had anticipated previously A second factor was our decision to make fiscal policy a bit more restrictive in 1991 On top of that, we already had brought our interest rate bulge down; we had thought rates would be going up and spiking in the first part of 1991 and then coming off Those first two things moderated that considerably Then we decided that it would be sensible, as a baseline for the discussion here, not to assume any significant change in rates because it still appears that we would have some mild disinflationary trajectory going into 1992 We felt this kind of scenario was in line with what we perceived to be the general policy objectives of the Committee, consistent with the symmetric directives recently and so on This seemed a sensible baseline for the discussion   I can give you, for example, the CBO's rule of thumb A one percent change in real growth starting at the beginning of a year yields--if you take the lower growth scenario--$7 billion in the first year   It's $7 billion in the first year and $26 billion in the second year Was it real output that was your primary focus?   For 1991, I would take it to be a fairly sizable difference once one builds in the difference in interest rate assumptions For example, their Treasury bill rate in 1991--these are    7/2-3/90  not published numbers yet--is an average of 68 percent So that's a little lower than our forecast entails Looking across the board that's probably worth somewhere between $5 and $10 billion; I don't know the particular phasing If you add on the output path difference, I would think we're running a difference of something in the $10 to $20 billion area in terms of the economic assumptions Inflation differences are very small; the projections aren't very sensitive to inflation differences Clearly, this is small potatoes relative to all the other aspects of [unintelligible] deliberations   Well, our simulation suggests that it's within the powers of monetary policy to offset any [expected] drag It might take aggressive action, if you believe these models, but it's doable I guess that's the most--   Mechanically, the models say you can do this I guess I should say, to follow up on the earlier question about 1991 budget deficits, that I wasn't really building in the differences in the 1990 forecast, which would start things off a little worse and widen that gap   Sure   Well, I tried to say two conceptually separate things One is that to the extent that it lowers activity, that's a one-time effect   That's a one-time effect, and then a growth path can be pursued as determined by subsequent interest rate and income movements as well The other thing is that to the extent that some builders have been displaced--for example, by their friendly S&L having been shut down or the loan-to-one-borrower restrictions having made their S&L less able to provide credit--we think that in time they will find alternative funding if they have viable projects There will be people who want to make those loans On a technical side, we think that institutions will find ways, such as participating loans and so on, to deal with the loan-to-one-borrower limitations So in that sense we think that the level problem will diminish over time   Clearly, that has happened already I heard a news story that something like 10 or 11 states had tax increases going into effect yesterday And in our forecast we expect, among the actions taken to close the budget gaps in a number of states, more tax increases We have in the forecast a significant increase in the average indirect business tax rate of state and local governments That tends to give a little boost to inflation as we go out through 1991 in this forecast   Well, unless we go to extreme cases, there is no timing requirement If you act later, you have to act with greater force    7/2-3/90   Just to give you some sense, though, of the sensitivity of these numbers We did another simulation where instead of waiting until the fourth quarter, as we've assumed in this, we adjusted the federal funds rate by 150 basis points in the third quarter of this year and then let the rate drift up very gradually, pretty much back to the path seen here And that has essentially the same output effect So, it took 50 basis points less if you moved one quarter earlier That gives you some sense that there is considerable [room] to maneuver, if you're willing to move in rather gross ways in your policy adjustments--and if you believe the model  SPEAKER(?) That's one big ""if""   Well, that was before my time However, when I arrived at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank in 1970 it was legend There were a lot of economists in the System who were still feeling that that was one of the biggest mistakes they had ever made They had neglected to take a sort of permanent income view of a one-time tax surcharge I think it was expected to have significant effects on expenditures and in retrospect it didn't seem to have that Now, in this case, the presumption would be that we're talking about something more permanent and one wouldn't have that kind of surprise But I think that was the analysis There may be people around the table who have a direct recollection of what went on within the System   Right   Yes   We recognize that this [presentation] makes it all look more pat than it is I hope I threw in enough cautionary words on that part But as I said, I think it gives one some sense of the orders of magnitude that conceivably could be involved   Yes, in a rough way The fact is that after that period the personal saving rate did rise There was not a recession, as some people expected, because there were some strong interest- income generating sectors--stronger than most people had realized at the time The net export increase was sizable; the investment gains were sizable That seemed to generate the income And even if consumers wanted to spend less of it, they still increased their expenditures, and thus we glided through that period But the index of the wealth effect would be the personal saving rate So there's nothing in the data superficially, given everything else that was going on, to suggest that there wasn't the predicted effect   Well, I don't know If I knew what the fiscal policy change was, we'd be able to [unintelligible] I'm not sure the error would be any larger, but given that I don't know the [fiscal policy change] or the underlying strength of the economy, I'd say there is a very wide range of possibilities   Mr Chairman, if I can follow-up In thinking back to where we were when putting together the flow-of-funds projection at the beginning of the year, our focus was very much on our view that the thrift industry was going to contract and that that would result in some disruption of the mortgage market We were very much concerned about who would pick up the mortgages We anticipated that banks would pick up many of the liabilities the thrifts were giving up I think we were sort of right in our analysis of the mortgage market effects of the thrift institution change, but we didn't anticipate the weakening in bank credit And at that time we didn't anticipate all of the hits on bank capital that would arise as real estate loans were recognized to be less valuable and as these other events occurred, especially in New England, that affected bank capital and the growth of bank assets That was another surprise So we've had some significant surprises relative to what we were thinking on the supply side of the credit market and at depository institutions in particular   But the economy is roughly on the track that we charted at the beginning of the year The central tendency of the forecasts at this point looks very similar to what we had, except that the inflation rate is a little higher Debt is on target, around the middle of its range, and I think that's what we indicated In a sense it's this depository element, which is so important for the monetary aggregates, that has been disturbed   Right, so I think there's a rationale--   Also, the Committee should have to decide what it is trying to communicate [via] the monetary aggregates Are they closer to ultimate objectives for your purpose in policymaking or are they just instruments? In a sense it's as if you were shooting at the moon; you set your direction initially and then found you were off target It seems to me completely reasonable to say you adjusted your instruments rather than shoot past the moon and then explain later why you missed That may be an exaggeration of the differences here in the way one can view it, but I think you have to decide just how important the monetary aggregates are per se as a representation of your policy   Do you want to put ""though still to an uncertain extent?""   You could make it ""unexpectedly strong"" if you want to reinforce your earlier thought   We use the administrative message system, if it's convenient "
3975,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I was away the last three weeks and missed much of the excitement For that reason I've asked Dave Stockton, who was here for it all to reach the exciting conclusion, to present the domestic side of the outlook   We will be taking another cut at this when we get the revisions on the employment data next month We may have something additional to report then   We don't want to offer you the great hope that that's going to eliminate all of the peculiarities in these numbers This series just seems to move in ways that are inexplicable at times And we think the ECI data are a more reliable guide than--   We also have to keep in mind the possibility that some of those phenomena that might be affecting labor force participation suggest that the unemployment rate may not capture all of the elements that are affecting wage behavior If labor force participation is falling off because people don't feel the job opportunities are there, that's a somewhat different kind of slack in the system that could moderate wage increases So, it's a very complex system But I would underscore the point that there doesn't seem to be evidence contradicting the basic view that slack will diminish inflationary pressures Indeed, there are few other channels available to us that would seem really to affect the inflation rate   That's true because we haven't had extended periods of slow growth So the question is Is it the slack or is it the sudden shock of a decline that one sees in a recession that really explains that?   We noted that fact last fall when we had a presentation on inflation--that there was uncertainty about whether there was some sort of nonlinearity in the system   Let me try to put this in the perspective of our forecast For fiscal 1991 we have a $35 billion deficit reduction That's smaller than the $50 billion they still are talking about but perhaps some of the people who are concerned by recent developments would think that maybe even $35 billion is in question at this point As Dave indicated, just before the last meeting all the talk was leading us to think that maybe $35 billion was too pessimistic At this point, it looks like a healthy adjustment given the political situation But if you take some of that out, we could begin to move closer to a $250 billion deficit, including $70 billion of RTC-related [expenditures] in fiscal 1991 If you overlay on that a weaker economic picture--say, with no growth or a mild recession over the next year--then it could easily move toward the $300 billion level So this discussion of a $250-$300 billion deficit is not inconsistent with the kind of picture that we've depicted in the Greenbook   Well, I think you're correct There isn't much in here We have really a trivial increment to defense spending in this forecast over the next few quarters, partly consistent with the oil price assumption that things are presumably--   I think there is also some effect on suntan lotion prices--the sunblock effect! At this point, it seems largely to be a matter of taking some things out of inventory, shifting expenditures, and so on If this results in major deviations from what we had anticipated in overall personnel and additional munitions and [supplies], if we maintain a significant presence in the Middle East over the coming quarters, then we might begin to talk about at least several billions of dollars One could read into comments made by the President yesterday that some of the defense reduction that people had been looking for might not be achieved That then perhaps would begin to chip away at our fundamental fiscal assumptions So, there is clearly upside potential here on the fiscal front for some lesser restraint than we have embedded in this forecast I think that's a clear risk   That's true   There has been a consistent drop-off from the last 10 days [of a month] to the first 10 days in these seasonally adjusted figures   I think on ours as well I just don't think we've found a way of capturing the pattern, particularly in the transplant sales They have this tendency to be very strong in the final--   Well, it's not entirely clear We have looked at the historical evidence on these oil prices, and whether people don't buy cars or whether they shift the kind of cars they buy is not as clear as one would think   Well, it depends on your--   In a sense, the only thing that would change is inflation expectations and that would drive down perceived real interest rates That would affect demand for goods and services in a  -11-    8/21/90  stimulative way, conceivably It's a very complex process and it's going to depend on your response to those--   I think the third alternative illustrates this to a degree by showing the higher level of inflation that we would have   A forecast of recession or the experience of two quarters of less than 1 percent growth   Either OMB or CBO, I believe, can make that forecast   It allows for a suspension   I'm not sure that it's automatic, but it does provide for the Congress to temporarily suspend [the Gramm-Rudman cuts] They have to make that decision   Put it in the file cabinet? [Laughter]   There always are innumerable uncertainties I think we've just layered over the normal ones There are some very, very big imponderables at this point I might just say--and this might seem silly normally, but just to close the loop entirely on this Gramm-Rudman issue--if there were a declaration of war, that would suspend the Gramm-Rudman [provisions]   That's why I raised the point It's not inconceivable   I think the sense in which this nominal GNP concept is attractive is as sort of an automatic stabilizer   But you don't necessarily have to constrain yourself to that automatic response So, there's nothing magical about this If you were concerned about any acceleration in inflation in the short run, you might want to have a lower nominal GNP path or even--   So it doesn't do the work for you here in terms of the policy decision "
3995,1990-09-07, Up and down! 
4016,1990-09-17," Mr Chairman, we've begun to get some information on developments since the Iraqi evasion of Kuwait but the data really do not provide a decisive reading on even the current quarter let alone where we are headed in the remainder of the year and into early 1991 Read literally, the employment report, retail sales data, and other economic figures that have come in would appear to us to be on track with our expectation for the third quarter At this point, based on the data, we have no reason to make a significant revision Looking toward the fourth quarter, given the flow of data, there probably would be little reason to make any significant change Our forecast had been for 1/2 percent GNP growth; in essence, we were saying there was little more than a 50/50 bet that we would be in positive territory I would have to say that the anecdotal evidence coming in through the reports from banks and everything else we hear has been quite negative My reading would be that it might even be somewhat more negative than we thought would be coming in, given the kind of economic environment we had forecast So, I'd have to say that if we were to write down a Greenbook forecast today, we'd probably be more in the vicinity of zero Whether we'll be in plus or minus territory in the fourth quarter I think, at this point, is really too close to call But, as Peter suggested, many private analysts may be thinking it's not evident that a significant cumulative collapse is in process at this point Indeed, one factor-- which I would defer to Ted Truman to discuss further--as we look out over the next few quarters, is the decline in the dollar While it may have some additional adverse price level consequences, it certainly seems to indicate that there's a greater likelihood that the trade sector will be a source of some buoyancy in the economy I might just turn to Ted to see whether he has anything he'd like to add   Well, I think the direction should be reasonably predictable that if we take a more expansive approach by pushing rates lower at this point than they otherwise would have been, we would have somewhat higher nominal GNP growth next year Our reading of history suggests that in the short run that probably is going to have more effect on the real side than on the price side But I should underscore that a movement of a fraction of a percentage point isn't likely to have a dramatic effect in any event in 1991 "
4040,1990-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   That is part of the first-quarter effect Of course, with the timing of the gasoline tax that has been proposed, that means we'll get something before the end of the year   I'm pleased that you said we had to make that assumption because, obviously, there was some degree of arbitrariness to that, and we hope that this is a plausible baseline We feel somewhat optimistic--but [unintelligible] I think to highlight the kind of policy issues you confront Basically, that rebound does follow fairly naturally from the improvement in real disposable income that would result from this kind of decline in oil prices History suggests that oil price shocks of the sort we have had do tend to disturb consumers, and [thus] we see very sharp drops in confidence The previous large drops were in somewhat similar circumstances Unless the economy really follows through with a significantly negative performance, one might expect confidence to improve somewhat We certainly see downside risks here because of the credit situation, but we think we've built in some allowance for that in an informal way But should quality spreads widen dramatically, should lenders really pull in their horns more sharply than we sense they are, that would certainly be a drag on business spending We've assumed that inventories will be kept in very tight check over the coming months; that's one of the reasons for the weakness in production in the forecast We don't have a buildup [in inventories]; they keep production lines running So, that positions us for a nice rebound in production as soon as that underlying demand picks up But as we enter into a period of such weakness, there are a number of variables that could turn more negative than we have [projected] It's possible too that we will skate through this without any cumulative decline   Well, I guess one would have to reach pretty far back to find any example This is a supply shock The supply shocks  -10-    10/2/90  that come to mind occurred in 1973, which was a period when other things also tended to exacerbate recessionary pressures, and again in the 1979-80 period when we had a recession with an oil price shock But the magnitudes differ and the general circumstances differ I think one couldn't simply appeal to historical precedent to justify this forecast   Well, as I suggested, we've assumed that businesses do move their inventories very consistently with sales in this period ahead Our sense is that in recent years, given the kind of inventory management practices that have evolved, the pattern really does support that kind of assumption about their behavior One can already see an awareness on the part of businessmen that there may be weak sales in the months ahead We have anecdotal reports of retailers ordering very cautiously for the fall Basically, we are looking for the production adjustment to happen very rapidly and that's when our recession is occurring   On the latter point, we really haven't done anything exotic in the assumptions about potential GNP You're quite right that the shift in the relative price of energy could affect the productivity of the capital stock; it could have an effect on the level of potential GNP If oil prices stayed very high, one would have to be concerned about some effect I can't state the magnitude; perhaps Dave has something to contribute on that point Basically, though--assuming there isn't a major contraction of supply that is permanent, so to speak, going out through 1992--I think our forecast follows quite naturally from the assumption we made about oil prices, the projection we made for the dollar, and our anticipated increase in slack in the economy We have a 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate We think that is high enough and the slowness of growth per period great enough that we should see some downward pressure on real wages We    10/2/90  anticipate that import prices will be rising fairly rapidly in the near term, but as a result of our dollar path [the rise] will be decelerating and thus that will be a helpful factor in the deceleration [of overall inflation] by 1992 And we have a favorable trend relative to overall inflation and energy prices as we go out through 1992 So, the cumulation of these things puts [inflation] back into the low 4 percent area during 1992   Dave   This is a complex question--one we really want to look at in the weeks ahead As we noted in the Greenbook, one still has to be very tentative about one's assumptions on potential GNP And we've yet to address that in that broader production framework   Well, that's just one more of the uncertainties And, of course, if and when there are revisions of the data, that will alter the sectoral distribution of value added as the result of the repricing of computers and so on And that could alter one's impressions of what has been going on in productivity performance   I suspect so But that doesn't mean that we're expecting things to return to the kind of situation we had three or four years ago I must say that on the mortgage side, as opposed to the construction side, we still don't see signs of any great addition to effective demand in that market But I think the construction credit side will continue to be a touchy situation for a while longer As you know, we have assumed that there would be some gradual improvement in access to credit by builders who have decent projects to propose But the key here is that we're looking primarily to the weakness in real income over the next couple of quarters to be the major drag on housing demand And as that situation improves, we expect some people to come back into the market and provide some lift to housing demand The level to which we go back is still a relatively low level of overall housing activity; it certainly does not go beyond what one might think the longer-run demographics would suggest should be the basic level of housing demand So, we don't think we have a very aggressive forecast here as we look out to 1991   Well, the figures that we've built into our thinking would involve about 400,000 units a year to replace dilapidated or demolished units and meet the second-home demand If you add that to the demographic trend, we estimate that the basic housing start level ought to be somewhere at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 million units--maybe toward the lower end, if you want to be conservative   Well, we are sort of building into this forecast the notion that we're going to absorb some excess supply at this point That's one moderating influence in the growth of starts over the next couple of years  SPEAKER(?) That's just residential, right?   That's right   I think we've been pointing for some time to the altered psychology of this market The investment motive for buying a home in many areas of the country is not very strong at this point There are still areas where prices are reasonably firm On the whole, though, the picture is certainly one of a flattening out of prices for both new and existing homes It looks much like the kind of rate of increase or stability that we saw in the last recession But interest rates are anticipated to be a bit lower They're at the low end of the range we've seen in the past decade or more And there is some basic underlying demand Now, houses might get smaller We've seen a lot of moving-up-the-scale by homebuilders in recent years and perhaps if there's some moderation in demand for shelter, it will take the form in part of less extravagant houses But at some point we're going to have this pressure to house this population While we may have doubling up and so on for a while, I think there is some underlying support here  -14-    10/2/90   It could go even lower than that It's a small sector It has some side effects but it would take a very deep plunge relative to our forecast to have a major effect in altering the outlook   Well, you're moving into another sphere I guess you could say that might--   That might [hint] at some offset in terms of fiscal policy   That's a slight variation of what I tried to say   We can't see it yet   Well, as I noted, there were several [factors] One of the biggest single considerations was the significantly higher level of oil prices that we have in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year, which is going to squeeze the real purchasing power of households by a significant degree   That would account for at least the majority of it; I wouldn't say it would account for all of it in a [strict] mechanical translation We thought there were other factors in the environment too The general inflation trend looks a bit worse and the excise tax hit also implies somewhat greater inflation in the near term and still further erosion of real income We also looked at the credit market developments and at least intuitively judged that there is more restraint being imposed there than we might have anticipated in our previous forecast We try to take into account the anecdotal information I mentioned that as something that certainly has looked negative and I think it would be silly for us to ignore that totally   Hard evidence? Well, obviously, the trends are visible The lending practices surveys that we pick up aren't that up-to-the-minute, but the recent survey showed a slight widening of quality spreads in the bond market Very clearly something that has impressed us is the turmoil in the banking sector That is something we can't yet document in terms of its effect on their lending, but it seems to us to suggest some significant further constraint on them   We have had some reasonable increases in industrial production thus far this year Indeed, there is something of a tension between the industrial production numbers and the GNP numbers over the course of this year The relative movement is pushing the limits of what one might have expected But the natural consequence of that is that we don't have capacity utilization coming down a great deal I don't have an answer for this These are somewhat independent data sets and they sometimes do diverge They are also both subject to revision And where the truth lies, I can't say with any certainty   Well, in a sense this is a mechanical calculation All the variation in capacity utilization essentially comes from the variation in industrial production We don't measure capacity month-by-month I guess one might say that there hasn't been anything very obviously strange about the relationship of capacity utilization to price behavior this year Materials prices have not been collapsing; the PPI for finished goods has not been collapsing This doesn't suggest that capacity utilization really has been falling dramatically So, I don't see any indication that we've been led astray by these numbers  -16-    10/2/90   I could use a couple more inches!   Well, the point we tried to make is that if potential GNP is growing more slowly, one has to lower one's sights on what kind of GNP growth we can have and achieve a given degree of slack That, I think, is the cutting edge on this issue   Governor Angell, I might just note that the relatively low deflator we have gotten for the fourth quarter--  -17-    10/2/90   --is something of an artifact of our assumption about oil prices, the oil import pattern, and how fast those prices of imported oil flow through to finished products, and so on The fact that we had a big bulge in the oil price gives us this temporary dip, which is then reversed in the first quarter That isn't to say we don't have a pattern of slower nominal GNP growth over this quarter and the next; but it is still a relatively low number "
4065,1990-11-13," You recall they also have regulated the maturities, in essence for the same purpose   So, they played a very active role in this field   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll try to sustain the level of interest here! [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the major mechanism is the drop in oil prices that we have assumed On top of that we get some impetus over time coming from the recent decline in the dollar showing up in the stronger export growth and the retardation of import expansion So, that's the major impetus to defining final demand as we look out into the latter half of 1991 As to the risks Obviously, they're manyfold and very substantial If I had to characterize them for the very near term, I'd put a small interval around the minus 2 percent and say that is what we think is the most likely result My judgment would be that the tail [of the probability distribution] is probably a bit longer and a bit thicker going to the down side but that we have a significant [mass] of the probability around this moderate drop--I don't know if a drop is ever moderate--of 2 percent or something close to the magnitude that we have in the fourth quarter   Well, we're sort of captives of our key assumptions And oil, given the movement we have forecast, is a quite powerful influence So the broad contours here seem right to me in light of that assumption Now, as to how one might want to alter that in light of one's geo-political-military assessments, obviously, there's a tremendous range of possibilities I think there is a lot of sense to assuming that at some point over the next 6 to 9 months we will have a significantly lower oil price either after military conflict or in the absence of military conflict But the timing of that and what might happen in between is hard to say So, that obviously complicates things As to the credit picture, as we've said all along, this is just very hard to translate into GNP points We  -15-    11/13/90  are not able to point to very clear-cut real impacts at this juncture that we can say are obviously attributable to the credit situation For example, in nonresidential construction, which is where everyone thought the most direct hit would be, it isn't really obvious there yet We can see the contracts and permits data suggesting some weakening, but there seems to be a pretty long pipeline and there isn't a sign of an enormous drop right now We're predicting that we will see some significant weakness in construction put-in-place in the next two months' reports But this is hard to predict   Well, I think the evidence is mixed in this area Last week at a meeting of business economists, a steel company economist indicated specifically that the steel fabrication for structures seemed to be holding up quite well up through the first part of next year   This is just what they had booked through the first quarter of next year Now, there's always a vulnerability to some shift in this; and one company's perspective may be different from another's We're expecting a significant change in the tenor of these things Also, based on anecdotal information that has come in, there are some areas such as steel and chemicals where perhaps there has been a bit of inventory building, and we could see production fall off very noticeably in the coming months Certainly, we have a distinct change in the tenor of things happening right now in this forecast And it's a judgment call; it's not something that we can substantiate by pointing to clear leading indicators in the data, particularly with regard to the timing and magnitude   Well, both of them look weak over the last two months and that's the key inference that we're drawing--that there is weakness in labor demand There have been these divergences over time, which have not been fully explained But both series for employment show weakness recently, and that's one of the reasons we're putting considerable weight on that information   The personal saving rate has come down and has done so in circumstances where real disposable income has been significantly eroded by the energy price increases Basically, in the very short run, if these data hold up, what we've observed is that people have not adjusted their spending patterns very rapidly in the face of this decline in their incomes We're expecting that this adjustment will occur and that we'll see some movement back up in the saving rate, particularly because of the general financial environment All that we know about consumer sentiment suggests that people are not necessarily going to want to diminish their financial wealth They've already experienced rather weak real estate values and the stock market hasn't gone up, so their wealth positions just have not been improving recently   I think that's a fair characterization   77 percent! [Laughter]   All right, 65 percent [Laughter] I'm not going to be enormously more confident when I've seen the first set of retail sales data knowing how much they are vulnerable to revision subsequently But it would certainly help to make the pieces fall into place in this puzzle that we tried to put together here We have had, basically, a very large drop in hours [worked] Historically that has proven to be one of the most reliable indicators at our disposal of short-term movements in output We had discounted that because the drop in the average work week, especially outside of manufacturing, was just huge and seems incredible But even with that discounting, we're off to a very bad start Initial claims don't suggest that the labor markets are firming; we're looking for further declines in employment and a noticeable drop in hours overall for the quarter   [Unintelligible] are still set with a wide confidence interval No one could state this with normal certainty We do know one other thing and that is that motor vehicle production is going to be down appreciably in this quarter and that alone by our arithmetic--when you put the cars and the trucks together--probably cuts better than a percentage point off of GNP growth in this quarter   That's helpful in adding these things up We know that, unless something bizarre happens with wages in this quarter, real labor income is going to be very weak because of the oil price increase So then it becomes a matter of how aggressive people are going to be about spending what they have And the Christmas spirit--my predecessor was always inclined to bring that up at this time of the year--may move people to spend very freely But we have to try to make our judgment based on all of the information at our disposal And we don't hear anything that suggests that kind of pattern emerging at this point So, we think it's a negative quarter Basically by going [from a forecast of minus 1 percent], which was just slightly different from 0 in our perspective, to [minus] two percent we're signaling that we think it's going to be a negative quarter and we feel fairly confident about that   Well, if they are wrong and demand holds up reasonably well, we're going to see a drag on inventories here that's going to give us the possibility of some bounceback in the early part of next year   That's true There's some income that is lost in this process   Well, some of it is just the straight price effects on real purchasing power But I wouldn't set aside the question of confidence It isn't just an oil price shock; it's a whole discussion of war and peace and one's sense of the stability of the world after a very good move that developed because of [unintelligible] in eastern Europe So, I think with that, plus the debacle of the budget in Washington, there have just been a number of things which seem to have led to an enormous shift in the sentiment of American households With the passage of time maybe the budget issue will be forgotten and something will happen with respect to the military situation I guess it's implicit in this that the risks don't look worse several months down the road   My sense is that the polls suggested some loss of confidence in our economic policy makers at that point  SPEAKER(?) It's hard to believe!   I've tried to puzzle through this The people on Wall Street keep saying that the economy has hit a wall They think that we're going into a serious recession and that we need dramatic monetary policy action to cushion the economy Yet they have not bid the bond prices up further than they have I suspect part of that, and I've heard it said, is that people don't want to buy bonds in front of a war So I think there is a risk premium embedded in there and it is reflecting this   What happens in a war? You mean economically?   Well, I don't think we would presume to have enormous insight There's a considerable range of things that could happen Clearly, if there were significant damage to the production facilities and the transport facilities and so on, we could have a period of time in which supplies were significantly disrupted On the other hand, perhaps in that circumstance we would get the drawdown in reserves and that could be a cushion for a period There could be military spending consequences if a war went on and utilized a large amount of munitions that it was felt had to be replaced within our lifetime It's conceivable that some things just would not be  -19-    11/13/90  replaced immediately, but the sign there I think is positive--ie, that there would be more military spending   I think you're right Under the contract there are these unemployment benefits You probably have it nailed down better than I do   Look through the corporate [unintelligible], if you want to get fancy You would figure that's coming out of Big Three profits, all other things equal, and that certainly affects the shareholders ultimately   I might note that in terms of our forecast, nominal consumer expenditures will grow in excess of 6 percent in the fourth quarter, which would affect transactions demands for money "
4082,1990-12-07," Well, Mr Chairman, the Committee members undoubtedly have the major figures, and you have covered the crux of the picture We were surprised by the dimensions of the decline in private employment in November--270,000 There was a noticeable downward revision in the figures for September and October as well The workweek, which we had noted last time had dropped more than we could possibly understand, did rebound, but only partially So overall the hours of production workers for the current quarter are likely to be down very sharply   In the fourth quarter [hours worked] are likely to be down very sharply, on the order of perhaps 5 percent at an annual rate That combined with the other information we have on the labor market--the unemployment rate and so on--suggests to us that the decline in GNP this quarter is likely to be at least as large as the 2 percent that we had in the last Greenbook We're trying to sort through the data and come up with a reasonable estimate as we work toward next Wednesday's Greenbook publication My guess is that it will be closer to [a decline of] 3 percent when we're done with this Industrial production, as the Chairman noted, appears to be down very sharply in November It's a larger decline than the 3/4 of a percent that we saw in October, based on both the physical product indicators that we have and the hours in manufacturing for last month So, those are the major inferences we have from the labor market   Right It was the second straight month of essentially no change, and over the last three months they were up at a modest rate--something between 1 and 2 percent annualized So in retrospect, looking at the employment cost indexes for the third quarter, it appears that we have seen some moderation in wage inflation recently as the labor market has weakened We're continuing to have this puzzle about labor force participation It continues to be weaker than we would expect, even with the decline in labor demand, and of course, that raises some analytical problems Basically, the overall picture is one that we're not surprised by, ie, declines in employment in manufacturing, construction, and retail trade But the declines were sharper [than we expected] and we're trying to assess why and what the carry-through is going to be into the future months   Well, President Syron, that is very speculative, obviously There are two facets of this, one of which is even more difficult to assess than the other One is the implication for oil prices To the extent that the war premium comes out of oil prices, we would see a significant drop there and very quick translations--if we see the reversal of the earlier runup--through gasoline prices into overall consumer purchasing power And we would expect that to have a fairly prompt influence on consumer spending On the other hand, there is the war scare and what influence that has had on sentiment and what influence that in turn has had on actual spending, about which we know very little really We have very shaky data on spending for October and only anecdotal evidence--apart from the chain store sales, which haven't proved very reliable in the past as a guide to overall spending--for November, My sense is that to understand why retail activity seems to have weakened as much as it has, one has to put some weight on the argument that sentiment has been adversely affected by the concerns about possible hostilities And if people get to feeling a whole lot better about that, particularly around the Christmas season, perhaps one might see some catch-up on consumer spending There are great uncertainties here, but my feeling is that if these things were to move in a positive direction, there could be some fairly prompt firming on the consumer side But, as I said, that's very speculative "
4103,1990-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   We have not had time to sort through these data in detail and to try to match them up against the various expenditure categories, but I think one needs to emphasize that GNP measures domestic production   Indeed, as of last Wednesday when we went to press with the Greenbook, we didn't even have retail sales data, etc We were depending to a considerable extent on the labor market data to get some sense of what the input was to domestic production and then we were trying to make some reasonable guesses, in effect, about productivity and so forth But I think one should not leap to the conclusion that dollar-for-dollar any surprise in net exports would track through to GNP We may find stronger expenditures on capital goods, for example, to match some imports or some other adjustment There may be more luxury cars being imported, which will be part of our bulge in consumption in the fourth quarter If that were the case, rather than coming out of inventories, that might have implications for the first quarter So, I think it's a very complex process that one needs to go through with these data   [Unintelligible] "
4125,1991-02-01," I have been sitting here trying to sift through some of these [numbers]   I can try to give you that answer in just [a moment]   Yes, but I think that was only about 10,000 Let me see whether government was revised There was a significant downward revision in government employment, I believe   Mr Chairman, could I just correct an impression I may have left earlier in answer to Governor Seger's question? There were downward revisions in the changes from November to December in just about every category; it's very widespread "
4147,1991-02-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman We'll be utilizing the chart package that everyone should have If you haven't found it, you may have another  MESSRS PRELL, PROMISEL, and SLIFMAN [Statements--see Appendix]   Well, I think the credit crunch was already at work prior to the downturn As you know, we've discussed that over the course of the past year and we would characterize this in some nonquantitative way as a significant but not huge effect If one could somehow embody this in GNP growth terms, it probably would be less than a percentage point--maybe much less than that   By our reckoning, the oil price shock--just the direct normal type of oil price change that we run through econometric models--would have had a larger effect as of the end of last year We think during this recent period that [other factors had] a much larger effect than oil prices Certainly at this point we ought to be seeing a turnaround in terms of the oil price effect and we'll be seeing what other things are in train The even greater unknown in all of this is [what] psychological damage was done by the oil price change, which probably summoned up in people's minds recollections of a couple of earlier major shocks that were followed by recessions I suspect that it created in many people's minds the specter of rising unemployment and so on There also was the war aspect of the situation, which may not have been a very positive factor in people's thinking, though I must say historically--for example, in the Viet Nam war--it's not entirely clear that people become grossly negative in their expectations and their sentiment as there is an increase in military activity But my sense is that that has not been a big plus for sentiment And we had last fall this debacle over the budget If we all think back to that period, we'll remember what an appalling spectacle that was; and it probably had at least in the short run a rather devastating effect on people's assessment of whether the government here in Washington really had a handle on economic affairs I haven't seen any concrete evidence that this financial fragility and the failures of banks and so on stand out as factors in people's thinking; but I think it has to be a negative, too, for consumer sentiment On top of all this, we've had fiscal restraint of a modest degree in train for a while These things cumulate to a very considerable damping effect at least on economic growth And with the oil price change and the war I think it put us into negative territory That's my crude [analysis]   It's something under 1/4 percent [on] real GNP But, as Larry pointed out, that was on the assumption that you stick to a previously assumed monetary expansion path If you wanted to offset that, you would raise money stock growth and let interest rates fall and you would have some offsets through exchange rates and effects on the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy So, it would not be such a large shock and not at all difficult to offset through a moderate policy adjustment if you saw it coming   Thank you We haven't really thought about publication but we'll have to give it some thought   Are you referring to the second quarter?   Well, in the second quarter there's actually a little uptick in federal spending, but it's only 2-1/2 percent But your point on state and local [spending] is well taken In fact, we've lowered our projection of state and local real purchases in this forecast and we only have a 1/2 percent increase this year, which assumes probably some decline in construction spending--an area that really had been surprisingly strong through last year We've been surprised on the up side fairly frequently over the past year or so that this apparent fiscal problem has not shown through on spending Obviously, on some of it there's a lag They sold bonds earlier and are going to go ahead with some of these infrastructure investments But we expect that there will be some crunch there; obviously, a number of you are familiar with rather dire situations in your locales   That's promising; that's my kind of question!   I'd be happy to send you a descriptive memo, but it's a measure we developed that unlike the high [employment] budget  -18-    2/5-6/91  surplus--which you know is a measure of discretionary fiscal policy-- basically rates various components of the budget according to their impact on aggregate demand as revealed by econometric relations It strips out some of the trend elements and gets rid of some of the one- time sorts of financial effects that at times distort the high employment budget For example, in the high employment budget currently those contributions from foreign countries would show up in the normal calculation as additional revenues and greater fiscal restraint And it's somewhat counter to [logic] to think that if somebody else pays for it instead of having to pay for it ourselves that that's additional restraint on aggregate demand So, this measure doesn't include that sort of thing And we think it's probably a better way of capturing things We've run this in terms of horse races against other measures of fiscal policy in determining GNP and this seems to work better   I hesitate at times to use this because I know it's a more obscure measure, but I thought that under the circumstances--   Clearly, there was a package of cuts in expenditures and hikes in revenues enacted last year and that's the basic process that's going on here   A different way to look at it is that there's an aggregate supply function out there and an aggregate demand function If monetary policy keeps pushing the growth of aggregate demand out there faster than aggregate supply will support, we're going to end up with accelerating inflation And that's the message that this is intended to convey There will be a lot of dynamics over a period of time if we are right and you kept pressing against that But that's, I think, the interpretation of this data Obviously, there are significant uncertainties, and I think we underscored this in the report Larry's reason for presenting the band on it was to suggest  -19-    2/5-6/91  that on a statistical basis 26 percent is almost as good an estimate as 23 percent Where the issue arises is if you take the more optimistic view, say, of the Administration and you're talking about 3 percent plus [real growth] That begins to press pretty hard against our confidence intervals here; that's stretching it But there are lots of assumptions made about the future in this and this is just our best guesstimate--as careful an analysis as we could do   I don't think credibility would be--   And the same point is made simply in our Greenbook forecast in essence that over the next seven quarters after this one the economy is growing at a rate clearly above our estimate But it's an environment of decelerating prices because we're above the natural rate   In the am!   Mr Chairman, if I might just inject a point that perhaps we should have made in talking about that last simulation According to our model, the additional M2 in 1991 would be about 2-1/2 percent So, to give you some--   Yes, incremental M2 growth in 1991   [Damning with] faint praise!   Can I get you to 60?   Monday is fine "
4173,1991-03-26," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, by the end of the year "
4229,1991-05-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I've made the argument for a long time now as I've looked at the trend of inventory-sales ratios in retailing I've looked at the enormous growth in floor space in retailing and the many shopping malls that have opened up We have developed an awful    5/14/91  lot of stores Each one of them has some inventory They have clearly moved beyond the point of adequate returns and we're seeing an industry shakeout And in the course of that shakeout we probably will have some consolidation over time and some movement down in inventory-sales ratios That's a very macro sort of view of the process But clearly retailers have moved to try to capitalize on computerization and some of these other [techniques] such as ""just-in- time"" deliveries They should be doing better on inventories than they seem to have done, and maybe this is part of the story   We still don't hear a lot of complaints that inventories are uncomfortably heavy On the other hand, the profits aren't there Something is out of kilter I think this excess capacity in the industry is reflecting part of the excess stock of consumer goods on the shelves   Well, I think you put your finger on the problem in saying anything with any great conviction at this point We don't have much data We've looked at orders to try to see beyond the data for recent months that we have on industrial production We don't know a great deal about the flow coming in from abroad or going out from current production; that's an unknown We basically reached this conclusion as one that was consistent with what we thought plausible as a final demand picture and what we sensed was going on in terms of production Also, I think there is certainly in some sectors a desire to achieve lower inventory levels And, as I've noted, this is the third successive quarter of substantial inventory liquidation For a recession that we entered with supposedly pretty lean positions, we're ending up in total absolute dimensions with an inventory liquidation that's pretty much in the ballpark of previous cycles--not relative to GNP but simply in '82 dollar terms So, maybe there is some upside risk, but I don't think there's a great desire to accumulate inventories at this time   I don't think this is greatly atypical   And we may not be getting, overall, the kind of cushion we did in some cycles in terms of the government sector But I don't think there's a gross disparity here We were disappointed, as I noted, in the first quarter; much of the surprise was in data revisions Some of it seems quite plausible to us Previously, the interest income figure seemed to be holding up more than appeared reasonable in light of what was happening to interest rates So now we've had a significant reduction in interest income in the figures for the early part of this year It's reasonably sensible   Well, of course, they use the very best data that are available our flow-of-funds accounts!   Let me correct something We did have some numbers and I blanked out on this We're getting more DPI decline in this recession than on average in prior recessions That's what I had in the back of my mind, but then I was thinking no other data I had seen looked different from that   Yes, especially since this is a lesser GNP decline "
4239,1991-06-10," Well, Mr Chairman, I think everyone is aware that generally the recent economic data have been on the firmer side Relative to our expectations, it seems as if almost every number has been about where we expected it or perhaps just a little stronger Our basic reading of this is that it is all consistent with our expectation that we would see the turning point in the current quarter It gives us a little more confidence that we are indeed headed toward the kind of recovery that we predicted in the last Greenbook But I must say that the signs at this point are very tentative and I don't think that we would change our forecast materially for the remainder of the year If we were to write down a number for growth of real GNP in the current quarter, I suspect that rather than it being the marginal minus of the May meeting's Greenbook, it would be a slight plus That summarizes our view "
4266,1991-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman We've distributed a packet of charts with red lettering on it entitled ""Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee"" Statement--see Appendix   Well, we've been attempting to monitor this We raised the flag long ago that there was an emerging sizable imbalance And we have built into our forecast, certainly since the beginning of this year, a picture quite similar to what we have now of historically quite weak state and local real purchases   That's right, and we've built that in too And we've been noting for some time that a small but not totally insignificant ingredient in our expectations for consumer prices would be repeated increments to indirect business taxes That plays a role, and, of course, even the property tax increases tend indirectly to show up in the consumer price index through the rents and owner equivalent rent figures So, we think those are built into our disposable income projection But this is a sector that is very hard to monitor The data sources are poor; the numbers upon which all these estimates are based are benchmarked to shaky data after long lags We could be blind sided But as a Wall Street Journal article, I think of yesterday, suggested, there's a very powerful momentum here as one looks back at history There are very strong demands for services; there are various imperatives The prisons have to be staffed; there is a backlog of infrastructure investment that has to be attended to So, though I think the risks here are reasonably balanced, there is an upside potential beyond our forecast as well as the possibility of some shortfall   We have on occasion studied that Certainly, I've warned for some time now that most forecasters tend to underestimate the amplitude of expansions; maybe the same is true of recessions But I've been conscious of the fact that by presenting these highlights of the forecast the way I have that I have focused somewhat on the negatives because I'm trying to explain why we're expecting something well short of the norm But I think these do stand out--for example, the state and local sector--as something unusual in a cyclical context The restraint on federal spending, given the budget laws that have been put in place, is an innovation that may suggest a departure from the past It stood up through the recession period; now, we will be into a recovery period; presumably that won't even give them the option that they had so readily if they had wanted to set aside the constraints And in the construction sector, as I've illustrated, the imbalances seem to be well beyond anything in recent experience So, I think there are some real negatives Now, we could get surprises We might do better in international trade than we have in the forecast; businesses may feel a greater urgency to modernize their equipment and improve productivity thereby Maybe we can get an impulse there If everything went well, maybe consumers would find the wherewithal to increase their spending relative to income But, as I illustrated, barring a radical revision to the personal saving rate, we're really    7/2-3/91  in very low territory So, I think in each of these cases there are risks on the up side and the down side; but they add up to something that suggests to us that we're going to fall short of past norms   Well, there has been only one since the Korean War, I think, that had less than 6 percent growth for the first year-- ruling out the abortive '80 cyclical expansion because that ended so quickly   Right So, this is a distinct outlier, which gives me some hesitation Indeed, one of the features of the recession thus far has been a quite healthy inventory liquidation And that is probably part of the correlation one sees between the depth of the recession and the size of the rebound In this case we're looking for a sizable inventory swing because of how strong the liquidation has been Yet we're saying the final demands are going to hold down this overall upswing Obviously, none of this is certain and we recognize the risks on both sides   Well, I think we back out money via a velocity or money demand relationship, having derived a forecast using some interest rate assumption--in this case stability of the federal funds rate That is the assumption made   There hasn't been a recovery in which interest rates came in absolutely stable in the short end either   I recognize the artificiality of this but, as Don will be exploring, I'm sure, there are special factors in the environment that condition our expectations about velocity   I did note that one of the things that suggests to us that possibly there's less of a monetary impulse to this recovery is the fact that thus far we haven't seen much of an acceleration in money stock If you look at real M2 in past cycles, for example, it's very clear that around the troughs and early in recoveries there typically has been very marked acceleration   I think we've emphasized that the kind of money stock growth that we're anticipating over the next year and a half could not be sustained over the subsequent years and [remain    7/2-3/91  consistent with a] move toward that significantly lower inflation you're seeking So, yes, this would have to be a transitory phenomenon; if you want to move toward price stability, [M2 growth] has to move significantly lower and, obviously, there are alternatives in the Bluebook that describe such a path   I think in essence we've really embodied in this forecast a bit more favorable sacrifice ratio than some of our models would predict But, indeed, we have not assumed that within this time span we're going to get an improved tradeoff coming from enhanced credibility and so on But if moderate policies are pursued and it's clear that we are pursuing that objective wholeheartedly, then one might expect that tradeoff to improve over time   Governor Angell, the alternative II strategy on page 9 of the Bluebook is an approximation; it has 4-1/2 percent M2   As you can see, we get into the vicinity of price stability by 1995, with allowances for measurement questions and so on We're certainly close, if we're not there   Well, the model says that roughly 1 percentage point of extra unemployment for a year gives you a 1/2 percentage point reduction in inflation, and we have not built in additional credibility effects that could improve that tradeoff as time progresses So, it might well be that one could achieve, with the same unemployment path or a better unemployment path, as good or better price performance by the mid-1990s    7/2-3/91   Well, there's another option I think Don considered getting into this--and he's discussed it in the past--that there is this entry problem as you approach price stability In a sense you're going to overshoot unless you bring that unemployment rate down fairly rapidly by around 1996 So, what one would do presumably is accommodate some faster growth out in '94 and '95 and then you would have a smoother landing as you went toward price stability This just goes mechanically throughout without the kind of fine-tuning that one could do here   So, that maybe overstates the bleakness of the employment--   Well, we tried to describe what our baseline meant because, as Don described, it was an extension of the Greenbook forecast assuming that you are going to leave some small margin of slack to bring down the unemployment rate gradually   We found a range of estimates from about 5-1/2 to 6 percent, and we've determined that we would bet on something closer to the 5-1/2 percent   It has been adjusted to be consistent with the judgmental assessment   I was speaking loosely, but I think one could make the case that something in the 1 percent vicinity might be consistent, when you allow for the possibilities of substitution, look at quality change measurement problems, and so on But that's [likely] to be settled when we get closer--   We have a study already in process   In fact, we'd be happy to distribute a paper by some staff members that was presented at the AEA meetings last December, which addresses this very question as a first cut   Or second! [Laughter]   President Hoskins, if Don hadn't just made that remark, I think I would have myself My sense is that we have as much confidence in predicting what inflation will be over the next couple of years looking at the real GNP and unemployment picture as we would looking at money and guessing at velocity and the links through all these channels to prices So, there is a significant uncertainty here about what you should be focusing on to have the greatest confidence--   I might   Obviously, this unemployment/inflation link is a short-run relationship, so it may not be relevant over the longer span But with financial innovation, I'm not sure what the meaning of M2 will be five years from now So, in today's world I'd be reluctant  -28-    7/2-3/91  to set out in advance a particular course and say ""I want to stick to that and I can be highly confident what the price trend would be"" "
4284,1991-08-05," Well, at this stage, we're just beginning to put together a forecast for the next FOMC meeting The data of late have been mixed On the whole we don't feel they have been as robust as we would have expected if we are to get the almost 5 percent GNP growth we had for the third quarter in the last Greenbook Thus, I would anticipate very tentatively that we will be marking that down significantly to probably something more in the neighborhood of 3 percent But we're having to sift through some data that don't fit together very neatly And there has just been such great volatility in the labor market data in particular, which are usually one of our most important guides, that it's very hard to read at this stage   Again, it's a mixed picture in the recent data In the most recent figures on the wage side, for example, we got a nice figure on average hourly earnings in July after a string of very bad numbers That was some comfort but the employment cost indexes for the second quarter were not favorable On balance, they were higher than we anticipated So, the labor cost picture doesn't appear to be evolving in a more favorable way In the other price data, for food and energy prices there are likely to be some adjustments I don't think we see a materially different picture at this point for the second half than we had before It's still a relatively moderate rate of inflation, something in the 3 to 4 percent range, for the second half "
4307,1991-08-20," Statement--see Appendix   Well, what happened in the second quarter was clearly a liquidation of stocks in the nonfarm business sector We  -16-    8/20/91  believe on the basis of the data that came in after BEA's advance estimate that that liquidation will be, in all likelihood, deeper in the revised numbers but perhaps still not quite as sharp as we had anticipated in our June Greenbook forecast Looking ahead, while one can see in the June data--if one wants to read them very closely--some hints of a diminished rate of liquidation, basically our view is that, in light of the anecdotal evidence and our anticipations of what behavior would be at this point, we are probably still in a phase of inventory liquidation but at a slower pace than earlier And probably we are not swinging toward stability or accumulation quite as rapidly as we had thought we might be in our prior forecast As I indicated, businessmen just seem to be very cautious and not at all confident that the recovery and the demand are there and will remain there So, I think this process is likely to be stretched out some relative to our earlier forecast   What is in the Greenbook is the BEA number We think we're likely to have several billion dollars less inventory investment   I would think that oil would be the major item of inventory that would be significantly affected, but obviously other items could be affected to a lesser degree   I have not seen estimates and I don't think we are able to replicate those estimates at that level of disaggregation; we could not really pin that down   Well, there are always risks that the inventory numbers could be significantly revised History provides very discomforting examples of this kind of thing The evidence--in terms of surveys and in terms of what we see going on in industrial production and orders and so on--is consistent with our impression that, indeed, inventories have continued to be liquidated But the dimensions are important here So, if there are errors in these numbers, they could be misleading us   We would like to see firmer numbers than the June figure The June figure wasn't particularly a surprise, in a statistical sense, coming after the pretty good gains we had seen in the prior months At this stage of what we think is a recovery, erratic movements without a clear-cut, month-by-month upward thrust are not uncommon But, as I said, the major areas in which we became somewhat more insecure were how rapidly the inventory turnaround would occur and how much spending on business equipment would improve I'd say those figures will be of considerable interest   Just to clarify something stemming from an earlier question from Governor Mullins Our guess is--just reading the data that we can see on manufacturing and retail/wholesale trade-- that the inventory liquidation that was put at $3 billion in the initial GNP estimate will be more like $11 billion So, it's a significant change   We think that the manufacturing and retail and wholesale trade data imply a downward revision of roughly $8 billion in the inventory accumulation rate in the second quarter "
4340,1991-10-01," I think that notion has some intuitive appeal It's not something that one can discern in terms of the behavioral relationships that are sort of the averages through cycles that are embodied in econometric models My sense is that where this in fact may be a part of the current process is that some sectors are having a more muted initial response for various reasons The housing sector, for example, is perhaps not having as big a kick from declining mortgage rates as we've had in some past cycles, and we are not seeing a big pent-up demand for consumer durables We didn't get a big surge initially, and this may have tended to contribute to this sense that things are really not picking up And with the rather negative tone that I referred to earlier, in those circumstances the confidence may not be there on the part of businessmen to proceed to the next phases of restocking and pickup in investment as might have occurred previously So, in a sense, the initial sluggishness may be continuing to retard [activity] as people just don't get the sense that things are falling in place and that they should proceed with confidence in making investments to meet future demand So, it may be that there's some of that dynamic here I don't see that, though, as    10/1/91  necessarily suggesting that this [recovery] has to peter out We have this continuation of what we think is the beginning now of a moderate growth path   Ted Truman presented an interesting econometric result--I think it was in the chart show--which indicated in essence that to a first approximation the decline in interest rates that had occurred since the beginning of this year had effectively offset the surprise we have seen in the dollar, which we had not anticipated to appreciate as it did Thus, if you looked at where output would be sometime out in 1992, these were compensating forces Now, what caused the dollar to do that--whether it was exogenous events and political factors and so on or part of the internal endogenous dynamics in the economic system--is hard to say But some political factors clearly were involved in that development   Well, I would not discount entirely the notion that some of the responses to the financial developments that we have seen in the economy may have differed from what we have observed in the past There's a complex of factors in terms of term structure and financial flows and the credit crunch aspects of this and so on that you'd have a hard time matching up against previous history My sense is that the key interest-sensitive sector, housing, has responded to the easing in rates; that did happen And we expect the recent easing to continue that process Inventory investment has been very cautious and we've been a bit surprised On the other hand, there haven't been other things occurring that should have driven firms to restock aggressively So, maybe things are not out of kilter there; the basic elements of the cyclical dynamics are there And it's really hard to discern how much they've departed in degree from the past   This is an extraordinary slump    10/1/91   Right, it's very long; it started a while back and it is very protracted by historical standards In terms of gauging how far it might go, we think it's reasonably aligned with what we can see already in the construction contracts and permits data, which have some lead time in them We think that there is still [in train] a significant decline in office and hotel construction and probably in other commercial construction to some degree and that we're likely to see only modest improvements over the next year or so beginning in industrial construction and maybe in some utilities construction This just looks like a very weak sector The vacancy rates have remained high to date despite the fall-off in construction of office buildings We just don't see a basis at this point for an improvement there And the financing situation is obviously not a plus But, given the fundamentals, that's just a side story Nobody in their right mind would finance the construction of a new building in many of the major cities   In fact, as we noted in the footnote in this Greenbook as we had in the prior one, we actually perceive the liquidation as likely to be larger than the number we wrote down in the Greenbook, given our expectation that the inventory liquidation in the second quarter would be lower We've circulated some revised tables   Under this cover sheet are the revised forecast tables that we distributed There is a substantial liquidation still in the third quarter We think that is consistent with the July numbers, anticipating that in the subsequent months there will be a little less liquidation and that as we move into the fourth quarter we're going to move toward to some end to that liquidation But even the fourth quarter we perceive at this point to be in negative territory on a GNP basis So, we think it's consistent with the production figures and the import figures and the limited inventory data we have But we're dealing with a very small amount of data on the third quarter   And there's room for a surprise, certainly "
4381,1991-11-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   Given the direction things have been going, my gut reaction is to say ""yes"" But I think also that the tail isn't quite so long and so thick as before As I said, what we've done now essentially is that we have realized some of the risks we perceived earlier [by lowering our forecast] and I think the risks may be somewhat more balanced in this forecast than before   That's right Our strategy normally is to take the prevailing funds rate as a neutral base for the projection What we were looking at with that funds rate path, though, was an economic forecast that in our judgment strayed farther perhaps from the Committee's objectives than one might like in terms of presenting you with a reasonable framework for discussion Indeed, the unemployment rate at the end of next year might have been a shade higher than it is currently rather than the level we have So we returned to a procedure that we have used in the past of putting in policy adjustments so as to try to get closer to something we thought would be acceptable to the Committee    11/5/91   That's correct   Right, but obviously 25 basis points is a very fine reading But that is [the thought] we went into this with   Well, there are two things, I would say One is that the swing in inventory investment in the quarter just ended in September was considerably larger than we had anticipated And with the potential revisions of those data, it goes even further In a sense we got ahead of the game that we were anticipating businesses would play here The second factor is that as we look at the prospects for final demand and what we think businessmen might be anticipating at this juncture, we have a hard time conceiving of businesses wanting to move further in the direction of inventory accumulation at this point So, we stretched the process out here We have an inventory/sales ratio path that is downward through this forecast We think that implies that at some point in the coming year, if we can just get through this period and sustain growth, there is going to be some further movement in the direction of inventory accumulation And by the end of next year we have businesses adding to their stocks at a gradual pace This might be regarded as a quite conservative inventory forecast Certainly, we have model results that would suggest that that is so But we think businesses are being very conservative in their inventory management And to the extent that there is still stringency in credit markets affecting some businesses, I think it just encourages them even more to try to keep their inventories down to avoid having to finance a lot of stocks   Right As I mentioned, the manufacturers inventory numbers were much higher for September than we had expected They were also much higher than the Bureau of Economic Analysis built into their estimate of third-quarter GNP Relative to their assumptions, there were additional manufacturers inventories of about $10 billion, in 1982 dollars at an annual rate And that inventory investment in the third quarter is essentially equivalent to a    11/5/91  percentage point of GNP Whether that will be the ultimate adjustment of the GNP numbers and whether we'll see some weaker wholesale and retail figures than they anticipated, one can't say But, clearly, it's a substantial surprise for BEA   Are you talking about auto dealer inventories?   Well, actually, they've been running very low, for autos in particular Truck inventories were heavier, but they undoubtedly came down in September with the big surge in light truck financing   It's always a bit murky as to exactly what data they are using in estimating the retail auto component of inventories But, yes, presumably they had a handle on what was happening in vehicles   Well, I think I showed in a chart show earlier this year our estimates of the number of unoccupied dwelling units during the '80s The buildup was much more marked in the multifamily area than in the single-family area But those are housing units and people can choose among these I think there is something of an overhang in the housing market Certainly, at this point with the new homes sales at the pace they're running, the months' supply of new homes on the market is very sizable So, yes, that is a factor Sorry, I forgot the other--   Auto sales were quite high through much of the 1980s and the stocks looked to be fairly sizable per household, for example In the last couple of years the average age [of the auto stock] has leveled out; it's fairly long As I look at the forecast going forward, I think perhaps we're beginning to develop a movement back in the other direction If car sales stay as low as we have them in this forecast, as we look ahead another year or so the demands may begin to reflect some pent-up buying desires But at this point we don't think those desires are very intense    11/5/91   Well, Janet Norwood called attention to this in her testimony before the Joint Economic Committee last year This is a procedure that is followed routinely every year to utilize the unemployment insurance data to benchmark the payroll employment series The data evidently did show a very abrupt drop relative to the payroll employment series estimates early this year She cautioned against taking this as gospel at this point; these are preliminary readings But it is conceivable that ultimately, when the revisions are made, payroll employment growth will appear less robust than before I think the feed-through to GNP that has been implied by some of these reports is a bit tenuous Certainly, in the short run we expect that BEA when it has a lot of data missing may give some attention to the hours input, but I wonder how important that would be looking back at history It could be, if the employment is slower and hours commensurately lower, that productivity growth will look better than it currently does   It could also be that this will lead them to lower their estimates of labor income until the data from tax returns are available   Well, I wouldn't want to leave the impression that we feel there aren't any upside risks here We continue to return to the notion that, in the absence of absolutely clear evidence that we are back into a second dip, recoveries often surprise one in their strength So there could be unexpected areas of greater increase in expenditures It is conceivable that the decline in mortgage rates, which seems to be inspiring a lot of refinancing-- suggesting that people think these are good rates--perhaps will stimulate some additional home buying beyond what we have My concern is, though, that people are just so worried about whether they are going to be employed that that [rate decline] may not be as powerful as it might otherwise be It's a possibility We don't have any clear index of what desired inventory/sales ratios are in various sectors of the economy We can guess by the historical patterns and apparent response what that is But maybe this goes to the earlier question Getting a more rapid buildup of inventories could be an indication that we underestimated where businesses want [their inventories] to be and that they won't continue this kind of liquidation but rather will stay even or move into some accumulation in the near term That could be worth a point or two, conceivably, on GNP growth in the short run Business investment is another area,    11/5/91  conceivably, that could be stronger, but the orders and anecdotal evidence just don't seem to suggest a lot of upside potential there And we have consumers not spending a whole lot in the quarter The personal saving rate ticks up Maybe consumers, despite the worries they're expressing, will behave as they seem to have behaved throughout this recovery and spend practically every dollar they get their hands on Maybe that's simply because many of them have their backs to the wall and they really don't have a lot of leeway, and if there is this additional income, it actually will flow into the spending stream Those are possibilities, and cumulatively they would add up to a materially different picture   Well, I suppose there could be something there My sense is that this is an ongoing story It may be that managements feel the ongoing negative earnings reports require some action to convince the security analysts that this is not going to be repeated in the future Some people have noted that there seem to be a lot of layoff announcements pertaining to the fourth quarter and that this cuts against some tradition in business of not laying people off just before Christmas My sense is that a lot of restructuring is going on in industry where this recession has revealed the need for some cost- cutting in order to get reasonable profit margins in an environment where inflation is not going to offset any looseness of management There's this sense, too, that the layoffs are occurring in places where people thought jobs were once fairly secure And that undoubtedly adds to the feeling among many people who would seem on the face of it to be in pretty good shape that even they could be vulnerable to some structural adjustment that seems to be going on, particularly in the service-producing sectors    11/5/91   I think that's a fair statement The rough cut I made, just looking at short rates, was perhaps the conjecture that inflation expectations might be viewed as a little less tenuous than thinking about 10- or 20-year horizons By this assessment the short- term rates have come down considerably One calculation I have looks very similar to the general level during the 1960s My point really relates more to that cyclical stage typically reached toward the end of a recession when real rates quite regularly have been decidedly negative The point is, though, that perhaps there wasn't a movement to tighten soon enough as the expansion progressed to avert that building up of inflation pressures This isn't to say that a sharp move of the sort I suggested might be necessary in order to achieve the Humphrey-Hawkins central tendency as a rate level you want to hold for a long period There might well be some need to move back up within a year or so But historically, the lows in this cycle don't look at all like the lows we have seen in short-term real rates in previous cycles, certainly in the postwar period   The real estate is an easier factor to consider The leveraging gets to be a little more difficult to pin down--ie whether firms really are cutting back their investment because of their debt loads There's some anecdotal evidence that would suggest that, but I don't know how powerful a force that is And we can see a significant amount of restructuring going on, with some of the firms that have leveraged themselves up to the hilt being able in the current environment to reduce their interest burdens and to alter their debt/equity ratios in ways that ought to give them a little more room to maneuver I think the real estate problem is going to be there for some time and will weigh against a strong surge in the economy The fiscal policy picture--just the total setting aside from the current budget program--will remain less than stimulative, of course So, there are some things that [appeared] in the past in recoveries and early expansions that aren't going to be there this time But the higher the growth rate, the lower the unemployment rate; and the less slack in the economy, the greater the risks are that you're not going to make the kind of progress toward lower rates of inflation that we have in this forecast And that even might just    11/5/91  be cut off entirely if we get a strong enough [trajectory] So, these are the risks one has to weigh at this point as to whether the economy is going to prove weaker than is acceptable and whether the inflation rate might be more stubborn than we've anticipated I must say there seems to be a lot skepticism among forecasters with outlooks for economic activity that don't differ greatly from ours about whether the disinflation trend can be sustained well into the expansion period--say, getting out into 1993 There is a sense that in the past the decline in inflation has stopped or has become very meager as people have sensed that the economy was on a solid growth track And that might be a concern "
4403,1991-12-02," Well, Mr Chairman, I think the news since the Committee meeting has been, on balance, decidedly negative Just to note the one outlier The housing starts numbers were certainly a more favorable reading than we had seen in the September data We're a bit skeptical about the level of starts indicated by the latest figures in light of all the other anecdotal information, and the sales figures that we have in hand will be firming up that impression    12/2/91  tomorrow when we get figures on new home sales Otherwise, we've had a string of negative surprises Right after the Greenbook was completed, as you know, we had the hours figures for October, which indicated very weak labor income Subsequent to that period, initial claims have ticked up a bit, suggesting to us that in all likelihood payroll employment will be down a bit when reported this Friday Consumer sentiment has soured further and the spending numbers through the latest month show some further erosion of consumer demand for autos and other goods and services We found in the September inventory figures a buildup that went well beyond the Commerce Department's expectations, or ours, and that suggested to us that our expectations with respect to inventory investment in the fourth quarter had been perhaps too optimistic Now, it appears that there may have been some influx of imported goods that showed up in those inventory figures and, thus, that we might hope for imports to absorb some of whatever inventory corrections we're looking at From the orders figures and other information, we suspect that domestic manufacturing activity will suffer some in the next few months The motor vehicle production schedules have been revised down to below even our discounting of the earlier assembly schedules We think we're going to exit this year probably with some decline in total industrial production Our sense is that the current quarter is likely to be on the negative side of zero--not deeply so but negative for real gross domestic product And at this point, looking at the trajectory and the lack of an obvious spur for an immediate turnaround, the likelihood is that perhaps some additional inventory adjustment might be sought in the first quarter of the year In an environment in which layoff announcements will still be widespread and consumer sentiment probably still very depressed, we may remain in modestly negative territory in the first quarter It's obviously early relative to our schedule for preparing the Greenbook, but that's our general sense at the moment Thank you "
4425,1991-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, [the reliability of the] information we are getting from those data is a matter of considerable dispute among researchers I think there is considerable evidence that they do add something to the relevant data one has for judging what consumer spending is doing currently The increment to our knowledge of what will happen down the road is probably more limited We had basically taken it as a sign early on, when we saw the drop in last month's figures, that this was going to be a weak quarter for consumer spending; and I wouldn't want to read much more into it at this point   Well, I would duck that to anyone I could! If we had a strong conviction about what the composition and magnitude of any package would be, given our guess that something is going to happen, we would have put it in We really don't know There are significant differences among the packages, [such as] emphasis on actions that would reduce the cost of capital versus other things that would provide a rapid transfer of income to middle class households or whatever These things vary considerably and their impacts would be significantly different, I think, in timing and potential dimension   Well, that fact was one of the reasons--and I think we at least hinted at it--why we didn't put it in I do think    12/17/91  they still feel somewhat constrained at this point by the size of the budget deficit and the Budget Act itself No one seems to be talking about really large net fiscal impulses, so we felt we wouldn't be missing much by not including the package in the forecast at this point and merely suggesting that the direction is likely to be stimulative but probably not very large   Well, the change in computer deflators that went into the index is a major factor in the change in this forecast   But we've also anticipated, in light of the stalling out of overall activity, that there's going to be a greater deferral of equipment spending So there's an element of fundamental change in the forecast I might also note that the revisions in the national income accounts give a larger weight to nonresidential construction in business fixed investment And given that that's a very weak component in the forecast, that also tends to damp the expansion of business fixed investment in this forecast   It's the output that we're talking about "
4461,1992-02-04," Well, that very clearly is a deviation from past norms of cyclical behavior, and I think it does reflect an unusually low degree of interest sensitivity Basically, we think that process has been short-circuited by the buildup of so huge a stock of unoccupied buildings Traditionally there has been a modest but significant contribution from nonresidential construction in the first couple of years of business upturns Outside of that area, there are indications--and we've tried to gauge this econometrically--that housing may be less interest sensitive than it once was It's a little hard to disentangle historically because of the disintermediation or reintermediation with segmented mortgage markets that produced a credit rationing effect that outweighed whatever interest rates effects there were So, one has to disentangle that There is also more reliance than in the past on adjustable rate mortgages, which scarcely existed earlier; and that conceivably may affect interest sensitivity So, we may not have as great an interest sensitivity in the housing sector as one might expect But, indeed, our models have been surprised at the weakness of residential construction And that may be partly a matter of gauging the perceived real cost of home buying It is quite conceivable that in the past year or so people have perceived the prospect of capital loss as being much greater than any trend in prices over recent years, which is the normal effect that the models capture I think those are the major areas It's possible, too, that inventories don't have a greater interest sensitivity than we have built into this And in the consumer durables area, we're torn between a couple of considerations (1) the interest sensitivity probably isn't all that high to begin with; and (2) the movements of consumer loan rates haven't been enormous, but on an after tax basis they have moved somewhat perversely in recent years On the other hand, somebody looking at the option of whether to invest in a consumer durable with the expectation of a return of flow of services versus the 3 or 4 percent rate earned on a deposit might feel that isn't a bad deal and might be stimulated to spend a little more than otherwise   Yes   Yes, indeed In the 1980s there was a distinct improvement in productivity performance in manufacturing The residual has not shown that kind of improvement, and basically our expectation is that we will continue to see manufacturing do well in terms of gains in output per hour and that probably we will see the remainder of the economy improve its performance somewhat I would caution, however, that it's not so clear that the developments we've been seeing recently--the restructuring--constitute a vastly different kind of event than we have seen in other cycles So at this point I think one should be cautious in anticipating a really radical shift in productivity gains   Mr Chairman, we've just received auto sales data For those of you who want to be brought up to the very minute, there was some improvement in the last 10 days of January On our seasonal adjustment factors auto sales were 6-1/4 million at an annual rate with almost 4 million in sales of light trucks So we ended the month at 59 million autos sold and 36 million trucks sold; that's a little better picture than we saw in the first 20 days of January The cars were close to the December rate; trucks were off a bit; you will recall that the year-end incentives distorted it So, I think we're on a steady-as-you-go [course] in the motor vehicle market   Well, it's very difficult to get a precise fix on underlying longer-run trends We know something about the demographic situation It's certainly clear that the relevant population is growing more slowly than it was several years ago It's also clear that if past patterns hold, that would favor single-family relative to multifamily construction because people are passing into years where home ownership rates typically rise very markedly We think we have been below the longer-run trend recently and that we're going to move up relative to that trend--conceivably to around trend or a bit above it--in response to what is much enhanced affordability We've had a very distinct improvement for people who want to buy houses, and the signs are that there is some response already in train here We've raised our forecast since the last meeting despite no change, really, in our mortgage rate assumptions It just appeared to us that people have been responding more than we had anticipated previously and that with perhaps a small degree of optimism we could carry that through the forecast period   Governor Mullins, as you know, we distributed to all of the FOMC members a paper by Dave Stockton and colleagues which included a discussion of that issue, and there's further work being done But we do have something that has gone out to the Committee   Mr Chairman, may I remind you about the updates of anyone's forecast?   Yes, and I wanted to raise the question about fiscal policy assumptions There seems to be some confusion about what has been asked for   We won't anticipate any particular indication of what you are specifically assuming So it's [unintelligible] "
4486,1992-03-11," Thank you In the last Greenbook we had a forecast for the first quarter of only a slight increase of about 05 percent at an annual rate in real GDP and then a moderate pickup in the second quarter The data we've received since that time have been somewhat mixed but on balance suggest to us that that general pattern still is a reasonable guess If anything, though, I think the first quarter could come in a bit higher rather than a bit lower than our Greenbook guess But we wouldn't really see it as a material difference at this juncture  The tenor of the news from the retail sector has been better than we anticipated but, of course, we'll know more statistically tomorrow when we get the February retail sales release The housing market has been quite firm recently, largely in line with our expectations or maybe a little better But given that the strength in starts and new home sales seems to be so concentrated in the Midwest, one wonders whether there is some statistical noise in the data and whether things really have picked up as much as the data suggest And, of course, we have to be a little concerned looking forward about the consequences of the backup in mortgage rates We have not heard very much to indicate that that has put a dent in the market to this point, although the mortgage bankers series does suggest that the demand for new mortgage loans, whether for refinancing or for new purchases, has slackened considerably in the last few weeks  On the equipment side, the orders have looked a bit better than we might have anticipated We don't know whether that will be domestic equipment spending or exports; but in any event it's output and it's worth a little more perhaps than we had built into our forecast Nonresidential construction continues to look very weak The inventory situation is in broad terms in line with our expectation that there would be an inventory adjustment in the first quarter The fourth quarter came out worse than most people expected in terms of accumulation We only have a few data, manufacturing and wholesale trade for January, that do show some liquidation We think the industrial production drop in January reflected this adjustment process February appears to be a period of some considerable rebound in manufacturing, probably not enough to fully offset the January decline, however And we're still expecting to see the first quarter overall down appreciably from the fourth-quarter level for industrial production On the employment report, the unemployment increase was generally in line with our expectation that it was going to go up further The employment and hours figures were stronger than we anticipated but there are some things in the data that lead us to discount those numbers heavily One is that the average workweek has been very volatile in the last couple of years, and we find it very difficult to buy the tremendous jump in the workweek that we saw in the February numbers Also, the payroll employment increase was in essence totally in retail trade and in motor vehicles production We know there's a seasonal adjustment uncertainty with the retail trade figures and consider it unlikely that we're really into a period of substantial renewed growth in retail employment And in the manufacturing sector, motor vehicle employment probably did increase as the assembly schedules were [raised], but we don't expect ongoing increases there So, as I said, on the whole there's a little better    3/11/92  tone than we had anticipated, but we think we're generally on the track that we had of very modest increases in activity at this time-  On the price side, the January consumer price index was favorable relative to our expectations We didn't get the so-called January effect of some of the series that tend to be adjusted once a year, [producing] a big increase in January On the whole, we think developments are definitely in line with our expectations that the price trends would be favorable Thank you, Mr Chairman   I might defer to Charlie Siegman; I don't think we've seen enough to change our assumptions greatly, which did have pretty much a flat picture in oil prices   Our fiscal policy assumption was for no change in the overall fiscal picture except for the change in withholding schedules Of course, at this juncture, that seems to be a pretty good assumption in terms of the likelihood that [legislation] will be passed and vetoed and there may be a stalemate On the other hand, we really thought something probably would be passed by the spring; we just didn't know what it would be There's still reason for uncertainty There is certainly talk that there may be some effort to come back with a much slimmer package of things like passive losses and some investment tax break and perhaps something for first-time home buyers But at this point we would probably resort to the same statement of ignorance and not incorporate any new fiscal policy assumption   Well, I should caution that we are just beginning the Greenbook forecasting process and, as these things relate to the pattern of activity out over the remainder of the year, we can't state with any great firmness where we're going to end up But Charlie may want to say something about how things are developing   We also, of course, will have to incorporate the developments in the exchange market My intuition at this point is that there has not been anything on the external side that suggests a more favorable outlook for demand for US produced goods over the next few quarters   There have been weather effects There have been effects flowing from deals with the former Soviet Union and so on I don't think that picture has changed in any way that would have any material effect on our forecast We still view that, looking out over the next year or so, as an area containing some significant upside price risks just because of the very lean levels of inventories And I don't think anything that has happened on the production side changes that picture at this point   Mr Chairman, if there were a significant drop [in oil prices] from current levels, I think that would make a dent in our forecast But at this point we're talking about differences from where we expect things to be later in the year of only a dollar or two And that was within the range of various factors that could be changed in this forecast I don't think we're way off track at this point But if, as suggested, there is a risk of a material decline from these levels, then prospects would look a little different   Well, it's clearly a plus but I think we're talking about a few tenths at most on output or prices over the course of 1992 "
4511,1992-03-31," There's probably also some greater volume of net mortgage financing and it's clearly at the long end   There's a very modest pickup from the fourth quarter   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we do think that the outside world is perhaps overestimating the inflationary effects of this moderate growth and underestimating the effects of what is generally perceived to be a continuing fairly sizable amount of slack in the economy So, I think the possibility of diminution in the markets' inflation fears is a significant one Also, as people perceive that only moderate growth--if we are right--is ahead, that will ease some people's fears that we might be opting to do something that could close the margin of slack more rapidly I have the sense that perhaps long-term rates have moved up into the range in which they have been fluctuating for a while without a particularly sound basis and that we can simply have some reversal But I think the fundamental factors are the moderate    3/31/92  course in the expansion we see and the continuing slack that should be bringing the inflation rate down, not stabilizing it or pushing it up as most outside forecasts have it   I feel reasonably confident that it is a process that is ongoing Certainly, to the extent that there is any evidence, formal or informal, companies indicate that they would like to have lower inventory/sales ratios In manufacturing, while there has been some considerable progress, firms still are redesigning their production processes, their relationships with suppliers, and their overall inventory management, to trim inventories And as we noted before, we've yet to see the benefits of inventory management techniques and utilization and so on in the retail and some wholesale sectors that we might have hoped for, and we think there's potential there as well But, certainly, the consolidation of the retail sector, if that continues, ought to work a bit in that direction So, there's still likely to be a trend movement and it's inherent in our forecast We have a very modest rate of inventory accumulation; late in 1992 and in 1993 the inventory/sales ratio is drifting down [in our forecast] We're drawing our lesson much more from the trends of the last long expansion than from what one might have seen in earlier cyclical upturns So, in a sense it's either a cushion or we've captured a trend that's probably continuing   That is obviously hard to assess It's to some extent a matter of gauging what people's desires are and those could change over time A simple examination of what happened, particularly in the motor vehicles area, is that we look for trends in motor vehicles per household The trend in the stock of motor vehicles has varied in constant dollars We look at the equations that we have for automobile demand, such as they are, which estimate a desired stock given operating costs, interest rates, and those sorts of things All of these seem to point toward some shortfall We're not sure how much it is Drawing some trend lines we get something like 1-1/2 to 2 million units at present We are aware of the forecasts within the industry, which are based on the notion that there may be a 3 million unit shortfall--pent-up demand as it were Basically, our forecast is one that, given the basic replacement needs, doesn't really make any substantial progress in overcoming that Again, one might view this as possibly a small upside risk That as this expansion proceeds people will want to replace some of those cars which are now, in terms of median age, considerably older than people used to live with Maybe the cars are better; maybe we don't need to return [to trend]; but there does seem to be some possible backlog of demand there  Other areas we don't see so clearly There has been a very sharp downturn in expenditures on other durables and on some nondurable items that one might think of as lasting some span of time Conceivably, there's some backlog of desired spending there We haven't built it in; it isn't readily visible in other data on stocks for durable goods, for example The past year or so has been a period  -11-    3/31/92  of extraordinarily weak consumer spending and we think there's some backlog and buildup "
4536,1992-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we've felt that the balance of risks also was more even in the last couple of forecasts than it had been through much of last year And I think we repeatedly flagged what we perceived to be the asymmetry of the probability distribution through last year We are reasonably comfortable with this forecast as presenting fairly balanced risks I think each of the items that you mentioned is a plausible story The one reservation I would have in light of the recent data is that the latest housing market data are disappointing relative to even our meager expectations We probably had about as low a forecast for second-quarter housing starts as anyone and yet the April figures--one month admittedly--do paint a weaker picture   Rates have come down and some observers sensed that people were beginning to look at home buying as they would look at car buying They had to feel there was a bargain You know, the government offered rebates early in the year and people rushed to buy We had not attached a lot of importance to that at the time, but in retrospect it may have pulled forward some housing starts from later    5/19/92  in the year, or certainly some home sales And we're not exactly sure where we are   I think they're reasonably balanced here   Let me give you the arithmetic [to the extent] that we are able to do these translations Every number that has come in since the BEA's initial estimate has been higher than they had anticipated, at least until the revision for the March housing starts, which had only a small impact If you cumulate those figures, you come out at this point with about a 4 percent increase in GDP That's assuming that the merchandise trade figure comes in right on their assumption It could be higher; it could be lower Our feeling was that all these additional goods being sold might be tilting the risks toward some lower [trade figure] So, that's where we are, and I think it's a fair statement at this juncture Now, BEA will confront the same anomalies that I noted, and they will have to take that into account They have some room to maneuver, but I think we should expect a substantial revision   Indeed It's looking backward, but I don't think everyone has caught up with this I see that a number of private analysts have been talking in the last week or so about growth of around 3 percent, and they will probably refine that a bit So, it's unlikely to be a total shock, but it's coming in on the high side of expectations, well on the high side   Explicit decline!   Well, I'm not sure how one would define the ""recent"" trading range If you look at the period since early    5/19/92  February until recently, I think we're pressing against the lower limits [of that range] this morning, and we could conceivably break below that Looking at the broader time frame going back, with bond yields having gotten down to about 7-3/8 percent, that's about the dimension of the decline that we're anticipating in our forecast by early next year I think the answer to your question depends on what circumstances bring about this failure [of long rates to decline] If it is a buoyant economy and strong demands for capital, then obviously it's not a problem If it is higher inflation expectations, we get into some more complex issues about how that might affect the affordability of housing and so on; but if it's inflation expectations and not real rates, again it may not be a compelling negative If it's risk premia brought on by political uncertainties--and this may be a year of tremendous political uncertainty--or just the wrong expectations, as we've had on some occasions, that could be a negative So it's really hard to say ex ante   Well, let me just say that I think we noted in the last Greenbook, not this one, that we didn't find the narrower monetary aggregates nor the enhanced narrow monetary aggregate that you're implicitly describing as providing strong evidence on the outlook Historically, we haven't found that these provide all that much better guidance than M2 as it is, with all of what I view as flaws in the logic of its construction But I'd also argue that in telling the story about how money affects inflation, there's a short- run transmission mechanism which I think would run through the pressures of aggregate demand on aggregate supply Thus, I think our assessment of the pressures in resource markets is very relevant to the short-run outlook for inflation through 1993 So, I can segment these questions to some extent   Well, I guess I'm skeptical about the meaning of the monetary aggregates right now I'm not inclined to assign a large asymmetry to the risk just because the monetary aggregates have been running low Clearly, that's a judgment call Others have differed, and perhaps wisely, in looking at the progress of this recovery But one also needs to interpret why the aggregates are behaving the way they are and whether it is demand shifts or changes in the structure of intermediation and so on that may be neutral in terms of their implications for the cost and availability of credit to support it   Well, as a general matter, we would perceive the interest sensitivity of the housing sector as being reduced from what it once was, in part because of reduced market segmentation--the elimination of the non-price rationing effects that occurred a couple of decades ago when rates moved above Reg Q ceilings and we got disintermediation The introduction of ARMs might work in the same direction, but how important that is isn't clear There's a question on mortgage rates Some people have been able through considerable effort to tease out of econometric equations some suggestion that people will wait until the rates have come down and they don't think rates are going to go down any further before they will move But that is a very short-run phenomenon and it doesn't seem to be a very important result over significant spans of time  On the price side, it depends on which model you think is most relevant There's an affordability model, which clearly does have some importance That looks at mortgage rates and prices and at that combination relative to income; and that says that we have had a considerable improvement in affordability over the past couple of years On the other side, if you look at an investment model, a user- cost model, it says that it's cheaper to own a home when you're getting capital gains So expected price movements would be important in that model Basically we've taken a middle-ground view saying affordability is better and the fear that people will be losing their shirts in owning a home is probably abating because house prices generally have firmed some over the past year It's a hard call to make as to which of these things is most important I think what we've seen recently, as I was suggesting, is that people are very sensitive to a number of aspects of this They jumped when they saw those mortgage rates get down to low levels and when there was the first-time home buyer credit [proposal] They seemed to have pulled back very sharply when rates backed up and the credit [proposal] evaporated An environment in which people are still rather uncertain about their employment and income prospects is a fragile situation And, going back to President Parry's comment, if we can begin to get, without generating strength solely out of the housing sector, some reasonable growth going here and some confidence in employment prospects, then people may move in response to this vastly improved affordability, and we could get a significantly stronger housing expansion than we have forecast We're certainly operating at low levels even given the prevailing demographic trends   Well, it's not bad news The question is how much good news there is in these numbers We've looked at the history and a lot of other analysts have too Some have declared that there is some lead, particularly in the early phases of an upturn, in the household employment series relative to the payroll series Others have said that's just not a very robust relationship We find hints, but [the relationship] doesn't seem to be highly reliable The fact is that in the payroll series the Bureau of Labor statistics make an allowance for new business formations as well as the closing down of businesses And it is a little murky how they do this It is conceivable that they're underestimating the rate of new business formations if the economy is picking up and that that is biasing the change downward But as I suggested, looking at corollary evidence entirely separate from these things--such as initial claims and the responses in the Conference Board surveys about job availability--all these other things don't suggest that employment is growing at 300,000 plus a month [Actual growth] may be somewhere in between but I'm more inclined to think it may be closer to the payroll trend at this point than to the household trend   Well, as you know, I've not been an enthusiast of that view and have worried that that was more a coincidence Typically, we have thought of there being a lag between changes in money growth and changes in GDP So, the close timing last year I think was not necessarily in line with what we normally consider the relationship to be Whether a one-quarter lag in velocity gets at this or not is another question I think we're looking at a period of slow growth of money that stretches back a few years now And in a sense we haven't gotten some of the payoff [in] disinflation that some might have anticipated If [the economy is] growing at the rate it appears to be, that doesn't quite seem to fit But I don't want to state the case excessively strongly either There may have been a message--and it may show up in the second quarter or the third quarter--from that weakening money stock growth last year   Well, without being too precise in this, we've seen some evidence in the first quarter of a very big jump in profits A sizable move at this point wouldn't be surprising in terms of the historical relations, which suggest an acceleration in output growth that produces an acceleration in profits As things level out, as productivity increases begin to move back toward trend, we get a little additional pressure on the profit margins even though the rate of compensation increases is diminishing And thus we get this leveling out of the profit share and in the pattern we see for total corporate profits It may be that profits should be trending up a bit more That certainly would be more consistent with the view that I think prevails among private analysts, which has consumer price inflation stabilizing or increasing in 1993 Those people tend to see continuing upward movement in corporate profits   I think it's very difficult to read what the stock market is building in here But looking at this year's profit forecasts, recognizing that the PE ratios are distorted by extraordinary factors in 1991 that may be unwinding in 1993, we can see a movement of PEs at current stock price levels back into the high teens, still at a high level historically But later on this year things will not look as out of line as they do now And if interest rates are stable or coming down, this all hangs together fairly plausibly It's on the high side of history but plausible I sense the market probably is taking a view that with expansion come firmer prices and that profits will be a bit better in 1993 than we forecast   Well, the repercussion is that had we ended up with the level of sales we are running at with lower inventories as per the initial estimate, that would have been a bullish factor for the economic outlook As it is, though, we don't see that there is a gross inventory imbalance coming out of the first quarter except for the wholesalers And in fact in the nondurable wholesale area there are not very many signs of inventory/sales ratios being high Our expectation is, though, that inventories are going to be managed very cautiously and that quite possibly wholesale inventories will run off some Manufacturers show no inclination to see their inventories rise We expect to see some runoff of inventories for a little while longer but at a lower rate than even the reduced pace that we think the first quarter produced So that means that inventory investment makes a small positive contribution in the second quarter in our forecast and a considerably greater contribution in the second half of the year as we see a swing to a mild rate of accumulation as sales trends continue positive "
4562,1992-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman We'll be referring to the set of charts that you all have before you labeled ""Material for Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee""  MESSRS PRELL, STOCKTON, and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]   This potential output assumption is basically what we communicated in that report on potential output, with the adjustment that was needed because of the change in the 1987 base year for the output measures   When you do a present value calculation, [given] the distortions with a non-indexed tax system, the payoff doesn't look bad for the short-term sacrifice But it is a substantial sacrifice in the short run   Dave showed you some numbers for the household employment increase Basically, we have payroll employment gains creeping up toward a level of 150,000 per month by the end of the year, which is really a very modest increase relative to the trend, say, in the last decade And that's reflected in the very slow progress that we see in the reduction of the unemployment rate   Well, we've had only a very small increase in total payroll employment I'm not sure what it is We're approaching 1 million on the household series, I think  SPEAKER(?) Payroll [employment growth] has been more like 300,000 so far, hasn't it?   Payroll has gone up only about 300,000 from December to May   Well, a little better than we have been doing The last couple of months have been in the ballpark We would expect to get some acceleration, but it's quite modest overall   Of course, this isn't a public discussion   I would emphasize that basically we are looking from various points of view here at the debate that one might have about the progress we'll make This relationship has proven to be quite robust in the short run, though as Dave Stockton emphasized this is not a fully specified model We are not taking account of expectations effects, which are obviously very important in shifting the short-run Phillips curve around But there is information in this that suggests that to a first approximation slack is what gives us the disinflation force And I think we need to confront that internally in our policy decisions in terms of what tradeoffs are acceptable in the short run, recognizing as Dave emphasized that over the long run  -10-    6/30-7/1/92  the actions might build credibility and lower those costs and make those short-run tradeoffs increasingly advantageous   Well, one can look at dramatic regime changes-- major currency changes and so on--to see whether there were tradeoffs in those instances and try to find information there I'm not sure the results are uniformly favorable I appreciate your point, President Jordan, but from our perspective there has to be some mechanism that gets you from money to prices And that mechanism historically seems to involve some constraint on aggregate demand expansion, some weakening of demand for resources, some slack that evolves, and then there is the wage and price response One finds only limited evidence--Dave has worked on this in the past--of a more direct effect which may be consistent with a view that all wage and price setters out there are watching the money stock trends and adjusting their expectations accordingly But that isn't obvious; the statistical evidence is limited to support that kind of direct channel But if one could declare with absolute credibility that inflation will end next week, then it would be costly for people to behave in any other way So the question does arise What could one do if one of those [unintelligible] was raised here to enhance the credibility of that commitment Of course, once you fail, then you've lost that--   Well, we're always very attentive to that political problem in writing public statements But some sense of that, I think, is abroad and it doesn't come as a very great shock to people that that is the mechanism that many people have in mind   Mr Chairman, as a point of clarification, so that people know on Thursday [when the employment data are released] what the surprise is relative to our forecast, I think the Vice Chairman had the disadvantage of looking at some rounded quarterly average numbers Actually, what we have for June is only an 80,000 increase in payroll employment   Right   The quarterly average is 400,000 above the first- quarter average   The statute in force requires language close to this I think it requires you to ""establish""--  -60-    6/30-7/1/92   Yes, ""plans and objectives"" And one time we tried not to, though that was more extreme--   Our guess was 80,000 Just to bring you up to date, for those who don't have telerate screens today, the National Association of Purchasing Managers came out with a report this morning The overall index was down [from] 56 and a fraction to 52 and a fraction Construction put-in-place data for May came out; they were a little hard to read because they involved revised seasonal factors, but a quick look suggests that the numbers going from the  -62-    6/30-7/1/92  first to the second quarter were considerably stronger than we had anticipated, particularly in the state and local sector So, offsetting some of the disappointment there--   This state and local number is phenomenal; it's running very strong   Well, that's what is a little hard to read It does not appear to be a drastic change from our expectation   Well, I think it helps it to stay in the 2 percent area   Mr Chairman, I hesitate to inject this but perhaps the thought that people have is that the Committee is adopting a policy that would be expected to move the aggregates back toward the range unless the recent unusual behavior of velocity persists That would be a correct statement, but a non-quantitative one   But that assumes that the recent unusual behavior persists What I'm saying is that unless it persists you'd expect [growth of M2] to move back because we would not expect to end up the year with only 2-1/2 percent [M2 growth] given our GDP forecast if normal velocity behavior were to resume   I'm saying that isn't necessarily what is known to be the operative element in your policy concern It is contingent on a continuation of unusually strong velocity If you didn't get it, then you would expect [the aggregates] to come back I apologize for the diversion "
4596,1992-08-18," I'm deferring to my colleague, Mr Stockton, this morning in light of my absence through much of the period He's more on top of the forecast  MESSRS STOCKTON and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  -11-    8/18/92   On these July figures, I think last time in the Chart Show one of the exhibits I showed indicated that [the housing data] had been somewhat out of whack in the past several months We were getting a much higher level of single-family starts than customarily goes with the level of new home sales we had observed The level of starts in the latest month is well aligned with the permits--it had been running high relative to permits--and it's well aligned with the recent pace of new home sales Our supposition is, though, that we are in a period when new home sales are rising There will be some eating away of inventory And attitudes are favorable for home buying apart from the concerns about the general economic environment Certainly, home buyers perceive interest rates as being attractive So we'll see permits and starts rising a little  -12-    8/18/92   New home sales are reported fairly promptly after a sales contract is signed, but we don't have data for July And there are slight lags; [sales are] a little behind when these lower interest rates should have had their effect   The recent data have been favorable on balance for consumer spending Car sales haven't been great, but retail sales have been good and orders for capital goods have been pretty good There just isn't any reason to think that we are falling off from this somewhat erratic but generally steady trend of slow growth We only have 2-1/2 percent growth [forecast] for the fourth quarter If we were to fall short of that by a percentage point, the Okun's law relation would add only a touch to the unemployment rate So, it gets back to what Dave has been emphasizing in terms of these uncertainties about the labor market relationship per se What is happening with productivity and what is happening with labor market participation?  -13-    8/18/92 "
4623,1992-10-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It's a difficult question I think many people in different positions perceive the effects of changes in short-term rates differently A retiree living on the proceeds of short-term deposits would not see an improvement coming from lower short-term rates A business that has a heavy load of short-term floating rate debt or debt that rolls over frequently is going to achieve some significant improvements in the bottom line from the decline in interest costs I think it is fair to say that some of the channels of positive influence from declining rates have been somewhat diminished in their effectiveness in the past couple of years because such sectors as commercial real estate are just so far out of kilter in terms of the fundamentals of supply and demand that making borrowing cheaper is not going to make new investments particularly profitable It may enhance property values to some degree and diminish the write-downs that will occur, but we're not going to get quite the stimulus we would have in other circumstances Similarly, to the extent that credit availability has been the problem for some classes of borrowers, a small reduction in rates probably is not going to make a very great difference  But there are a lot of borrowers for whom lower rates will make a considerable difference I think we've seen that the decline in rates has significantly abetted the balance sheet restructuring process I think lower rates have played a role in sustaining relatively high valuations in the stock market and probably have cushioned the falls in a variety of other asset values We have not argued that modest changes in short-term rates are going to make a    10/6/92  night and day difference, but if you feel that there is nothing else here to provide a great deal of push to the economy over the next few quarters, our assumption of a decline in long rates looms rather large as a factor in the projected acceleration And the question becomes one of whether some easing of short rates is needed to facilitate that process If people thought that the Fed was overdoing it and that the implication of the easing was that we would have significantly higher inflationary pressures down the road and that we wouldn't reverse course in a timely way, then we might not get the beneficial effects in the bond market My sense is that unless the Fed went to 1 percent on the funds rate tomorrow--if the movement was gradual--that in the context of weak economic indicators we are more likely to get the ""too little too late"" complaint than we are the notion that we've overdone it and have shifted to a grossly inflationary posture So, there are a lot of things to weigh here But, as we suggested, I don't think we should ignore the fundamental notion that on balance easing probably does give us some stimulative effect It's a very long answer   I'm confident that we don't have any evidence to support that but no evidence to counter it either It's hard enough to discern a general phenomenon of a lower propensity to spend out of interest income in general They refine it to that point I don't know that anyone has even endeavored to do that By postwar standards this is rather an extraordinary episode in terms of the dimension of the decline in interest income, partly because we started the rate decline early and there's a lag effect here as instruments roll over I'm not sure we have a great historical sample from which to try to discern those [relationships]   This is the income-to-price effect We have the classic question here about how interest rates will affect consumption and savings   Their target is trying to get current income    10/6/92   Well, I suppose we ought to be more uncertain [given that] we have been disappointed in our prior thinking, but I don't conceive of it as more uncertain, though it's still very uncertain I think the risks are reasonably balanced at this point One might argue that we have tipped the scales in a more negative direction by taking the position we have on productivity, in a sense making the personal saving rate more directly a function of what is going on in the labor market But I think this forecast is no more certain in the end than our prior forecast was We've been less than confident for some time now about what was going on   Your question raises an interesting issue about the consumption behavior that we've observed because consumption has not been stronger than one might have expected given the usual determinants So, that would suggest it has been running fundamentally even weaker if this phenomenon is--   I guess the simple answer would be that we don't have that in our forecast There could be a tradeoff between the direct effects of lower taxes on income or higher expenditures on activity that would eliminate the need and probably tend to elevate long rates relative to what they are in our scenario   Yes It's an open question, of course, whether rates are now higher than they would otherwise be if there were not already considerable concern about the possibility of some significant enhancement in the size of the budget deficit So, it's a little [hard] to sort out what the effects would be; but I can envision circumstances, as you're suggesting, in which the bond markets would be adversely affected at least temporarily   I can't say that we have a lot of company in this projection There are some other forecasters who are looking for that kind of rate effect, but it is clearly not what is built into the market structure at this point There are always uncertainties about liquidity premiums in the term structure, but I don't think it's built into the market now nor is it necessarily clear that the forecasters generally are talking about this But it's interesting, I might note, that most private forecasters are anticipating flat or maybe even a slight upward tilt to long rates over the coming year or so A growth forecast of the dimensions we're showing here is also quite [common] so they're in essence saying that [a decline in long rates] isn't essential We're taking a bit more negative view of what the underlying strength of demand will be ex any effective fiscal stimulus, post-election surge in sentiment, or something   Possibly; it's hard to say Even before the employment report last week, having much the same information as we had, I sensed more positive expectations than we had For example, I attended a meeting of the technical [consultants] of the Business Council last Tuesday and the prevailing forecast--there was a slight lag in this, admittedly--was for growth more around 3 percent without interest rate declines and without a general expectation of significant fiscal stimulus   For 1993   Well, I guess it could be viewed that way in the context of a prevailing expectation now that some small amount of easing is going to be occurring, which might have a little negative effect on bond yields if the market were disappointed, all other things equal Basically, as we were putting this forecast together, my sense was that given the behavior of the Committee what we were forecasting seemed highly probable and that, unless you switched gears, some slight further easing would be consistent behavior We did not assume anything that we felt was really material to the basic thrust of the forecast As we indicated, we are thinking only of a small fractional further decline in the funds rate as being in the range that underlies this forecast If our story is right, most of the decline in long rates that we have projected would occur even if the funds rate were held at 3 percent But that's a conjecture Basically what I said in my briefing was that we have the expansion beginning to pick up gradually fairly soon If something is wrong in our analysis, the only logical conclusion we could draw in terms of policy implications is that more needs to be done if you want to do at least as well if not better than the forecast We're falling short of what the Committee's expectations were for economic activity as it stands, so that was the conclusion we reached   Well, I don't have anything new to add As we've noted in the past, there is possibly some measurement bias toward higher inflation than in truth is occurring That probably has prevailed for some time It could conceivably be getting worse, but that's even harder to judge The 1 to 1-1/2 percent inflation that I held out as a possibility sometime out toward the middle of the decade could be interpreted in light of the scientific evidence available as being essentially price stability So, if I were at DRI, I would probably title this a price stability forecast We are following a path very much akin to what we've outlined in the past Dave Stockton and his colleagues in briefings to the FOMC have indicated possible paths to price stability; and inadvertently in terms of what our forecast have been, we've been on that unemployment path for the last couple of years and our forecast continues on that path in essence We're on a gradual path back toward full employment in this forecast but it's far enough down the road that we'd be making a lot further progress on disinflation   Well, nothing obvious on nominal GDP--there may be some tricks of measuring here that would have an effect--but real GDP presumably is being underestimated But then so, too, is  -15-    10/6/92  potential GDP in some sense The benchmark I think you want to put an eye on here is capital resource utilization The unemployment rate isn't affected by any of these measurement issues and it has been trending upward in this recovery We expect it will be going up further, so there is room by that measure for the economy to grow faster; no matter how fast it is growing, it can grow faster than it has been   Indeed, and that may go back a considerable ways into postwar history   There is no material change, for example, from the last forecast to this one in terms of the path for the long-term rate Now, I think we've gradually come down over the past several forecasts In 1992 basically long-term rates have followed the path we charted at the beginning of the year It took a lot of short-term rate decline apparently [Laughter] and that is something that one might want to consider in terms of the prospects for achieving the further interest rate decline that we have forecast Whether we would be where we are now if we had not had those cuts in short-term rates is difficult to say On the one hand, we wouldn't have had the pull from those short rates punishing people who don't go out and invest at the long end On the other hand, we probably would have reduced aggregate demand to some extent and lowered inflation expectations and tended to lower nominal bond yields But we've been saying for some time that we expect the long rates to come down significantly over the forecast period   May I correct something I said? While the interest rate decline going out to 1994 is essentially the same amount as before, in light of the weaker economy over the next few quarters we've moved that decline up in time somewhat More of it occurs quickly So, on this forecast we have somewhere between 1/4 to 1/2 point more decline by next spring than before; then the rate flattens out more as the economy picks up   I've seen a few, but I think the more predominant notion is that the recent weakness in economic indicators just seems to make a compelling case in light of the past patterns of behavior of the Committee   We in essence have the real short-term rate moving back toward what might be regarded as more the equilibrium level in the longer run as we use up some of the slack in the economy to insure that aggregate demand doesn't overshoot a disinflation path Our assumption is that we have reached further in the direction of relatively low real short-term rates, below what would be sustainable in the long haul We have it coming back up some Another factor in this is that we are getting some extra retardation in a sense in the financial sphere now from the credit crunch and other experiences in the financial system As those ease, some adjustment in the nominal market and real market rates would be called for in order to exert adequate restraint on aggregate demand   Well, we're thinking of this more in terms of a link from real interest rates to spending decisions And there's a whole dynamic here of activity and resource utilization and inflation; the inflation results do affect expectations about future inflation That gets built into the bond yields and so on   But I think it's not a sustainable relationship here to have inflation running at 2 or 3 percent and inflation expectations remaining at 4 or 5 percent Something has to give Either those inflation expectations will prove such a serious impediment to lower wage agreements and provide some momentum somewhere in the price system that we won't get the disinflation we have [forecast] or, as experience builds that the norm is not the 5 or 6 percent inflation we've experienced over the last two decades but 3 percent or 2 percent, there's going to be an adjustment The experience to date suggests that the brute force effect of slack in the system has been able to overcome any stickiness in this inflation expectation that's evident in the consumer surveys or even many professional economists forecasts Indeed, we pointed out over the past year that it didn't appear that the private economists were generally expecting inflation to come down further in the latter part of this year or 1993 I've seen a shift in that I think there is more movement in our direction We're still a bit ahead of the average in our expectation about the disinflation progress, but there is a change Some of you have noted that businessmen increasingly are thinking that they are going to have to do their planning in a pricing environment that is going to be more consistent with lower inflation   Well, I will confess that we never did, [at least] on the straight P* form--though there are elements of the P* model that are very much consistent with our models That is, the output gap there is the critical lever in lowering inflation, and that is equivalent to the aggregate model we're using Obviously, the money growth numbers don't argue against our forecast; they argue for an even more rapid deceleration of prices And if you believe that money is behaving in a normal way, then I guess you'd want to argue that we grossly [over]stated where the inflation rate is going to be in 1993-94   You might think about whether it makes sense! "
4650,1992-11-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   Mr Chairman, I might note that I heard an oil company economist last week cite figures that ran something like this About a year ago, there was a mix of oil rigs in the mid-400s and gas rigs in the mid-300s; now that has flipped So it's about the same    11/17/92  overall level but the mix has shifted toward gas with those firmer prices "
4686,1992-12-22," I don't want to venture a political judgment, but--   I can't argue with the direction of what you're saying It would look like reduced budget deficits That might be favorable for the financial markets but they would also perceive the cost-push and worry about it translating, unless monetary policy were very restrictive, into ongoing higher inflation So, it's hard to say how that would net out as a bond market shock   I think so I'm not sure what kinds of changes you're assuming, but if they are mandated health care, mandated expenditures on training--though I gather there may be some signs of a backing away from that--they would enter the cost structure one way or another and tend to be passed through   Incidentally, the [revised] third-quarter GDP number is 34 percent Maybe there was something; I don't know If there was, we missed it, obviously Another possibility is that all those quarterly numbers will be revised in ways that will alter our perception of where we went wrong To be sure, we are trying to forecast numbers that are consistent with the current scheme of estimation, but there is an erratic quality in this One wonders whether the fourth quarter of last year was as low and then the first quarter as high, and so on, or whether there are some flaws in the numbers We pointed out that at this point through the first three quarters of the year--at least before today's revision--there was a somewhat puzzling, growing discrepancy between the income and expenditure sides of the accounts All of these things I think you need to recognize as the [unintelligible] pattern of errors But I don't know what magic forecasting tool we missed I will remind folks that in May or June you were presented with an analysis of how we had disregarded the information from M2 It suggested that our forecast should have been revised down to 1-1/2 percent for the third quarter and for the fourth quarter So, M2 at that point wasn't the missing forecasting tool, at least applied the way that particular model presented it I just don't know what it was   Well, let me say two things One is that after having lowered the real short-term rate, even stability means that the time profile of growth rates of GDP will show a bulge and then will come back down as the level effect peters out The growth rate effect disappears and becomes negative But we've added on to that a rise in nominal short-term rates in 1994 plus the further modest deceleration of prices, which enhances the increase in real rates And, yes, the rise in real interest rates in 1994 is a factor in this forecast   Just to be clear on why we've done what we've done Obviously, we need to make some decision about what assumption to base the forecast on In this case we're making some judgment about where the Committee desires the economy to head Starting with one rather simple observation, which is that real short-term rates now are very low and lower than we think would be consistent with some steady state, and secondly that the other financial restraints in the system will presumably diminish over time as capital positions of financial intermediaries improve and so on, it seemed to us that at some point the short-term rate should go up We could have postponed that until beyond 1994, but in our assessment of the trends in the economy that ran the risk of overshooting going out into 1995--hitting full employment and tending to head through it and thus reversing the disinflation process We could fine-tune this, but that is the basic sense of what is behind the interest rate outlook   Well, the reduction in inflation was less than the nominal interest rate change We notionally put in about 3/4 of a percentage point increase in the nominal federal funds rate The disinflation at that point is progressing at several tenths per year So, it's a small element in this rise in real rates    12/22/92   Our notion is that, yes, there are natural equilibration processes in the system With adequate monetary expansion, there are corrective mechanisms through the price system that ultimately push the system back toward [equilibrium] But those take time; and it's rather hard for us to define this in terms of some monetary path, given the uncertainties   I'd like to establish that in the past the Federal Reserve has shied away from enunciating a view about potential GDP growth, remaining agnostic and being prepared presumably to accommodate any positive surprise If the positive surprise on nominal GDP could be discerned to be a favorable supply shock, then accommodating it would be a more natural thing to do than if you felt it was a demand shock which tightened up markets and had inflationary consequences down the road But viewing nominal GDP targeting as your basic approach takes some things as given, as being relatively stable You may view this [approach] as a way of having an automatic stabilizer over time so that it would be natural to react if you're overshooting, with the thought that you would end up with some price pressures later [if you don't react] "
4726,1993-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll give you a second to locate the chart package that was put in front of you  MESSRS PRELL, TRUMAN, and SLIFMAN [Statements--see Appendix]   Well, there are longer-term movements one can observe I think manufacturers have made particular progress over time in reducing materials and work-in-process But basically our assessment is that inventories are probably at comfortable to lean levels at this point Retailers reported stronger-than-expected sales coming out of the Christmas season, which suggests their inventories probably are in good shape And manufacturers' inventories would seem quite likely to be rather lean in light of the volume of shipments reported in December   Not really As I've said, we don't have a large increase We just perceive that with sales seemingly on a clearly upward path, [business firms] are going to want to stay closer to that trend in their [inventory] stocking Even so, as we indicated, we    2/2-3/93 -6-  still allowed for some downward tilt in the inventory/sales ratio While the arithmetic of the current quarter is such that it looks like inventories are a significant story, looking at the broader picture we don't really see that as a key driver in the forecast   Well, at this stage we'd probably see a large share of that showing up in employment growth One is hard pressed at this time to pin down what the productivity trends are But I think at this stage, given the shedding of labor that has occurred, we'd expect to see a larger proportion show up in actual employment    2/2-3/93  increases I'm not sure whether you're talking employment hours versus numbers of workers   Again, we'd expect it to show up to a greater extent in numbers of workers rather than a lengthening of the workweek   That's the thrust of my remarks I'm sure there is still some elasticity in many cases and they could [increase production] without adding more workers But I think we are getting closer to that margin here and, on the presumption that additional growth is demand driven rather than an increase of potential supply, we'd look for additional hiring   Well, we're making some inferences here We don't have any information about [their assumptions for] food or energy prices But it seems unlikely, given the general tenor of [developments] in those markets, that that would be a major factor We've been seeing this pattern for some time At this time in 1992 I think one would have perceived a difference in outlooks And we feel somewhat vindicated by events, which showed in fact that we could have some decent growth with the disinflation trend continuing Some of my colleagues have suggested that this pattern is one that could be perceived in private forecasts over a number of years That is, at this point in a cycle, during the early expansion phase of a recovery, forecasters have tended to expect an acceleration [in inflation] Our interpretation of history, some of which is visible in the chart, is that that is not an empirical regularity; indeed, with significant slack the tendency is for inflation to slow It is something of a mystery why we're at odds with so many of these forecasters   Well, to a first approximation that may work here The Treasury bill rate in the fourth quarter of 1994 in the Blue Chip average is 4-1/2 percent, which is more than a point higher  -8-    2/2-3/93  than our forecast And there is a similar picture in the inflation [outlook] So, yes, I think that may come out fairly close   Well, let me emphasize that in a broad historical perspective those numbers don't constitute bad productivity performance Those numbers are stronger than the trends in recent years and would be above what we would regard as the likely underlying trend at this time Basically, the typical pattern is that in early phases of recovery we get very large productivity increases as some stretching of the available work force occurs This time we had a lot of labor shedding and we haven't had even the normal employment gains And we think this process will only go so far before, harking back to President Boehne's question, [firms] begin to have to add some workers as they expand production As I noted, there's probably some distance to go in this labor shedding process--not so much for typical cyclical reasons but because there are some large firms who probably have the capital to hang in there for a long time and not make the adjustments they should have made a long time ago in the size of their operations I think firms like Sears or IBM are going to be shedding workers for a while That is an ingredient in the process that gives us what we believe to be above-trend productivity increases   Well, that becomes a difficult question One, we would expect the unemployment rate, as a first approximation, probably to be 1/2 percentage point lower at the end of a year--   Indeed, as I noted before, I'm taking this [greater strength] as a surprise that comes more from the demand side And one does need to specify that to be clear If it were entirely from productivity performance and we were accommodating, then it would not have any inflationary consequences   A 1/2 percentage point lower unemployment rate would give us a shade more inflationary pressure, but it wouldn't show up very much in 1993 given the normal lags in the process The other risk, though, is what I alluded to before Growth of 4 percent begins  -9-    2/2-3/93  to be a noticeably faster pace of expansion, where perhaps one needs to worry a bit more about so-called speed effects And that might intensify the inflationary pressures relative to what I just said So it could quite possibly be a situation in which there is little, if any, further progress in disinflation in 1993, especially if that growth came early on and we were getting a rapid drop in unemployment   Well, in an accounting sense the implicit deflator came in much lower than we expected Relative to the fixed weight price index, that was largely a consequence of the behavior of service import prices This is an artifact of the way they deflate the insurance payments In fact, we have some information that suggests that all of those price measures may be off by a few tenths due to an error that [BEA] made in their import price measures But that still would leave a considerably lower number than we were anticipating   Well, not on this divergence necessarily, but it's hard to say If there are vastly different inventory movements or credit movements than they've anticipated, it could alter these numbers significantly   For one, we don't have the December trade data yet, so anything in this area is open to substantial change We've received a number of pieces of data since BEA published the fourth quarter, including the durable goods figures and the construction figures Doing a sort of full accounting, adding up all of these things, we come out very close at this point to our Greenbook estimate of 36 percent So, it isn't a material difference from what BEA has at this point; we'll just have to wait and see what the additional data show   Could I add a point that Don and I have discussed many times? One thing you want to remember is that our money numbers are conditioned on our forecast The members' forecasts for nominal GDP are a bit higher than the ones that were built into this, which easily could add a fraction of a percent to what you might want to anticipate for M2 growth   I think Don has covered the point We've always been uncertain; the concept itself is not airtight But even in estimating it, one has to [allow for] some considerable range either with the potential output concept or the NAIRU But I think the two are working in opposite directions, as Don suggested For one, we may be getting faster expansion of potential output currently but there are many displaced workers And experience suggests--from the churning we saw in the first half of the 1980s in the manufacturing sector when the dollar appreciated so much and we had what seemed to be a lot of restructuring in manufacturing--that displaced workers take some considerable length of time to find their way back into jobs One can see the likelihood of some of this happening again That may be one of the reasons some private analysts seem to have this worse inflation/output tradeoff in the short run I wouldn't want to push that far, but I think there is the risk that this structural element in the unemployment situation now might be a little greater and that we have effectively less room to run in terms of reduction in unemployment before we get those labor market pressures The markets for particular skills that are useful in this automated environment-- people who can do the programming and so on--may be relatively tight We can see some of the dispersion in recent wage numbers   I don't have any inside information on this at all; I know only what I've read in the newspapers My presumption has been, for what it's worth, that if there is an investment tax credit it will probably be a permanent feature That's more consistent with the longer-run growth strategy that was outlined during the [election] campaign That has some implication for how big the bang would be in the very short run And we've assumed that on the infrastructure what they still seem to be talking about probably would also be more than a one-time shot, but in what magnitude I don't know We've assumed that would be folded in and just overwhelmed in terms of the deficit effects by the other things in due course "
4743,1993-02-18," I think it's this year  SPEAKER(?) The end of this year, I think   Well, obviously, the [programs] get phased in, but it's a conjecture It's the same sort of conjecture that's involved in why interest rates are declining now in anticipation As I have pointed out [in the past], you can make the same arguments that people expect their disposable incomes to be lower in future years and you could pull forward an expenditure depressant effect on consumption expenditures So, I think it's very hard--   [The difference is] not very large   Well, they've made the incremental tax credit temporary That means you could get a considerable tax credit; you could get a lot of bang from moving forward investment that would have occurred later But that's probably more a '94 effect since [firms] have until the end of '94   Well, one way of looking at the argument is that what brings the real rate down is the anticipation of weaker aggregate demand down the road That's one possible explanation If it were all an inflation expectation story, then the real rate wouldn't be adjusting as much and we'd get less bang from this anticipatory effect But--  SPEAKER(?) Mike, did you run this through your model?   One can only do that artificially because our model doesn't have this kind of anticipatory structure But we have run simulations that just arbitrarily lower long-term rates I might be able to put my finger on something, in fact "
4767,1993-03-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, not in specific detail But I think we have seen some improvement overall in margins over the past year or so There are still some sectors, though, where it has been very difficult--in some of the materials areas particularly, where prices have been soft and there has been a lot of discounting Now, we've seen circumstances where there has been some pressure put on capacity Firms are looking for price increases and in some instances getting them; steel is a clear example The steel industry has had extra help from our trade policies, but their bookings have been very strong and have stretched out some months They've had some price increases already that have stuck and they are looking for more And there are a few other places But it does seem to be only here and there that    3/23/93  we're really seeing much happening among materials prices Lumber is another obvious example Again, there are special supply stories More broadly, though, there is still considerable slack And we see some industries, chemicals and so on, that are still pretty hard pressed in terms of widening margins   You've asked a complicated question I might observe that there were times when our interest rate forecast was even lower for this period into 1993 than it was, say, at the time of the last meeting We got worn down a bit by the fact that the markets weren't responding to all that good news the way we thought they should be, so we tempered our [rate] decline somewhat I guess our notion involves two things One is the view that inflation would remain lower than the market was anticipating And that seems to have been the theme recently As was noted earlier, the market seems to have sloughed off the recent bad news on the price measures and still sustains this view that inflation, at least for some period of time, will be lower than the market seemed to have been worrying about earlier The other element in our thinking was that simply holding down short-term rates as we've assumed--it's not a prediction but simply a conditioned assumption in our forecast--would tend to pull down the long-term rates One explanation of the dynamics of the recent market movements that wasn't given a few minutes ago--well, I think there was some hint of it--is this People are simply growing impatient with the low yields they're getting; they're reaching for current income, and this gives us an inexorable pull on the long-term rates It took a bit of a psychological breakthrough, I think, to get us into the current zone Over recent years something in the low 7 percent area had been a floor to rates People had not adjusted their thinking to bonds possibly being a good buy at 7 percent or less, but we seem to have broken through that [barrier] recently And what we're anticipating going forward is that inflation still will be on the low side of expectations, that people will become more hopeful that the economy is not going to bound back up to high inflation rates, and that this persistence of low short-term rates will continue to push [investors] out on the yield curve We have only a mild further decline in long rates, though Our models, which I noted before seem to have performed quite well over time, now are again fairly well aligned with where bond rates are and would suggest that  -10-    3/23/93  we could still get a very large decline as people respond adaptively to the kind of news that we think there is going to be   Well, there may be some element of truth to that In fact, one story that we've heard is that the change in the perception about the likelihood of the Fed tightening over the next year has provided the bond markets with some encouragement   Indeed I think the other story about the fear of Fed tightening was consistent with the view that as soon as the cycle begins to show some substantial growth in the economy, we're going to have inflation picking up and the Fed will then respond to that So, these things do fit together But there are many strains that aren't entirely consistent   Indeed   Well, the difference in forecasted real growth is not a vast one between the two The rise in nominal short rates in the Blue Chip is offset to a significant degree by the acceleration of prices in assessing what their real short-term rate path is So, their real short rate path may not be vastly different from what we have in the forecast The differences may be less than meets the eye in terms of an underlying sense of what the determination of aggregate demand will be in this period--real activity  -11-    3/23/93   What we've noted before and we've hinted at recently is that we're not at all sure, given the kind of disinflation movement we anticipate, that this level of the funds rate is really sustainable all the way through 1994 This level implies a relatively low real rate, perhaps one that is not sustainable; and we think it's more likely that we'll see the rate higher rather than lower in 1994 and that there may be a need for some tightening as we look out beyond 1994 The other side of this is, of course, that there is going to be a clearer negative fiscal impetus as we move into 1995 and some of the pent-up demands will have been satisfied and so on It may be a little early to get particularly far out on a limb in predicting where interest rates will have to go, but our notion is that the movement is likely to be upward by 1995 and that perhaps there will be a need to move before then   Well, I think you're saying if things turn out stronger than--   Right I think what we saw for a while in the latter half of last year was stronger growth and very strong productivity and not much sign of any real deterioration in the price trends But we've gotten a bit of a pop in early 1993 What we see at this point is some evidence that inflation expectations really are currently higher than what we anticipated the outcome would be In a sense we may have to fight against that to push the inflation rate lower But if things turn out stronger, I think it will create not only a lower unemployment rate--less slack in that kind of Phillips curve argument for higher inflation--but it may also create a psychological environment in which pricing behavior becomes a bit more aggressive This is in a sense the speed effect that we've talked about, simply that the rapid growth may create some additional pressure That may be what we've seen in the deterioration recently We really did have a pickup and that may have given us a little of that Unemployment was coming down relatively rapidly   Real GDP "
4790,1993-05-18," [Statement--see Appendix] Thank you, Mr Chairman I apologize for the unusual length   Well, as I noted, we're trying to understand why things have been going the way they have Certainly, supply conditions [are] a possible explanation That was something that was at least in our minds as we were doing this But basically the bigger driver in this was simply a recognition that the trends had not been developing as we had anticipated and were carrying through higher levels of inflation throughout and moderating somewhat further the tradeoff; in a sense, we were getting less bang for the unemployment [buck] from here on But it's very much a level adjustment that is involved here   Nothing more than what I suggested It's not going to [unintelligible] a separate matter from the tradeoff if you feel that in effect the NAIRU has been raised It is simply that the gap is small--   The tradeoff could be affected if the expectations formation process is different than the backward-looking version that's inherent in a simple Phillips curve model But again,  -11-    5/18/93  it's hard to say whether that's a level adjustment we're making or a tradeoff adjustment We simply tried to recognize the tendencies we've seen and to be a shade less optimistic, going forward, about the tradeoff between unemployment and disinflation These are rather small adjustments in a sense   Well, we think it's probable that weather chipped a bit off of the first-quarter growth We could see some disruption, some temporary loss at least, of output in industrial production But I don't see a correlation between those output losses and the price pressures I see it certainly in vegetable prices Clearly, agricultural commodities have been affected by the weather and we see it in their prices But I don't think the steel price increases that were referred to earlier and the medical services price increases recently had any significant weather element So, while it's a nice simple conceptual analysis to say ""Well, we reduced the supply and the prices went up,"" I really don't think that was what has accounted for the uptick in the inflation trend   Well, in the overall CPI it was an element recently But we're really focusing on the core CPI, recognizing that within a few months we should move back to normal supplies of fruits and vegetables and then the price level of food should return to the basic trend So, this is not a significant element in our analysis   Indeed Overall inflation undoubtedly is important as well as the core in determining peoples' expectations about the future, or what they perceive to be acceptable increases in wages, and so on But I don't think weather is the story here   But clearly we have had an exchange rate movement and slack in the Japanese economy Both of those things have tended to boost the prices of Japanese automobiles and have provided an umbrella for domestic manufacturers They started off the year with relatively generous incentives that held down the seasonally adjusted prices They've been able to take those off; they raised a few list prices And I think this is certainly influenced by the developments in the foreign exchange market As the Chairman noted, in steel there has been a marked reduction in imports and there has been considerable pressure on supply in some parts of the steel market There is some uncertainty about whether that's going to persist in the coming months Of course, this will depend in part on decisions that are made about protectionist measures Basically, the improvement in profits has largely conformed to the typical pattern of profits moving up with an acceleration in activity and a related jump in productivity I assume we've had a rather typical cyclical pattern in that respect   Well, on net, there probably has not been a very great influence to date The Japanese automobiles are one story, but exchange rates against other currencies haven't been adverse So, overall import prices have not been rising very rapidly at all In fact, for the first quarter, non-oil import prices are estimated to have declined So I don't think to date that we've seen, overall, a major unfavorable impact from import prices In particular areas it has been a factor   I think we all recognize the dangers of pegging nominal interest rates It is not an automatic stabilizer And if the pattern has been relatively stable, it has been because of various offsetting factors I would say that coming into the first quarter we initially expected growth in the high 2 percent area for the quarter with a lower inflation path As things have turned out, we may yet approach that real forecast but the price numbers clearly have been unfavorable Going forward, you are correct that--as we noted in a footnote in the Greenbook--in essence the higher inflation trend and what we would take probably to be somewhat higher short-run inflation expectations than we had been expecting earlier do imply a somewhat lower real short-term interest rate The question is whether at that level we are providing sufficient stimulus to offset the fiscal drag and other drags in the system now Or perhaps, on the other side, is this excessive monetary stimulus? As has been noted, we don't see it in terms of rapid money growth on average We don't see it yet in terms of rapid nominal GDP growth But in due course it's conceivable that we would see that this [policy] was excessively stimulative Our sense has certainly been that as we move along there would likely be some tendency for the real short-term interest rate to rise But we do have to recognize that at least out through 1994, if this fiscal program is adopted, there is going to be a very large tax increase and a very substantial amount of fiscal drag So the point at which this becomes an unsustainable real short-term rate may not be imminent; it may be some time down the road At least that's the implication of our analysis   The simple analysis might lead you to expect lower real interest rates But if you believe that inflation expectations are based on either some primitive notion of how deficits cause inflation or a more sophisticated one about the risks of future [monetization] then, yes, we could get also some narrowing of the inflation premium In either case we would have had some offset from the beneficial anticipatory effects of the fiscal action We think those are probably already behind us, but I'm not sure Back to the question that Bill addressed earlier, what could happen here would be an important, pleasant surprise that would be a big boost for the bond market At this point, I think people recognize that there's a budget resolution out there with which they have to contend Most likely [Congress] will do something that at least nominally meets those requirements No one, I think, is anticipating a vastly larger or vastly smaller deficit reduction than is currently being discussed  -14-    5/18/93   Well, as I should remind everyone, our presumption has been that even if this were legislated by sometime in 1994 the phase-in would be long and the effects within our projection period would be almost solely those based on expectations Our presumption would be that an increase in mandated costs relating to payrolls would be passed on only gradually to the workers in the form of lower wages and that the hit would be primarily on the price side in the short run   Well, that depends on whether monetary policy accommodates that kind of supply-side shock Clearly, the monetary policy response to that, as it would be to any other jump in exogenous forces, is critical But if this provided opportunities for much larger consumption of medical services to people, there presumably would be some offset on the demand side   I don't think I can give you any useful sectoral breakdown On your question of the long-term versus short-term expectations, could you repeat that one for me?   Our indicators of long-run expectations are rather volatile from month to month and my sense is that in general they haven't moved much recently They came down some earlier in the recovery, but recently I don't think there is a particularly discernible trend The Michigan Survey has bounced around in the 5 percent neighborhood A survey that is a successor to the Hoey Survey shows a similar pattern, except that it's more in the 4 percent neighborhood, but I don't discern a big change there On the short- term side, what is notable is that we have not had any consistent further lowering and there's perhaps a little firming if one wants to read it very finely But basically it has been a rather stable picture even as we got into the 3 percent CPI increase area for two years That's the impression I have  Let me go back to Governor Lindsey's question I suppose in general if people felt that they were more secure because this program offered them particular long-term care and some other safeguards against their wealth being depleted, then we could have in a sense a wealth effect that could be positive for consumption in the short term apart from the fact that the cost of medical services for some part of the population might have been lowered "
4817,1993-07-06," I don't think it's clear that the product is that much different from the perception of the investor; it's how he is really using it Transactions, turnover kinds of measures, are not particularly high Indeed, they are for many people a substitute for a time deposit or a very dormant kind of savings account as opposed to a transaction vehicle Transactions are clumsy out of the mutual funds that have capital gains and losses because of the complicated tax accounting one has to do if nothing else I don't think there is strong evidence that these are liquidity so much as investment holdings   Thank you, Mr Chairman We've distributed to all of you a package of charts labeled ""Staff Presentation to the FOMC"" [Statements--see Appendix]   For political correctness reasons, it's now called ""workers'"" compensation I knew it would cause confusion I was tempted to say ""workmen's"" compensation, but I didn't!   I guess in the abstract I don't view this speed effect as relating to the kind of phenomenon I think you're talking about The effect should in essence wash out over the course of the cycle as you get back to the same unemployment rate level You've gotten the bad part on one side and the good part on the other side of that cyclical movement But I suspect what has been more at work over the postwar period has been a gradual, and at some points maybe not so gradual, escalation of inflation expectations, which have gotten rather deeply embedded and have not been reversed from cycle to cycle And as we attempted to move the economy back to higher levels of employment through macro policy, taken as a sort of base is this higher level of inflation expectations We don't seem to be headed into this pattern this time where over a long period of time now there has been a lower inflation I think we've made some progress in lowering inflation expectations from what prevailed a decade or a decade and a half ago I think such expectations are the more critical element probably in this movement to higher inflation levels from cycle to cycle But I don't think we've really investigated things in that particular cyclical context   Obviously, the nomenclature here has misled you This is the cash flow burden of owning a home How much the monthly payment on a home is relative to disposable income What we plotted here is a new home, constant quality price measure, and a current fixed-rate mortgage So, this is what it would cost to buy a home today, setting aside issues of the down payment And the down payment, as I noted, seems to be a big hurdle for a large segment of the population, particularly the younger group; relative wages have not worked to their advantage in recent years If you're looking at debt service burdens in general--   We've seen a significant decline in those burdens over the course of the last few years; debt has grown less rapidly, interest rates have come down, and refinancing opportunities have opened up We're not expecting quite that rate of improvement but there may be some room for that in our forecast largely through the rollover of debt into lower rate loans Debt growth in this forecast is certainly keeping pace with income in the household sector   Well, it's certainly back down a considerable way relative to the mid-1980s To go back much further than that we can look at the table in the Greenbook, page 11-2   As you can see, we're still above, by at least a small margin, the levels that we had through the '60s and '70s   My colleagues can correct me, but I think mechanically as one conceives of this model it will wash out as we move back to the initial level of unemployment Now, there could be problems that arise as inflation expectations build so that a dynamic process is created here that works against us But in terms of just isolating this conceptually, it should be no net effect   That is very hard to judge and even difficult to characterize in our forecast because the sacrifice ratio is a sort of net effect observed ex post Ex ante one can think about what the slack effect in the model should be and then one can parcel all these things out Our past experience is, as we noted, that in the first stage of this disinflation we seemed to be getting unusually good tradeoffs It was well below the traditional two-to-one rule of thumb In the recent period, we've been getting either nothing or very little, depending on how one dates this On average, it hasn't been much of a departure from our rough rule of thumb But, indeed, this may be a reflection of the speed effects, which worked favorably through at least a good part of 1992 as unemployment was rising It has been working against us more recently   Well, that is probably one of the elements of the stickiness of inflation expectations that we've seen I think we're clearly a long way from breaking through that barrier   Well, I seriously doubt it, given that we're looking at some annual numbers over a long period of time I don't think that would have a great [effect]  -12-    7/6-7/93   You're looking at the middle panel, the scatter diagram?   Yes   I'm sorry That really is poorly labeled It is 30-odd years of data; it goes from 1960 to 1992   I hope we calculated it correctly! [Laughter]   Yes   Yes, we can provide you with a longer time series   The computer prices have been falling fast for so long that if we stretched this back--at least going back to the '70s-- I think we'd probably still have a pretty steep drop   Yes, it may be more in recent years   Yes, we've used the ECI here   Well, undoubtedly, you [have to] go back to a period when interest rates were moving sharply enough to have significantly moved this  -13-    7/6-7/93   Certainly, this would be the case going back several years before this, but I don't have data going back much earlier   I can't answer that  SPEAKER(?) Fudge!   I have a chart on the growth rate of the cost of capital and it clearly has been falling on average since the beginning of the 1980s expansion There were a few periods when there was some increase but we have seen a significant decline over time It is faster in this period than it was earlier by a significant margin   That's right As I understand it, BLS does not like to use seasonally adjusted sub-components unless at a more detailed level there are indications of seasonality in them If they can't find it at the very detailed level, they won't do it for that major sub-component of the CPI And most of this residual seasonality appears to be in the not seasonally adjusted components of the index   No, it's an aggregation of seasonally adjusted components   One of the things BLS has pointed out and which gave us pause--we thought about this some months ago in terms of whether we should expect something--is that it is hard to find at a detailed level a consistent pattern in recent years Certain commodity groups were behaving in a way that suggested there was a seasonal problem One year it was one thing and another year it was another, and that gave us pause But the accumulation of evidence now certainly shows, at least at a statistical level, that there's something going on there As I said, it doesn't explain everything The best you can get out of this is that the pattern this year looks much like the pattern last year   The question is Why [isn't] the pattern this year better than the pattern last year, given the ongoing slack in the economy?   Certainly When they pass [some legislation], then we can do something similar Let me just say--   Part of the problem here--I touched upon this in my comments a few minutes ago and unfortunately we didn't emphasize this in the write-up in the Greenbook--is that this is not all of the deficit reduction that is occurring in essence   This is more or less the mandatory spending and the tax changes that are in the package   The ceilings on discretionary spending would have required significant cuts That is where, for example, the defense cuts are coming in   Well, we hope it's relevant and not throwing people off   We've looked at that And our finding, tentative though it may be, is that it probably doesn't have significant implications for the deflator There are different indexes used for some things and different seasonal adjustments It's not clear that this feeds through in an obvious way to the GDP number   Well, we've talked many times, at least to the staff, about differences in the seasonal pattern for food, for example, where they have used seasonal factors that were sufficient to alter the picture of the PCE deflator from what one would think [looking at] the CPI There are also different weights, too, in some of these things So, it really is hard to translate   Discerning flash points is difficult Certainly, a level of 85 percent is a very high level, and any time we've been in that area I think we've been in a period of significant inflation People have declared lower levels of capacity utilization to be flash points We're not sure that's a particularly robust result In our forecast I don't think we get into the zone where, unless we're getting some speed effects as well, this is particularly worrisome You're right, though The more open the economy is, the more [important] the cost of transportation or the lower relative value of the products and so on, [and] we're going to have more of a potential role from foreign supplies in the market The question is on what terms And exchange rate developments, obviously, would affect what the price pressures--or the depressing price pressures--would be from foreign capacity But, indeed, currently in our forecast there is ample capacity abroad We think the exchange rate movement will be favorable in this regard, so it removes still further the concerns that industrial capacity limits are going to be a major source of inflationary pressure   It's a complicated question; I'm not sure I can give a good answer I'm not sure that the perception is that we've reached a secular low in inflation, though I find it hard to argue with that I certainly think there was a notion that with a growing economy we probably had reached a cyclical low in inflation Now, it may be that many people thought we'd never go below 3 percent; I don't have a basis for judging that, but maybe that's true   Everybody is operating in an environment of uncertainty, and people get to a point where they are satisfied if they can make a gain that's worth the transaction cost A household may indeed feel that if they knew or really were convinced that interest rates were going to go down another point in the next three months, they'd hold off But not knowing for sure and having seen rates come down a good deal, they see they can make a saving They also see that some have refinanced a couple or even three times, so they haven't foreclosed that possibility Corporations may be in the same boat; a corporate finance officer knows he can lock in a reduction in the coupon on his long-term debt and doesn't want to be criticized for having missed that opportunity if rates back up He'd have to be very certain at some point that the rates were going to go down still further not to go ahead and jump If you look at bond  -18-    7/6-7/93  issuance over the years, it seems to be motivated as much by the movement in rates as by the level And that, I think, would correspond to this kind of logic, at least to an extent   On taxes, I guess it's plausible to assert that people feel that the bottom in the marginal tax rates may have been reached a few years ago How that is affecting the various decisions at this point isn't entirely clear It presumably affects decisions about capital structure and so on There is a wide range of things that could be affecting [decisions] As I suggested, it's probably the notion that taxes are headed up, including possible taxes relating to medical care This whole situation is probably making many people feel poorer than they did a year ago So, there are a lot of things going on here which may relate to the kinds of perceptions that you're talking about   Sure, in various ways And as I said, one of the things that has disinclined us to follow the models to significantly lower inflation rates over the next year or so, which would seem to be implied by an unemployment rate near 7 percent, is the notion that it may be difficult to get those inflation expectations to move down to the 3 percent rate of inflation that we've observed over the past few years We seem to be a long ways from that point Now, if there was something that suddenly brought a collapse in expectations, then I think we could have a much better result more growth or less inflation, or both   We did some investigation of the ECI I don't remember the numbers but it smoothed things out some but still left some acceleration on the double seasonal adjustment   A tenth or so per month It's not a great deal at this point   This is a quarter in which we are getting the advantage of this, but I don't think month by month there's a big effect  -19-    7/6-7/93   I don't have anything to contribute to the debate!   That's right   Right   Mr Chairman, may I just interrupt to answer a question? Our guess is that the core CPI is depressed by half a tenth in June   Yes, but that's not total budget, that's--   Right, those programs--   It's hard to look at the recent period, which has been concerning all of us, and [say that] if strong credibility had been established--if there were absolute credibility that we would bring things back quickly into line--people would have discounted the recent signs of inflationary pressure So, despite a long period now,  -49-    7/6-7/93  the evidence of our having gained a lot [of credibility] in affecting this tradeoff is pretty limited "
4843,1993-08-17," I always thought being audible got me into more trouble! I thought the example set by Mr Volcker and Mr Corrigan might be the one I should follow, but I'll try to follow my colleagues' example this morning Having asked the Committee to endure a very long presentation last month I shall be quite brief this morning [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think we had some discussion of this in the Greenbook Pinning down the amount of the leasing transactions with consumers is a little difficult There is some survey evidence that we're aware of that suggests that perhaps a quarter of the consumer car sales have leases And that does seem to have been the way that the major manufacturers have gone as a substitute to some degree for the kind of price shaving they previously had done--rebates and other techniques Clearly, they've been trying to firm up their    8/17/93  margins One step was to diminish the flow of cars going through the rental companies that come back as nearly new and are perceived as fairly close substitutes for the new cars That was partly a response to a general rise in retail demand, which meant they didn't have to sell the cars on concessionary terms [nor did] the rental car companies If demand remains on the uptrend we think we're seeing, and with the Japanese car prices likely to be under even more pressure than we might have anticipated in light of the further appreciation of the yen, there may be some further tightening up of that market, with some firming of prices either through less aggressive residual valuations on the leases or through other devices But I don't think we have that good an insight into what trick they're going to use   Well, they seem to have maintained incentives They've broadened them recently We don't think they are as deep or quite so broad as we've seen at the end of some other model year clearance periods because the stocks are pretty [low] So, we might enter the new year with less overhang of prior year models The ""end of year"" has gotten a bit vaguer We see new models coming out at different times of the year; and in the case of Chrysler, one of the reasons they're pushing so hard now is that they're going to be bringing out new models at the end of this year, sort of a '94-1/2 [model] So, there's a lot going on here Our sense is that there is a more moderate level of promotional activity going on than there was [at the same time] a year or two ago And that trend will probably persist for some period   Well, to be honest I can't give you a neat accounting on this We didn't perceive that the outcome was drastically different from what we've been assuming previously The major change was the smaller energy tax than we'd been anticipating We thought they'd come out somewhere between the House and the Senate [bills] and [in fact] there wasn't any concession [to the lower Senate version] [Unintelligible] reduction number they moved them to full    8/17/93  retro-activity for 1993 Other changes were quite minor And as we noted last time, the baseline from which we were measuring that tax deficit reduction last time isn't the same as the accounting that was going on here We perceived [the reduction] to be rather heavily on the revenue side A good bit of the indicated expenditure cut is attributable to the cumulative effects of the lower deficit on interest costs I suppose it's legitimate--it's an expenditure--but whether it's a high powered expenditure or not is another matter But we perceived that it's enough on the tax side and there's enough of a case to be made that the GDP aggregate demand effects of tax increases may be somewhat less than expenditure cuts to suggest that the damping effect on economic activity would be less than if they had gone as far as some had advocated on the expenditure side But we still see it as a substantial fiscal contraction, depending on how one looks at this-- liabilities or cash basis and so on It's either a tremendous restraint in 1994 or a substantial restraint in '93 and again in '94 So, we're looking at the consumption behavior and so on, and we would allocate some of that restraint to 1993   I don't think there is a lot of that in this There is obviously still talk of doing some things in terms of grazing fees and mining and so on; those aren't big dollars But, no, I don't think there is much of that in here   Mr Chairman, might I just add something? An earlier comment--the comment about the medical expenses--raises an interesting point One of the major savings on the mandatory spending side is the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid costs Economically one would anticipate a lot of cost shifting here, which might call into question exactly how one wants to view the quality of this expenditure reduction There are also some user fees, things like the FCC auction expectations and so on; but I think that medical cost issue is a very big one, looking back   A fellow named Hotchkis, his former colleague, does it It's a little below 4 percent   Well, there's a 5-year and a 10-year rate; they are both in the same ball park "
4867,1993-09-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix   Well, I think you hypothesized a situation in which the consequences are obviously explosive If you held short- term rates too low for too long, initially through this term structure mechanism lowering the cost of capital below the equilibrium rate in the intermediate- and long-term end, you would generate excess demand and inflationary pressures Those inflationary pressures would mount over time Something would have to give; presumably at some point monetary policy would have to adjust in the proper direction But one of the reasons I have reservations about the model is that in a sense it doesn't include a place for people to recognize where things are headed and to have a more forward-looking response The latter could introduce an inflation premium earlier on and tend to override what this model's formulation would suggest And perhaps because we didn't move into those patterns of behavior the model didn't have those kinds of experiences from which to estimate So, I grant that this likely has limitations If I didn't feel that, we presumably would have a significantly different kind of forecast But the one thing that gives me pause, as I suggested, is that this model has worked remarkably well in the past, even the past decade I noted that it was fitted over 1958 to 1983, and even during the 1980s when there has been an acute sensitivity to inflation risks and what had happened in the past, the model has tracked quite well Other versions of the model, with the same sort of formulation, [have also tracked quite well] So it has gone through some difficult times and I think it does capture one element of human behavior, its adaptive expectations formation as people become accustomed to given rate levels But I would agree with you that in the extreme it's likely to break down   Well, President Jordan, that's the kind of very complicated question that I'd have to have in writing a week in advance, I think, to be able to do justice in answering it I don't think I've absorbed all of the threads We do have, obviously, in our forecast for 1993 a substantially less favorable mix of output increase and inflation We've gotten much lower growth than we anticipated and inflation has been running somewhat higher Now, curiously, the unemployment rate has not been higher than we anticipated; it has been lower, and that needs to be taken into account as well Furthermore, looking at the revised national income account data and at both the actual growth and our estimate of the potential growth, the output gap we've estimated tentatively at this point is somewhat smaller than we thought, not larger The actual growth has been revised up more than our estimate of potential growth So, in a sense the gap here that is exerting disinflationary pressure isn't larger than you thought; it's probably smaller Furthermore, we had earlier in the year what we view to have been some response to the surge in activity We think that is unwinding now, but on net thus far this year I don't think it has been helpful  I would really have to review a lot of detail here to be able to give a better answer to your question, but I don't think our basic model, in the sense of how this works, has changed We've had a few surprises What I've suggested in regard to the current forecast is that we see some underlying confirmation here of the scheme that we've been applying in our forecasting And that has led us to be a little more confident that we can extend the disinflationary trend going forward And we think that if growth for '95 remained moderate and unemployment remained close to where we have it, there would be an ongoing disinflation But we have not seen quite the favorable tradeoff that we anticipated, and the slack has been a shade less on average thus far   Well, we don't think that has affected the tradeoffs here but, as you know, at the beginning of the year we didn't introduce a fiscal package because of the uncertainties Then we introduced one that included fiscal stimulus because we wanted to follow the President's lead on this Ultimately, there was no near- term fiscal stimulus in the package; in fact, it probably moved the restraint forward in time beyond what anyone would have anticipated earlier And we now have a substantial amount of fiscal restraint in the forecast damping aggregate demand but not affecting the unemployment/inflation tradeoff Well, there are some elements here, [such as] gasoline taxes; an excise tax impact in a sense gives you a short-run deterioration in the tradeoff And there are other things that have been going on and that could still happen that will tend to raise the price level in the short run relative to what everyone--   Well, there are two things one could say One is that monetary policy can't be adjusted to offset shocks such as a change in fiscal policy I don't think there's an economic basis for that statement There may be difficulty in doing that because we can't anticipate with precision what will be occurring without a shift in monetary policy and there are uncertainties also about what the effects of a monetary policy change will be So, all those uncertainties may lead you to think it might not be desirable to attempt to engage in fine-tuning Certainly the Committee over the recent decade or so has in one way or another repeatedly made the statement that it realizes it would be impossible to be fully effective in fine-tuning and that there would be some risks in attempting to do that  In terms of advocacy, I would view that statement more as a positive statement than a normative statement It simply says that if you wanted to achieve this growth path, it might require low real short-term interest rates for a longer span We didn't advocate that particular outcome That's clearly the Committee's decision to make [It's up to the Committee] to weigh the risks that might attend the policy movement or no policy movement here in terms of whether you might end up with less output or more inflation or whatever than you desire We're attempting to be as neutral as possible here by taking as our essential assumption that the nominal funds rate remains fixed We aren't advocating that necessarily; we were just taking that as a    9/23/93  baseline and giving you something you can adjust from based on whether you feel the risks are different or that the fundamentals are going to push things in the stronger or easier direction   We have a very marginal increase in September for PCE We see a pretty healthy gain in the third quarter because of the data already in hand Real consumer goods expenditures other than motor vehicles seem to be well above the level of the third quarter, and service expenditures were running very strong early in the summer So, we think we have the likelihood of a strong advance there We see a flattening out, and arithmetically that works in the direction of a more moderate increase in the fourth quarter But we are basing that on income trends and attitudes and all the other factors that one might look to in explaining the prospects for consumption expenditures  GOVERNOR GREENSPAN Governor Angell   Well, we've alluded to this problem in the last couple of Greenbooks and there has been a great deal more discussion about this in recent weeks in the press, some of it by investment banking firms such as Salomon Brothers who have been calling attention to this issue It appears that a large number of corporations are in serious risk of having major underfunding in their defined benefit pension plans with these kinds of investment returns They've been very optimistic in maintaining high expected returns, [ie] in the assumptions they've used for determining their contributions They're going to be under significant pressure to make those more realistic And we would expect that there will be upward pressure on that component of employment costs That is not likely to be a gigantic effect We don't really have a good enough handle on it to size this, but we feel there's probably something there that is of significance in buoying increases in benefit costs While other items may be coming down, the overall deceleration seems likely to be limited by this factor   I think it's possible It's also possible--I don't think we have much evidence, though I've asked a few businessmen whether they can perceive this--that people may not opt for early retirement to the degree that they have in recent years because they may have lowered their expectations about what their assets will earn in the way of income over their retirement years I don't think we can see anything yet in labor force participation data to support this notion, but things may work in that direction We may see some tendencies toward a little less of that 55 to 64 year old male retirement that we've seen recent years   I might have   Well, the numbers in terms of the unified budget are distorted by the year-to-year movements in deposit insurance, so that the drop, for example, from fiscal '93 to fiscal '94 excluding deposit insurance programs is on the order of $40 billion If we look at the NIPA budget deficit numbers, we're going to get something like an $80 to $90 billion reduction in that deficit over a two-year span with roughly constant levels of resource utilization If we look at the structural budget deficits, while the CBO numbers and the OMB numbers show a flattening out as we go out several years, in the near term there are a couple of years of fairly substantial reductions in    9/23/93  the structural deficit Our own measure of fiscal impetus, looking at discretionary components, indicates a significant movement in the direction of restraint I think the direction is pretty clear, but gauging the economic significance is always problematic We interpret things as suggesting that in this period going out through '94 and maybe well into '95 the direction of fiscal policy is one of significant restraint   No As I said, this is a very simple model; and a small upward movement is just going to begin a process of altering the moving average, which in our model reaches back several years So, it's not going to have a major effect I think you have to ask whether this model is something you want to rely on in reaching a judgment, though The other questions are how low the rates have to go in order to get the outcome you want and how fast do you want to get there? Do you want to be patient? If you believe that rates might [move] as the model is suggesting, is that quick enough for you? Would you rather accelerate the process by cutting rates further, knowing that ultimately you probably are going to have to reverse course more dramatically down the road in order to move real rate levels to something that is more appropriate in terms of the longer- run equilibrium? But a small adjustment, in terms of this model, is going to be essentially meaningless   Right   Okay, let me address a couple of things very briefly One is that, as we are gauging it now, we believe that a reasonable estimate of potential output growth at this time is perhaps a shade below 2-1/2 percent So, it's very close to the growth rate of output that we are projecting If that is so, then all other things equal, one would expect the unemployment rate to be reasonably stable There are short-run uncertainties about labor force participation If it remained on the weak side, then one might anticipate a lower unemployment rate If it rejuvenated suddenly, the unemployment rate could easily go higher I'd say, looking at various models, that there is a very slight upside risk on unemployment  As for the inflation forecast, basically we've had about 3-1/4 percent over the past year for the core CPI We see it edging down to just under 3 percent over the next year or so This is not out of line with various models we look at Some of them would give more deceleration and some less It is a bit less favorable than we had been hoping a year ago, say, or at least at the beginning of this year We remain concerned that there is a certain momentum here that is supplied by expectations, which still have not adjusted downward among households, that appear to be in the 3 percent area We think part of the disinflation process will be a gradual adaptation of expectations to that kind of inflation; but in the near term it tends to keep wage increases a little higher than they would otherwise be We think we're in a reasonable middle ground, given the uncertainties that we feel Based on the experience of the past year or so, we think it would be a little aggressive at this point to lower that forecast further   I would anticipate that if the inflation outcome is also similar to what we're forecasting, those inflation expectations would come down But you are correct--   What I'm saying is that as inflation has remained low expectations have been adjusting and they will continue to do so   Well, I can't speak to all of the experimentations done over the years on this In the current model, there is only a minimal role for inflation expectations in the term structure determination And it's in [the model in] an arcane fashion It is possible that such a model as you hypothesize might be serviceable, but I suspect that we have experimented enough that this formulation has proven more robust I think saying that this model is nonsensical and totally at odds with reality runs up against the point that it does contain some very basic notions that people have talked about theoretically for a long time, and it has worked But I don't want to push that too far   Indeed   Let me say a couple of things One is that a 5 percent long-term rate, with inflation moving below 3 percent and a short-term rate around 3 percent, still looks like a high long-term rate if you go back to the early 1960s Now, if that's what people were thinking, perhaps about 3 to 4 percent inflation for the next X years--they were probably thinking 1 or 2 percent [in real terms] which is not inconceivable--   But in that case you'd be looking maybe for a 4 percent long rate   Well, to take minor issue with that, I think that perhaps is embodied even in some of your recent comments about what has been happening with the way investors have been moving into the stock and bond funds I think it's very much compatible   Those people are not necessarily thinking in any precise way about what inflation will be doing over the next 10 years They're saying ""I just can't stay with these 3 percent rates forever"" They are saying here that maybe [rates] aren't going to go back up, and they shift out [of CDs and the like] The model doesn't precisely specify the psychology, but it's compatible   Well, cumulatively, it's conceivable that it's non-negligible A number of things have happened over recent years where we've had various mandates that have added to the cost of production in one way or another or circumscribed supply But whether those things have been increasing in size on a trajectory that means faster inflation in recent years is very hard to say   Prospectively the same thing would hold The big issue hanging out there clearly is health insurance And we have not made an assumption on that in this forecast, in part because we've not yet ventured beyond 1994 I grant that we need to before very long because of the necessities of monetary policy strategizing But I don't expect that a program will be in place before the end of 1994 And it is likely to be phased in over several years in terms of the various costs So, whether it will show up as a sudden large boost to costs isn't clear I'm reminded of another thing we had in our earlier forecast, based on some trial balloons or whatever, and we've taken it out, which is a minimum wage increase The kind of minimum wage increase that is being discussed is only going to have a very small effect if implemented in 1994, maybe one-tenth of a percent  -11-    9/23/93   It's partly that [such costs] aren't readily measurable in terms of their aggregate price effects A bunch of little things have come along, all of which may tend to increase costs and in some cases are perhaps affecting the willingness of employers to take on full-time workers and so on So, there are broad effects And one of the reasons we have this rather subdued view of aggregate demand going forward is the thought that there will be a continuing burden of worry in the business community and among households about what government mandates may do to them over the years "
4970,1993-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we have not assumed anything significant happening within 1994 We have the notion that things might start in that direction and then continue on gradually through 1995 I don't think the precise pattern is critical here Basically we've stretched our forecast horizon out through 1995 We would anticipate that as we move through 1995 into 1996, not knowing what will happen on important things like medical care and so on, there will be alleviation of some of the negative elements in the economic picture [at a time when] fiscal policy will no longer be exerting quite the drag it will through 1994 and perhaps into 1995 We expect that we will have worked our way further through the overhang of unoccupied commercial space and multifamily residences and so on and that by then there would be some assurance that foreign industrial activity will have picked up In general we think there may be an emerging stronger thrust to activity and that some tightening of policy may be called for in order to hold aggregate demand at a level that would be consistent with maintenance of some marginal slack in the system and thus the conditions that will promote some gradual further movement toward price stability This is in essence a matter of design, trying to capture at least in a rough way the objectives of the Committee over the intermediate term   I don't think there is a change in any fundamental way There are two things that we had in mind in this forecast One was we had to live for all practical purposes with the set of third-quarter data that existed Our suspicion was that that level of inventory investment in the third quarter was overstated by BEA They didn't have data for September, and that's why I focused some attention on that a couple of minutes ago As things turned out, it does appear to us, as best we can do the arithmetic--and this isn't easy--that there will likely be some downward revision to nonfarm inventory investment in the third quarter And we noted in a little subtle footnote in the Greenbook that using our best change approach, which addresses what the growth contribution of inventory investment would be, the numbers written on the green sheets are artificially high relative to our belief of what would be happening Basically we think that inventories are at reasonable levels now There are some sectors where they may be a bit lean, particularly at the manufacturing level We don't see large shortages; we don't see any real impulse coming here in the way of longer lead times and expectations of rising prices that would lead companies to want to stock up rapidly Essentially, with this adjustment we have inventory/sales ratios in the aggregate probably declining slightly over the forecast period And I think that's a continuation of the just-in-time modifications of inventory practices and so forth   Well, we're always constrained in terms of those level numbers but we don't think we have an exceptionally high rate of inventory accumulation here If some of those upside surprises that I suggested came about, those might be circumstances in which we might also get besides the extra final demands some greater inventory investment But we just don't see inventories as a tremendously dynamic element in the forecast; it contributes only a small fraction of a percentage point to GDP growth over the coming year   Yes, the BLS had a press conference this morning There are a number of changes that will be taking effect with the January household survey Some of these have to do in essence with concepts and the way various questions are asked and how the responses might be interpreted Others have to do simply with the mechanical procedure of the survey--the use of computers which will permit them to check out what the person in that household who has been in the survey in prior months had been saying; they have found that that sometimes alters the responses They've run this experiment now for the last year and they indicated this morning that the result of that experiment was that the unemployment rate they were getting for this overlap sample was 76 percent versus 71 percent on average for the regular series Whether this is a unique period of some sort that  -69-    11/16/93  might make this 1/2 point differential unrepresentative, one can't know for sure And there will be, I gather, a number of analyses of the difference issued over the coming year But it does appear that the methods they will be using will raise the measured rate of unemployment The question for us will be Is there any reason to assume anything other than that in essence the natural rate has risen 1/2 point and we just need to adjust our thinking, with due recognition of President Jordan's remarks, about what inflationary pressures might be implied by a given level of the unemployment rate   I don't believe so, and there's not going to be any endeavor to do historical revisions   Yes, and I'm sure [BEA] will be engaged in an educational effort But I suspect we'll have one confronting us, too, in February when we present the Humphrey-Hawkins report Now the public will be trying to educate us as to what we've missed all along   Presumably, if we were to adjust our forecast today, we would just tack 1/2 percentage point on there for lack of any alternative rationale  SPEAKER(?) Ouch!   Let me remind you that the change in the survey has not changed anything in the realities of the world It's a matter of how we understand them and perceive them  SPEAKER(?) Well, it's a political reality  SPEAKER(?) Yes it is "
4998,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, I think one could also note that because of the interpretation we made of what the System conference wanted in the way of an emphasis here we sort of set aside all the questions of what damage might be done in terms of the welfare lost from unanticipated inflation because people were not saving enough for their retirement There's a whole array of welfare costs that might go with high and unpredicted inflation So there's a whole other area to explore if one wanted to look for reasons one should be concerned about non-zero inflation   Well, we recognize that it's been very hard to establish, as it is on any macro issue, anything definitive out of this research But there were some analytical points that argue that low inflation could conceivably be better than no inflation We tried to experiment, but we also thought the mission was to try to put some empirical flesh on these analytical [bones] Some progress was made but we have to concede that the lack of certainty--  -3-    12/21/93   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the price performance this year relative to our expectation a year ago depends on which series you look at The GDP fixed weight price measure is now expected to be 3/10ths of a point higher than we expected for '93 a year ago So there are some crosscurrents in the price data There has been a modest--though we think significant in terms of whether it is consistent with out expectations of deceleration--slowing in core inflation over this past year We now are at a somewhat lower level of unemployment and a higher level, I think, of capacity utilization than we expected to be at this point We see in the compensation data, which we consider another important measure of some underlying costs trends, no really clear evidence of ongoing deceleration even over the course of the period when unemployment was higher than it is now So we are not perhaps as sanguine as we might have been before about the prospects for ongoing substantial deceleration as we move on out through 1994 We're re-calibrating some things as we move along here And we are looking at some different initial conditions than we expected to see as we enter [1994] Now, one could certainly argue from a variety of econometric models built on the Phillips curve--one you're not particularly fond of--that there could be more significant deceleration If you have a view, as some do in using this model, that NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent, we have a significant output gap; and normal rules of thumb would produce more deceleration in prices than we have On the other hand, I think there are many people who would say that the prospects aren't quite as rosy as we're forecasting them to be But our basic notion is that we think the most likely direction of the trend on inflation through 1994 will be downward   Well, there is going to be some significant competitive pressure from imports in a number of sectors of the economy, [though] not all sectors All sectors are not as susceptible to that influence in the same degree But as I noted, the import price prospect is one of the things that makes us hopeful that we can continue a downward [inflation] trend We have not had import price pressure over the last year This isn't an element that in our forecast is going to move in a [significantly] more favorable direction over 1994; if anything, the prospects might infer a less favorable contribution from the import price side But we're splitting hairs I think the picture is essentially the same and it doesn't really make a very big difference as we go forward in terms of the rate of deceleration   I think the major story here is the ongoing increase in the relative importance of computers, whose prices are decreasing at a very rapid rate   Well, they are different measures I think the deflator is not an optimal measure of prices but even broader measures of consumer prices are going to be affected by this computer pricing  SPEAKER(?) As a technical matter the computers have a much smaller weight in the CPI than in the deflator for gross domestic product So the weight of this one item, this fall in price, is small in the CPI and it's relatively large in the deflator   Well, I don't have a strong conviction about the likely magnitude or direction of revisions in GDP, the personal saving rate, or some of the other key variables and how we would look at the gap between potential and actual real output In the first half of this year, to be sure, there was some evidence from the income side of somewhat more rapid growth than was registered in the GDP numbers  -6-    12/21/93  But it isn't a night and day difference I don't think I would make a great deal of that at this point We are at least as leery about defining precisely the GDP gap as we are in looking at the unemployment gap It's a difficult number to construct So I don't think looking at anticipated revisions here would loom large in our thinking about the inflation risks  There has been some discussion, I might just note, of possible revisions in the industrial production measures and capacity utilization We may have stirred things up by indicating in our release--I guess it was a month ago--that in February we hope to be publishing annual revisions Some in the markets took this as an indication that we anticipated major changes At this time we don't really have a good fix on this and don't have a real predilection toward reducing or raising capacity utilization based on the evidence we've been able to process to this point So we're agnostic on this for now; we'll be looking at this in a couple of months   You're talking about the actual unified--   Yes, the receipts   No, in this case they don't I'm not sure I can give you a good answer off the cuff here We have put into this our forecast of the effects over '93 We have some modest differences with the OMB and CBO estimates We've been a little more conservative in the sense of allowing for a bit greater behavioral response, diminishing the income tax receipts that will accrue But in April we're expecting to see a substantially higher level of non-withheld income tax payments than we had in the 1993 second quarter And that's the key feature of the year-to-year movements in revenues apart from what is being generated simply by the ongoing increases in economic activity which are boosting both corporate and personal income For 1995 I'd have to look into that more closely I see a lesser gain from the second quarter to the second quarter in '95 than in '94, which seems reasonable to me But I can't be very specific at this point   Sure   Well, that isn't precisely how we're viewing it As things have progressed, we've moved a bit in the direction of thinking that there could be a larger effect in the first half of 1994 than we had initially allowed for We've made some shift in that direction Yes, it's true that a lot of people knew that tax increases were coming; they began to adjust their behavior at least in the timing of their income receipts in late 1992, which showed all those bonuses coming in then But looking at the behavior of consumption this year, one is hard pressed to discern any anticipatory effect And it's not entirely clear that everyone behaves totally rationally in terms of gauging their lifetime income stream and adjusting their expenditures quickly There probably will be a number of households that are going to be somewhat liquidity constrained at tax time And we're anticipating that there will be a disproportionate effect in the first half of 1994 as people really calculate and confront their tax bills   Mr Chairman, could I clarify something in my earlier response to President Jordan? Not only was the GDP fixed weight price index up more than we expected, the CPI and the core CPI both have risen more over this past year than we anticipated last December while the unemployment rate has been about 1/4 percentage point lower as we got more decline in unemployment for the output growth than we anticipated So I'd assert more strongly than I did before a broad consistency with the fundamental principle that applied in our forecast and continues to apply Thank you   I hope so   No, it's the employment report that is--   The 20th of January "
5027,1994-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman Peter and I will be referring to the chart package that's been placed in front of you [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes I wouldn't want to put too fine a point on any of the numbers, but we do go through a reasonably detailed exercise   You're trying to get inside the factory here I certainly will share with you our major numbers   I think one has to recognize that, when we get down to these levels of detail, there are potentially a whole lot of offsetting factors and we don't necessarily have strong convictions   I can share with the entire Committee in broad terms our expectations in this regard In personal income growth, we have a substantial step-up in regular salary disbursements Nonfarm proprietors' income is expected to rise somewhat more than in 1993, but it's not a dramatic change Wage and salary disbursements are muddled by all that income shifted into 1992 out of the first quarter of 1993 I would caution everyone that our expectation is that once again sometime during this year there will be a revision of the fourth-quarter income figures that will show at least some shifting from the first quarter Otherwise, we have a significant pickup in dividend income We've already seen some upward movement in that category in recent quarters; in fact, quite rapid in recent quarters    2/3-4/94  Also, we have an acceleration in personal interest income Again, we are beginning to see, as the rates have bottomed out, some firming in that category Otherwise, transfer payments will increase pretty much the same as last year   Beats me I just don't know   That's not in manufactured homes   Well, if they were including mobile homes, then that might be a quite plausible number Mobile homes run a quarter of a million a year, so if you tacked on 100,000 or 200,000 houses as prefabs or whatever, that third would be easily attainable I just don't know   I'll try to get more precise data   Well, I've never seen figures broken out that way I've seen it by age groups Are you suggesting that there is a financial impediment to--   No, I don't have any real insight   I've not seen them, but there are lots of data in this area; perhaps they have them at the Bureau of the Census   Well, I suspect that somehow there's a cell buried in the data that could address--  SPEAKER(?) There is a cell in the sample   I think we have about 3 percent for January   And 3 percent for the core   Yes Again, there's some uncertainty relating to the seasonal adjustment factors The latest word we received just a day or two ago is rather encouraging on how aggressive they may be in solving this problem   Well, we thought they were going to go a long way They may go even further, so that the seasonal adjustment problem will be largely eradicated   We thought that a couple of tenths ago! The tendency has been remarkable here I guess the conventional wisdom might be that at some point workers get tired of putting in that much overtime on a persisting basis They like it for a while because their paychecks are padded, which makes up for the lean times   The incentives at this point look very strong for an employer The additional worker means a batch of fixed-cost fringe benefits plus the perceived costs of hiring and possibly firing, including legal expenses Then on top of that they fear that some medical insurance costs might be imposed that they don't face now Our expectation is that the workweek is probably going to remain quite high But there's certainly a risk that it will shift back some and that we will see more of a slant toward employment growth   I don't see a very obvious asymmetry in the risks I might note that the CBO, using different techniques to some degree, arrived at the same numerical conclusion as our point estimate--24 percent I think in the Bluebook there was, as I recall, some reference to possible risks that one could perceive One possibility on the positive side is that the productivity trend is even stronger than we've anticipated, but offsetting that is the languishing labor force participation As I noted, whether we're going to get even the modest growth in the labor force that we've anticipated is a question mark So, I can point to risks on both sides and I think we feel comfortable that this is a workable basis for forecasting over the intermediate term  -10-    2/3-4/94   President Syron, I want to turn this around slightly and emphasize that we see significant external impacts on the domestic inflation Our econometric models do incorporate import prices through the aggregate demand channel Weak economies abroad mean demand for our exports is weak Other things equal, that tends to damp activity and inflation here So we think they're very important channels, as Peter was emphasizing If you look at those two factors, that pretty much captures it as best we can judge   Right   Well, two things are going to happen with tomorrow's numbers One is the introduction of the new survey of households Looking at the sample that they used and comparing it to the official unemployment rate, the experience of the past year would suggest that it was almost 5 different On top of that, these adjustments to the census introduce enlargements in the labor force and unemployment that add almost a tenth to the unemployment rate So, between the two of them the difference is somewhere between 5 and 6 For the purpose of our solicitation of your forecasts, we suggested a number that was rounded to 6 But this is, as I said, a very uncertain matter When they move to the full-size survey and there's more experience, we may find that the implicit differential may narrow And we'll never really have a very clear idea of whether  -11-    2/3-4/94  we have that nailed down after the fact because they won't be continuing a large parallel survey against the old questions   Except that we try to be sensitive to the objectives of the Committee, and so we are swayed The reason that we put the interest rate increase in, as I noted, was that we thought that at a minimum you folks had expressed a view that the inflation trend should be pointed down; we just have it pointed barely down   That was the instruction that went out to the Committee members, and I thought I would not try to read the minds of the Committee But let me just say--   Well, one possibility I can imagine is that Committee members may feel that there will be developments in food or energy prices that may obscure an underlying trend and that the underlying trend is better than these numbers may suggest But I don't know, and I didn't interrogate each person to find out exactly what his or her objective function is and what special factors may have played a role in these numbers   We didn't look at these numbers before we completed our forecast; in fact, we didn't have many of them before we completed the forecast When I looked at them a day or so ago, I said our assumption that the Committee might consider a baseline with just a slight down tilt in the inflation rate relevant to their discussion didn't seem to run head on into the forecasts you submitted So, I felt more comforted than anything else by this in terms of whether we were presenting to you a forecast that was generally in the ballpark you were thinking about   Well, our expectation is that as the financing gap of the nonfinancial corporate sector widens, as I indicated, there will be an increased need for credit by business firms and a considerable segment of that will be satisfied in the shorter-term markets, including bank loans We have only a rather moderate increase in bank credit You have a flow of funds forecast that portrays these flows In the household sector we're anticipating, as I said, that the growth in borrowing will exceed the growth in income We are anticipating that consumer credit will continue to grow fairly rapidly in the near term, but that it will trail off a bit as the intensity of demand for durables wanes Mortgage credit will continue to grow apace, in line with our forecast of residential construction activity Otherwise, we have the Federal government's borrowing requirements tailing off with the deficit, and State and local governments continue to borrow significant amounts of funds to support the investment that I referred to So, overall, we have debt growth running pretty much in line with nominal income  We don't see great strains developing over the next two years in this scenario We do see real interest rates increasing slightly, but at the long end we have nominal rates coming down a little in the near term and then backing up slightly and in general remaining close to their recent levels This is a rather mild experience compared to prior cycles Maybe that calls into question whether we've got this right, but we do see fiscal policy in an unusual contractionary mode That's one factor here, and it will be a while before the external sector is exerting a lot of positive force on the economy And with the pent-up demands probably relatively limited coming out of a mild recession, we think we'll work our way through those pretty rapidly; we've already gotten to a period of high-level housing activity We  -13-    2/3-4/94  don't think we're going to have to see sizable increases in interest rates in order to keep the economy on a growth path that is consistent with some slight downward pressure on inflation   Well, this was intended to be a topic for discussion   I think simply having the numbers may give some additional context to the discussion   Earlier this morning I had a brief discussion with a senior official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics The civilian unemployment rate for January was reported at 67 percent under the new survey They have two econometric models that they are using to try to give people some guidance about how the month-to-month movements in the unemployment rate might have looked if the new survey had been in place in December or if the old survey had remained in effect in January On the basis of their model of what the old survey would have done, they estimate that the unemployment rate would have dropped 01 percent in January Their model of what the new survey would have done is that it would have dropped 03 percent There is a considerable range; the household series is clearly subject to a lot of uncertainty There was a huge increase, 13 million, in the household employment total As I indicated, there are both the change in the new monthly survey plus an adjustment for a Census update involved here A rough guess is that, if you took out those two special effects, the month-to-month change might have been in the area of 150,000 or maybe a little higher, but that is a very crude guess at this point The labor force participation rate was 667; it had been 663 in December One might have expected an upward movement from the change in the survey of 1/2 percent or more And so on that basis it looks as if the labor force participation rate might have dropped and contributed to that decline in the unemployment rate, all other things equal Again, this is very difficult to read The nonfarm payroll increase was 62,000--72,000 for private industry--well below market expectations and below what we had been expecting for the near term Manufacturing was up 26,000 but construction was down 3,000 and private service-producing industries had an increase of 51,000 There were no large revisions to the prior couple of months  The Labor Department believes that weather had a serious effect on the payroll increases, particularly in construction They noted that in parts of the country that we wouldn't expect to be much affected by weather at this time of the year, construction was up, whereas in parts of the north central and eastern regions, where the weather ordinarily is very cold, they found that construction was down They also pointed to weakness in a number of other industry groups that they think might have been affected by weather, such as recreational amusement, and they mentioned that some colleges evidently had to cancel athletic events In their minds all these things evidently contributed to the low increase in payroll employment Now, this may also have affected the mix of full-time and part-time employment for the month The average workweek is estimated to have risen to 348 hours, a relatively very high workweek, from the 345 hours figure in December; that was revised down from 346 hours This does look fluky; we've seen ticks up to this level sometimes revised away a bit and in other cases just reversed So this rise may prove ephemeral The index for the overall increase in production hours went from 1252 to 1263 reflecting that workweek increase Actually, the way the arithmetic goes, they report the hours, then derive the average workweek But that's the better part of a  -41-    2/3-4/94  percentage point That's a much stronger start on the quarter than we had anticipated  Overall, taking all of these things into account, my reading of this would be that there are signs that perhaps the outlook is a bit stronger than we had anticipated in the Greenbook and would probably imply our leaning more toward raising our first-quarter GDP forecast rather than lowering it Given the very strong car sales that were reported yesterday, that gives some greater credibility to the production schedules for February and March That output will be needed to keep inventories from being utterly depleted even if sales don't maintain their January pace That, too, argues for some upside risk to the 4 percent GDP forecast we made  One final note on average hourly earnings They were up 7 in January Again, this may have been affected seriously by the shift in the industry mix and more importantly in all likelihood the shift in terms of part-time/full-time employment and so on So, I don't think one would want to read that number too closely either, but it certainly does look as if it's on the firm side of our expectations for the start of the quarter   I was just handed Commissioner Abrahams's statement and she indicates here that ""weather appears to have played a major role in the relatively small rise in payroll employment between December and January The reference week for the survey was the week before the California earthquake and the East coast snow and ice storms; the extreme cold over much of the nation during the reference week held down employment Indeed, the weakness in the payroll survey was quite concentrated in weather-sensitive industries in January, while other industries continued the pattern of moderate growth that has prevailed for some time"" And then she goes on to provide detail for some of these industries I guess the person I  -42-    2/3-4/94  talked to at BLS was reading from this or had written this! One other point I might make is that, looking at the manufacturing data, the workweek remained at its recent high level The workweek employment increase was in motor vehicles; outside of motor vehicles there wasn't any gain But overall this looks consistent with a moderate increase in industrial production That's even allowing for what we think would have been some loss during the month from the freeze and the earthquake I think the industrial production picture for January is at least as strong as we anticipated when we prepared the Greenbook forecast   The econometric model that they have used would have predicted that If I'm looking at the right place in the press release, it says ""Another tool that we are providing analysts is our model of what the January 1994 unemployment rate would have been under the old methods based on the historical relationships between employment, the unemployment rate, and other economic indicators that rate is 63 percent""   Well, that's the key element in my judgment that would probably raise the forecast But these numbers are all being affected by weather; evidently, we're going to have to sort through the data to get a more refined assessment   Mr Chairman, a possible answer may be that when we made some of those recent adjustments, we did emphasize their technical nature in response to some recent developments in the behavior of the aggregates, so there might be some feedback   You could greatly overstate these trends We are talking about $20 to $25 billion a year of net equity issuance, which is a very small part of the overall external financing activity in the economy So that isn't a major element of the financial flows at this point   But it's less so than a lot of the other transactions In fact, that one includes some cash, whereas most of the major transactions have just been stock or stock swaps So, indeed in our forecast we're assuming we're going to see some trickle of cash buyout transactions over the coming years because our sense is that the firms probably have gone a long way in adjusting their balance sheets and trying to get the mix that they will be comfortable with Our tax system, with an increase in corporate income tax rates, tilts even more in the direction of favoring debt than it did a year ago   Well, okay, I was just looking at the marginal taxes "
5045,1994-02-28," Well, I thought I was off the hook when you said it would be worthwhile waiting a couple of weeks, because, at this point, we find it very difficult to read the trends through the noise of the recent data Clearly, there have been some effects of weather on a variety of data series, which makes them very difficult to read One can't even tell how much of the labor market data is a fluke, for example, given the fact that the January surveys occurred during a week that was affected by bad weather And it appears we're going to get a repeat of that in February when there was bad weather in the survey week So, we don't know how representative that week is of the month But in any event, in brief summary, the consumer sector still seems to be reasonably firm The nonauto retail sales for January were not particularly impressive, but there were upward revisions in November and December, so we were at a fairly high level And while there's some question in some circles about the seasonal adjustment of the motor vehicle sales, all indications are that the motor vehicles sector is on very firm ground at this point in terms of demand We're also getting a substantial increase in production; this quarter appears likely to exceed what we had built into our forecast in the last Greenbook  In the residential sector, housing starts were down very sharply in January; permits were down less sharply but still fell appreciably In all likelihood, that was largely a weather effect and probably did not reflect a fundamental shortfall in demand from what we were anticipating would be the picture in the first half of this year These higher interest rates do raise a question that we'll have to address in our forecasting If they were to persist, it would imply mortgage rates significantly higher than we had in our prior forecast But if this is an environment in which expectations about the growth of the economy and employment prospects might be reasonably strong, then this shouldn't put a very great dent into residential construction going forward We would expect to see the January sales figures affected by the bad weather and the February picture again may be weaker because of bad weather    2/28/94  In the capital goods sector, the orders and shipments for January for nondefense capital goods were on the soft side--but not particularly so relative to what we would have expected in the wake of very big jumps in some volatile categories in December I think the trends there still are distinctly upward, and we perceive the equipment sector to be a very strong contributor to the overall growth of the economy at this point On the employment side, the initial claims have tended to be higher in recent weeks, and reading through our models, that would suggest that we're going to get another quite modest increase in payroll employment this week But that's a very shaky tool for estimating these things Industrial production was up 1/2 point in January; manufacturing activity was flat We think that was largely a loss of manufacturing due to bad weather offset to some degree by increased utility power generation that is holding up the overall index What indications we have to this point suggest that output in motor vehicle manufacturing and some other sectors is producing a decent gain in manufacturing activity in February Certainly, the anecdotal evidence--purchasing managers' surveys and so on--suggests that the manufacturing sector is remaining quite robust in the current quarter  Finally, on the inflation picture, the CPI was very good news, with a zero overall increase and up just 01 ex food and energy It was certainly below our expectations It was not a seasonal adjustment story because we had largely allowed for the change in the seasonal adjustment Could it mean that we are on a better overall trend? Perhaps, but I don't want to read too much into the one month Could it mean that in the short run we're not getting the so-called speed effect that we feared we might see in the aftermath of that surge in activity at the turn of the year? I guess it argues against that to some degree, but I would not rule out the possibility that we will see less favorable readings in the next few months Certainly, there are hints in the manufacturing sector that the pressure is on capacity, and some segments are leaning to some firmness in prices We see it in the materials prices for inputs reported by the manufacturing purchasing managers There's a sense of some greater pricing leverage but it's not pervasive We're inclined to think that the general news on pricing, along with the CPI figure, has been favorable, on balance So, at this point, we would guess the first- quarter GDP, in large part because of the weather effects, might be somewhat weaker than the 4 percent we forecast in the Greenbook and the increases in the overall CPI and core CPI also might be a little less than we had forecast   I think there are offsetting influences here What I'm suggesting is that the GDP growth probably will be weaker in the first quarter than we had forecast before The overall hours input--I don't know We have a very substantial increase in hours in January We're expecting to see the workweek retrace some of its increase and only a modest increase in payroll employment There is the possibility that this may be one of the downside risks    2/28/94  While we can't see it in the data yet, the disruptions may have shown up, effectively, as a weaker productivity and profits performance in the first quarter Certainly, there were many salaried workers who were paid but did not get to work in the eastern part of the country in January and February; so, that might suggest some weakening of productivity At this point we have a very hard time summing up these pieces   Right   Yes, and that's one of the difficulties in reading the recent data We don't know how much of the increase in initial claims might be just a very transitory weather effect or whether it means that we're actually getting a slower trend increase in employment One thing that argues against it being totally weather-related is the persistence of this sort of week-in and week- out being a little higher than before But there are certainly some weeks that one could identify as in all likelihood having been affected by the bad weather and the earthquake in January So, there's undoubtedly some weather element in these numbers "
5066,1994-03-22," Ted will begin   We switched   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, as I noted, I think we have provided a baseline against which you can apply your own objectives As I said, if you accepted the structure of our forecast but didn't accept the implied result for inflation, it would logically lead you to say that the monetary policy assumption made wasn't sufficiently stringent As to the strategy we applied, I think we could plausibly have read the forecasts that have been made and the statements that have been enunciated by members of this Committee as suggesting that we would have given you something useful if we had put in, in terms of our analysis, a tighter monetary policy and therefore a somewhat slower growth and lower inflation result over the next two years In the  -16-    3/22/94  present circumstance, I think we have put in a tightening of monetary policy that does not seem grossly at odds with the kinds of signals we pick up from statements that have been made and the degree of aggressiveness with which you've moved at this point We have given you an alternative that is perhaps more comparable to what many outside forecasts that you might look at embody at this point in terms of the increment to short rates That's a hard call to make It's hard to say what people are thinking just today  As to the changes in our forecasts over time, I think what happened basically is that we made some mistakes Sometimes we made mistakes, in a sense, in our policy assumptions; the Committee didn't do what we anticipated I would have to admit, too, that we have had some upside growth surprises over time But perhaps even more important, at certain junctures we didn't anticipate how much unemployment would decline for a given amount of growth And what we find ourselves with today is what we think is less slack than we might have anticipated in those earlier forecasts and less downward pressure on the inflation rate So we are not anticipating, without very sharp constraint on aggregate demand, that we'll get to the low 2 percent inflation range within the next year or so That was perhaps a complicated answer, but you've raised a whole bunch of questions   I think you've put your finger on what is a significant question and, if we had wrestled with it for a while longer, perhaps we might have come to a different conclusion You've highlighted the key point, and that is that we have taken seriously our view of what has happened recently--I mean the drop in unemployment--not seeing clear evidence that it is just a fluke And we essentially used this as a jumping off point in this Okun's Law assessment If one used a different jumping off point for that kind of simulation, it is arguable that perhaps the unemployment rate path could be a couple of tenths higher than what we have But this is always difficult It goes back to the very problem that I mentioned in responding to President Jordan's question It has proven very difficult in recent years to get a fix on that Okun's Law relationship and where we are in terms of cyclical or trend behavior of labor force participation in particular So I think there is a significant area of uncertainty in this whole relationship   No, I think this is separable But again, going into this deeply, one gets into questions of labor market structure and behavior It's not entirely separable from those features of the economic system that relate to how much pressure we get on wages and prices at given measured levels of unemployment   Well, all things equal, if we held to our assumption of the NAIRU of 6-1/2 percent or a shade less and we had unemployment at 68 percent, and looked at those numbers very, very finely, that would be enough slack, presumably, to give us some modest edging off in the inflation rate over the coming year or two   My life is flashing before me in the transcripts of the meetings that were released recently where we got into extended discussions of these sorts of hypothetical cases It's a fair question; it was back then, too [Laughter] I think we made some significant mistakes in our assessments of what the term structure would do a few years ago It depends, obviously, on what circumstance gave rise to that If it were in essence a decidedly greater degree of risk aversion on the part of investors who have been burned recently and are demanding a much larger term premium, all other things equal, it would make capital more costly to firms who wanted to buy equipment and so on And I think it would tend to damp aggregate economic activity relative to our current projection If it were a reflection of underlying stronger demands for capital based on higher expected returns, then I think in a sense it could be the bond market vigilantes keeping things under some control Whether on net we would have a higher GDP outcome or not, I don't know But it would be a different situation   I think 1/2 percentage point at the long end, even perhaps modifying the rather strong interest-sensitivities in our model, is non-negligible in terms of economic impact So I think we are talking about potentially a few tenths on GDP over the next year   Chairman Greenspan, could I inject a couple of points of clarification here?   One, for what it's worth, the level of GDP is about the same in this forecast as in the last As currently estimated, we got more growth in the fourth quarter than we anticipated and, in essence, the lower growth rates simply offset that surprise The second point is one of arithmetic on consumption in the first quarter We don't know what will happen in March; we don't even know for sure what happened in January and February at this point But in your calculation I think you were probably using the currently published estimates of real PCE for January   The retail sales revisions for January were dramatic, and they would substantially lower the number one gets doing the same February/March arithmetic So that's the key explanation for why we have as seemingly low a number as we have On the interest rate story, I think you did touch upon the various elements in our thinking, but you went a step further in describing what has happened, covering things we didn't say explicitly in the Greenbook You referred to the 120 basis point rise in long rates since October I guess basically we find it hard to believe that circumstances have changed in such a way as to raise intermediate- or long-term inflation expectations by anything approaching 120 basis points We don't find evidence in the surveys of that kind of movement; we don't see evidence in other asset prices and so on that really suggests that big a move But we don't rule out at all--I suggested this I think in my comments--the distinct likelihood that an elevation of inflation concerns did play a role in the recent backup of rates, particularly since early February Basically what we said is that, given our expectations about what kind of news will be coming forth over the next several months, there will be some allaying of those concerns,  -24-    3/22/94  and thus a part of the backing down in rates is due to some reduction in those inflation expectations "
5097,1994-04-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman The recent news we've received suggests that growth in real GDP in the first quarter probably was somewhere around 4 percent at an annual rate You will recall that that's where we were a couple of Greenbooks ago In the last Greenbook, on the news of the winter retardation, we had dipped down to 3-1/4 percent Some of the data that have come in have shown upward revisions, particularly the retail sales figures for January and February Those revisions, combined with the strong auto sales data for March, have moved our estimate of consumer expenditures growth in the first quarter up to about 4 percent The other major ingredient in our upward revision of the first quarter has been the incoming data on inventories which show that, at least through February, inventory accumulation was running considerably higher than we had previously anticipated At this juncture, we would expect to see a substantial contribution to GDP growth in the first quarter coming from nonfarm, non-auto inventory accumulation Obviously, there are many pieces of data still missing and some volatile components, including the trade data and the missing inventory data But at this juncture, the upward revision to our GDP forecast does not seem to put us out of line with the incoming evidence on employment or industrial production Our estimate of manufacturing output for the    4/18/94  first quarter is about 8 percent growth at an annual rate, and the payroll employment figure for March, showing a very sizable increase, puts the first-quarter average increase at about 200,000 workers a month, comparable to the fourth quarter of last year  As for the more recent indications, the level of initial claims in recent weeks and the scattered anecdotal evidence would suggest that labor demand has not slackened since the March survey Indeed, one hears--and I've seen this to some extent in the memos from the Reserve Banks relating to discount rate discussions--that there seem to be signs of some tightness here and there in the labor market and some scattered wage pressures Overall, there are no clear statistical signs of general wage or price acceleration yet The recent average hourly earnings and the PPI and CPI news were broadly in line with our expectations We think that maintaining the favorable trends on the price side will likely require a considerable deceleration of activity in the near term We don't have a whole lot of new evidence on the economy as it enters the second quarter We still anticipate a substantial drop-off on a seasonally adjusted basis in motor vehicle production, perhaps enough to subtract about 1-1/2 points from GDP growth in the second quarter That would reverse the comparable increment to production in the first quarter So that sets up a considerable swing from that sector But if demand does not fall off significantly, we're either going to see very tight inventories heading into the summer or increasing price pressures or some mixture of those two  In other sectors of the economy, we still think that there is a strong upward trend in producers' durable equipment We think that we're going to see some pickup in nonresidential construction after what seems to have been a weather-related downturn at the beginning of the year The residential housing sector will clearly warrant some close attention Our sense is that there will be a near-term rebound in housing starts, but we're anticipating that it will be more muted than we had projected earlier when we were looking at current and prospective interest rates in our forecast that were considerably lower than those now prevailing Mr Chairman, that concludes my remarks   Well, as I said, we still see in the near term the likelihood of a deceleration; perhaps I didn't state that clearly We think that there's enough of a swing in motor vehicle production that is not likely to be offset by other factors that we will get a slowing in the second quarter At this juncture, I wouldn't want to put too fine a point on this, but we don't see anything to move us very greatly from the 2 to 3 percent range of our last forecast for the second quarter Looking beyond this, I think the wealth effects and the cost of capital effects that will come from what now is a substantially higher level of longer-term interest rates than we had anticipated in our forecast would tend to offset any indications that consumers or others might be inclined to spend more aggressively than we had thought previously So, at this juncture, very tentatively, I wouldn't anticipate a substantially different outcome if I were to attempt to update our forecast through the end of the year "
5119,1994-05-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, clearly, I was trying to suggest that for someone who wanted to look for evidence that things were not going so well We do still regard these longer trends in the indexes as quite relevant to gauging the behavior or the direction of inflation Last year, to be sure, the spurt that we saw was, it appears now, considerably a matter of seasonal adjustment problems Looking back now, things don't appear quite so bad Our recent experience has been a shade better than we anticipated a few months ago The very latest data aren't any better than anticipated If there has been some good news recently, it's been on the labor cost side The employment cost index in the first quarter was considerably lower than we had anticipated, and in our view that sets the world right in a sense As you know, we had wondered a bit about why ECI increases had leveled out last year in the face of unemployment rates considerably higher than they are now, the substantial reduction in the current inflation, and to some degree in shorter-run inflation expectations So, we give some credence to those numbers and it has led us to trim a little off    5/17/94  our wage forecast or our total compensation forecast on the benefits side going forward And so we are reasonably comfortable that, if the economy follows the path we're talking about, the inflation trend will remain stable to perhaps a shade lower But I did want to highlight some risks and certainly to underscore our view that the room to maneuver here in terms of faster growth than we're projecting seems to us rather limited, if one really is concerned about inflation   Current CPI   Yes, for the total over recent months, we're doing somewhat better   Yes   Well, I can address this on two levels One is simply the arithmetic of plugging in the actual data that are now available in place of the assumptions that the BEA had made And this is primarily data that have changed on inventories, retail sales, and construction On net, those numbers would seem to chop a good percentage point off of the 26 percent GDP growth rate that was estimated initially Now, we're anticipating that some of the incoming data, particularly on trade, perhaps will come in better than BEA had assumed And ultimately, perhaps on the next round of revisions when there are some further changes, for example, in construction, we may get closer to the 26 percent So, notionally, in framing this forecast we've been thinking that GDP in the first quarter was probably a little less than the 26 percent, probably 2 percent plus rather than what the incoming data just mechanically would suggest And then we made an estimate of, in essence, the best change for the second quarter, and that's what gives us an estimate of something over 3 percent for the first half   Our working assumption is that, in the near term, potential output growth is about 2-1/2 percent I think one might take a more optimistic view of the underlying productivity trend-- assign more of the increase we've seen over the past few years to perhaps sustainable underlying trend growth, as opposed to the normal cyclical component But we think that's going out on a limb a bit at this point We've already assumed a considerable pickup in trend productivity growth from what we were experiencing prior to the 1990s On the labor force side, we haven't seen much lift yet in labor force participation and the population trends are very hard to read It's conceivable that the trend in labor force growth isn't even quite so strong as we've anticipated, which is not robust by historical standards We feel that the 2-1/2 percent potential is a reasonable working assumption We don't advocate that the Committee take that number as gospel and make its policies on that assumption and close its eyes to the incoming evidence But we think that's a reasonable estimate for now  I must say that, for example, in a recent Business Week article there was much talk about how the world was changing in terms of productivity growth, and I think high-tech investment is one of the elements in that story In quantitative terms, the net investment from that kind of equipment isn't very large because it's rather short-lived; it turns over relatively rapidly So the capital stock in that sense isn't growing very rapidly But if you believe that it is affording firms the opportunity to reorganize in major ways the way they do things and is really creating disproportionate efficiences in a sense, then I think you can make a case for stronger growth The other thing I found puzzling in that article was that it said because of all of this, one needn't worry so much about inflation And the key argument it made was that if there were pressures, firms would just ship production abroad Well, that's a rather puzzling argument It says basically that you can avoid inflation by sucking in imports, but that doesn't really enhance domestic economic growth in the GDP sense So, I think there's some loose thinking behind some of the more optimistic stories   Well, President Jordan, let me just say that we have no reason to think that this hasn't been a distinct improvement in the seasonal adjustment   Well, actually, the median generally has been running very close to the regular core inflation number over the past year They are almost identical on a 12-month basis But the key here is that I don't see on technical grounds a reason to be very concerned at this point that, in essence, the recent data have been overstating the degree of deceleration and that we're going to get a vast surprise later on simply because the adjustment in the seasonal factors has been overdone The methods seem to us to be reasonable We consulted with them during the process of their revisions, and don't believe that they really are missing significant residual seasonalities   Yes, but that's splitting hairs in terms of the measurement accuracy   Well, I think it's pretty close with the minor exception that I would suggest that, in terms of the inflation forecast, the behavior that we're predicting is not simply a function of expectations but also of our judgment that the output path producing the unemployment rate and capacity utilization rates leaves a modest amount of slack in the system So that force is tending to tamp down wage and price increases In terms of the risks in this outlook, they are so numerous and disparate that it's hard to know where to begin That isn't particularly different from any other forecast This may be one of the reasons why the markets seem so unsettled and volatile; and like many other forecasters we have a hard time, in light of the dramatic reversal of the bond market, judging where the equilibrium may be The market movements have been very fast and very large, and judging what the impact will be as we move forward several months or quarters is a very tricky business  As I suggested, there are considerable differences of opinion among private forecasters and we think they mirror some of these uncertainties On the one hand, there is a view that we are in the midst of what will be a dramatic and very well sustained capital spending boom that will interact in some sense on the trade side where we will be very competitive In that view, as these foreign economies pick up, we will see tremendous increases in exports, and this kind of lift will provide the income to support a healthy rate of consumer spending right on through 1995 On the other side, there are those who are beginning to find some hints of weakness here and there; they think the higher rates that we have, assuming they are sustained, will have an even more serious damping effect on the housing sector and that consumer demand will be damped not only by that but also by the effects of the tax increases beyond what we had anticipated They see that saving is already at a low level, that we've already seen increases in debt and probably will have more ahead, so consumers may feel more constrained down the road And certainly even with the recent better news there are those who are skeptical about how quickly the foreign economies will come on and thus what kind of impetus we'll be getting in the next few quarters from a diminished drag on the trade side So that's sort of a range of some of the thinking that I see, and there certainly are elements of risks in those directions in our view   Well, if I take the base as last October's low when the rate was about 58 percent, that's an increase of some 170 basis points, if I've done my arithmetic correctly I would judge that more than half of that is real That's a seat of the pants judgment and I can't point to any clear-cut analytical support for it I certainly see nothing in changes in inflation forecasts going out the short distance for which most professional forecasters' results are available; and nothing in the household surveys indicates that the longer-range inflation expectations have risen dramatically Looking at stock market behavior and trying to intuit something about what may have happened to the real returns that are built in there, I see a significant element that must have been real as opposed to inflation   In looking at the behavior in the housing market, as limited as the evidence is at this point, people have not on the evidence dismissed these higher rates as being simply a reflection of higher inflation in terms of what they might expect for their wages or for house prices going forward We wouldn't have seen as much effect as we have perhaps if there really had been that kind of inflammation of inflation expectations   Well, looking out over a 5- to 10-year span, I guess I would be more comfortable asserting that market expectations would be on the order of 4 percent inflation They could be a little lower, but that would leave the real rate a little lower than it has been   Indeed, that's one of the reasons, given our assumption that there will be at least mild fiscal restraint and that inflation expectations will be going down, I think there is a discernible downside risk to our bond yield forecast; we have it really not getting much below 7 percent by the latter half of 1995 "
5143,1994-07-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll give you all a second to locate the Chart package that was distributed to you [Statement--see Appendix]   We have tentatively indicated that next Monday, July 11, might give us ample time for completing the report and reassessing the members' forecasts   Do you mean in the longer-term trend in the workweek?   It's not apparently obvious in the very recent data, but our presumption is that eventually we will see that occur In the forecast, we have the workweek shortening in the near term from its very high recent level and not changing a great deal thereafter through the forecast period Our assumption is that perhaps there has been some interruption of the prior trend as companies may tend, particularly with fringe benefit costs being as considerable as they are and with the possibility of incurring costs to fire someone and so on, to keep the workweek a bit longer than we certainly were anticipating at the beginning of this year   It's a small factor There are a number of small factors we have taken account of in getting from the nonfarm business sector to GDP   The reference to financial restraint was intended to have a broader meaning, encompassing all interest rates and also the nonrate terms of lending As I noted in my presentation, we think that one ingredient in the current situation is a pretty substantial shift in credit availability from banks and, to some extent, other intermediaries That, in effect, has provided perhaps over the past year some significant incremental stimulus I wouldn't want to try to quantify it, but it has been in an expansive direction To your specific point, there are several things one needs to consider in thinking about the long-term path One that I referred to specifically in my remarks was the notion that there is a considerable liquidity premium, probably larger recently than it was earlier, in the term structure and that, under calmer conditions in the markets, one might expect that to diminish somewhat It's that in particular that I was referring to as a rationale for thinking that some rise in short-term rates would be necessary Now, getting to the broader cyclical dynamics of this, if the Fed did not tighten as assumed here under the conditions that we have perceived to be prevailing in the economy, at least two things I can think of might happen One is that so-called credibility might be diminished if there is a broadening perception that we are behind the curve at some point and that we are not exerting anti-inflationary restraint The inflation premium in rates might rise The other possibility is that it comes about more automatically in that we are too stimulative, aggregate demand is stronger, pressures arise ultimately in the economy which tend to push up rates, and if we didn't tighten at that phase, then we would be getting this inflation premium generated in the rates It's a complex issue   That might qualify me for elevation to a higher level position! [Laughter]   Well, there is no greater certainty attached to the relationships in this forecast as we perceive them than there was in the prior forecast The major changes were a result, I think, of changes primarily in so-called exogenous factors We have a higher  -15-    7/5-6/94  oil price; we have a lower dollar, with the likelihood of there being some greater pressure coming through import price channels and so on We also have a somewhat lower unemployment rate with all the adjustments we care to make that suggest that the economy is at a somewhat higher level of resource utilization and has more of a tendency to pass these kinds of shocks through to the general inflation rate We also had a stronger sense about this liquidity premium effect after we saw what happened when we announced our policy decision in May and the bond market rallied We took that as confirming what we had thought was going on All of these things led us to raise the short-term rate assumption, I'd say moderately, certainly relative to what seems to be built in in terms of market expectations, at least after 1994 We have rates peaking out at the end of this year, leveling out, whereas the market seems to anticipate further tightening Our judgment is that this will be enough to bring about the moderation in aggregate demand that we forecast   There are two questions that you've raised You're certainly correct that there's a symmetry here We have a slower growth rate in 1995 than the central tendency, and we have a higher unemployment rate I might note that we're sort of at the low end of the overall range for growth, and at the high end of the overall range for unemployment So there's certainly a consistency here We come out with an inflation rate well within the range I didn't think there was a great deal here fundamentally to make a point about--   If you don't tighten, the effects are likely to be very modest on inflation even through 1995 A difference of 100 basis points would have a fractional effect on the level of real GDP over that forecast period and a very small, almost imperceptible,  -16-    7/5-6/94  effect on inflation unless we get out of this some distinctly different kind of path for long rates than we have talked about That could throw in some additional variation in the outcome But basically, the 100 basis point increase in the funds rate would have a rather moderate effect on inflation   I think the prospect would be an only slightly perceptible upward tilt to the inflation rate rather than this flat path that we have, if you simply isolated in the standard way that 100 basis point difference in the funds rate But we also have been sensitive to these expectational considerations   I think our model, which is reasonably interest sensitive, and with the normal rather sluggish adjustment of long rates, which would be questionable, would show less than that over the course of 1995 But your order of magnitude would not be far off   It would depend on your objectives, short run and longer run I think there would be a significant inflation jolt in the short run Your policy dilemma would be to prevent that from tending to flow through into an ongoing inflation process where it had its initial price level impact but then perhaps got built into wage increases and broader inflationary expectations You would need to raise the unemployment rate substantially above the prior level that you thought acceptable in order to get you back on what you thought was an appropriate inflation path I think we would lay out the options in that way I think we'd have a hard time deciding exactly what forecast design to present to you We would probably work toward a compromise scenario that you could then assess to decide whether you wanted to be tighter or easier   The nominal GDP forecast is 3 of a percent higher in 1994 and 2 percent higher in 1995   So, you are going back to the January forecast?  -18-    7/5-6/94   Yes, I am sorry; we tried to make this comparable   Right The change in our assumption from the last Greenbook is 3/4 percentage point I regard all of this almost on the order of hair splitting given the uncertainties, but certainly we wrestled with it and it gives some meaningful indication of where we think things need to go   Yes   If policy accommodated it Certainly, if you held the funds rate, which is in an extremely accommodative posture in the face of that kind of shock, you would have astronomical GDP growth But let me note, for example, that there was a footnote in the Greenbook reporting on a partial simulation of an exchange rate shock I think it was about three times what we have in terms of the forecast change, but that's a reference point for you I think you would see it is in general terms consistent with the kind of adjustment that we have incorporated in this forecast   I would also note that in the last Greenbook, and in my presentation, we emphasized that we thought the risks were that it was going to take higher rates than our assumption rather than lower rates So in a sense, mentally, the adjustment isn't even quite the 3/4 percent that we made   Are you talking about the alternative simulation in the Bluebook or simply why we raised the assumption in the Greenbook forecast?   Well, as I said, I think the major consideration was how we could in essence cap the inflation rate close to where it has been in the face of these shocks Implicitly, also, I think we probably have incorporated a sense of a little stronger underlying aggregate demand We're not talking about a vast difference, but the real GDP path in this forecast is little changed from that in the last forecast   That's right   Basically what we have here with the dollar depreciation and the stronger growth abroad is more impetus coming through the external sector, which we have essentially offset through higher interest rate effects on domestic demand That's the simple version of the story here   You've served up such a softball here, I hate to reject it at all, but I am not sure whether in the greater cyclical scheme of things, I'd call 50 basis points or even a 100 basis points substantial Now, we're not talking about throwing the economy into recession, but looking back over time, I think, we have seen that it has frequently taken very large movements in short-term rates to achieve a major change in the direction of aggregate demand The other point I'd make is that, yes, the signal we hoped to convey was  -20-    7/5-6/94  some degree of conviction I wouldn't say definitely we're going to need to tighten, but we have some conviction that a significant movement in that direction was probably going to be needed to achieve the kind of outcome that we're talking about I must say I am a little surprised and quite interested in the results that you described from your staff's work because the numbers that we have been citing come from a model that tends to be one of the most highly interest-sensitive that we can find And so to get the result that you characterize is a bit surprising to me There may be a lot of other add factors and so on that are going on in this exercise   Mr Chairman, may I just follow-up on something I said to Governor Lindsey earlier, which may not have been the perfectly good answer, as President Hoenig's remark about oil prices and production reminds me Obviously, with the higher oil price, we could get some stimulus to domestic production that could be positive The other side is that to the extent that we are importing all of this oil, we have the so-called tax plus the shift in income, even to domestic owners of oil, from consumers which leaves a damping effect How we come out on nominal GDP, I think, is a very tricky empirical issue here But our simulations would still suggest that, if you wanted to avoid the blip in inflation, you would have to add restraint even beyond what you would get just automatically from this oil tax as it were, in order to have enough slack to even out all of that impulse on the price side   On nominal GDP, it could be a wash and certainly we have simulations that could produce that result   I have no quarrel with anything you said, Mr Chairman Indeed, it's a point that I have made many times, and I have convinced myself that I should be very leery about presenting these kinds of simulations If I don't buy the model in the baseline forecast, why should I buy the differentials literally? Now they are probably the best we can do systematically at this point because it's very hard to juggle all of these variables in a judgmental fashion and come up with a whole array of alternative simulations And we are trying to improve the model so we can have greater confidence I think the key question the Committee has to ask is whether it believes the baseline For example, those who feel that the NAIRU is much lower or that the true unemployment rate is lower relative to the NAIRU would have a different baseline path so that the most stimulative policy wouldn't necessarily yield higher inflation than we forecast It might be comparable to what we forecast Still, the point, I think, is that you only get a short-run benefit, and not a long-run benefit, if you feel that over time higher inflation has a negative implication for economic efficiency and productivity in the economy That, I think, is the key judgment you folks have to make  -41-    7/5-6/94   Mr Chairman, I think it's important to mention that if people anticipated this higher rate of inflation, we might not get this short-run output gain   At least that expectations might be shaped by something other than the experience of the past several years--   Well, it might, though, in tax terms The fact is that our tax system isn't fully indexed; the effective corporate tax rate rises as inflation goes up, and that would raise the cost of capital, reduce investment, and lower productivity over the very long run That, I think, is probably embodied in our current model And it's one of the things one would point to in estimating the losses over the long run with higher inflation There are other possibilities in terms of inefficiencies in the price mechanism's operation and so on that are not captured   It does not take, in terms of a normal simple cost of capital calculation, a very big inflation differential to get you a net loss in the present value in the long run   No [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) Don't keep us in the dark   The Post article carried an excerpt from the 1987 transcripts in which I said something to the effect that, given the lags of policy, we either should tighten or should ease, but I didn't know which [Laughter]   I have been trying so hard all these years not to get quoted in the press!   Exactly right [Laughter] "
5159,1994-07-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Joan, I think, touched upon most of the incoming data, so I won't repeat all of that except to draw a couple of implications The first is that in light, particularly, of the inventory investment numbers, it does seem to us more likely than not that the advance estimate of second-quarter GDP growth will exceed the 3-1/2 percent Greenbook forecast It may come out around 4 percent or perhaps even a little higher if the Commerce Department decides that they want to fill in the missing data in such a way as to close a bit more of the apparent gap between the expenditures side and the income or labor market side of the current picture Indeed, the labor market report that we got in June confirmed our expectations about the increase in private production worker hours And with the slight changes in prior months and so on, this came out tilted more toward payroll increases, rather than the workweek, and thus it was an impressive set of numbers    7/20/94  Looking at the near-term outlook, we are inclined not to view the very rapid accumulation of inventories as implying the need for any significant adjustment of orders and production Inventory-sales ratios have not gotten far out of line and we hear no anecdotal evidence that there are major inventory imbalances Indeed, I'd even be inclined to question whether we got quite the degree of inventory accumulation that is indicated by the current data, just as I might also be a little suspicious of the sluggishness of retail sales, at least to the degree that is in the data Be that as it may, there is no evidence in the labor market at this point--for example, in the unemployment insurance data--that there's any production adjustment going on And so, while the higher-than-expected level of inventory investment in the second quarter would seem to suggest that we're going to get a more negative swing in the third quarter than we anticipated in the last Greenbook, we'd expect to be making a rather moderate downward revision of our third-quarter GPD growth forecast at this point  On the wage and price side, there hasn't been a great deal of news Average hourly earnings certainly did not indicate any acceleration of wages The incoming CPI data were, on balance, quite close to our expectations So we don't see any major innovation there The unemployment rate in June was lower than we anticipated, and in that sense the labor market looks perhaps a bit tighter and heightens the risks a little as we go forward At the same time, though, our interpretation of those data in part is that the difference between the old and new surveys may not be even the third of a point that we had in the last Greenbook forecast Where we're sitting relative to our central tendency of our NAIRU guesses is not appreciably different from what it was in the Greenbook So, we're pretty much where we were before on the near-term inflation outlook   The wholesale inventory accumulation in May was very widespread across the durable goods sector, which at this point we wouldn't regard as very worrisome Given the orders trends and backlogs that have been developing and so on, I don't think there is any indication that they've done anything more than move back into line after a period in which the inventory-sales ratio dipped for whatever reason On the retail side, the accumulation in May was particularly marked outside of the auto sector; in general merchandise that could be connected to the sluggishness of retail sales Again, though, I don't think the level of the inventory-sales ratio is particularly worrisome overall But the general merchandise area does bear some watching as we get additional data for June   Nothing of significance "
5182,1994-08-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   No, I don't have information on that It's very clear the ratio of starts to permits for the single-family sector is extended well beyond the norm Given the better statistical reliability of the permits series, I think that this argues pretty strongly for starts likely to have been less robust than this report suggests But we had a level of single-family starts for this quarter in the forecast that would still be below any reasonable adjustment, I think, of that single-family starts rate   I think it's a reasonably balanced forecast, given my suspicion that inventory investment in the second quarter may have been overstated But I wouldn't want to make too big a point of that The May figures held up very well; they were raised in the    8/16/94  revised figures To date, there hasn't been any evidence there But we have, in essence, carried through a slightly higher level of the inventory/sales ratio, that having been achieved in the second quarter We do not have a significant movement; the ratio begins to trail off very slightly in the latter part of 1995 In a sense, at that point we are beginning to get a little improvement in final sales and we begin to see the hint of a restoration of what we think is the secular downward trend in the overall ratio We have anticipated in this forecast that the adjustment in stock levels relative to sales trends is going to occur in the distribution sector, particularly retailing We have allowed in effect for a substantial degree of manufacturing inventory accumulation, which is the area where we might have anticipated the upside risk to have existed because of the tightening in supplies and some of the pressures on prices of materials and so on Certainly, no inventory forecast is without its risks, but I think in this case the balance is not distinctly on one side or the other We really are not uncomfortable in that respect   A compound question here, I think   No   Let me try to be helpful with a few, brief comments I think if we had to do the single-family housing construction forecast again today, we would still have in essence the kind of pattern we have, with some further erosion of single-family housing construction in the near term and then some firming over the course of 1995--the levels in the two years being pretty comparable and quite decent by historical standards A fairly high level of existing home sales is also likely over that period We have seen very strong sales of appliances and furniture Even through July, the retail sales report shows considerable strength there We would expect to see some ebbing of that strength and some deceleration in non-motor vehicle consumer durables outlays over the coming quarters At the same time, we think we've reached a rather low level relative to the plausible trend in motor vehicle sales, in good part because of the shortage of some of the more popular models We see a substantial ramping up of production going on currently and we are anticipating that sales will move up significantly in the next few months, and then we have a slight upcreep during 1995 with the continued moderate growth of income and employment Our sense is that there probably is still some element of pent-up demand in the motor vehicles sector, just looking at what has happened to the stock of cars relative to the number of households and the aging in the stock and so on Our forecast for next year, at just a little over 15 million for light  -4-    8/16/94  vehicle sales, is certainly not high by the standards that we see in private forecasts and certainly not relative to the hopes of the automobile industry I think they will have the capacity to supply that many cars and this is not an extraordinarily high level of durables expenditure overall relative to income or GDP In fact, it's rather moderate in that sense So I think there is a reasonable rationale for this path   Well, we have at least 59 varieties of, or is it 57, I don't know, [Laughter]--57 varieties The number has crept up over the years, of econometric models So, we probably can encompass a pretty wide range of outcomes, given the conditioning assumptions of the degree of slack in labor and product markets, the acceleration or deceleration in activity, the signs we have seen of materials' cost rising, the implications of exchange rate changes for import prices, and so on Our models have not done that poorly in capturing the general trend of things Our analysis is that we are generally in the ball park of the natural rate, I think our forecast looks quite plausible We have sort of a stabilization of the core inflation rate One could say that there might be some offsetting influences here of abatement of the speed effects and the pressures on materials prices that we've had recently and some of the shifts in the influence of the exchange rate I think this is not hard to justify at all in terms of a pretty wide variety of econometric models, but a significant element of judgment has gone into this As I indicated, we simply do perceive a leveling out of things that have occurred in the last several months, the last few quarters We foresee a generally stable labor market and level of industrial capacity utilization if the economy slackens as we have forecast And so the broad macro conditions are sort of stable in this picture   I think you probably cited one period in which we could find it in the 1980s, but I'd have to reexamine that record I'm not sure what precedent one would look for What we are anticipating in this forecast is a moderation of economic expansion that extends this cyclical upswing with inflation not picking up at all We think that the implied real rates of interest, given the kind of inflation expectations that presumably could prevail in 1995 with    8/16/94  the continuation of 3 percent inflation, are fairly ample by historical standards Even with the nominal rate decline we have, these real rates might be regarded as generous by historical standards Some might say it poses the possibility of a downside risk We think that there is probably still an element of extra liquidity premium in the market--some trepidation on the part of investors People who had been throwing money into bond mutual funds with abandon until a few months ago are perhaps a little more cautious now I think we can get a combination of some reduction in the inflation premium and some reduction in the liquidity premium that is probably still embedded in the long rates The yield curve would still have an upward slope of some significance and certainly wouldn't look strange in that regard   I suppose I should have thought ahead to this kind of question; it comes up frequently I don't really have any clearcut answer jumping into my mind at this point I think there are risks that one could identify in every sector and I could identify them as having potential on both the upside and downside So I don't think there is any key number here On the inflation--sort of the Phillips curve--side of things given the outlook path, we certainly are somewhat at sea still about what the unemployment rate truly is right now There is still, because of the change of surveys, an unusual degree of uncertainty about the seasonal [unintelligible] labor force participation would change radically from where it is now We noted that we tried to come to grips with the news that we've seen recently, but that news involves a lot of interpretation And so even given an output path, the degree of labor market slack that that implies is uncertain Looking back at the recent experience and maybe leaning toward a slight degree of pessimism, one could argue that things really began to firm--the end of the deceleration in wages, the lack of evident further deceleration in core CPI--earlier this year, before we got the drop in unemployment that we've seen recently This    8/16/94  might suggest that more pessimistic views of where the NAIRU is, such as those embodied in the famous Kansas City Fed estimates, might be correct and that one could see some pressure emerging fairly promptly that we don't have in our forecast  On the other hand, as I said, the range of estimates we could come up with in this regard certainly embodies NAIRUs that would be below what we perceive the current level of unemployment to be and thus might give us a little more room to run We've got a sustained strong investment pattern We think that makes sense, but it is on the strong side perhaps of what some models would suggest There is uncertainty about inventories, and certainly in the near term, if there were enthusiasm about building stocks because of concerns about supplies and price increases, that could give some impetus We are continuing to see the evolution of the recoveries abroad, and in that kind of dynamic one could be off the mark in gauging just what impetus we are going to get one way or the other there Given our own experience in the United States and maybe once things settle down, one could see a sequence of surprises in a positive direction On housing, as we saw this morning, we've been surprised; and so we could be right or wrong there I don't feel that this is, on balance, far out of line with the Blue Chip consensus in the sense that they have more growth and more inflation They have higher nominal short-term interest rates, I think, ultimately perhaps But again, that is also consistent with more inflation So there is not a glaring inconsistency of our view with a lot of the private forecasts   My recollection is that we were anticipating that the increase in the latest month would have been 50,000 or so less   Right   Without an explicit view about the bias adjustment I think the bigger surprise was in June where we got a whopping increase in employment, and we were, as I recall, anticipating something again more in the 200,000 area So I think, we have had a substantial upside surprise for those two months   I think that is the order of magnitude   Mr Chairman, may I simply improve upon my answer to Governor Blinder? In the latest data, there were upward revisions to April and May payrolls from what we were aware of at the time of the June Greenbook, a total of about 100,000 The increment to what we were expecting in June and July is about 150,000 So the total increment we have had is considerably larger than what I suggested But the June-July increment is about 150,000   I think DRI is perhaps in the lower part of the spectrum right now   I think they have about a half percentage point increase in the funds rate in the second half of this year and nothing after that   Right, I think they have some modest easing next year and bond yields come down a bit more than in our forecast, and yet they have somewhat weaker growth over the next six quarters In terms of what a more gradual rate increase would produce if one used our quarterly model, the distinctions, as I hinted in my remarks, would be modest   Well, we are talking about rather small differences A 1 percentage point change in the funds rate done immediately according to our quarterly model will only take several tenths off GDP growth by the second half of 1995 And it only means a couple of tenths or so on the CPI So, if you simply select a more gradual rise, the differences are going to be even smaller I guess what we are suggesting is that, in our judgment, the tilt begins to be most likely in an upward direction in terms of inflation right now, that is, given that we feel we are essentially at full employment   Faster growth will mean some additional tightening and the probability at least of an upward tilt, but only very gradually; it's a question of degree  -13-    8/16/94   I just got these numbers at the break and I think the picture in the adjusted permits and the single-family starts is really one of rough stability in the past three months  -32-    8/16/94 "
5207,1994-09-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   Implicit in the third-quarter payroll forecast is an increase of about 250,000 for September   This includes in essence no particular assumption for the strike We have made some back-of-the-envelope calculations, and it is conceivable that it could have a measurable effect But many of these people are part-time who might have found something else to do We had the start of the exhibition season for football; they may have been employed as vendors for football games There just seem to be too many imponderables here to make it a very big factor in the estimate for September   There would be some loss of hours   It could be a few tens of thousands, conceivably   In retrospect, the numbers through August looked as if there might have been a World Cup effect--if you look at the areas of employment that might have been sensitive to that There was that falloff in August So, there might be some upside bias, all other things equal, in our forecast because we didn't make allowance for a big effect from the baseball strike   We are, I think, well aligned with Okun's Law models if you take where we are as the jumping point   Right Clearly, you can get a variety of results depending on what your starting point is, but we looked at this both in terms of the simple rule of thumb of an Okun's Law model working from where we are as well as in terms of models that can reach back a ways and take into account some of the errors that have occurred and so on This looks as well aligned as our forecasts ever are, gauging this by our miscellaneous Okun's Law models   I should note, Dave Stockton reminds me, that implicit in this forecast is potential output growth more like 2-1/3 percent than 2-1/2 percent   I'm sorry, I should have noted that   Mr Chairman, I might bring to the Committee's attention a late-breaking piece of news here this morning The Conference Board released its survey for September The headline is that consumer confidence registered its third consecutive monthly loss in September, declining 2 points In June the index had registered 925 but it is now at 884 The punch line in this release is that ""the current level of consumer confidence has been associated in the almost 30-year history of the survey with a reasonably lively economy"" So it's consistent with the notion that consumer sales have slipped a bit but are not far below the higher levels that we reached earlier this year   Well, this is open to varying interpretations! [Laughter] Certainly, as we perceived it, that announcement has been an element in the sense that it gave traders a period of safety in which they didn't have to worry that every bit of incoming economic  -10-    9/27/94  data would necessarily carry with it the risk of a tightening action So, they probably were a little more relaxed about the near-term outlook   Well, I think I highlighted the numbers that struck us as most important   I think our sense of the momentum in the consumer sector was altered by the combination of the August retail sales and the upward revisions to the prior months Private economists had become very enthusiastic about the signs that consumers really had moved to a more cautious spending posture So this certainly suggested that there was still a willingness to spend and also a willingness to borrow; we still have considerable growth in consumer credit, and consumer sentiment is holding up well So, I think our perception of where the consumer is has been altered I noted two other factors One, at least through the current period--this does not necessarily tell you very much about the next few months--there is a considerably greater degree of strength in manufacturing than we had perceived earlier; and, secondly, the housing data just have not shown the erosion of activity that we had anticipated We still see things as slipping but not at the pace that we had expected earlier  So this certainly suggests that one of the key channels through which we would have thought that interest rates would damp aggregate demand is not working with the force that we had anticipated This has its corollary, too, in all probability, in the fact that purchases of household furnishings and appliances have remained very strong; that was the notably strong element in the consumer spending report through August There just has been no sign of tapering off there So, those were key factors suggesting greater momentum in aggregate demand At the same time, the employment data and the initial claims suggested that we were still getting a lot of growth in payrolls In all likelihood, we were getting a little tighter labor market than we might have anticipated On top of that--   Right, capacity utilization is much higher So, given the momentum, given the slack, we have felt that somewhat greater tightening is probably needed in order to hold the pressures in the economy down to something like those we had in the forecast by the latter part of 1995   We will be looking at all of these things We currently are anticipating some bounceback in orders for nondefense capital goods If we got another very weak report, it might cause us to revise our view of what the trend is in capital spending, which has been giving good impetus to the expansion Obviously, we'll be looking at those other indicators of response to interest rates, which might be the housing sector and consumer durables And we'll be looking at what goes on in the financial markets to see how things are proceeding through those channels  -12-    9/27/94 "
5232,1994-11-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   President Boehne, I think the first question is more a forecasting question The second one perhaps is more a policy question, though there are obviously ingredients of both in the two questions We hinted in the Greenbook that, in essence, we see the probability distribution as skewed a bit in the direction your first question suggested--that, indeed, the momentum could turn out to be better maintained in the near term and that it might take considerably greater monetary policy tightening in order to generate a quick and significant slackening in growth, bringing the economy below potential and beginning to reverse what we regard as an overshooting in resource utilization So, I take your point, and while I don't think history would suggest that a moderation in growth requires a total flattening of the yield curve, I would say that perhaps we are a bit optimistic, if you want to view it that way, on that relationship The Greenbook assumes a reduction in the upward slope, but the latter is still significant If I had to pick an alternative scenario, I might lean in the direction you are talking about  As to slow growth and openness to shocks, the economy is always open to a shock that could move it off the projected path by a given amount When growth is that low, such a shock obviously could move the economy into negative territory Maybe the psychology of that is different and downward momentum might develop, but I don't think we have a way of coping with that In fact, in 1989-1990, we did have a period of slow growth There were some revisions of data which revealed just what the pattern was, and it wasn't until that shock occurred that the economy really tipped into recession In the absence of that shock, it is conceivable we might have skated by A period of slow growth does not necessarily mean that the economy is going to slip into a recession   This is hard to pin down, but my sense is that the credit availability cycle has been out of sync with the normal pattern this time around   In the sense that, when interest rates were coming down in 1991-1992, we were still seeing the tendency toward tightening of bank credit terms   And, as we have been tightening money market conditions, our loan officers' survey and the preponderance of the anecdotal evidence have suggested that the banks have become increasingly aggressive in their business lending and obviously have been increasingly willing to extend consumer credit as well We looked back at the responses to that same senior loan officers' survey some years back through a couple of cycles and found that, as we might have expected, during periods of rising interest rates and a flattening term structure, some of which we have had, we generally had a tightening of credit terms; but recently we had a tendency toward an easing in credit terms So, I think we may be moving in an unusual direction Be that as it may, we are pretty much convinced that we have been moving in the direction of easier credit availability and that that has tended to work against the effect of the rising interest rates on demand From the perspective of businesses, it is certainly clear that the credit crunch is no longer there and credit availability is not a concern to firms that want to expand their fixed investment or inventories   I don't want to put too fine a point on it, but I think the main point is that this seems to have been an offsetting influence over the past year to the rising market interest rates   As a technical matter, the productivity numbers for manufacturing that are published along with those for overall productivity growth are in essence based on a separate system in the current period The recent period is based on industrial production data rather than industry gross product data Those numbers will be revised There isn't any reason, though, to think that they are giving a grossly misleading picture Our assumption is that, indeed, there has been substantial growth in manufacturing productivity I'm not sure you want to subtract that number from overall nonfarm business sector productivity growth and get the residual for the rest of the economy   There's a big gap between the industrial and the nonindustrial sector productivity measures even when we do this exercise   Maybe that isn't actually true; maybe there is an inaccuracy in the measurement of output It would be affecting the GDP numbers It also would be affecting our estimates of potential output growth It is in fact neutral in terms of assessing what the output gap might be All the measures are commensurately affected As to the pattern we have going forward, we do have a deceleration of productivity growth This is a normal accompaniment to a significant deceleration in output growth We believe that we are somewhat above the cyclically-adjusted trend line and that deceleration normally occurs in mid-expansion As we move to fuller resource utilization, the expansion will be slowing; there will be some tendency to move back toward that trend line Historically, the economy has moved below it during recessionary periods, but we don't have a recession in    11/15/94  our projection period In essence, we have a somewhat below-trend growth of nonfarm business productivity over the next year or so and then we move back toward that trend Basically, looking at the growth of productivity in the 1990s, we don't see any real evidence that our assumption for some time now of about 14 percent trend growth in nonfarm business productivity is off the mark The data seem to be conforming to that in terms of the normal cyclical pattern   I don't think I can work my way through all the history you gave on the forecast But I think the first statement you made about giving back the extra growth that we had recently is fundamentally correct That extra growth, as we assess it, resulted in an overshooting of sustainable levels of resource utilization-- levels that would be consistent with at least stability in inflation as opposed to accelerating prices We tried to devise a scenario in which, within a reasonable period of time, we move back to and slightly above the NAIRU to damp the incipient inflationary process I think that is an apt characterization of how this scenario is designed  I hope Don has some thoughts on the M1 velocity story It is not something we focused on, frankly, in designing the forecast We didn't give any attention to M1 M1 is an endogenous byproduct in this forecast just like many other variables There can't conceivably be any tension in our thinking about the money and income relationship It is whatever it is, and we don't have an M1 target range that we need to worry about violating, so that doesn't arise as a side constraint, and we think the broader aggregates will remain at growth rates that are compatible with the 1995 ranges and any reasonable extensions   I don't think we can do a precise dissection One of the things we've pointed out in the Greenbook is that in looking at the acceleration--I don't want to overstate this--what we are talking about in essence in the core CPI number is that we are going to get pretty much 3 increase a month rather than a mixture of 2 and 3 a month   Whether we'll be able to perceive this month-by- month isn't entirely clear But we see this as involving a mix of things that are sort of overlapping We have had an exchange rate depreciation We have seen raw materials prices increase Some of those raw materials are internationally traded and are imported in some instances We have seen rapid growth of output recently, and econometrically, while it is not always a particularly robust result-- you can tinker with your models and get large or small effects--that mere increase in resource utilization can produce in these models some increase in markups, and when things taper off we see some stabilizing and a return to the trend I really can't parse these things out with any great precision Some set of these factors we think will give a little bit faster rise in prices in the near term than would be dictated simply by the margin of slack in the economy, which we would see as only adding maybe a couple of tenths to underlying inflation over the coming year, no more than that  -10-    11/15/94   Right We have a timing question here It is hard to say but we think that we might get a little more of the price increase announcements at the beginning of the year   So, there is a considerable amount of guesswork involved here But, yes, I think it is these speed effects or the exchange rate effects on import prices and so on that are giving the bulge However, if we did not eliminate the excess pressures on resources during 1995, as we have in this forecast, the risk would be that wages would begin to reflect more fully the higher price increases, inflationary expectations would take hold, and we would begin to build that higher track into the trend That's why we felt it important to try to indicate what kind of interest rate path would lead to this slackening fairly promptly   Reality will never be that smooth!   That's one of the risks we noted in the Greenbook   An inventory adjustment could come more quickly If final demand were to taper off and be perceived to have tapered off early next year, perhaps the inventory adjustment would be sharper That could move us much closer to zero or even conceivably negative GDP growth for a quarter, but inventories might then come back if final demand is still growing moderately So, they are certainly a potential source of volatility in the numbers and of some greater cyclical variation   It is going to be a factor affecting the cash flow of many households, but it is not a huge effect It is less huge than one might have expected because what we've observed this year is that a substantial proportion of the ARMs originated this year have fixed rates for 5 or 10 years This is something of an innovation in this cycle We are not going to have any adjustment on those and there is a 2 percentage point limit on those shorter-term ARMs So, this is not going to produce a drastic income shock in 1995  -11-    11/15/94   I think we have a forecast that is middle-of-the- road [Laughter]   A view that is certainly held in the industry is that there is considerable pent-up demand that could buoy sales of automobiles and light trucks but such demand really has not been fully seen yet because of capacity constraints We think there is some element of truth to that story On the other hand, it is true that, to date, we have had a very moderate response of auto loan rates to the increase that has occurred in market rates Prospectively, one would expect that gap to close, and in addition we have assumed some further rise in market rates I must say that the rise in rates is most pronounced at the very short end of the market, and the sort of intermediate-term rates that we typically compare to auto loan rates would not be going up as much We get some flattening in the yield curve here So, in our thinking, there is some further increase in auto loan rates, but maybe not as dramatic as one might think by adding the rise in the funds rate to the gap that seems to exist now between market rates and auto loan rates Arguably, that sort of normal interest rate response could produce a weaker automobile market than we have I think we are somewhere in between, but I would grant you that the interest rate picture might constitute a downside risk   I think that's fair One also could argue that we do not have as large an interest rate response here as we could have Again, as President Boehne suggested in his original question,  -12-    11/15/94  it is possible that we have not put in enough of an increase in interest rates to get the damping of aggregate demand in the Greenbook forecast   Equity markets clearly have been buoyed, in the face of rising bond yields this year, by surprisingly favorable earnings reports Our anticipation would be that those reports will not be pleasant surprises in 1995 That suggests some vulnerability to the stock market, at least in the early part of the year before the significant bond market rally that we anticipate occurs This pattern of flattening profits and diminishing profit share is quite consistent with the cyclical pattern of profits moving with the acceleration and deceleration of output--moving with the growth of productivity in a sense As we go forward, as was noted earlier, we do have a considerable slackening in productivity We see some pressure coming, as wages accelerate and productivity flattens out, toward certainly weakening profit margins--maybe not a pronounced plunge but some pressure on them   We think that investment has been benefiting to some degree from strong profitability and ample cash flows As we go forward, cash flow does flatten out We do get a growing nonfinancial corporate financing gap, and we do see that as an element that will be damping business fixed investment Recall that you are probably looking at real numbers that are inflated to some degree by the computer deflator You get rapid growth in real computer purchases with a zero nominal increase That's basically what we have in our forecast for the next two years We still think this is a climate in which business investment in computers will be fairly robust On the nonresidential structure side, we anticipate a pretty solid uptrend There are lags in this process Permits have been rising noticeably recently We think the uptrend at this point is unlikely to be reversed in the near term by the further rise in interest rates That's giving some underpinnings to this advance, and BFI along with exports are a couple of the sectors against which we are working in reducing the growth of other elements of private domestic demand   In all likelihood, the parallel survey that was conducted prior to the first of this year misled the Labor Department It showed that the unemployment rate would be 1/2 percentage point higher with the new survey The evidence from the survey that was conducted afterwards using the old relationships to other series such as the unemployment insurance data and payroll employment series suggests that somehow or other that parallel survey was misleading-- perhaps a fluke statistically--and that the gap between the old and the new series is probably very small, maybe no more than 1 with another upward estimate of 1 for the change in census population controls "
5257,1994-12-20," [Statement--See Appendix]   That is a risk I hinted at in my remarks about the late 1980s experience I think the key here is to look back at why we projected the inflation that we did for 1994 In essence, we were concerned at the beginning of the year that the pattern of expectations we were seeing, the very buoyant attitudes and so on, and the rapid growth at the end of last year were going to give us a stronger price increase this year than would have been dictated by our analysis of where levels of resource utilization were Looking back now, we see a pattern that seems reasonably consistent with our fundamental view of the Phillips curve picture We did not get down to our point estimate of the NAIRU until this summer Under the circumstances, some further deceleration was not implausible We also think that perhaps we underestimated the cost effects in the medical care area We have had tremendous deceleration of the cost of medical benefits, and this has helped to tamp down the rate of increase in compensation I think that has been a surprise that was not built into our forecast and now appears possibly to have been a broad element that was helping to bring down the inflation rate this year We don't see that contributing as much going forward We think there    12/20/94  will still be some deceleration, but it will probably taper off to some degree   I don't think one can rule out the possibility that the interest sensitivity of the economy in the short run may be less than it was Certainly, we have felt all along that, without the disintermediation effects of Reg Q ceilings that we got decades ago, there wasn't going to be quite the abrupt swing toward restraint that previously accompanied increases in short-term market interest rates But we are still learning Financial markets continue to evolve It is conceivable that the lag structure is different I just don't think we have enough evidence to make a strong statement in that regard Part of what has happened this year has been a surprise in the growth of European economies, in particular, that has helped to buttress export demand On the domestic side, while we cited a risk repeatedly through the year that inventory investment could be stronger than we were anticipating because businesses might become concerned about the availability of supplies, as things turned out, that seemed to be a much more dynamic feature in the economy than we had anticipated There is a cyclical dynamic to this As inventory investment and exports proved strong, that raised aggregate demand and that in turn reinforced the desire for inventories As we got more production and more income, that raised consumption So this is a process that feeds on itself up to a point  Going forward, it is critical, as I noted, that these levels of inventory investment are unsustainable If the economy is going to get back to a growth rate of no more than the long-run potential rate, there has to be a drop-off at some point The question is when that drop-off in inventory investment will occur We are also banking on there being a significant lagged effect of the interest rate increases that have occurred It is still early, as has been discussed repeatedly here As estimated even in our current models, the lags are long enough so that we would only begin to get significant effects now and in the early part of next year We are also building in further rate increases, which will have their effect more in the latter part of 1995 and into 1996, but we think these rate increases may reinforce the effects in the shorter run, too, through increases in adjustable rate mortgages and even adjustments in the stock market If short rates rise as much as we have assumed, it will be more and more difficult for households to get enthusiastic about taking on what appear to be some risks in the stock and bond markets when they can get sizable real returns without risk in the short run    12/20/94   In fact, we didn't quite get back to the unemployment level in our prior forecast We took the kinder, gentler approach to some limited degree here so that by the end of the period, we are in essence back at our point estimate of the NAIRU as it currently stands rather than somewhat above that This means in essence that we don't see any disinflationary pressure through 1996 We merely stabilize things That is the design principle here What we have attempted to do is give you a baseline forecast that holds activity to a path that at least doesn't let inflation get out of control and tries to tell you whether that is achievable and how That exercise involves a great deal of uncertainty, but that is why the good news in terms of output and low unemployment that we have recently experienced gets offset by bad news of slow growth and increasing unemployment later in the forecast   I don't know if there is anything I can say! It certainly occurred to me that taking these numbers just as they are might provide a somewhat unappealing forecast in the Humphrey-Hawkins report But this forecast is not so far from the consensus view among economists that a little degree of optimism, as you suggested, wouldn't put it in the ballpark I don't want to prescribe what people should say here What we have forecast clearly is a slight uptick in unemployment between now and the end of next year, a slight uptick in inflation, and growth that is only modestly below most people's assessment of the long-term trend We are a little bit lower, I think, than the consensus forecast at this point for GDP growth We are lower on the inflation rate than the consensus forecast I admit that these are differences, but we think they are consistent   The model simulation we have done using a constant funds rate has only slightly more growth in 1995 and then appreciably greater growth in 1996   By the model's assessment, that would add several tenths to the inflation rate in 1996 So in that sense, the difference here is one of stable inflation at slightly over 3 percent versus an accelerating price picture with the inflation rate moving up into the mid-3 percent range by 1996 I don't have a basis for seriously questioning this outlook I do think there is a risk in the near term that, if the economy behaves anything like what we are anticipating and if the fed funds rate were to remain at 5-1/2 percent, inflation expectations could mount in ways that wouldn't be anticipated in the structure of our model It is manifest that the market is expecting as much tightening as we have built in, if not more The recent response of the markets to the tightening action shows that they are rather sensitive to indications that we are going to resist inflationary tendencies The common forecast is for inflation to move up I'd say the consensus is about 3-1/2 percent, looking at the Blue Chip forecasts for 1995 I think there would be considerable worry--unless there are clear indications the economy has weakened in the next couple of months--if the Fed were not to move the rate up significantly   I think inflation mounts because, in this alternative, we are running with an unemployment rate that remains below the NAIRU out through 1996 and presumably into 1997, so we are getting an accelerating picture   But I think that in the near term, taking into account exchange rate and import price effects and so on, the model begins to get additional inflation creeping in within 1995 and building a bit It is very gradual and probably undiscernibly different That again goes back to the comment I made earlier It could creep up on you, and sustaining the low unemployment rate, as happened in the late 1980s, eventually does build up to a significant pickup in inflation That is what our forecast has been designed to avoid   I think it would show up certainly in the tenths column, but we are talking about a matter of a couple of tenths over the next year or year and a half   It is not dramatic I would caution that in thinking about the slowdown in the economy, one does not want to think of that as purely a straight interest rate effect Some of it is the inevitable reversal of that cyclical dynamic in the inventory investment area that I talked about Our inventory equations, just as other forecasting tools, don't work all that well, so it is not something I'd want to bank on the model to capture This is a very important element in the timing of the deceleration as we see it   We have the funds rate moving up into the 6-1/2 or 7 percent area by early next spring   It is specified and you should have heard through your research director what the specific numbers were I apologize if there was a slip in communications   My point is that we think the tightening needs to be significant I think a problem with specific numbers is that they imply a false sense of precision about what it will take Yes, to enter something into an econometric model, we would write down 6-3/4 percent "
5310,1995-01-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It looks like 6 percent is the fourth-quarter level that they are working with at this point   Given that their projected output growth will be pretty much in line with their estimates of the trend of potential output, it will look somewhat anomalous on that basis But when they were developing these numbers earlier, they were working from a much higher base It is hard to tell but they could say in the Economic Report that the news is good, the numbers now look better, and so we have adjusted the figures that appeared earlier in the budget   I think we went through this last time, and I won't repeat the four-part harmony answer on the 1994 error In a sense, we were thrown off by some movements in the numbers in 1993 that caused us to hesitate to follow the model religiously Looking back over the past year--as you noted and we noted in the Greenbook-- the behavior of prices is not out of line with the model forecast over the past couple of years on the assumption of a NAIRU in the 6 percent area The behavior of compensation, including the latest reading, might on balance be a bit more favorable--too high in 1993 relative to the model and on the low side in 1994--and that perhaps raises some question, but it is still within the confidence interval At this juncture, as we go forward in this forecast, I think the predictions are well in line with conventional short-run Phillips curve analyses We run many different models and we get different answers, and I think this is a reasonable ballpark estimate of what the history embodied in these models would suggest is likely to happen in 1995 on the assumption that we get this kind of employment data   I would say usually 1/2 percentage point   I think that is a reasonable range We might narrow it a bit but we would be pressing science pretty hard   Basically, we have an estimate of about 1-1/2 percentage points for what the elimination of the structural deficit would do  -79-    1/31-2/1/95   No   This is obviously an ""iffy"" proposition and to some extent one might view this as schematic as opposed to very precise   It is our belief that real rates have been elevated by the structural deficits of the 1980s and elimination of the deficit would yield a lower real rate One of the things we have to speculate about in this forecasting process is the anticipatory effects that might result Estimating those effects is very difficult One has to think beyond the financial markets to other kinds of responses--to expectations about cuts in taxes and federal spending   We were going to propose next Monday   Sure "
5328,1995-03-10," Mr Chairman, I think there has been a general sense in the anecdotal reports that supports the statistical evidence that we are indeed getting some moderation in the growth of economic activity in the early part of this year The employment report this morning could scarcely be regarded as a weak report, but averaging through the two months, one can sense some moderation and something a little short of the kind of increases in employment that we had anticipated This is perhaps putting too fine a point on it but, for example, we had noted in the Greenbook that we expected average increases in payrolls of about 270,000 per month in the first quarter The first two months averaged 247,000, still a strong number but a little to the soft side Similarly, the unemployment rate on average has been a bit higher than we had anticipated Overall, I think we would view the labor market indicators as suggesting that growth will be somewhat below the 32 percent in real GDP that we predicted in the Greenbook for the first quarter  On the expenditure side, too, we can see some signs of softening, particularly on the final demand side--in housing and consumer expenditure However, counterbalancing that to some degree is the fact that BEA revised downward the level of inventory investment in the fourth quarter by a considerable amount, in fact    3/10/95  putting it below the pace we had anticipated in the Greenbook Looking at what still seems to be a fairly robust picture in the manufacturing sector, particularly output of durable goods, it seems reasonable at this point to anticipate that we will not get the kind of near-term drag on GDP growth from inventory investment that we projected in the Greenbook On balance, again, we view the available information as suggesting somewhat weaker growth than we had in the last Greenbook, probably something less than 3 percent if we were going to put down a number at this point But certainly there is no evidence yet that the economy has slipped below the rate of its potential growth or that any slack has begun to open up in the economy  On the wage and price front, the latest hourly earnings figure was favorable, indicating an essentially flat trend in that series The pickup in the CPI in January was in line with our expectations I think we would have to say that basically the jury is still out on whether we were correct in our assessment that there is a deterioration in the inflation trend at hand There just are no clear signals as to whether things are stronger or weaker on the inflation side than we anticipated Looking ahead, there are three background financial factors that tend to point in the direction of buoying activity as we move out in the coming months The dollar is lower than we anticipated it would be at this point The level of stock prices is higher than we would have expected Bond yields have come down materially and mortgage rates with them So, as we look ahead, while on the international side there is obvious turmoil in Mexico and some other uncertainties that may be more to the negative side, when we weigh all these things, I don't think we see a basis for changing in any significant way our expectations for the year as a whole Thank you "
5349,1995-03-28," We are talking about Part I   Part I is classified as Class II   I think Peter was referring to the shorter intermediate term, the 1- to 3-year area   We didn't have it in February It's an open issue for July   No  -16-    3/28/95   After we have gone on even briefly you may decide that you don't want the full length Chart Show, but we'll see [Statement--see Appendix]   Reading the numbers as precisely as they are written down, the thrust of the baseline forecast is that we think we have a modest degree of financial restraint that will hold growth slightly below potential and have the unemployment rate creep up But we are at a point where we think high levels of resource utilization will begin to foster very gradually some momentum toward higher inflation So, yes, the most natural extrapolation from this would be a slightly higher rate of inflation in 1997   That is correct   Essentially, we would have an upward slope of average dimension   Yes   If you are asking whether the relationship of nominal interest rates to nominal growth looks abnormal or unreasonable here, I would say that there is not a very strong regularity in the history of the relationship between nominal interest rates and nominal GDP growth We have played around with some econometric exercises to see whether there is any information to be gained by looking at that spread as an index of restraint and prospective real economic activity It is weak It can contribute a little to explaining the prospects I don't feel uncomfortable with this forecast I think the fact that the nominal interest rate is a little higher than nominal GDP growth is consistent with our sense that this is putting some drag on economic activity, just as the fact that the real short-term rate, a bit above historical averages as we perceive it, could be interpreted as being consistent with some modest monetary restraint on top of what we believe to be some moderate fiscal restraint That is very hard to say The real rate of interest could vary considerably over a cycle or even a little longer   We are slightly above the ceiling now, drifting back toward the ceiling   We are splitting hairs here  -18-    3/28/95   Let me separate these questions In some simple models, one can relate the observed real rate of interest to the longer-term growth of the economy as a sort of equilibrium, steady state condition But if one starts elaborating those models, it can get much more complicated On the question of what we think is going on with inflation expectations, yes, our presumption is that the current inflation expectation for the shorter run is in the 3 percent --3 percent plus--area for consumer prices As we go out into the intermediate-term--5 to 10 years--expectations are probably closer to 4 percent inflation   At this point, in our judgment, the notion of a downward trend to inflation is not embedded in the markets Rather, there is some more inflation in the works, as President Parry was suggesting Our forecast is pointing toward some gradual pickup to a higher level of inflation   Indeed But in 1997, assuming gradual convergence, we are as I said splitting hairs   Exactly, and in 1997 on this trajectory, we would get back to the NAIRU and a little lower on capacity utilization In theory at that point, the inflation rate would stabilize at just a hair higher than we observe as the trend to 1996   We are using the usual sacrifice ratios and a NAIRU around 6 percent; and given our projected unemployment rate, we are only talking about accelerations of a couple of tenths a year The convergence by 1997 implies that we may not even have that in that year   Yes "
5360,1995-04-28," We had the advance reading on first-quarter GDP today and, as you know, the 28 percent estimated growth in the first quarter is right in the middle of what we had projected in the January and March Greenbooks It was very close to what we were anticipating in light of the data that had come in subsequently Final sales were not particularly strong at 18 percent and, taking these numbers at face value, it would appear that the level of inventories at the end of the quarter was higher than we thought it would be I think that reinforces our belief that in all likelihood there will be a significant drag from the inventory sector in the second quarter We anticipate that that will be particularly evident in the auto sector, but we don't see any signs of a collapse in economic activity  Very recent indicators, such as initial claims and the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Report that was published this morning, are consistent with a picture of moderate economic growth We think that consumer demand will pick up substantially in the second quarter There was only a 1-1/2 percent increase in real PCE in today's advance estimate for the first quarter, and we think we shall see a substantial acceleration The growth of spending has been very weak relative to income over the last several months, and in light of the readings from consumer sentiment surveys, the strength of the stock market, and the distinct possibility that the pattern and timing of tax refunds could have had an effect, we are looking for good numbers in coming months from the consumer sector The housing indicators are mixed and we expect housing starts to firm a bit from what to us was a surprisingly low March level In the business capital spending area, the figures for the first quarter were very robust We don't think that pace is going to be maintained, but the new orders figures and the data coming from the construction sector suggest to us that there will be a further substantial increase in capital outlays Net exports were a significant negative in the first quarter We don't see that persisting, given our assumptions about how the Mexico effects will play out in these data On the whole, we are still inclined to think that growth in real GDP in the second quarter will be around 2 percent, or perhaps a shade less, as we had projected in the last Greenbook Those numbers seem reasonable at this juncture  On the price side, the CPI in March included an increase in the core component that was right in line with our expectations We did see the kind of acceleration in that measure in the first quarter that we had predicted However, in line with what we noted in the last Greenbook, when one begins to dig into the details, the pattern still is not one that clearly evidences broad inflation coming about because of pressures on resources or the pass-through of rising materials costs I think that is a potentially interesting development Adding to that the fact that the employment cost index figures released earlier this week were so favorable, I think one    4/28/95  would have to say that on balance the incoming news on the inflation side is a basis for some optimism that perhaps we might have a little lower inflation in coming months than one might otherwise have expected based on a similar output path Thank you   To get the kind of growth we are anticipating, which in the last Greenbook was in the area of 3-1/2 percent and which still seems reasonable to us, we will have to see a very considerable acceleration The numbers have been quite flat in recent months, but I can't give you the specifics   Definitely not We did not have arithmetic strength coming out of the quarter   Yes, exports were about unchanged--minus 6 percent   Our sense is that the further decline in net exports is essentially a Mexico story That would be the right order of magnitude Net exports were down $12 billion; that's in the ballpark "
5381,1995-05-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It will take me a minute or so to find that I think we are still seeing rising backlogs   I can't give you that answer immediately I'm sorry   I don't have in mind a particular number that goes with neutrality in the sense that over time one would expect the economy to grow at potential--or to sit at potential output We have interpreted monetary policy per se as probably modestly restrictive at this point That is, the real rate of interest is perhaps somewhat above the natural rate But, in the total financial picture, we also recognize that credit availability if anything has been improving; the terms and standards of bank loans have been moving in an easing direction; and we also have had an impulse through the exchange market, which you might take as part of the broader financial context, that is tending to be stimulative over this period So, on balance, we don't have a picture of very marked financial impetus or restraint   We would anticipate, particularly in an environment of ongoing fiscal restraint, that the equilibrium as we look ahead to 1996, 1997, 1998 would be one in which the real short- term interest rate would move closer to its historical average; that rate would be on the order of 2 percent or maybe a bit less This would suggest that the rate probably is higher now than would be expected over the longer term So, we have some restraint there Don points out to me that we have had a very big run-up in the stock market that is providing another financial impulse  Mr Chairman, in answer to your question about nondefense capital goods, orders were about 4-1/2 percent above shipments   In March   I don't know that the concept of neutrality was ever particularly well defined, and I think the kind of economic outcome that would ensue from a given short-term real rate of interest is going to vary considerably over time, depending on fiscal policy and other impulses So, I have problems putting myself in that particular context But to respond directly to your question about the longer-term outlook, we have shown in previous longer-term scenarios in the Bluebook and elsewhere a declining path for the real funds rate over time because, looking at history, we felt that this was a relatively high real short-term interest rate and one that would not be consistent with stability in the economy It would be exerting some ongoing contractionary force and overshooting what would be required to stabilize the inflation level ultimately So, if we redo this projection, we would anticipate, particularly in a context of ongoing fiscal restraint, let alone any balanced budget program that is credible, that over the next several years there would be a decline in the real short-term rate of interest as we moved either toward a condition of stability at potential GDP or even maintained some minor gap so as to bring the inflation rate down gradually   I don't think so As I said, I think that a number of environmental factors would alter the implications of a given real interest rate level Thus, I don't think there is a number for all time   Two comments may be useful in responding to that One is that you characterized the range of possible NAIRU levels as being one that was sort of biased to the up side of where our forecast has been recently As we are interpreting it, I think we would say that might be a little too pessimistic Perhaps one of the risks is that the very good news we saw on the ECI through the first quarter of the year is an indication that the NAIRU was lower than is built into our forecast   Basically, our forecast is one in which the economy is operating, at worst, just a shade below the full employment level, or the NAIRU, as we move through 1996 In that kind of environment, one would not anticipate a great deal of pressure toward higher inflation So, given the recent experience and the factors that suggest what growth rate may be sustainable in this economy without a buildup of inflationary pressures, I think there is a reasonable balance of risks as we look out through next year Now, we are in a period in which there are some vulnerabilities The economy    5/23/95  is still operating at a quite high level It is being hit by a shock through the exchange rate channel As I noted, that shock is not as great perhaps as one would surmise looking at the yen alone, but we think there is an impulse there that is going to tend to bring higher import prices and provide an umbrella for domestic producers of autos and other goods We quite possibly still have in front of us a significant pass-through of materials cost increases We can already see that showing up in some industries It is clearest in industries like paper, but there are hints elsewhere It is conceivable that this hump that we are looking at in our forecast could be greater and could stretch out more if it generates some broader inflationary expectations than seem to be present now or than we have anticipated in the forecast So, I think that certainly does pose some short-run upside risk at a minimum   I think that relationship has varied considerably over decent spans of time historically So, they have not moved in precise lockstep   We are certainly mindful of there being a relationship over time By the end of the period, we are moving into the vicinity, if not below, what one might judge to be a natural rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing This reflects in part the slower growth of goods output in the economy, but it also reflects the fact that we have built into this forecast very sizable increases in manufacturing capacity, largely in response to what has been a very large increase in investment in manufacturing to date and what seems likely to be strong investment going forward So, that is a significant ingredient in the diminution of capacity utilization in manufacturing It is one of the factors that provides considerable hope that we are going to see a damping of inflationary pressures and a flattening out of materials prices--that such prices will not be a concern when we get to the latter part of this year and certainly as we move through 1996  -10-    5/23/95   Yes Obviously, as we move out into 1996 and capacity utilization drops, corporate profits will not be growing the way they have been, cash flow won't be as favorable, and all of these factors will work to damp further increments to growth of the capital stock in manufacturing We are not going to have an ongoing decline in capacity utilization forever, but this is our short-run forecast A lot of this is given by the natural lags in the process of adding to capacity so that we think there is a good deal of momentum in this process going out several quarters   I'm not sure I have a concept of a convergence process here, but over time the average and what we estimate as being a natural rate in terms of price behavior is at 82 percent or maybe a bit less One would anticipate that if we stretch this out, there would be some processes that would probably move us in that direction "
5407,1995-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   I guess it would be a fair request at some point for us to do another thick study    7/5-6/95   One of the problems of comparing past studies with where we are now is the change in the current population survey Even at this point we have some degree of uncertainty about how to translate today's unemployment rate into pre-1994 terms So, that can be one ingredient in a comparison of old NAIRUs to new NAIRUs As we have gone along, we have had to adjust our sights on what this is and now we also are trying to incorporate the experience over the past year and a half with respect to wages and prices and trying to surmise whether we might have been too high or too low We have inched down a bit our working assumption about where the NAIRU is--the number around which our price forecast, in effect, pivots At this point we are talking 59 percent; it is a little lower than it was previously The allusion to demographic adjustments in the Bluebook was merely to recognize that, as we look out over the next five years, there will be compositional changes in the labor force and there could be movements in the NAIRU as a consequence For this kind of schematic presentation, though, we thought such adjustments would greatly complicate matters and get us into areas of increasing uncertainty to try to maneuver them over the five-year span that we were portraying But we wanted to alert you that there were a number of subtleties that we didn't address in this and that you shouldn't be thinking necessarily that the 59 percent unemployment rate would be the pivotal rate for each of the next five years   Let me interrupt you there   We wanted to make that as clear as we could--and I guess w failed--or maybe we did do it as clearly as we could but that wasn't clear enough! We didn't mean that adjustment in the nominal rate, which we took to be a reflection of a change in the natural r e, to be viewed as monetary stimulus In effect, it keeps things neutral as the fiscal restraint tends to lower the natural rate--the rate that would prevail when the economy was in a steady state, operating at potential I apologize if we confused you on that score In fact, what we were doing was recognizing something that I think you raised at the last meeting about how high the real short- term rate should be expected to be over the longer run and whether we felt that 3 percent, or wherever the real rate is, was the sustainable rate I noted then that if we looked out several years that would  -10-    7/5-6/95  become a relevant consideration I said that we felt it was higher than the longer-run equilibrium or natural rate and that in prior Bluebook simulations we had introduced a downward tilt Since we were going out a bit further with the Bluebook simulations and we were building in a somewhat more substantial fiscal consolidation, we felt that it would be appropriate for us to introduce that into this forecast So, that's how that should be interpreted   Assuming inflation expectations remain constant   That's right   I should emphasize that, given our limited ability to predict these relationships, the calibration of this is clearly very uncertain I think the point of Tom's presentation here, which is a schematic one in a sense, is simply that if there are large anticipatory reactions in the bond market, then you do not need to move the short rate as aggressively in order to give a greater stimulus to private investment spending It's a simple point, and we don't want to suggest by the precision of these charts that we can calibrate that very neatly Again, it's a broad conceptual issue and one that, obviously, I would think you folks would want to contemplate in thinking about where funds rates might be over time   It was one of the laundry list of factors that we mentioned in our discussion of consumption in the Greenbook It works in the right direction We certainly are not going to argue against that as a possible drag on consumer expenditures  While we are on the subject of consumer expenditures--and I may get additional information later and I certainly would not want to interrupt your discussion at that point--but assuming you were interested in motor vehicle sales, Ford has released its data earlier than we anticipated, so we now have Ford and GM, the Japanese transplants, and a number of other manufacturers--that is, everyone but Chrysler The ones we have are essentially unchanged from May Chrysler has been indicating that they are fairly optimistic They actually have seen their numbers, so I assume that their numbers will look fairly decent, and this would suggest that total light vehicle sales in June will be unchanged to slightly higher, which would be right in line with our forecast   You have the numbers!   I don't think they have the new minivans  They are out  -21-   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be very brief Initial claims for the week of July 1 were published this morning and were unchanged at 369,000 You will recall that two weeks ago they showed a spike up to 396,000; they came off last week and were unchanged in the latest week Insured unemployment was up to 27 million That has been trending up recently, so the rise wasn't particularly surprising in light of the initial claims The leading economic indicators were down 02 percent in May, as we and most other people had anticipated The change in the prior month stood at minus 06 percent; there was a revision from minus 05 percent to minus 04 percent, I believe, in the preceding month For what it's worth, we were speculating that the measure of the probability of recession that we presented in the Greenbook would be about 54 percent and, with the revision to the earlier month--this is a very sensitive measure--it is now at 48 percent [Laughter] The Johnson Redbook came out yesterday afternoon--up 14 percent for June--and you have the auto sales figures before you As I indicated yesterday, they were up slightly in June to 149 million units for light vehicles, which is in line with the Greenbook forecast Thank you   We find it to be terribly unreliable, but a change that large might be a signal that we can look for a positive in the retail sales numbers   It is hard to say That is all the news--some of which probably is not fit to print   Let me remind you again that we ran those models off our nominal GDP forecast, which is a pretty low number, and you would want to make a mental adjustment for your own forecasts   I would like to emphasize the point that there are many kinds of interest rate paths that one could imagine If you moved rates down very sharply in the short run and they were to flatten out or even come back next year, that might have some implications for growth next year; in particular, M2 growth might not run appreciably higher than our forecast There are lags here and we still don't know all of the behavioral relationships--what would happen to mutual funds flows and so on under some of these rate scenarios "
5456,1995-09-26," [Statement-see Appendix]   I think your characterization of a favorable surprise relative to many typical models is right When we get surprises, we go back and start tinkering with models We want to see whether we can fit history better and whether we can, for example, introduce something into these equations such as lagged wages that    9/26/95  might capture a trend in wages or a wage norm and reduce the errors significantly I don't know whether that is particularly appealing on analytical grounds, but there is a sense that we are locked into some trend here People seem to have a 3 percent figure in mind about wage increases If we looked at wages alone and tried to model those, we would probably also see some surprise there in terms of how low the inflation has been But we do think that the overall compensation number is more relevant over time, and we have seen the downward movement in medical costs as constituting something of a favorable supply shock in a sense to the system  There are significant changes going on in the medical care market It appears that after a period in which many businesses were surprised year after year by how fast the costs of their medical benefits were rising and they did not necessarily subtract those costs from workers' wages, we are getting a reversal of that now that there is some revolution in the market for medical services Business firms have not passed the benefits of reduced medical cost increases through to workers on the wage side or in other benefits As we see it, this process is likely to continue but with diminishing quantitative importance as we go forward A lot of firms have made the shift to managed care systems Medical care inflation itself seems to be stabilizing There are some risks, as we noted in passing in the Greenbook, that if some of the reforms that are being proposed for Medicare and other programs are adopted, there could be more cost shifting to insurance providers So, we think that this run may be at its end, but we just don't see anything emerging now that looks like a substantial acceleration Many of the Reserve Banks have reported in their letters on the discount rate and in the Beigebook that there are signs of tightness here and there and that employers are responding with higher wages But one also has a sense that there are pockets of weakness and that many employers are looking to other means besides raising compensation to solve their labor problems   I think we will remain below most model forecasts, but we have projected a little acceleration in the growth of compensation costs as we go through the next few quarters   Very slow   On the first question, if this emphasis on training is a manifestation of poor quality of the labor force, then that presumably has some implication for potential output In terms of the growth of the labor force, the effective growth is less than it would appear That tendency can be made up for by investing to improve the quality of the labor force Training presumably is a cost that would perhaps be an element in some markup over perceived unit labor costs if it doesn't show up as a form of compensation  On the NAIRU, I suppose it's possible that this deterioration in the quality of the labor force, if that's what it is, could lead to a greater tendency toward mismatches in the labor market and some elevation of the NAIRU But I don't think we have any sense that there has been a radical change in this Employers have been complaining about the quality of workers for a good many years I don't know that what you describe is an entirely different circumstance, but maybe the response is different I alluded to this when I was replying to President Parry We do hear these reports, and it does seem that there is this alternative response of taking a less qualified worker and making that investment in training rather than bidding for the scarce pool of well-qualified workers  On the job insecurity question, I don't think there are any direct measures There may be some opinion polls of which I'm not aware that might have asked people how they felt about this One can look at some indicators, such as perceptions of job availability in the Conference Board survey, and relate that to actual unemployment and other labor market indicators to see if things are out of kilter My recollection is that the number of people saying that jobs are in scarce supply is probably a little high relative to what one might have expected We have tinkered with the question of whether there is a systematic influence by, for example, putting variables into a Phillips curve relation and so on My sense is that we haven't come up with anything that is very persuasive   I think one can make an inference from other expressions of dissatisfaction with the current situation in the economy and just anecdotal evidence from the press and so on that people probably feel that they don't have a lock on their jobs, even    9/26/95  in a well-established corporation, the way they once did There is a sense that because of changing technology the loss of a job will incur the risk that the next job will pay a much lower wage than the current job and lower than might have been expected in prior years   Mr Chairman, I think you've made a very good point about these levels and changes It certainly would be a possibility that as unemployment remains in a relatively low zone, though the average duration is remaining relatively long, people would become a little less concerned about their potential vulnerability so that that could alter the--   Exactly   Yes Your point's well taken   Moreover, for any given amount of unemployment, if it were disproportionately short term it would suggest that people were able to find jobs relatively quickly   But when there's a lot of long-term unemployment, that would suggest there may be some difficulty for people who have been displaced, for example, with all the restructuring   I think that was the leading hypothesis for a long time   I think it ultimately depends on what monetary policy you pursue In essence, given our assumption of little change in the federal funds rate--we have just a little ticking down at the end of next year--we don't see here an aggressive effort to offset the ongoing fiscal restraint We have specified a three-year reduction, but the presumption would be that Congress is going to pass something that goes even beyond that So, fiscal restraint would be an ongoing force in the economy, though diminishing As we have it, the biggest degree of fiscal restraint is imposed in 1996 Some of the restraint that flows from earlier actions--over 1993, for example--disappears and the smaller increments from our assumed new fiscal package are what is left So, on our assumption, the degree of fiscal restraint really is diminishing a bit as we move out in time We felt that, (1) we wanted to stick to the steady policy assumption for the baseline, and (2) this produced in our analysis an outcome where resource utilization rates eased only moderately and created a situation in 1997 where there was only a small degree of slack in the system  -12-    9/26/95  Given the enunciated goal of moving toward price stability, that seemed to be reasonable to present to you As you move on out, unless you wanted to accelerate the progress toward price stability, if the tendency was for that gap to remain and for the unemployment rate to continue drifting up, you might want to pursue a somewhat more stimulative policy for a time to at least stabilize things at a comfortable level of resource utilization It's a question in this mechanical fashion of just how fast you want to move toward price stability   In our forecast we don't anticipate that there will be any favorable wealth effects as we move beyond this year   There are some very obvious questions, for example in the area of medical care We have not specified our package in a way that calls for staking out any position on this But it's quite conceivable that people of reasonable means, if they were called on to pay a larger Medicare premium or to have some deductible or something, might continue to consume roughly the same amount of medical care and save less in the short run As I suggested, the package being discussed now includes lots of changes in programs that are very fundamental--for example, the welfare program There are potential labor supply responses that we will have to come to grips with If legislation is enacted in the next few weeks, we may not be able to put that off for very long in our analysis for the forecast I don't think it's going to be a big deal over the next couple of years even if there is a phasing in and so on But over the longer haul, there could be effects on saving behavior; there could be effects on labor supply behavior and maybe many other effects We'll have to look very carefully at what are pretty radical changes that are being discussed in some of these programs Regarding the transfer of programs to states and the block grants, we have assumed that there will be some short-run cushioning for states and localities in cases where there were cutbacks in funding to absorb some of those cutbacks and maintain benefit levels But over time that would change, too "
5482,1995-11-15," [Statement--see Appendix]   At this point we don't see anything in the cards that is going to change the picture materially We have had relatively rapid expansion of capacity in our forecast, and the incoming data in the updated survey on investment have supported that We will be revising our numbers on production and capacity utilization, but my sense from talking to people who are engaged in that work is that this isn't going to change the picture materially Basically, we think we have something that's pretty much parallel to our assessment of the labor market We are a little on the tight side of what would be ""nonaccelerating"" inflation over time   I don't know that I just looked at the rounded data here which show a core CPI increase last month of exactly 3 percent, but I don't have the data with the Board staff's estimate   We have discussed this in the past, and as I said, we pondered this question of whether having nominal interest rates running higher than nominal GDP growth over time is an unnatural  -14-    11/15/95  relationship It strikes one as being something that is unsustainable We think of this, in terms of government budget positions and so on, as a relationship that's unsustainable But over limited periods of time, this relationship clearly has varied tremendously, and there isn't a very compelling short-run macro story that pushes you toward equilibrating these things or having the nominal GDP growth rate higher than the nominal interest rate Certainly, our view in formulating this revised forecast is that, given real interest rates in the current environment--one in which we are experiencing ample availability of credit, and we looked at all the other parameters of financial conditions at this point--these real interest rates are not creating quite the damping effect on aggregate demand that we anticipated earlier But we do expect that they will create some drag on final demand and that we will have this tapering off in the growth of consumer and business expenditures We think there is a coherent story here But it does in essence have implicit in it, if you like that model, a relatively high natural real rate of interest for the forecast period   We have intermediate- and long-term rates rising in nominal terms, but we see no reason to think that inflation expectations for the intermediate to long run will change materially The 3 percent inflation that we are forecasting is very much in line with what private forecasters are expecting I think the survey evidence suggests that expectations for inflation over the intermediate run probably run in the 3 to 4 percent range I don't think that would change a great deal You are correct in noting that the uptick in real interest rates has a damping effect in the forecast It's one of the things that contributes to the deceleration of fixed investment, residential and nonresidential, and gives us this moderation in growth going forward   Let me make several comments I probably won't be able to achieve absolute coherence here In a sense, we have introduced a supply shock into this forecast to the extent that we have lowered our NAIRU and in essence have raised the potential output ceiling On the trend of potential output growth, the analysis that we have offered is that when one looks at data--not on a 1987 fixed- price basis, but on a more recent base year or chain-weighted basis-- recent evidence of surprises in productivity growth disappears We seem to be running on a trend that has been in place for well over a decade, something on the order of a percentage point in these terms It doesn't suggest that we had a big surprise in the last couple of quarters It doesn't suggest that there has been a radical revolution over this decade relative to where we were running before Now, that may mean there was a mismeasurement, as Chairman Greenspan noted earlier There may be components that could be added in and so on, but those add to both potential and actual measured GDP and don't alter the output gap So that doesn't imply anything different about the pressures on the inflation side  Training is an interesting question I would remind you that training costs money It's a cost, as you've characterized it, of production It would have to be made up on the price side So it's not a free good Second, I am not sure how clear the data are I think there may be bits and pieces around about how much expenditures on training have increased I am not well versed in that, but I have certainly seen anecdotal reports of it here and there Some of the stories I have seen over the years have suggested that a lot of this training goes to managers--upper level people They are getting all kinds of training that may not have particularly obvious payoffs in production I could cite the training here at the Federal Reserve [Laughter] It will be five years before my colleagues in HRM hear that and in the interim you are all sworn to secrecy! [Laughter]   Furthermore, a lot of this training is remedial Many of you have reported what directors and other contacts have told you about how it's really hard to find workers who are literate or numerate A question might be raised as to whether they have to spend more and more money just to maintain the quality of labor input that they are accustomed to In a sense, one of the reasons for some of this investment in computerization--I have speculated about this with my colleagues, who would rather I not say this--may be to make up for some of the deficiencies of the work force A simple example is something like fast food outlets where workers are able to tell you what you owe them without having to enter in any numbers They just punch a button that has a picture of a ""Whopper"" or whatever it is I think we need to be a little cautious here in thinking that there is a revolution in progress leading to an improvement of the labor force  -16-    11/15/95  We all recognize that achieving the gains in productivity that might potentially result from the investment in high-tech information processing equipment will only be achieved when people know how to use the equipment, reorganize production processes accordingly, and the whole infrastructure is developed Maybe it's still ahead and maybe we are not optimistic enough going forward But from what we can see to date, we feel pretty comfortable with our assessment of the trends in potential output   This is consumer durables spending excluding motor vehicles in our forecast, As we have suggested, we think there will probably be some improvement in sales of appliances and home furnishings in connection with the surge in home sales that we saw over the summer; reports seem reasonably favorable into early fall Second, we anticipate that there will be some considerable strength in home electronics, computers, and other such items--hardware and software   Obviously, the housing element flattens out We have a weaker motor vehicle contribution in the first quarter Yes, this is a big Christmas for computer buying in our thinking I don't want to get too fancy about this Obviously, whether the sales occur in December or in January isn't of great moment for the GDP forecast-- and certainly not for monetary policy--because the production might occur anyway on this schedule   Yes, and I think it gets counted with books and other things and in many cases probably is bought at the same outlets That's one of the real problems in gauging the actual level of expenditures   The question is whether it lasts very long or whether you have to go out and buy a new one next year when you buy your replacement computer That is where it's counted   Let me just say this The incoming data have been weaker and that would be a component of this downgrading of the PCE that I suggested would be appropriate at this point   As you know, the personal saving rate is 44 percent in the forecast and it has been 44 percent So, nominal expenditures are roughly keeping pace with nominal income   Probably inadvertence in the forecasting process Let's take a look again The latter part of the year is weaker in 1997 The saving rate is down because of the intra-yearly tax pattern that we have and our assumptions about how people will spend their tax cuts   We do have a deceleration going on at the end of 1997 in general   As you may recall, it wasn't until quite recently that levels of investment got to the point where we were really adding rapidly to the capital stock My sense is that those people who would try to approach estimation of what labor productivity should be through a production function find some pretty substantial rates of increase in labor productivity in 1987 dollars My recollection is 1-3/4 percent   Indeed, how strong investment has been is obviously important to the story   Yes   I don't have the number in my head for what you would derive from a production function approach But I know from talking to people like Larry Meyer and from our own quarterly model work that one could argue for a somewhat higher number than we have embedded in our forecast   That's all a matter of model estimation There is still the question of what the actual experience has been The simplest way of looking at this is, if you believe in Okun's law and, admittedly, it is not a precise relationship in every time period, that there is nothing in the behavior of the unemployment rate that would suggest that we have been grossly underestimating the growth potential of output   I think some would argue that what we are seeing that is reminiscent of the late 1980s is this undaunted optimism on my  -19-    11/15/95  part [Laughter] There is a distinct chance that this will be declared Prell's second folly and that we inched toward a somewhat greater degree of optimism on how low the NAIRU might be just when things were starting to turn   We were somewhat seduced at that time by the run of good experience after we had hit what we thought was probable NAIRU territory As we saw the unemployment rate moving in the 5 to 5-1/2 percent zone, we got a little more optimistic than in retrospect we should have and there is the risk that that is also the case at this point In terms of sheer econometric tests, you can't say that the experience that we have had over the past year, a relatively brief period, deviates in a statistically significant way from what model predictions would have been based on a NAIRU as high as the roughly 59 percent that we had before we made this change, or even numbers in the low sixes Compensation per hour numbers have begun to push the envelope a bit But if you look at reduced form models with prices, there is certainly no inconsistency with a higher NAIRU I think we have cautioned, at least implicitly in what we've said, that we are making an assessment of what we see going on now and what is likely to be going on in the near term in light of all the factors affecting the economic environment It is not necessarily the case that we can expect the NAIRU to be permanently lower than what we have previously thought it to be There may have been some short-run favorable supply side effects, so to speak, that helped push the short-run NAIRU below where we thought it was, and it may pop back up We need to be very cautious and continue to watch this Some people point to the other compensation-per-hour numbers that come out in the productivity cost release, and conclude that that has turned up--Larry Meyer, for example, and that's perhaps because it fits his model It is true that there certainly has been no deceleration in core CPI this year The latest data are a little worse than they have been for the last few months But given the average hourly earnings and the slight uptick in the core CPI, I would rather have had the numbers go the other way than have had my neck stuck out this time   There is also possible irreparable damage to the November CPI estimate because they normally have people out in the field all month getting quotes Those people presumably are not out in the field now If they get back soon, this may not lead to any major miscues in the estimates, but there is still a potential problem for the estimates   In fact, we may not publish another number in 1987 dollars! [Laughter]   I'm a sporty kind of guy! "
5506,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   One feature of the latest forecast is a change in our projection of labor force growth As we have reported from time to time over the past few years, we have been surprised by the lack of rise in the labor force participation rate The most recent observation was distinctly short of our expectations So, we have flattened that path out considerably and have less labor force growth going forward Now, what would happen if demand were stronger and employment were to grow faster? One possibility is that labor force participation remains on the track we are forecasting and we do get a decline in the unemployment rate relative to the path we projected and that creates some additional pressures Alternatively, maybe at long last what we would see is a response by potential workers to the healthy demand for them, and you would see some renewed growth in labor force participation and stability in the unemployment rate I don't think we can say what will happen with any certainty at this point, but we have made a distinct change in the trajectory of the labor force in this forecast   I don't know what this particular regression is I assume we are talking about the MPS model   Let me say, we are looking at net worth in the model, so that also shows up, which is the other side that you cited in passing at the end of your comments Could I clarify one point without getting into an argument about the construction of these numbers? There is no significant wealth effect built into our forecast If you look at the personal saving rate, there is no decline from where we have been In essence, we pretty much neutralized this, taking into account also the debt side of the picture That's why I characterized this as an upside risk It doesn't take the full dimension of the model wealth effect in order to give rise to an upside risk of the sort that I was suggesting   No   We won't get a 1987 dollar figure The waters could be muddied in other ways, but we do think the third quarter looks stronger than it did before "
5529,1996-01-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman We will be referring to the material that has been placed in front of you It's entitled ""Material for Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee"" [Statement--see Appendix]   I think I would characterize the growth on average after this quarter as being so close to the trend as not to be perceptibly different   Our forecast does suggest that the recent weakness is likely to be a transitory phenomenon In terms of the available information, the weakness has been highly concentrated, in effect, in the manufacturing sector, with producers moving quickly to gear production down in an effort to reduce inventory investment to a more sustainable level Once that adjustment has occurred, we don't have a drag from inventory investment and we return to trend growth This presumes that final demand is reasonably well maintained through this process and that we don't get a big contraction in employment that would reduce income in a serious way That is the issue that was addressed by all of my colleagues in looking at some of the key sources of impetus to income and employment growth business fixed investment, exports, and reasonably well-sustained consumer demand despite rising consumer debt burdens Weather probably is a negative, but we have not attached a great deal of quantitative significance to that for the quarter as a whole We think it is damaging in January, but that there will be a snapback over the next couple of months Construction will resume and we will get essentially back on track by the end of the quarter   That is our judgment As I have been careful to suggest, we would not say that we have come close to knowing these relationships with such precision that we would want to pinpoint the federal funds rate down to the nearest quarter of a percent As best we can see at this point, a real funds rate that currently looks a bit above the historical average seems to reasonably balance the risks and foster sustained economic growth at a pace close to trend growth   Until very close to the end of our projection process, we had to rely very heavily on anecdotal information Toward the end of the process, we received the PCE estimates for October and November and they are a big chunk of total expenditures Those estimates did not suggest a very strong PCE contribution, which reinforced the anecdotal information in leading us to discount somewhat what we were seeing in the hours data Looking at the behavior of the unemployment rate as another labor market indicator,  -6-    1/30-31/96  we essentially had stability in that rate from the third to the fourth quarters, which would be broadly consistent with trend growth of output Thus, 2 percent growth seemed a reasonable place to be If I went solely by the anecdotal information, I might have been inclined to write down a lower number The retail sales data we received this morning would trim a couple of tenths from our projection, all other things equal I think we are in a reasonable ballpark, but at this point the range of possibilities clearly is very wide   It is always dangerous to judge these things by the anecdotal information, though sometimes such information provides an early sign of a development that we can't perceive yet in the data With the lags we have experienced recently in getting the data, I think we may have to look at those anecdotal reports a little more closely than we might usually On the statistical side, some of the indications of trends have not been unambiguous, and some of them have been surprisingly weak Looking at the housing indicators, the recent pattern of single-family starts and sales has not been particularly robust We had a spurt in the summer and then we had some slight softening in home sales and so on through November   Permits look a little better We are hopeful, looking at loan applications and so on, that there is an uptick in train, only temporarily interrupted by all this snow Looking at the trend in capital goods orders, we have pointed out for some time that there was some moderation in their growth aside from computers So, I think that even the data show hints of deceleration We felt all along that that was coming and was appropriate if the Committee were concerned about not overshooting noninflationary levels of resource utilization  Why are people so sour at this point? The people who do the surveys at the University of Michigan and the Conference Board have noted in their reports that they felt it was possible that the bad weather was having adverse psychological effects They also point to the layoff announcements, which seem to have picked up in the last few months for large corporations The AT&T announcement was particularly striking The disarray and closing of the federal government, which affected hundreds of thousands of people directly, may have left people unsure about what kinds of stimuli were coming from the federal sector These factors may have played a role, but the recent downturn in the confidence measures comes after several months of very slow    1/30-31/96  consumption growth So, I am hard pressed to point to anything very tangible to explain why we have had this moderation I guess this is one reason we are in effect giving some weight to the possible indication of some financial distress at a time when the stock market has been booming The latter is certainly an indication that someone does not feel too insecure   Historically, we have not had recessions with the stock market going up It would be astonishing if we were to see a much weaker picture without some softening in the stock market   The anecdotal reports for that industry are quite weak and certainly tend to offset the report of a spurt in sales in December But averaging through that, we still would come out with a moderate sales pace that is quite consistent with the trends that have been in place for a while That does not rule out a downside surprise, of course   It's clear they have made a move to reduce their production this quarter   They perceive that their earlier expectations were too rosy We felt that was true all along, so the shock in terms of our forecast is milder But it has played a role in our perception that this is going to be a pretty weak quarter   It is unusual to have it here in Washington   I am sorry, but I do not have an immediate answer I have seen estimates, but that information is not readily available to me   Mr Chairman, I would like to broaden this a little We did undertake a Systemwide research effort not very long ago I don't think there have been major breakthroughs in the economics profession in the last couple of years that would greatly change the picture The picture was that one could not come up with definitive, compelling evidence that could override people's priors, and their policy judgments in a broader context, about how they should view the value of officially setting our sights on moving the inflation rate down from 3 percent to price stability   I am not talking about the priors of these researchers, which may have varied What we found was that it was very hard to pin these things down It was very hard to get definitive, empirical measures of the costs and benefits of varying inflation between 3 percent and, say, 1 percent as measured by the CPI So, I don't think we are going to be able to solve the Committee's problem through another intense research effort You are going to be confronted with what economists normally provide, something that leaves some considerable room to maneuver You are going to have to confront this issue mainly on other grounds at this point The profession does not have the tools to ascertain the costs of moving the inflation rate by 2 percentage points "
5553,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I take it you are not referring to yesterday's--   I don't have a good answer My sense is that a reduction in herd size probably has not begun in any significant way That remains one of the uncertainties It could be that the markets anticipate that such a development will occur in the not too distant future   Yes We see that as more of a risk as we move out into 1997   The article did echo a couple of the reasons that we stated in the Greenbook Admittedly, we stated those reasons only very briefly   One was the remark about replacement demand I certainly have heard this from people in the industry They feel that in many cases businesses have acquired about all the computers they need The question is how fast they are going to replace those computers, given the changes in technology That was a central theme of yesterday's article It also is clear that businesses confront an ongoing decision about whether to buy or to wait for the next round of technology This is not something we really went into in the Green- book, but it is one of the uncertainties in the forecast We have gone through a number of product cycles At times this has been a significant feature in our thinking--that perhaps people would hold off buying until the Pentium chip became available or some earlier version In this case, the P6 chip that is just coming out might lead to another issue of timing Basically, though, the industry seems to be mature enough at this stage--its penetration of the business market, in particular, seems great enough--that the movements in investment more generally are going to show through in computer purchases If we are in a phase when the accelerator effects are no longer a big plus, we would expect that to show through more in the computer sector than it might have earlier when computers were still increasing dramatically their penetration in the business sector   President Jordan, that's a good question I do not have a ready answer for you Obviously, the deflator has shifted more than the other price indexes   That suggests an element of mix change here It is conceivable that, on further investigation, we shall find that there is something we are not entirely comfortable with in these numbers So, I shall take that question as something for us to investigate before the next round   I should have noted that Because the nominal GDP is higher, there is a bit of a mystery here for us   No, but in the course of a forecast where one needs to align both the income and the product sides of the accounts, the nominal totals are relevant We should not end up with numbers that don't make sense   Let me remind you that the observation was about a forecast made last September That September forecast was put together prior to a total revision of the national income accounts Some of those revisions did affect nominal GDP going back historically I don't want to go too far here I am not certain   Right But the fact is that the largest change in these nominal GDP forecasts for 1997 was between September and November There has been a further upward creep that accumulates to a significant difference from September to now But if one looked at the changes just over the past couple of months, one would see a pretty small creep and it would not be quite so shocking We have to go back and look at this in light of the fact that, as Dave Stockton pointed out, we really did have a total change in the accounts in this period, both in terms of data whose history was revised and concepts that have changed   You are getting into a fundamental question about the whole forecast, and I am focusing more on the fact that, in particular, our consumer price forecast looking out into 1997 did not change a great deal Our real GDP forecast has not changed much either, but we have switched from 1987 dollars to chain-indexed 1992 dollars Allowing for that, our real GDP forecast for 1997 is stronger than it was back in September You have just pointed to a couple of factors that would be relevant to thinking about that one, we have a lower funds rate path than we anticipated at that time; two, we have removed some of the fiscal restraint that was in the forecast looking out through 1997 So, there is a consistency in that respect I was focusing more on this narrower technical question and this relative movement in our price measures That raises an interesting question "
5575,1996-05-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   In 1998, economic growth would remain essentially around trend and the unemployment rate around 5-1/2 percent Our judgment is that the core inflation rate is tending to rise gradually and perhaps it would continue to do so in 1998 We do not think that we are far beyond the NAIRU, and that would mean a very gradual trend in the direction of more inflation   There are some exacerbating factors, as I emphasized in my briefing, and those are areas where the uncertainties are substantial But as we looked at the probability distribution in light of developments since the last Greenbook, we felt that we ought to assign a higher expected value to the levels of grain and food prices down the line That is the most important exacerbating factor   We noted in the Greenbook that we do not feel that we can pin that down with any certainty I think we are already seeing this transmission process affecting the poultry area where producers are cutting back on their production levels, and we expect to see a price pass-through there fairly promptly   We have looked at the futures prices and--   We are making assumptions, but there are no guarantees Certainly, it is our perception that things have started to turn in the cattle area Whereas, a couple of months ago, we saw the risks that herds would be cut back, the anecdotal evidence suggests that this process is now under way So, we feel more certain that there will be that pressure several months down the road   I guess our assumption is that it would probably come out of savings to some degree in the short run Over time, we would expect people to reallocate their spending and to absorb that elsewhere But in the very short run, there probably would be some inelasticity It would not be a one-for-one substitution for other expenditures   There is still an anticipation in the market that oil prices will decline What happened yesterday, though, is that prices in near-term contracts jumped dramatically after their initial drop The market reports talked about the closing out of near-term contracts, some short covering, and so on As we read most of the commentary, though, there is still the expectation that the net effect of the Iraqi oil flow will be to push oil prices down a couple dollars per barrel below what they otherwise would have been It is recognized that in the near term there is going to be some tendency to rebuild stocks, and that may mean that we are not going to get all of this increased supply benefit passing through to retail energy prices very promptly   In terms of our CPI forecast, if we assume that the price of oil declines a little faster, the contour of the forecast changes in that we have a little less inflation this year than next year But at this point, we need to monitor what is happening in the markets   We are well aware of the calculations that show how the grain in a loaf of bread accounts for just a few cents of its cost There has been an increase in packaging and distribution costs so that there is less sensitivity to changes in grain prices than in the past The big kicker here is the meat price story, and there again we are less certain about the timing There have been changes in the production processes, as we have seen dramatically illustrated in the poultry and pork industries So, one does have to be a little cautious in following past patterns here, but we think that ultimately this grain price increase is creating a lot of pressure on margins and will lead to reduced supply That is where the big kicker will come over the forecast period   Perhaps I think we need to see what happens with cereal coupons and all of that business   That underscores again that, while we know something about a good chunk of this year's wheat crop, we know very little about the corn and soybean crop outlook We are making a bet, and the markets are making a bet We are pretty much in line with the markets, but there is going to be a lot of volatility and we are not going to know the outcome for another four or five months I think one's optimism on this score has to be tempered by the fact that inventories are quite low and demand growth seems to be robust enough that one year of good harvests probably will not relieve the pressures entirely   I think that's important whether it's a formal COLA--and COLAs are much less important in the economy today than they    5/21/96  once were--or an informal process, in the sense that employers are conscious of what is happening to the cost of living and have some sort of behavioral norms for adjusting wages in light of changes in the cost of living In any event, there would seem to be a tendency for one-time shocks to be built into wage increases as they engender a certain elevation of expectations about ongoing price increases I think there is little basis for thinking that people will look at this price increase as a one-time shock, that workers will absorb that increase, pass the income willingly on to the farmers, and we won't have any resulting elevation of wage increases with resulting cost pressures To date we don't have a lot of evidence to support this hypothesis, but if one looks at the Michigan survey for early May, coming as it does on the heels of the April survey, the one-year, mean inflation expectations measure has gone up fairly substantially and it seems quite likely that it has been affected by the gasoline price increase We think that increase will be reversed fairly quickly, but as we move out into the second half of 1996, we are going to have, in our forecast at least, food prices increasing more rapidly and we would anticipate that the consumer will be quite sensitive to that change   That's the most direct driving force   As best one can judge, yes   I take it that you are suggesting that we take as given the projected output path and look beyond that The year 1995    5/21/96  is still something of a mystery We had essentially stable unemploy- ment in the face of very low GDP growth One possibility is that GDP growth was mismeasured One hint that we have, and have mentioned previously, is that looking at the addition from the income side one would conclude that GDP should have grown about a percentage point faster That would help to reconcile this behavior I don't want to push that too far We don't know where the truth is in that regard, but it is a possibility Another point is that these relationships are not super tight in the short run There is considerable varia- bility in the Okun's law relationship This means that what happened last year could be viewed as just a random event or we could have some continued disturbance as we go forward Last year, we had very weak growth in the labor force We also had very small increases in household employment These tend to correlate, but perhaps it is arguable that somehow or other we will get some rebound in the growth of the labor force and unemployment will tick up a bit and average out in line with the experience in earlier years But there is nothing to suggest that we ought to think about it that way, and going forward, we have the labor force tending to grow slowly with a flat labor force participation rate That is one uncertainty that we discussed previously, but basically we have a normal alignment of output growth and unemployment movements in our forecast   I think that brings you back then to the question of whether demand really will slacken as quickly and as much as we have in the forecast I indicated that a number of assumptions about the behavior of various sectors underlie that forecast These really have not changed in our view Our basic view has been that we don't see underlying forces in monetary policy, fiscal policy, the dollar, and so on that ought to be expected to produce persistently more rapid or slower growth than potential as we move out In the very short run, we can see a flattening of motor vehicle production The arithmetic relating to that helps us to reduce growth very quickly in our forecast from a more rapid pace in the second quarter to a moderate pace in the third quarter We don't see ongoing, double- digit growth in business fixed investment as plausible, but we recognize some upside risk on the computer side On the consumer side, we could now be seeing the wealth effects that were not perceptible earlier, and if that continued in some significant magnitude our consumption forecast might have an upside risk In housing, the anecdotal indicators and recent survey evidence do not suggest that we are getting the kind of weakening in starts that we have in our forecast, but we are anticipating that there will be a significant drop, maybe fairly quickly So, we can see these upside risks Perhaps there are risks on the downside as well, but I take your point, and I think that I communicated the view that the risk seems at least as great on the upside at this point   We recognize that, because we have a new current population survey that has been in place for only a short time, the short-run movements are very difficult to assess The seasonal factors could have changed, and we don't have enough evidence on what they are doing So, we need to take these numbers with a grain of salt   Well, I can't say that there is a surprise that I can point to I suppose that relative to our forecast one thing that happened last year was that we got a lot of growth in profits We don't see that as out of line with corporate profit reports, but, certainly, as things evolved last year that was one factor that was a surprise Basically, we have had a significant swing in statistical discrepancies, and where that gets reduced, whether it's on the product side or the income side, one can't know Historically, I think you find it somewhere in-between and a little more toward the income side on average   That is something that might be noted about our forecast In essence, disposable income is currently being reduced by the capital gains taxes that we think are probably a significant factor in the heavy tax revenues, and yet that does not show up in income   I find the distinction a little awkward myself, having dealt with these numbers What I have always found strange was that no one changed the numbers after the discussion at the meeting, which may have given people a clearer impression of what the Committee was up to But the numbers stood as they were, presumably as numbers that were based on your optimal policy prescription To divorce that from what is possible in your minds would seem pretty strained to me So, I take this as a matter of emphasis to remind you that, especially for forecasts that extend further out in time, you should be thinking about what you want to achieve and not just producing some forecast based on current conditions, which is what some people have done   We indicate that they are consistent with the monetary ranges that the Committee selected and so on So, they presumably are based on some policy plan That is what the Humphrey- Hawkins Act calls for   President Jordan, I figured that that was what your GDP forecast would embody Are you asking the staff to take each of the members' forecasts and rationalize them in terms of productivity?   Each of you would have a different model and different relationships "
5600,1996-07-02," I think there have been some occasions when we have indicated that the risks in our outlook were asymmetric I would characterize our forecasts over the years as an effort to present a meaningful, modal forecast of the most likely outcome When we felt that there was some skewness to the probability distribution, we tried to identify it In this instance, as we looked at the recent data, we felt that there was a greater thickness in the area of our probability distribution a little above our modal forecast, particularly for the near term, than there was on the other side of our forecast I am very conscious of the fact that we have made some of our biggest mistakes in the past by losing sight of the trends in responding to the run of recent data, and that is part of the reason why I tried to focus some attention on the GDP pattern on a moving-average basis We have been getting very erratic movements in GDP data over the past year or two, and we may well be seeing another episode of that kind I don't feel uncomfortable at all in saying that we think the highest probability is that we are going to experience some significant slackening of the expansion in the near term We can point to some special factors that have lifted growth in the most recent quarter Some of these affected just the second quarter and they were offsets to developments in the first quarter Some may have lifted activity above what the second-quarter level would have been in the absence of various shocks, thus raising the first-half growth rate On balance, we think there is a good case for the slowing scenario, but we also can see an alternative scenario with somewhat faster growth in the near term than we have projected   Roughly   I would say that is one of the things that we feel the least discomfort about We are forecasting fairly steady, moderate growth in productivity We don't start off with any major disequilibria that we can see in terms of employers having hired well beyond production levels A trend increase in productivity seems entirely reasonable in these circumstances I think the question is whether the trend from here will be what it has been over an extended period As I said, the trend has been pretty steady since 1973, and obviously we have discussed many times around this table whether recent higher levels of investment or changes in technology and so on    7/2-3/96  might bring about some acceleration in productivity growth We have not seen it yet; the most recent figures don't indicate it So, we are staying pretty much with a fairly straightforward extrapolation of recent trends   That is a quite reasonable question, and I certainly would not see it as implausible to have the bond market rallying beyond our assumption for some period of time In my view, the only thing that would tend to limit such a rally in terms of how far down yields might go permanently is that we don't have a particularly steep yield curve at this point And if one hypothesized that a few months down the road the economy is perceived to be on a stable, sustainable, and moderate growth course with inflation perhaps creeping up, I would not expect--with the assumed 5-1/4 percent federal funds rate--to see the bond yield go a lot lower than we anticipate Basically, we have the long bond moving down to a range of somewhere around 6-3/4 percent It would not be surprising that a run of softer data would induce a bond rally that would bring the yield noticeably below that level How far down the yield on the long bond would be expected to go an ongoing basis, I think, is the question Clearly, there are some in the market who are talking about 6 percent bond yields and in terms of the variability we have been seeing in the market--the overshooting--that level is well within reach on a run of appealing data   I don't know how much useful excess capacity is left in the United States I suspect that when we tote the numbers up it looks as if there is a lot, but when we look at current production problems, we see that, for those categories of cars and trucks that people want to buy, the manufacturers would like to build more than they currently can It isn't simply a matter of assembly capacity In many cases the capacity limits are in the production of some key components -- engines and so on So, effectively there may not be a lot of slack in this country I suspect there is some considerable slack in Japan at this point and maybe elsewhere When we talk about yearly sales of 15 million units or a little more on an ongoing basis, I guess I can't quarrel with that too much I think the foremost authority in the room on replacement demand is the Chairman He has done some research on this subject in the last few years Looking at the results of that analysis, 15 million would seem to be a little high But if you talk about an economy in which incomes are rising and people have a taste for having more motor vehicles per household -- maybe everyone wants to have a sport utility car, a family sedan, and who knows what else -- perhaps there is a potential for higher ongoing demand I think the automobile manufacturers are looking at forecasts based on trends that are a little higher than we have in our forecast   Well, I will yield to my colleague, who is much more expert on this, but there is, in a sense, a discontinuity here Some of the adjustments we are making have to do with the arithmetic that perhaps you can view as fairly predictable When it gets to things like changing the way in which costs of medical care are calculated, there are real underlying economic considerations involved and the relationships could shift   We have tried to make a sensible assessment of how movements in the old and new versions would go and that is what led us to make the adjustments that we did, but I think that all this is a little problematic   If we look at the constant quality or repeat sales prices, there has been some pickup in house price inflation over the past year or so This is uneven across the country Your regional market may be experiencing some pressures that we wouldn't find elsewhere   I don't recall that that stood out in any major way in the Michigan Survey, for example, where people are able to cite that kind of factor as a reason why they think this is a good time to buy a home   We would take this as a reasonable representation of where productivity is relative to the trend and say that we are pretty close to trend growth, thus arguing against a big pickup or decline in the near term   We do have corresponding numbers   Yes, we are talking just several tenths of a percent, very much in line with our NAIRU  -13-    7/2-3/96   For average hourly earnings, the charts that we look at are dramatic if we take the latest observation and think about it in terms of the 12-month change We recognize that there was an odd reading a year earlier that will drop out when we get the next reading, and we would not be surprised to see the 12-month change move from 34 percent in the latest month back toward 3 percent That would still be above the lows we saw a couple of years ago and it gives us a sense of an upward movement, but it would be more the kind of creeping movement that we would have anticipated, given price behavior and what we perceive to be the moderate size of the gap between unemployment and the NAIRU over this period On the ECI, looking at the composition, looking at what happened in terms of sales workers and some of the unevenness in those figures, we think it likely that we are going to see some considerable slackening in the rate of increase in this wage measure in the second quarter   I was told that we would be trying to get that, but I have not heard anything   What we are anticipating might yield a considerable narrowing of the gap between the recent levels of those two measures I guess I would characterize that chain-weighted measure as having moved pretty much in a sideways channel over the last year as opposed to an upward sloping channel I still think the regular average hourly earnings series and the compensation per hour data from productivity and costs, which don't have fixed weights, can also yield some useful information about what is going on within the labor market that is relevant to thinking about pressures on prices That is, a markup might be applied to this kind of compensation measure   Again, we have not explored this in great depth but the concern might be that, in the cyclical experience, one sees these changing weight measures as tending to accelerate, perhaps as an early signal of the broader pressures in the labor market So, I think it's worth looking at all these measures, and certainly that chain-weighted measure does suggest there may be some complexity in this picture, which is worth some investigation   Well, there are a lot of definitional problems, and I suspect some firms that have to fill out that form are confronted with a real challenge in sorting through the instructions   One can reach that conclusion One has! [Laughter]   I think that's right   That's right   About 5 percent from where we were as of last night   On the latter point, it is not at all clear as we look at various reports of analysts' expectations that our profit forecast is really lower than what is anticipated in the market now So, that leads me to characterize this expectation as being in essence some faith in gravity We have a feeling that the market has been defying it to some extent recently It's not that every current measure of aggregate valuation is outside of historical ranges by any means But when we look at some of the internal aspects of the market -- the IPO craze and some of the other things going on -- and look at  -15-    7/2-3/96  that against a backdrop of some high valuation measures, it suggests to us that there is room for at least a moderate downturn   Usually it doesn't work when you expect it to, either So, the fact is that the market, as of last night, is significantly above where we though it might be just a couple days before In the last half year or so we have consistently had to raise our stock market forecast in the Greenbook   Mr Chairman?   Could I remind Committee members that there is an opportunity to submit revisions of their forecasts? It would be very helpful to us if those could be sent to me by close of business on Monday to give us time to incorporate them in our draft of the Humphrey-Hawkins report  -112-    7/2-3/96 -113- "
5625,1996-08-20," Charles Siegman will start us off this morning, Mr Chairman   [Statement--see Appendix]   I am not aware of any Certainly, in this particular set of circumstances, were there not to be a major damping of underlying demand trends--and I do not see why that would necessarily occur from a strike of plausible duration--the attempt to make up the lost production to meet the pent-up demand for autos would press pretty hard on capacity The GM strike in March, as we have seen, created some turbulence in the data, and GM had to press production pretty hard after the strike In that recent period, we did not see major price increases in the auto industry So, the bottleneck there does not seem to have resulted in a lot of inflationary pressure   Our understanding is it would not occur before the expiration of the contract, which I believe is September 14 So, we presumably will have some information around the time of the next meeting The strike target is, as I gather, to be announced on August 22  SPEAKER(?) August 22   I would just note that in this auto industry situation there also are peculiarities that people will be focusing on in terms of whether the union is able effectively to set a pattern after they have negotiated an agreement with one of the auto makers I think there are major questions about the mechanics of this negotiation process with the three auto makers So, there will be a lot of grist for the analytical mills that look at how labor relations work   There is little I can say at this point because I do not really know the details of these revised data One obvious implication is that, if our estimates are correct, we will have stronger final sales and stronger output We also will get the same kind of inventory level that we estimated before, which suggests that inventory positions may be even leaner relative to sales than we had anticipated Obviously, that might have some favorable implications going forward Now, we are not talking about night and day differences, but we would lean in that direction We also want to look for whatever evidence of export trends there may be in these data, and we shall have to make a careful assessment of that Charles, maybe you know more   This nominal GDP change is so small that it is going to be very hard to pin down all the factors that go into it from different directions I don't think there is a major story here because, as I have said before, we do not approach the forecast in terms of taking interest rate assumptions and from that drawing directly a forecast of nominal GDP It is a complex process There has been a reassessment of some of the price series and relationships that have crept into the analysis We do have a situation where we have a bit more inflationary pressure because of (1) a lower starting point for the unemployment rate, (2) the minimum wage hike, and (3) we  -10-    8/20/96  are impressed by the wage data in the first half of the year that are tending to push us to a forecast that has a little more of an inflationary cast Given the nominal funds rate, we have a little more inflation and a monetary policy that is a little more accommodative as measured by real interest rates If you put these things together, they end up producing a nominal GDP path that is a little higher even with essentially the same real path   We have a monetary accommodation implicit in our forecast   We let the money stock be whatever it will be Whether it actually comes out faster in our forecast is also a function of how the recent developments have influenced our views of the money demand relationship We do not have faster money stock growth in this forecast   What we assume is that monetary growth will accommodate the maintenance of a nominal funds rate in the face of the growth of aggregate demand   We do not think there is enough of a slowdown in our forecast to relieve inflationary pressures Basically, what we  -11-    8/20/96  see is that the evidence on wage behavior in the first half of this year supports the view that we are operating at a level of resource utilization that is incompatible with maintenance of a steady rate of inflation in the economy We are not in such tight conditions, particularly looking at the capacity utilization side of the picture as well as the labor market side, that we would anticipate, absent external shocks, a very rapid pickup in inflation But we would expect some gradual updrift   I think our confidence in our assessment of the implications of this level of resource utilization has grown with the latest wage figures   I've observed what you well know, that the data certainly are supportive of the notion that there has been in the past couple of years a continued quite rapid improvement in productivity in manufacturing We get reports from business executives that they can produce as many widgets now as they did a few years ago with twice as many workers then I think the data are not completely inconsistent  -12-    8/20/96  with the reports we get anecdotally from the manufacturing sector In some of the nonmanufacturing sectors, we get into the difficult problem of measuring the output, and it is conceivable that output growth is being underestimated The only caveat in this regard is that, when we look on an aggregate level at what has been happening to output and what has been happening to unemployment, the relationship has held up reasonably well We had some veering off seemingly in 1995, but we now seem to be pretty much back on track with that basic Okun's law relation Ultimately, we think that is of critical importance because it tells us where resource utilization levels are headed for given measured levels of output growth "
5649,1996-09-24," [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think I can comment very productively on your point about what future revisions may show We do not have a basis for a judgment about whether the allowances that the BLS makes in blowing up their samples for new firms and other statistical problems are on target this time or not To be sure, there have been sizable revisions at times in the past On the broader point, as I tried to suggest, we certainly do see evidence that hiring has continued to be quite robust, probably outstripping the trend increase in labor force growth However, I am not sure how much that tells us about things going forward It may be in essence that this reflects the strong production gains that we have seen recently rather than the anticipation of much more rapid growth in business than we have projected I think the indicators of business sentiment that we have suggest that firms are anticipating growth, but not necessarily growth that differs greatly from what we are forecasting It is a risk, and certainly this is a part of the picture where households that have enjoyed very sizable income gains recently, and probably are continuing to do so in September, add a certain buoyancy in the economy that is visible in consumer sentiment That is probably a response to the very favorable labor market environment "
5672,1996-11-13," We are just moving too fast!   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   I think there always is a question about the behavior of the saving rate, particularly when we are estimating it ahead of the annual revisions of the NIPAs We have seen saving rate trajectories altered considerably by those statistical revisions Given that we feel that GDP growth may have been underestimated, it is not inconceivable that a part of those revenues could be in consumption expenditures I do not have any particular insight on that, but that may be one aspect of the situation that should make one cautious about jumping to conclusions But on the face of it--   I cannot give you an answer to that off the top of my head   Obviously, each time they do their quarterly estimate, they try to reconcile the income and product sides If they find income is stronger, they are presumably going to look for    11/13/96  opportunities to find product and add it in But I think they are limited by their source data And now they are running behind on the updating of the benchmarking to Census surveys and so on because they were unable to do their regular annual revisions That said, and recognizing that the data may be throwing us a curve, one would have anticipated over the past couple of years, all other things equal, that the saving rate would have declined appreciably in light of that increase in wealth The saving rate might have been depressed by 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point this year relative to a path that would be consistent with a stable wealth-to-income ratio, say, since the end of 1994 The apparent updrift that we have seen creates a considerable differential from that, and so we look to other possible factors One of them, as we have noted for some time, may be the fact that the wealth gains are not evenly distributed across the population A considerable number of households that have built up debts may now be restricting their spending The tightening of credit availability has contributed something, even if it has not been very great to this point Earlier we were seeing a liberalization of credit availability and that could have been enhancing consumption growth; now the credit effect presumably is moving in the other direction We also have offered a laundry list of other rumored factors that may be affecting the saving rate such as greater concerns about retirement security, particularly in light of the perception that Social Security may not be there fully for people now in the workforce; Medicare and Medicaid issues that might suggest less security about medical coverage later on; and the general notion of job insecurity While we do not see clear evidence that by historical standards people are unusually uncertain at this point about job prospects, there remains some general sense that all is not well and that jobs are not secure, so there could be some rise in precautionary saving levels   We do have some increase in real wages We have diminishing profit shares So, some shift is occurring in income shares   I should defer to our foremost authority on this, Mr Stockton   I should note that our estimates of the effects of these changes in method, or the market basket change in 1998, are somewhat conjectural It is not a simple, mechanical arithmetic story, and that is truer in some cases than in others But these are estimates; they are not engraved in stone I would remind the Committee that the Boskin Group is slated to come out with their final report on the bias by December I do not think we have any inside information on whether they will be revising their estimates up or down, but there certainly will be considerable focus on the issue at that time    11/13/96   That is right, yes   Well, final sales for the quarter could be changed at least noticeably, maybe not importantly, by a possible revision to September retail sales to be published tomorrow Moreover, we have yet to receive the net exports data for September, which are always a wild card At least some modest change in that number is possible, but at this point we would not expect a major change in the PCE estimate based on retail sales We are talking mainly about September In effect, enough of the quarter is known at this point that there is not going to be a big surprise In addition, there is only one more month of trade data So, we know it was a weak quarter for final sales  The inventory situation is harder to gauge at this point Built into the estimate that we gave you is the BEA assumption about retail inventory investment It is a moderate number We did not see any reason to quarrel with it, but the translation of these data into real inventory change is difficult There is a further wild card here in that a lot of the surprise in the wholesale trade inventory numbers was in food products There is some question about whether BEA might decide that, if it did not show up in those numbers, the food was still on the farm and maybe some adjustment should be made in farm inventories Nothing that we have been able to glean from discussions with BEA or from their previous behavior would lead us to assign a high probability of their making some ad hoc adjustment here, but it is a possibility   I think the numbers will probably hold up fairly well As I said, they may not be accurate numbers, but we have no basis for gauging a bias one way or the other We do not perceive that the trend in the growth of consumption has moderated to the degree that those third-quarter numbers might suggest   If I'm asked again, I might give a different answer!    11/13/96   Not highly confident, given the statistical uncertainties that I indicated We can imagine a number a little lower; we can imagine a number a little higher You will recall that one of the fundamental factors in our thinking about the third quarter was that the labor input was quite ample, and the income side would suggest there was room for considerably more growth On the other hand, when we looked at the first half of this year or the second quarter, we did not always see these things tracking perfectly; there was some averaging out The basic trend of growth in the mid-two's for this year seems fairly reasonable relative to the behavior of the unemployment rate, to other measures of labor input, and to our general sense that things had picked up and were running somewhat above the long-term trend   We have some notional views about proportions of the population that might be liquidity constrained or not liquidity constrained So, embedded in some models is a perspective on that But in preparing our forecast, we are not thinking of this on a disaggregated basis   Transfer income has been relatively strong, and to an extent that might lead one to have expected fairly firm consumption relative to aggregate income   Thank you [Laughter] Let me just say once again that our forecast is not based on the monetary aggregates Rather, we derive what we would expect in terms of monetary aggregate growth through our assessment of likely patterns of money demand consistent with the interest rates and economic activity we are forecasting That is a different framework than I think you are suggesting for thinking about the outlook for nominal GDP As we look ahead, we see an economy that is operating above potential and a gradual acceleration of inflation In such an economy, the growth of real output tends to erode gradually over time We anticipate some gradual deceleration in real output growth from 1996 to 1997 and 1998 I think there is a coherence to this, and nominal GDP is just a summation of these forces as we see the picture I do not have a particular view about 1999, but certainly we are coming out of 1998 in no better position with respect to the alleviation of inflationary pressures in the labor markets So, we would anticipate at this point an extrapolation of that gradual acceleration of inflation "
5698,1996-12-17," Mr Chairman, in this case the reference is to the staff forecast, and the question is how to portray the movement of inflation in 1996, 1997, and 1998 and its relationship to--   In essence, it refers to the Greenbook forecast We could go back to the original wording in the preliminary draft of the minutes or we could put in something that says the price forecast is adjusted for technical changes   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   As I recall, it is up about 3/10 of a percent   They account for a very small portion, as you know, of the overall index   You mean the quarterly average?   Exactly, it's a very small weight in the outcome for the quarter, but we have been looking at the other evidence such as trends in orders, and we are comfortable in anticipating a moderate increase   We feel comfortable with that at this point We are anticipating that, in part because of the effects of the cold weather that showed up in the utilities component of IP in November, the energy component of PCE services would be quite robust in November I don't know what to make of all the anecdotal reports on Christmas sales activities, but I will note for what it is worth--and it may not be very much, for even though it has gained some prominence, it is a very small sample--that the Mitsubishi chain store report that came out this morning showed a quite sharp further increase in the latest week So, we have had a couple of weeks of distinct upward movement there We have heard other good things about retail sales So we are reasonably comfortable, especially given that--going back to the Chairman's arithmetic point--a deviation of a few tenths in the outcome for December will have only a modest effect on annualized growth rates   Not materially  -10-    12/17/96   More likely up than down given, for example, the stronger industrial production data Also, the single-family housing starts will feed through rather directly in the calculation of residential construction activity in the current quarter and add a smidge So, the adjustment might be in an upward direction but nothing of great significance "
5723,1997-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Ted suggests it is because we set a low standard previously [Laughter]  But I will try to take it more positively   Perhaps, but not so much that I felt the need to feature that aspect of the  picture There are some sectors where historically one would look for positive serial correlation  The fact that consumption was as strong as it was according to the published numbers, though  only a little stronger than we had forecast, might lead us on the basis of historical experience to  anticipate ongoing strength to some degree On the other hand, the personal saving rate was  lower than we had forecast On still another hand, the fourth-quarter outcome may be a sign that  the wealth effect is beginning to show through more importantly and that one of the upside risks  that we have noted for some time now is coming more into play than we sensed in the fourth  quarter Those durable goods categories may be a place where that would occur  In the area of business fixed investment, nonresidential structures were stronger In  fact, our reading of the construction put-in-place data for December released just yesterday  suggests that there might even be a slight upward revision in that number for the fourth quarter  However, I am not inclined to view that report as a sign of even greater strength going forward  In fact, the spike in such construction was so sharp that there probably will be a slight tendency  for it to drop off in the near term, at least in growth rate terms  In the residential construction area, we made a very substantial error That was an  error that we should not have made in our translation of housing starts into residential    2/4-5/97  investment We did not anticipate that the estimates of housing starts and residential investment  would be brought back into line as quickly as they were We think that, going forward, the  changes in residential investment that we have been anticipating remain reasonable The data on  new home sales that we got today still look about the same as in November; they seem to  confirm our notion that housing activity has perhaps stabilized at the about the level we were  anticipating So, we would not have a new view of the outlook for residential investment The  other aspect of this is that, if we have a level adjustment in GDP that does imply more output  That might call for more inputs and a somewhat lower unemployment rate than we have in our  forecast But the difference here, given our interpretation of the GDP data, is so small that it  really is not material to the outlook   You will recall that we learned nothing new about the level of resource  utilization in the fourth quarter as measured by unemployment or capacity utilization So, there  is a question of alignment here In the fourth quarter, by Okun's law equations, we found the  unemployment rate to be a little higher than we might have expected, given our GDP path This  new number suggests an even greater excess We had been anticipating that we were going to    2/4-5/97  catch up, with more of a drop in the near term than suggested by the rule-of-thumb applied to the  quite modest increases in output that we were forecasting for the first part of this year We  would just, I think, continue in that vein It would be, in a sense, a bigger catchup But any  adjustment we make would perhaps be on the order of 1 percent on the unemployment rate, and  it is a tough call We would have to think about whether we would want to alter productivity  slightly from the higher level One has to consider other possibilities as well I just do not think  it is a material difference as we are interpreting the data   Because it is such a long period, there are a lot of quarters to put into  these buckets   I cannot tell you how many quarters there are in each of those inflation  ranges; I probably should have checked that In terms of the broad sweep, if you look at a chart  of inflation versus the P-E ratios--all the noise in the relationship makes it a little hard to see--  you can perceive this correlation There are reasons that are propounded for why this pattern  might occur There are differences of opinion, but it's not difficult to come up with reasons that  might lead one to believe that there is this kind of correlation Clearly, that is not the whole story  in assessing whether P-E ratios are abnormally high, abnormally low, or right on the historical    2/4-5/97  norms One needs to think about the interest rates that are prevailing at these times; one has to  think about the expected earnings growth at these times Perhaps because of the phase of the  business cycle, and apart from whatever inflation might lead one to think about the stability of  the outlook, other factors could affect what kind of risk premium one wants for investing in  equities as opposed to fixed income   To be fair, this table is just a slight variation of the one Abby Cohen has  used As you know, she has been among the most bullish and the most correct stock market  forecasters This is one of the key exhibits she presents in support of her opinion   I can pick one that was widely discussed, namely the behavior of the  nonproduction bonus component of benefits It struck many people on Wall Street who were  pocketing huge bonuses as out of keeping with reality However, as best we can tell, this is  probably at least in part a matter of timing If the bonuses were not paid by mid-December, they  will be picked up in the March ECI It could be that these are errant numbers reflecting just  some sampling problems Conceivably, the firms with the big bonuses might not have been in  the sample So, there may still be grounds for residual doubt about the accuracy there We have    2/4-5/97  not found any smoking guns that tell us that we should look at these numbers with a jaundiced  eye They are reasonably credible, I think   That is what I read in the newspapers   Our supposition is that a lot of this discussion just did not recognize that  a good share of the bonuses will be paid out after December   I don't know whether that timing is new, though I think there has been  some shifting over time In part, it is inconvenient in terms of tax planning to get this big slug of  money very late in the year But I think there are other considerations, too   My recollection is it that it is up 2-1/2 percent   Yes That is based on a reasonably firm view of what the nonfarm  business output was for the quarter but only a tentative view about what the total hours worked  ultimately will look like We think we have a reasonable handle on it It will probably be in the  2-1/2 percent vicinity   We aren't certain and I don't see how anyone really could be in this  area We had clung with great determination to the assumption that the underlying growth trend  in this decade would prove to be 11 percent We have been continuing to reassess this  assumption, and I guess particularly because this meeting is one of those when a longer-run  perspective may be important to the Committee's deliberations, we took another hard look at it  What we perceived was that a trend line well below our 11 percent growth assumption clearly  would fit in a more natural way what we had been experiencing up through at least the third  quarter of last year The historical pattern is that productivity tends to be above the trend in level  terms until almost the end of an expansion, if not all the way to the end of the expansion, and it  then dips down below trend during a recession and the early recovery phase and subsequently  moves back up What we found is that, with a 11 percent trend line, we were well below that  trend line now and have been for a while even though the expansion has not come to an end  That just did not fit Something like 7 percent gave a picture that looked more like the recent  history Now, there may be reasons why earlier historical patterns would not hold this time The  adjustments of labor to output in the short run may be different, and so on But, when the  divergence persists over several years, that is a troubling pattern  We also noted that there were reasons to think that output, and thus productivity, may  have been underestimated over the last few years The question is how much One could look  at the difference between gross domestic income and gross domestic product--a difference that  has become quite sizable--and conclude that production really has been much stronger than the  data suggest and productivity greatly understated But looking at the history of revisions and    2/4-5/97  what little we know about what might be the flaws in the income-product data, we thought that  was a rather aggressive assumption about what true output and productivity had been So we in a  sense compromised We did assume that the trend in actual levels of productivity has been  understated in recent years, but only by enough for us to try to square things by assuming about  9 percent trend growth in productivity The fourth-quarter number actually is reasonably helpful  in getting a picture that looks sensible with that kind of trend line Now, this would naturally  feed through to our potential output assumption, but there are offsetting considerations When  we looked at the trends in the average workweek and the factors that get us from nonfarm  business output to GDP and so on, we were led to conclude that an estimate of about 19 percent  for the period since 1990 still looked pretty good So, we have not changed our potential output  trend; it is still about 19 percent per year, chain-weighted on a 1992 base   That was another factor We looked at Okun's Law It has worked  pretty well   It does not in itself suggest that output growth has been a lot more rapid  than measured That also gives one pause because, while Okun's Law is not a relationship one  can depend on from quarter to quarter or even year to year, over extended periods it works pretty  well So, that gave us some pause as to whether we should maintain the seemingly optimistic  view that the productivity trend was 11 percent Having to adjust that trend, we also adjusted    2/4-5/97  our sights on what actual productivity growth would be over 1997-1998, and that is how we  formulated our forecast   We get desperate sometimes "
5746,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   On our interpretation, there probably has been some positive effect  on consumption over the past year or so from the increase in financial wealth Setting aside  measurement problems, that effect likely has in reality been offset at least to some degree by  an increased propensity to save based on concerns about retirement income and for other  precautionary reasons Going forward, we would interpret our forecast as continuing to  incorporate some positive wealth effect, but again with these other factors tending to balance  that Because we have assumed that the stock market tops out as we move into the latter part  of this year and then declines noticeably in 1998, the wealth-to-income ratio falls back a  considerable distance toward where it was several years ago That tends to diminish the  wealth effect as we move out in 1998 Another factor to keep in mind is that we have had a  surge in income growth over the past year or so It would be natural, given a permanent  income view, for spending to lag a bit and for the saving rate, all other things equal, to edge    3/25/97  up a bit As income decelerates over the next year or so, we might still be getting some  adjustment in consumption that would then tend to result in the saving rate edging lower So,  we see a number of counteracting forces that we have tried, at least judgmentally, to balance  in a sensible way in the forecast   75 basis points   We felt quite uneasy about what kind of message the forecast would  convey had we retained the assumption of a flat nominal funds rate We perceived that the  underlying strength of demand has been greater than we expected Extrapolating that to  some degree, it exacerbates what we already saw as a fundamental instability I think this  was highlighted in some of the longer-run simulations in the last Bluebook, where we  stretched the projections out a bit Perhaps it became clearer to you there that what we  foresaw with unchanged nominal interest rates was in essence a path where resource  utilization was going to continue to be well above sustainable levels Following up on that  analysis, we thought that the assumed uptilt in the funds rate would be a natural way to    3/25/97  indicate that at some point nominal interest rates probably would have to rise to avoid  excessive stimulus We built in something that is on a par with what is happening to the core  CPI and to some of the broader GDP-related price measures   For all practical purposes the assumed rise in the funds rate is  tantamount in terms of the economic outcome to your not doing anything over the period  1997 and 1998   But I thought it might be a useful signal here of what we now  perceive to be the longer-term unsustainability of the scenario that we have been drawing in  prior Greenbooks   I guess it is a matter of interpretation as to what the opportunistic  approach entails If it entails making sure that the inflation rate does not move above the  recent range, then our forecast implies that a policy move is necessary at some point  Whether that means a relatively aggressive approach or something that involves a continued  ""wait and see"" stance and moving later, I don't think we can readily discern But the fact is    3/25/97  that our forecast does imply that, in an underlying sense, consumer price inflation is moving  above the 3 percent mark in 1998 If you view that as a ceiling in the range of acceptable  outcomes and the point where you want to apply the brakes, then I suppose you could argue  that a more aggressive approach than that associated with our baseline forecast is the one that  is consistent with opportunism But that is in the eye of the beholder I do not think we can  define its application that precisely   The ""maybe"" is an important qualifier That is not our baseline  forecast, but again these are matters of definition We do have a forecast that, given current  money market conditions, now sees the most likely outcome as above-trend growth for an  extended period and an unemployment rate that falls to 5 percent or less In some sense, you  could regard that as boom conditions even without going to the more dramatic, stronger  growth scenario that I suggested was a risk Why has this occurred? I think we consistently  said that we did not see the stimulus that would maintain above-trend growth, so we kept  forecasting that growth was going to fall back to something like trend for lack of a  compelling reason that it should not  What has happened? That is very hard to sort out If we look at consumer  behavior, for example, we have not had a drop in the saving rate It is true that the stock    3/25/97  market has been much stronger than we anticipated We have had a tremendous increase in  financial wealth that either has reflected or supported a tremendous surge in consumer  sentiment We are at very high levels of consumer confidence according to the Michigan or  the Conference Board surveys The current Michigan index is the highest since 1965, and in  only a few months in the history of that index have there been numbers this high I think  there is at this point some buoyancy in consumer demand beyond what we would have  anticipated We see very lean inventories We continue to be surprised on the upside by the  strength in computer investment; we have had some very strong numbers We seem to be  getting a more solid performance in nonresidential construction than we anticipated You  will recall that we were somewhat puzzled by weak contracts data through much of last year,  but they tended to catch up with an enormous burst in the fourth quarter All the anecdotal  evidence suggests there is more momentum in that sector than was apparent six months ago,  and that has multiplier effects The upside surprise seems to be a collection of things that  have supplied a considerable lift to economic activity At this point, while we are still  somewhat in the spirit of saying that economic growth probably will move back toward  trend, we see an economy that seems to have considerable momentum, and we are not  optimistic that the moderation in growth is going to occur overnight Basically, one of the  things we learned was that financial conditions were not imposing as much restraint on the  economy as we thought they would "
5768,1997-05-20," I am not aware that anyone has tried that; it is an interesting idea It  sounds like a lot of work   I am not sure that we have that much free computer space right  now! We can check into it   Thank you very much, Mr Chairman Carol Low is distributing a  table to which I will be referring in a couple of minutes [Statement--see Appendix]   You are talking about the natural rate of interest, I presume   I guess one could interpret what I have said about the stocks of  capital goods and so on as implying a lower natural rate going forward One could look at  this from various vantage points Whether, indeed, one should view the development of  surprisingly strong growth over the past year as a favorable supply shock, I am not sure  There certainly are some elements in the picture that support that view The labor force  growth that we have had over the past year might fall in that category If one felt that we  were seeing something more than the normal kind of cyclical kick to productivity over the  past couple of quarters as output growth surged, say from strengthened aggregate demand,  then that might be characterized as a supply shock I am not sure that conclusion is clearcut  Indeed, by our normal rules of thumb and model results, I do not think we have had any  more productivity acceleration in the past couple of quarters than one would have expected  with a surge in aggregate demand, a rise in output, and firms being able to get more mileage  out of their existing resources   Barring some shift in the demand for money--this is almost  tautological--we would expect to see slower money growth with the moderation in nominal  GDP expansion that we are anticipating But our forecast in a sense says that, on an  intermediate-term basis rather than looking quarter-to-quarter and defining movements in  natural rates of interest in that sense, we have the actual rate too low relative to the natural  rate to bring us back to equilibrium between actual and potential output In other terms, we  have an ongoing gap between the natural unemployment rate and the actual unemployment  rate and some tendency for inflation to pick up   As we have pointed out previously, the money demand relationship,  the relationship of velocity and opportunity cost, has been quite stable over the past couple of  years And we have not had a big movement in interest rates, so you would expect close to  equal growth of M2 and nominal GDP "
5789,1997-07-01," Let me emphasize that this is partly a matter of the peculiarity of the  timing We really don't like to attempt to pin down the dimension, let alone the timing, of this  adjustment   But we had to do this We have it starting essentially at the end of this  year and continuing relatively steadily through 1998 Given the normal lags estimated for the  wealth effects, we will not see a lot of the impact until the very end of the period and in 1999  That is why it does not loom so large    7/1-2/97   The emphasis is on ""again"" [Laughter]   I think we are only talking about 02 on this scale I don't think it  would greatly alter the recent picture   It's a question of starting points for thinking about this   You will recall that our unified deficit forecast for the next fiscal year is  somewhat larger than the deficit for this fiscal year On a calendar-year basis, because of the  timing of borrowing and other means of payment or cash flows in the federal government, we  have more of a step-up in borrowing than one would have expected on the basis of the unified  deficits for the two fiscal years   I think that the model reflects the importance of price expectations in  this process in a very simple way That is why we do not have the long-run tradeoff If  expectations change gradually over time, we are going to have short-run tradeoffs   The tradeoff is there in a sense, but it is obscured by the big drop in oil  prices That has shifted the short-run Phillips curve    7/1-2/97 "
5814,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the opening sentence of the Greenbook, we characterized the economy as continuing ""to hum along in recent months"" As of last Thursday, we were able to report that hiring remained strong and that high-spirited consumers were once again spending heavily at auto dealers and other retail outlets Now we can report that homebuilders are busy, too According to this morning's release, which is summarized in the table you received, total housing starts were unchanged in July, as we expected Single-family starts rose 3 percent, just a hair above our guess, but permits for such units were off 2 percent On the whole, these data, along with the upbeat report from the homebuilders survey for early August, would seem to support our view that the housing sector is doing quite well at this juncture  Indeed, the basic point is that the indicators now in hand provide few direct hints that economic expansion will be limited to the relatively moderate path that we think is ahead We are predicting that real GDP growth will average just 2-1/4 percent over the next few quarters--well below the 3-1/4 percent rate of the past year And as you know, a slowing of at least this degree likely is necessary, given our assessment of the trend of potential, if we are to avoid a further intensification of pressures in an already taut labor market  Unfortunately, our near-term growth forecast hinges crucially on a judgment about the outlook for inventories--a very tricky element to predict In a nutshell, we find it difficult to believe that the pace of accumulation in the second quarter was as high as the available statistics indicate But, after discounting the data as much as we feel comfortable doing at this point, we are still left with a rate of inventory growth that is clearly unsustainable-- around a 6 percent annual rate We don't think there were major overhangs of undesired stocks at midyear, but there will be if the accumulation doesn't slow soon Our guess is that it will, exerting an appreciable damping influence on GDP growth in the second half of this year  What could go wrong with this forecast? The possibilities are numerous One is that the rate of accumulation could have been even lower than we have assumed, so that the near-term drag on output might therefore be less than we are anticipating It's my intuition that this should be viewed as the more likely alternative to our Greenbook forecast than that inventory investment has been greater than we have assumed    8/19/97  But what if we have the rate of inventory investment in the second quarter just right? The possibility would still exist that businesses will want to maintain that brisk pace of accumulation a little longer because they are highly optimistic about sales prospects However, I don't sense such a degree of optimism now; nor am I as concerned as I was earlier that final demand might seriously overshoot our forecast, in turn generating additional inventory requirements  In particular, we have been noting for some time the risk that consumer demand might yet surge in response to the enormous run-up in stock market wealth Now that the national income accounts show the personal saving rate declining considerably over the past couple of years, the likelihood of such a spending surge would seem to have diminished Moreover, for what it is worth as we look ahead, the flip side of this argument is that we can perhaps also be somewhat more confident that there will indeed be some demand-damping effect if the stock market drops, as we are still predicting it will The wavering of the market recently might suggest we are on the right track in that regard, but we have been wrong before  There are uncertainties regarding other components of final demand as well, but I think our forecast is reasonably balanced overall I won't take the time to run through all the sectors of demand, but Ted and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have  Before concluding, however, I would like to say a few words about the price outlook We continue to believe that a pickup in inflation is brewing out there in a very tight labor market, but it clearly has not surfaced yet As you undoubtedly noticed, we have lowered our forecast of price inflation again--this time by a couple of tenths of a percent through next year  The incoming wage and price indexes provided only a bit of the motivation for this adjustment The ECI for June and the CPIs for June and July were no more than a rounding difference below our expectations But we saw other grounds as well for some greater optimism about the price outlook  Notably, while we think the recent run-up in the dollar is unlikely to hold up permanently, it seems prudent to anticipate only a gradual erosion in its value over the forecast period Consequently, we have anticipated a tad more restraint on inflation coming through the trade sector in coming quarters Certainly, the auto market is demonstrating the efficacy of import competition as an inflation fighter, as the Big Three have cut prices to save market share  In addition, however, the prospects of competitive pressures damping inflation seem greater now because the inventory adjustment is likely to    8/19/97  contribute to some slippage in the level of factory capacity utilization Moreover, the revised NIPA data suggest that profits have been much stronger and that corporations have more cushion to absorb some increase in labor costs Finally, there has been increasing evidence of a gradual downdrift in inflation expectations among individuals, for example in the Michigan SRC survey, which bodes well for the nominal wage outlook  Speaking of wages, in refining our inflation forecast, we obviously did not give much weight to a concern that surfaced occasionally last week when commentators were looking for excuses for the stock market decline-- namely, that the UPS strike might signal a major shift in the balance of power in the labor market, with workers now being able to dictate the terms and conditions of employment In particular, there was a fear that the outcome would be an erosion of firms' ability to use part-time and contingent workers at lower cost What we have heard of the settlement does suggest that the Teamsters won some significant pay gains for part-timers and 10,000 promised conversions of part-time jobs to full-time over the next five years But, pending receipt of more information about the agreement, it is far from obvious that what has happened would warrant a change in our forecast of only a gradual acceleration of labor costs   I don't think we know enough to answer that question at this point It  does appear that the gains for full-time UPS workers may not be spectacular in terms of hourly  wages I don't have a very good fix on what the part-time workers received   I saw those figures and I'm not sure to whom they apply or whether the  reference is to the minimum wage or some other measure    8/19/97   In that case, it would seem that there have been some significant gains   The company has been saying that they probably would lose some market  share, at least for a time, because many firms would no longer want to rely solely on UPS This  strike is going to be a fundamental problem for them, at least until they can rebuild confidence  among their customers I have not heard the assertion that they would be priced out of the market  by the wage agreement, but it was not known what the wage agreement would be when people  were making these pronouncements The company evidently has indicated, and as you said the  union has confirmed, that there probably will be some layoffs So, the situation is ambiguous I  don't know how much erosion of market share one might expect simply on the basis of the cost  factor   To a considerable extent, yes, but there is also a lot of capital investment  involved, particularly in the rapidly growing area of second-day service that UPS has developed  That is part of the story behind the changing employment mix In order to implement this rapid  delivery service, they needed to have a lot of people in concentrated periods to shuffle all the boxes  and get them loaded onto airplanes That is where the disproportionate rise in part-time  employment apparently occurred So, UPS evidently had some real problems in accommodating  the labor union's desires; many of their employees were working two four-hour shifts with a three-    8/19/97  hour break The unions did not want to call that an eight-hour day I do not know how these  working-condition aspects of the negotiations were resolved   I do not think, given the standard errors across most models, that one  would say that the price equations have uniformly broken down And I emphasize ""equations""  We tend to look at an array of models in our forecast work Some perform better than others Not  surprisingly, the inclusion of import prices as one of the variables in the Phillips curve model  would have produced much better results in the last year or so in terms of anticipating the  deceleration that occurred in the core CPI So, we would not throw these models out at this point  We would use them cautiously, though, as we always have, knowing that they are not very precise  predictors in any given period As a practical matter, we have not found an alternative to these  models that we can turn to in our effort to come to grips with the problems involved in constructing  quantitative forecasts   As we emphasized, applying the normal lags that we found in estimating  consumption functions with wealth terms, the time profile and dimension of the stock market  movement that we have assumed suggest that we would not get much of a retardation in consumer    8/19/97  spending from that drop in stock prices before the end of 1998 If we contrast this outcome to a  counterfactual one where the market continued to climb at anything like the rate we've seen on  average over the past couple of years, I suspect that we would have a considerably different  consumption forecast for the latter part of 1998 Unless there is a significantly quicker effect  transmitted through consumer sentiment in some way, which at the fringes is allowed for in our  thinking, I think the story mainly is how robustly the economy will be moving in 1999   I don't want to convey the notion--and I hope we didn't state it quite that  way--that we believe the durable equipment sector is systematically less cyclical than it might have  been in the past Our assessment at this juncture is that there seem to be in train some changes in  technology of a dimension such that the demand for those products will outweigh whatever drag  there will be from the general flattening of profits and cash flow and the deceleration in output We  would not see the same kind of impetus in some other areas of capital spending such as basic  industrial equipment So, we have a continuation of quite rapid growth in real computer outlays  and fairly substantial growth in telecommunications equipment expenditures as measured by the  national income accounts The effects of this, as I think we noted in a footnote in the Greenbook,  on the growth in spending for overall producers' durable equipment are invisible in this forecast    8/19/97  relative to the previous forecast because of the chain weighting This means that the weights  diminish as the prices of these goods fall rapidly and this balances out the higher real growth that  we anticipate for this component But at this point we see very substantial reductions over the near  term in the cost of various components of computers and very strong continuing demands for  equipment in the networking area There seems to be enough innovation going on here that people  are going to find that their equipment is becoming obsolescent, and they are going to be replacing it  at a relatively fast rate for a while longer   We saw considerable strength in imports in the second quarter in a number  of categories in the consumer goods and machinery areas, and that suggests that imports may have  contributed to the very substantial increase in inventories in that period As we look to the third  quarter, we anticipate that some of the fallout in inventory accumulation will be mirrored in a more  modest increase in imports in the merchandise category   I don't recall whether there was any significant change in trends in those  estimates    8/19/97 "
5837,1997-09-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman It would not surprise me if many of you found the tale of the staff forecast in the Greenbook more tortuous than usual Preparing the forecast and then writing it up proved to be a considerable struggle for us this time    9/30/97  Perhaps we engaged in more soul-searching than was really required, but we found ourselves with what seemed like a complex task We had to contend with the fact that as we were at work, financial markets appeared to be in the grip of new era fever and stock prices were moving ever further above, and bond yields ever further below, where we had anticipated they would be We also had to explain why we were raising our forecast of near- term growth again, as well as why we thought moderation would yet be coming And we had to explain why, though we were lowering our inflation forecast again, we still expected prices to accelerate in coming quarters I will try to run through some of the highlights of our thinking as quickly as possible this morning  First, on the new era, we do not have any problem with the notion that a good many things have changed in the world There have been some marvelous technological advances that offer the potential for productivity gains The emergence of new market economies around the world has unlocked vast amounts of underutilized labor resources There has been a lowering of barriers to international trade and capital flows There have been gains in competition and efficiency through domestic deregulation and restructuring Also, today's labor market is marked by less unionization and by more flexible approaches to compensation  Of course, one may observe that these phenomena generally involve rather gradual processes, most of which have been in train for some time, but perhaps there has been some harmonic convergence that is yielding magnified effects recently In any event, the practical question is what to make of these observations when we attempt to prepare a forecast that may be helpful in framing monetary policy The new era advocates say the economy can grow faster, with lower unemployment, without generating inflation If they are simply talking about higher trend productivity growth or lower NAIRUs, this doesn't suggest the need for a new analytical paradigm But they sometimes seem to be claiming that aggregate supply and demand will always be in non-inflationary sync, even if the government's statistics do not always show it Monetary policy seemingly is irrelevant in this self-regulating state of perfection You can dump the staff and take an indefinite vacation [Laughter]  If I were not well shy of retirement eligibility, I might be more receptive to this view But, I suspect that most of you share at least some of our skepticism Under the circumstances, we feel much more comfortable taking the most relevant and persuasive aspects of the new era view and incorporating them in our model--one in which supply-demand imbalances can occur and give rise to inflationary pressures that can be modulated by monetary policy This is, in effect, what we have been doing all along    9/30/97  So, with that prologue, what tendencies do we think are facing you in the economy today? As you know, we believe the economy is still running pretty hot Exports have been zipping along with remarkable strength And, though last Thursday's report on capital goods orders was a bit weaker than we anticipated, it didn't undermine our assessment that this sector of the economy is still on a steep uptrend, paced by demand for computers and communications equipment but with fairly substantial demand elsewhere, too The growth of these sectors and the massive gains in stock market wealth are providing consumers with the wherewithal to spend, and they are doing so Indeed, judging by yesterday's monthly PCE release, they are doing so to an even greater degree than we thought In light of those figures and the other late-arriving data, we would now place likely third-quarter GDP growth in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range  We continue to think that the levels of some types of household and business investment expenditures are high enough that stocks might soon begin to get out of kilter with income and output trends if there is not some deceleration in inventory accumulation And we believe the rise of the dollar has been large enough to damp export growth and raise import penetration further in the period ahead But, these are far from a sure thing--certainly in terms of timing and dimension  Booms generate a momentum of their own, and like others, this one is being supported by a degree of financial exuberance In fact, it is our assessment that, more likely than not, financial restraint sufficient to rein in the excess demand we see will be achieved only with a decisive enough monetary policy jolt to shake the market's current euphoria Whether the percentage point hike in the funds rate in the forecast is the right dose, we obviously do not know for sure, but if our analysis is correct, something noticeable probably will be required  The other part of the analysis is, of course, our judgment that we can't depend on productivity increases large enough to sustain such rapid growth of output and that the Phillips curve is not dead It is somewhat disfigured, perhaps, but not dead On the productivity front, as we suggested in the Greenbook, there may well be room for optimism regarding the outlook for growth in output per hour Among other things, despite all the complaints about the quality of available workers, measured productivity performance has improved of late We are skeptical of the new era view that firms always have another productivity trick up their sleeves to offset any cost increase-- but it could be that the high-tech investments are now having a more significant payoff, and we have taken a somewhat more optimistic view of productivity prospects  As for the Phillips curve, we believe that compensation practices probably have changed in ways that may temper the short-run response of    9/30/97  overall pay structures to tight labor markets On top of that consideration, we also have the apparent divergence of the degrees of labor and factory utilization This might be viewed as part of the new era--the perfectly elastic and immediate supply of plant and equipment as needed to meet demand Our projection of moderate capacity utilization argues, we think, for some restraint on inflation relative to what might be implied by labor market conditions Similarly, in the near term, the legacy of recent low inflation and a seeming convergence of expectations on continued low inflation bodes well for the sustained moderation of compensation increases  How far to carry these arguments in recalibrating one's model of the inflation process is a difficult judgment call We do not think they eliminate entirely the risk of an upturn of inflation if labor markets remain as taut as they are now, let alone get tighter, as we are projecting Moreover, there are a couple of other special factors that reinforce the likelihood of a steeper rise in prices going forward  One of them is the possibility that employers will face significant increases in premiums for health insurance In this regard, I might note that, at the end of last week, it was announced that the premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefit program will be rising an average of 8-1/2 percent next year We have not had the opportunity to research this development adequately, so I am not sure that this is a clear sign that the pressures in this sphere will be greater than we anticipated in our forecast It is a worry, however  Finally, in looking at the inflation outlook, we think it is important to consider the prospects for the dollar Estimates of the effects of the dollar appreciation and the associated decline in import prices vary considerably, but they certainly have been a significant factor tending to trim domestic inflation in the past year or two An advocate of the new era might say that a strong dollar is just a natural and lasting result of the reaccommodation of the United States in the world economy, but with the probability of a growing external deficit, we find it hard to swallow the concept that we should be anticipating another 20 percent rise in the dollar over the next two years It could happen, but we are betting against it Without that influence --indeed, with the possibility of some reversal of the dollar--containing inflation is going to be more difficult  Toting up all these considerations, we have core inflation accelerating only a couple of tenths per year through 1999 despite continuous sub-five- percent unemployment That rate is, to be sure, damped a couple of tenths by technical changes to the CPI But, especially given the expected abatement of favorable exchange rate effects, the forecast does fall somewhat short of what might normally have been anticipated simply on the basis of the excess demand for labor--say, if one simply applied a    9/30/97  conventional ""sacrifice ratio"" to the unemployment gap relative to a 5-1/2 percent NAIRU  We think that we have been judicious in adapting to the incoming evidence and in taking account of alternative explanations for the surprises we have experienced In the end, despite our flirtation with the new era view, our forecast conveys a rather clear message that the risks are tilted toward higher inflation in the absence of some restrictive policy action But, I would have to say that this is truly a period in which the outlook is characterized by the proverbial ""unusual degree"" of uncertainty   Those are very interesting questions Perhaps the relatively high real rate  of interest in recent years, particularly if it is measured in terms of the prices of goods, say the PPI,  may have something to do with why we see a downtrend in inventory-sales ratios Another factor,  of course, is the better information systems that firms have to work with Going forward, we do  project a substantial deceleration of inventory investment from what we have been seeing recently  The level of the inventory-sales ratio remains historically low in our forecast I think firms will still  find that markets are not so loose, even given our capacity utilization numbers, that they feel they  can avoid the need to have some precautionary stocks on hand But, yes, there is always the  potential, especially when we are anticipating that final demand will be decelerating and perhaps  surprisingly so over the coming year, that inventories will get out of line at least temporarily That  would lead initially to a period of somewhat greater inventory accumulation than we have in the  forecast but that would be followed by a swing down toward a much lower rate of accumulation,  and it would introduce a bit of a cycle into the outlook Whether inventories in our forecast are too  high on an average basis given these real interest rates is an interesting question I don't think I  have much more that I can add on this question It is certainly something that we are aware of  On the stock market correction question, there is something of a chicken and egg  problem The same sort of thought has occurred to me; we may have some shifting of the risk  premia in the market But there is a consistency in the forecast, at least in the sense that one reason  why we anticipate the stock market decline is the rise in interest rates That rise will require a  higher discount rate in the stock market valuation formula If we did not get that interest rate  adjustment at least initially, we wonder whether the negative earning surprises would be enough to  create this kind of decline in stock prices So, it may be a timing issue; we may see some swings  involving a flight to security and to fixed-income instruments It is not inconceivable that the    9/30/97  enthusiasm about prospective stock market returns has been a factor that in essence has raised  yields across the board on various types of financial instruments Why would I invest in a bond  that yielded only 4 percent when I think I can get a much higher return in the stock market? If the  expected returns in the stock market go down, perhaps we will also have some effect on the bond  market But I think we would see this in significant measure as a change in the equity premium in  the stock market so that people will require a higher expected return relative to those on bonds   The ""no change"" scenario that we have included in that model simulation  clearly would imply a higher level of stock prices than in our baseline forecast That better stock  market performance results from the strength of the economy that helps to sustain profits, and it  works through the discount factor in stock price valuations So, the wealth effects are more  favorable to consumer demand in the alternative stable interest rate scenario Our feeling is that  there is certainly the potential, simply on the basis of disappointment in earnings growth, for stock  prices to fall off some We see the tightening of policy, and the shift in expectations that that  causes--and the related tendency for bond yields to back up--as an important factor in explaining  the timing and dimension of the stock market decline we have in the forecast   Let me mention a couple of things One, we did build in only mild  accelerations in wages and salaries and in total benefits, and we incorporated a rather modest  upturn in the cost of medical benefits relative to some of the stories we have heard To some  extent, we have to consider whether we are looking at the gross increase in the cost of the medical  benefits or whether they are the net cost the employer is going to incur Certainly, many larger  companies in the last year or two have been talking about how their philosophy has shifted to  viewing the health insurance benefit as a defined contribution arrangement rather than as a defined  benefit So, they are looking for ways to pass along the rising cost to the employees by restricting  benefits or increasing the out-of-pocket expenses that the employees will experience In light of the  seeming confirmation of some of the scarier stories and the recent federal employee health benefits  announcement, our faith is a little shaken that we have allowed for enough of an increase I would  say that we do not see compelling evidence that one should write the step-up off as something that  will be offset through lower wage increases The evidence that that will be the pattern in the short    9/30/97  run is rather shaky In this tight labor market, I think there is a clear risk of more overall  compensation inflation than we are projecting  The final point I would make is that, in this forecast, as measured in product prices--and  we think this highly relevant--the increases in compensation are sizable in real terms and they are  growing faster than trend productivity So, in this model, workers are doing reasonably well  because of the benefits of low price inflation Now, whether this is the dynamic that will prevail in  this kind of environment is a matter of conjecture We have been struck to date by how, in the face  of lots of stories about tight labor markets and employers undertaking to pay particular workers  more in one way or another, we really have not seen an acceleration in labor costs It may be just  around the corner, and we may have to reverse course in the sequence of revisions we have been  making in the forecast   I might just remark that since this is the first time we have formally done a  forecast for 1999, it probably is a little shakier than it might otherwise be   I do not have a model simulation in my pocket to give you a quantitative  answer to that I think that a series of policy moves that raised the federal funds rate 100 basis  points by next March instead of one that only started to raise the funds rate next March would  probably lead to circumstances that would encourage the Committee to think about reversing  course by 1999 The reason would be to make sure that, as we moved out of 1999 and into 2000,  monetary policy was not holding down the level of output so much that more slack ultimately  would be created than was needed to achieve a gradual moderation in the expansion and a return to  a flat-to-descending inflation path Another way of approaching this policy adjustment would be to  start the process earlier and move more gradually to get to the same point You basically are  talking about shifting the process forward with about as sharp a total increase in the funds rate, and  I think that approach would create a greater likelihood that you would have the opportunity to  reverse course, say, in 1999   As a first approximation, I would conceive of that as a more likely  alternative in terms of nipping in the bud what we think is an incipient pickup in inflation But we  recognize, harking back to President McDonough's remark, that the implied real interest rate at the  short end would be fairly high with a nominal federal funds rate of 6-1/2 percent At that level,  some easing in policy might be warranted if and as the inflation rate was checked and the  perception was that the rate of inflation was clearly headed back down into the sub-3-percent  inflation zone   I'm not sure I understand that thought   I'm not sure I conceive of it as exogenous In a sense we are letting  bygones be bygones and not anticipating that the favorable inflation surprises have created some  pent-up inflationary pressure that is going to burst forth in the future I am impressed by recent    9/30/97  commodity market developments I looked at the charts the other day I did see some indications  in copper markets of changing expectations that appeared to be associated with the problems in  Southeast Asia, and there may be some special stories elsewhere However, when we look across  the breadth of the commodity markets, there really is no sign of general pressure in those markets  If we look at these markets narrowly in terms of the domestic industrial picture, capacity utilization  rates are not extraordinarily high in most sectors And where utilization is fairly high, as it is for  example in the steel industry, the businesses in question are drawing in a large volume of imports  and they have capacity coming on stream prospectively in such a way that there really does not  seem to be much pricing leverage So, in the last few months we increasingly have given weight to  the sense that there really is not much pressure in the goods sector and that there is a lot of capacity  coming on line in the United States and in many instances abroad In our view, worldwide  economic activity is not going to be so robust relative to capacity that we are going to have a lot of  pressures in the commodity markets I do not see those markets as the source of more inflation  independently of what is going on more broadly   We are in a sense modifying some of the conditions in that model When  we look at cycles historically, we see that capacity utilization has tended to move up as  unemployment has moved down It is very hard to discern econometrically a separate role for  industrial capacity utilization as a measure of the underlying inflationary pressure In the current  circumstance, the deviation of the capacity utilization rate from what we would predict given the  unemployment rate is becoming substantial    9/30/97   Probably Those industry unemployment rates are a shaky proposition I  must say I have not really looked at that   Since manufacturers cannot produce without workers, the labor market is  still relevant here We do hear, and there were some Beigebook comments, that at least in some  instances manufacturers were finding that they had to raise their wages in order to attract and retain  the workers they needed But the system seems to be working in such a way that we think it  behooves us to give some weight to our expectation that capacity utilization is going to remain  relatively moderate We think this will put some damper on what the pickup in inflation otherwise  would be going forward   One of the risks we repeatedly have pointed to and then last time said it  might not be such an asymmetric risk was the role of the stock market and the implications for  consumption As you may recall, the revised national income accounts that we received after the    9/30/97  August meeting showed that the saving rate had fallen so that the wealth effect seemingly was  working the way one would have expected We thought that somehow the world now was right  and that we had a grasp of its functioning We were not quite so concerned as we had been about  the risk that we would suddenly find consumption surging in a belated response to the  accumulation of wealth In the interim, the stock market has once again risen more than we  expected The difference is not big, but it is there, and consumption expenditures are surpassing  even our expectation of a robust upturn in the third quarter Going forward, I do not have the sense  that our forecast implies an asymmetry of risks in terms of aggregate demand being stronger or  weaker But it makes me nervous that we keep making revisions in the same direction, and my  sense is that there really is a boom mentality at work in the economy today The financial markets  are supplying ample credit to borrowers, and the ongoing appreciation of share prices, now more  concentrated in the smaller cap issues, is providing cheap equity capital for many companies I  worry that these booming conditions may be even more strongly maintained than we have forecast  But in terms of the nuts and bolts of putting this forecast together and the assumptions we have  made for deviations from what we think of as normal behavior over time, I don't think we have an  obvious tilt in the risks  Let me add something that Don Kohn just whispered in my ear We have helped, I think,  to balance these risks in a sense by changing the policy assumptions As we talk about the changes  in the forecast, you should not overlook that we have incorporated in it a more stringent set of  policy actions   I have heard that joke specifically pertaining to chip plants, an industry  joke   Mr Chairman, may I interrupt for a moment? I would like to remind the  members that in this discussion of what happens if the Committee tightens sooner than is assumed  in the Greenbook forecast, the tighter alternative in the Greenbook is a first approximation It is the  sort of scenario where the Committee starts the tightening process immediately, and by the middle  of next year the funds rate is at 7 percent instead of 6-1/2 percent But as you can see if you look at  the numbers for 1999, we have slow growth in economic activity and the unemployment rate is  moving up very rapidly So, this goes to the remark that I made earlier If you looked out to 2000,  you would probably be thinking about moderating the amount of restraint that was being imposed  so that you did not needlessly overshoot the sustainable unemployment levels I think you can get  some sense from the Greenbook as to what the difference might be   I don't question that I just felt that I probably overlooked a piece of  information that might have been a more direct answer to your question   I should say that the word I used to describe the Greenbook forecast was  ""tortuous"" [Laughter] I hope we did not torture the readers "
5860,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to offer just a few comments before yielding to Ted for his remarks on the recent turbulence in the international economy and its implications for the US outlook  I think it's pretty obvious that we don't share the view that the United States is going to be sucked into a deflationary whirlpool by the difficulties encountered abroad Time will tell just how big the contractionary shock will be, but it would have to be a large one to override the momentum of domestic demand in the near term  All major segments of private spending look strong right now Consumers as a group are rich and happy, and it seems likely they will continue to buy with abandon Manufacturers of capital goods report heavy inflows of orders--not just for computers and communications equipment, but for a wide range of other machinery as well Commercial property    11/12/97  prices are rising and should buttress nonresidential building activity Meanwhile, all indicators of housing demand are giving off positive signals As for financing, although the recent upheavals have produced some widening of risk premia in the securities markets, conditions are still such that most projects can get funding on what evidently are regarded as attractive terms  Absent a sizable shock, then, the economy probably will continue to power ahead--perhaps not indefinitely, but for long enough to exacerbate inflationary pressures significantly In our forecast, the recent developments abroad are a drag on aggregate demand, but not enough alone to bring a halt soon to the above-trend growth we have been experiencing One possible source of restraint on demand would be a steep decline in the stock market It's quite possible that the large equity premiums of the past will not be restored; however, we do believe that the current price-earnings multiples incorporate unrealistic expectations about future profits If we are correct, the market surely will reflect it at some point, but that might not be soon and the adjustment might start from still higher levels  In our forecast, therefore, we have assumed that you will put a damper on the economic boom by raising the funds rate three-quarters of a point by the middle of next year That isn't a lot, but we expect that the effects will be magnified by some deflation of the stock market bubble As you know, we are predicting a drop next year that would take share prices down about 20 percent from Monday's closing level We make no claim of precision in that forecast--we are dealing not simply with math but also with mind reading In any event, we expect that once people are shaken out of their complacency about the economic risks, the bond and loan markets will also be affected--with a further widening of yield spreads and some firming of loan standards  With the resultant financial restraint, demand growth weakens and growth of output falls below potential in our forecast But this doesn't occur before the labor market has tightened further In that regard, a few words about Friday's labor market data might be in order According to that report, the unemployment rate has already traversed some of the distance to our predicted cyclical low of 46 percent The report also showed the labor force participation rate slipping further This suggests that we might, despite the trimming in our latest forecast, still be on the high side for labor force growth This could spell more labor scarcity and greater wage pressure We would recommend waiting for another reading or two before reaching that conclusion, but the data do sound a cautionary note    11/12/97  The sharp increase in average hourly earnings in October was anticipated in our forecast Although the recent surge in wages is attributable in part to the effects of the hike in the federal minimum, we do believe that there is an underlying tendency toward acceleration associated with the efforts of businesses to attract and retain workers in a very tight labor market Real wage gains have turned up noticeably over the past couple of years, and the pressure will remain in that direction We think, however, that the decline in price inflation and inflation expectations this year has created a circumstance in which nominal wage increases will be damped in the short run--enough to offset a pickup in medical insurance costs that seems to be in the offing  Our projection shows prices accelerating over the next two years However, the pickup is even more gradual than in previous forecasts The recent developments in the external sector suggest that the swing from declining to rising import prices will be of still smaller magnitude than we anticipated earlier In addition, our reassessment of the trend in labor productivity leads us to think that price inflation will rise more slowly Our projection of actual productivity growth has not changed much; however, price setting seems to be influenced more by the trends of productivity and unit labor costs than by the short-run variations, and so the change in our trend assumption tends to damp our inflation projection The end result is a prediction that the rate of price increase will rise only a little over the next two years--especially in the published figures, which will be held down by technical changes to official indexes But, I would conclude my remarks with the reminder that we believe this rather benign outcome is probably contingent on something happening to create a less accommodative financial environment  Ted will now say a few words about how we see the external environment   We have looked at the movements in the labor force in some detail  Basically, in this latest forecast we backed off from our previous expectation of a significant rise  partly because the incoming data were not moving that way What we have seen since the spike  in March is a rather broad-based decline involving adult males, adult females, and teenagers  Certainly, a possible factor affecting school enrollments is the wealth or income effect that you  have noted One area where we have seen recent increases in participation is among women who  are head of a household, and I think that is consistent with some impact from welfare reform  Basically, all of the rise in labor force participation in our forecast is related to the anticipated  effects of welfare reform The latest data put the participation rate at a lower level than we had  anticipated, but there is enough noise in these numbers that we are hesitant to leap to further  conclusions Even so, the data do tend to underscore the risks to the participation outlook in that  direction   All other things equal, it will tend to lower productivity growth over the  period in which they wedge in this increase We are talking about a 01 or 02 reduction   I think it was 475,000 If we assess the effect on productivity growth in  terms of gauging the trend over a period of time, it would not be quite so large   They will carry something through as well, but there is also the  possibility that by the time we get to the middle of next year other data will have changed too,  perhaps on the output side   That is a very interesting question for which I do not have an answer It  is something that we ought to look into   As I understand it, the only data we are really dealing with are the  revised employment numbers They will feed that through in estimating total hours, but one  does need to look at the income data themselves   That is a part of the story We view resource pressures at this point,  particularly in the labor market, as being strong enough to produce some ongoing acceleration in  prices The fact that productivity growth in the industrial sector is as rapid as it is suggests to us  that, going forward, we are going to have a reasonably comfortable picture in that sector, but  more generally we see ongoing pressures in the labor market We have the difficult question of  judging what the relative influences are of trend productivity and actual productivity growth It  is probable that reality lies in some combination of those two elements Therefore, as we go  forward and the upcreep in compensation is augmented by a decline in productivity growth, we  expect to get a noticeable acceleration in unit labor costs that will put some pressure on profit  margins In that case, firms may, in what will still be a reasonably tight market overall, try to  extract some price increases along the way   One might think that there will be something of a so-called speed effect  as we move into 1999 The other element, though it is a small and uncertain factor, does work in  the direction of tending to raise inflation It has to do with the fact that we have been benefiting  significantly over the past couple of years from a decline in import prices Going forward, we do  not anticipate that to continue, so that adds to the acceleration of prices in our forecast   The numbers do conform arithmetically with the behavior of  compensation and unit labor costs, but there are other factors that play a role such as movements  in interest costs, foreign earnings, and so on In the short run, we probably will have our greatest  hit to foreign earnings from the problems in Asia in particular So, there are a number of  elements that tend to put a damper on profit growth in the near term The profit share begins to  turn down, but the greater damage really occurs as we run through the forecast period The year  1999 is where we see profits really declining Indeed, that is one of the reasons we have only the  mildest of declines in the stock market through the first part of next year Year-on-year  comparisons of earnings in our forecast will still look quite good Certainly if there is any  continuing inclination for investors to be optimistic, as they clearly have been in recent years, I  do not think reduced earnings will be such a rude shock to the markets that they would have    11/12/97 31  devastating effects on share prices in the early part of our forecast period Cash flow in the  nonfinancial corporate sector is not growing as fast as capital expenditure, and we are seeing a  widening of the financing gap As we go out through the forecast period, the financing gap gets  to be sizable enough that at least we would not think that firms will be spending simply because  money is coming into their coffers and they have to do something with it It begins to be a less  favorable factor as we move out through 1998 and certainly into 1999   I will call on Ted to comment regarding how he thinks other markets  will respond This is a question that President Jordan asked at the last meeting, and in retrospect  I thought my answer may not have hit on one point that logically would be potentially significant  in our thinking about the forecast That point is that to the extent that you surprised the market  early on before you saw any evidence of building price inflation, your credibility would be  enhanced You would not appear to be playing catch-up, and the solidification of low inflation  expectations would be greater Now, in fact, with the kind of acceleration in prices we    11/12/97 32  anticipate, it might be very hard to explain price developments from month to month So, I do  not want to draw this distinction too sharply Certainly, one of the reasons we have share prices  declining is that the markets do not seem to have built in any anticipation of tightening, and an  earlier move, as the Bluebook points out, could have fairly sharp effects on domestic financial  markets   The basic thesis here is that we have had a spurt We think the  improvement in trend is an element in that, but we also think that, in part, the acceleration of  output has lifted the growth in productivity to substantially above the trend line that we would  draw As the economy decelerates, we would anticipate a movement back toward the trend line  That is the pattern that we have here   No Think of the productivity trend as a line that is rising and current  productivity as moving above the line The two lines then tend to converge, with actual  productivity converging to trend from above Now, during past business cycles, this has  occurred irregularly Certainly, it has occurred at the end of cyclical expansions To some  extent, that may have reflected a deterioration at the margin in labor quality as new workers were  added to the labor force In some cases, it may have reflected the need to use less efficient    11/12/97 34  equipment, which does not look to be a very significant problem in this instance It could be  simply the deceleration in demand and the cutback in output, which is not followed immediately  by a proportionate reduction in hours of labor It is quite conceivable that not only are we  wrong on the trend, we could be wrong on the shorter-run dynamics too, and we could have a  more sustained growth of productivity But we think this is a sensible pattern, one that conforms  to experience as we have it embodied in models of productivity behavior   Perhaps because we did not include verbiage in that part of the  Greenbook about a lot of other developments, it may have seemed that there was more focus on  the wealth effect Since the midyear revisions to the national income accounts that showed a  decline in the saving rate, I think we have used essentially the same logic in terms of assuming  that a good bit of the strength in consumption and decline in the saving rate over the past year is  attributable to the increase in stock market wealth We also anticipate that, as the market turns  down in our forecast, we are going to see the wealth effect eroding gradually ""Gradual"" is the    11/12/97 35  point that we have tried to stress Some have suggested that the response is almost  instantaneous, but as best we can gauge that response, looking at a variety of econometric  models, it takes a significant span of time for the wealth effect to play out So, in 1998 we would  still see for most of the year some impetus on balance to consumer spending relative to income  coming from the rise that already has occurred in the stock market But, by 1999 we have it  turning the other way  I guess one could say that, anecdotally, we hear increasing reports of people feeling  rather wealthy and deciding that they are not going to leave all of their gains to their kids or the  IRS They are going to spend some of those gains Certainly, people in the auto industry believe  that one of the reasons the demand for sports utility vehicles, especially the high-end models, has  been so strong is that people are spending some of this wealth I think there is some evidence in  the housing market that demand for second homes has firmed in the past year, and people in that  industry seem to feel that the improvement could be a reflection of the stock market So, this  factor could be having fairly broad and significant effects, which is the reason we feature it so  much in explaining the deceleration in 1998 and 1999   There is a simple rule of thumb One has to have a full-fledged  scenario that indicates the circumstances in which, for example, this extra couple of tenths of  GDP restraint might be occurring If we just had a quarter percentage point more deceleration in  GDP growth for two years, we would end up by Okun's Law with about a quarter percentage  point higher unemployment rate by the end of the second year The difference in inflation  outcomes would be very small But if we blend in stories about exchange rate and import price    11/12/97 39  effects and their financial dynamics and so on, one has to step back and think very carefully  about what the outcome might be Just taking that little bit of arithmetic that Ted was  mentioning, we need to go to a drastically ""worse"" case scenario to totally change the outcome   As I noted briefly, the average hourly earnings report for October did  not upset us We anticipated another large number, and it was in line with our expectations The  forecast of a stable ECI increase in 1998 reflects the expectation that wages will be favorably  affected by the very low rates of consumer and overall price inflation that we've seen in the past  year and the apparent effect of that price behavior on inflation expectations That effect has been    11/12/97 40  small on the median of such expectations, for example, in the Michigan Survey, but very striking  on the mean Seemingly, there has been a convergence of expectations to the lower level We  would anticipate this to have a damping effect on wage increases, and in a sense we are not  looking for the ongoing effect of the minimum wage hikes that have raised the rate of wage  increases in the past year When we did simulations about a year and a half ago, the simulation  of a minimum wage increase involved some follow-through as higher wages raised prices and  price expectations But in fact consumer prices have decelerated, so we see that as a favorable  element in the near term  We have built a significant acceleration of health insurance costs into the ECI forecast  We have reports of increases in insurance premiums beyond those of CALPERS and the federal  employee health programs We are fairly well convinced that those increases will happen this  time They did not happen this year despite some earlier reports, but we feel the evidence is now  tangible enough for us to want to build that into our forecast at least in a moderate way  I guess my final comment would be that there seems to have been some increase  recently in the anecdotal reports of step-ups in wage increases It is very hard to read this  information, but I would say that there's a basis for some concern that the increases may be  larger than those we have built into the forecast I have not seen the actual numbers, but just to  cite something that I have heard, the survey of smaller businesses by the National Federation of  Independent Businesses has evidently shown a noticeable increase in the last few months in the  number of firms reporting that they actually have raised wages and a noticeable increase in the  number of firms saying they plan to raise wages    11/12/97  In sum, there clearly are risks I think we followed the logic of the basic model of  how wages are determined, and it just may be that we are going to get increases in this period  that turn out to be greater than we forecast   Before the drop, the market had moved up further So, as of Monday, I  think the average for the quarter was actually higher than we had predicted in the last  Greenbook Now, if the market stays at these lower levels, we will come out pretty much in line    11/12/97 42  The decline from the very peak of the market to the low that we forecast, going by the Wilshire  5000, is about 25 percent We have about 5 percent under our belts   It could be We have been wrong previously! We certainly have found  it more difficult in the past couple of years to track from our output forecast to profits, because  the statistical discrepancy has moved substantially Perhaps that could happen going forward In  our forecast, we do not have that continuing movement in income relative to expenditures that  we have experienced over the past year or so "
5884,1997-12-16," Thank you Anticipating that, as last month, the focus of your interest this morning is on the international side, I will try again to be    12/16/97  brief I thought, however, that I would offer a few remarks on some of the tougher calls we had to make on the domestic side of our forecast--namely those relating to the outlook for wages, the stock market, and capital spending  Before that, however, just a few words on this morning's statistics The CPI--total and core--increased just 01 percent in November The twelve-month changes were 18 percent for the total CPI and 22 percent for the core--the total a tenth below our Q4/Q4 forecast and the core right on it  Housing starts rose slightly further last month We had expected a dropback Most of the upside surprise was in the lower value multifamily segment, which held at a high level For what it's worth, I am told that this may be the result of a new seasonal pattern related to efforts to qualify for tax breaks on low-income housing projects We'll have to look into that further Single-family starts were up a little, but permits were down, so this more important segment looks broadly in line with our prediction of flatness  Now back to my main theme, some of the tougher issues in the projection The first I noted was the outlook for wages As you know, we have forecast that wages and total compensation will decelerate slightly in the next year, in the face of continued low unemployment We certainly are not arguing that the labor market is not tight We have heard the anecdotes and read the surveys, as you have, and we are persuaded that finding and retaining qualified workers is a major problem for employers While many firms continue to report that they will do just about anything they can to avoid raising their wage bills--including even forgoing expansion opportunities--wage increases have been creeping up for a while now  My gut tells me that the pressure is building in this labor market pot to where the lid could blow off But, for better or worse, our forecast has not been shaped by this visceral sensation In particular, we have given major weight to the observations that wages are rather inertial and that they can be significantly affected by perceived trends in prices And, at this point, workers and employers are looking at very low inflation over the past year, and they should be seeing more of the same for a while longer, given conditions in goods markets The net result in our forecast is still a hefty further rise in real wages and a marked increase in the labor share of the income pie--but not an upward wage-price spiral  Another tough call relates to the stock market outlook As you know, in light of our reassessment of the prospects for inflation, we have eliminated our prior assumption of an increase in the federal funds rate We    12/16/97  had viewed that tightening as an important trigger for a marked downturn in the market in the first half of next year The question before us, then, was whether disappointing corporate earnings alone could be expected to produce a significant correction before long Our answer was yes, but that the decline will likely be more gradual and smaller overall--about 15 percent from yesterday's close by early 1999 Question marks remain, however  To date, individual companies or industries have been punished for bad earnings announcements, but this seemingly has occasioned merely a rotation to other sectors by determined equity investors So, could the market shrug off the negative news we are forecasting? Perhaps, at least for a while Certainly, on our numbers, aggregate year-on-year profit comparisons will not begin to look really poor until next summer or fall  That said, though, I think there is the distinct possibility that, once the deterioration of profits comes clearly into view, the market could develop even more downward momentum than we have anticipated I would note that we are currently projecting a low for the Wilshire 5000 in 1999 that would only take it back to where it was this spring and leave price-earnings multiples at historically high levels A combination of revised earnings expectations and any further increase in the equity premium from what probably has occurred recently would point to a much more sizable decline, unless interest rates were to fall appreciably at the same time  Finally, a few thoughts on the outlook for business investment This is a sizable sector and one that has provided a lot of propulsion for the expansion to date We have forecast a significant deceleration in capital spending, and while this gets a little circular, it fits well with our predictions of rising equity capital costs and decelerating output However, most of the indications at this point are that investment plans are very strong going into 1998 For example, the semi-annual survey of the National Association of Purchasing Managers indicated that manufacturers are expecting to increase their capital expenditures next year by 15 percent--an even greater increment than they reported for this year The NFIB's November survey of small firms also showed extremely upbeat investment plans  These surveys underscore the risk that investment will, yet again, prove stronger than we have gauged But, there is some reason to doubt their predictive power in the present case For one thing, even if the surveys are merely a few weeks old, they may still be providing pretty stale readings Just looking at how our own changing perception of the international outlook has altered our GDP projection over the past few weeks, it seems reasonable to think that businesses are also reassessing their plans and that many of them will be trimming their investment budgets If we are wrong,    12/16/97  that does raise the question of whether this capital spending boom won't come to a more jarring end sometime down the road, with firms finding themselves with excess capacity and experiencing a deeper hit to profits  So, to sum up, we think we have provided a realistic baseline forecast, but there is still plenty to puzzle over--and perhaps to worry about from a policy standpoint On that comforting note, let me now turn the floor over to Ted, who has been doing a lot of worrying lately "
5911,1998-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman We will be referring to the charts in this colorful handout in front of you 2/  Chart 1 summarizes the staff forecast I should note that here, as in the other exhibits, we have used the Greenbook numbers for GDP-related variables rather than those in the BEA's advance release We have done this partly for mechanical reasons but also with the thought that the differences are for the most part small and mainly matters of forecasting missing source data Time will tell whose estimate is closer to the mark--though it makes me a bit uneasy knowing that they are the umpire as well as a contestant in this guessing game  In any event, on either set of numbers, we would be predicting a sharp deceleration of activity this year As indicated in the top panels, we are predicting that real GDP growth will slow to about 1 percent this year and pick up to just 2 percent next year We expect the growth of private domestic final demand, the red line on this chart, to fall off but not so sharply; in fact, we are expecting an advance of almost 4 percent this year The story behind the near-term drop-off in overall GDP growth is inventories and the external sector, as we will be discussing shortly  The projected growth of output is slower than potential, and thus we anticipate an easing of pressures on resources The middle panels show that the unemployment rate is predicted to rise to 5-1/4 percent by late 1999, while the factory utilization rate is expected to drop to 78-1/2 percent  This continues the recent pattern of disparate messages from the two utilization measures, with the jobless rate remaining so low that we would normally expect inflation to pick up by a few tenths of a percent per year, while the capacity utilization rate is below par historically and seemingly pointing to further disinflation The forecast in the bottom panels essentially splits the  2/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Prell and Ms Johnson are appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)    2/3-4/98  difference, while also taking account of the other elements in the inflation picture The core CPI inflation rate edges off slightly through 1999, while the overall  index slows further this year and then accelerates discernibly next year At least, that is what we foresee for the published data, a distinction I will return to later  Meanwhile, Chart 2 outlines the key financial and fiscal features in the outlook First, our basic monetary policy assumption is that the fed funds rate will remain near the present 5-1/2 percent level As you can see in the upper left graph, the real funds rate has been rising in recent quarters owing to the quarter-point snugging last March and a decline in inflation expectations--proxied here alternatively by lagging one-year PCE inflation and the Michigan SRC survey median We anticipate that this real rate will remain at a relatively elevated level over the forecast period  We also expect that long-term rates will stay pretty much in the range of recent weeks This implies the persistence of an unusually flat yield curve, as depicted in the upper right panel Historically, so narrow a spread between long and short rates would appear to point to very weak GDP growth However, this narrowing has occurred in an unusual way Most commonly in the past, the narrowing of the spread occurred with Fed tightenings causing short rates to rise more than long rates In this instance, though, policy action has been a minor factor, and the long rate has been influenced by, among other things, a flight to safety, diminished inflation expectations, and the prospect of federal surpluses One thing is clear, though whereas a year or so ago the markets evidently thought the Fed would have to tighten to keep inflation from rising, that is no longer the case What to take from that observation is not entirely clear, but I would offer the speculation that it is not so much a reflection of a view that the economy is going to weaken drastically as it is an indication of the belief that favorable supply conditions-- including strong productivity gains and the availability of cheap imports--will be restraining price increases as the economy expands moderately  The ability of the stock market to achieve new highs in the face of the recent Asian storms would seem to support this upbeat interpretation of the yield curve developments But, we believe that the market will decline about 10 percent from yesterday's record level by the end of this year The key reason is the divergence between our forecast of profits and those apparently prevailing in the market today The red line in the lower left panel of Chart 2 shows that stock market strategists--the so-called ""top-down"" analysts--are expecting S&P 500 earnings per share to grow roughly 6-1/2 percent this year and 51/2 next The ""bottom-up"" summation of individual-company security analysts' views, not plotted here, is still well into double digits The black line shows our forecast of a NIPA item that has tracked the S&P earnings relatively closely in recent years; as you can see, we are more pessimistic about the outlook It is obvious to which drummer the market has been marching in the past few days; and there is a clear danger that this rally will provide additional stimulus to aggregate demand The Greenbook    2/3-4/98  provided a simulation of a more buoyant stock market for those of you skeptical of our predictive powers, which I assume is many of you at this point  Finally, on the fiscal side, we have assumed that there will be no significant net changes in policy in the near term The unified budget is projected to be in approximate balance in fiscal 1998 and 1999  As I suggested earlier, a good deal of the action in our forecast has its roots in the external sector, so let me turn now to Karen, who will discuss that part of the outlook   The next two charts focus on the dynamics of private demand in the forecast First, in Chart 8, the upper left panel shows real PCE growth holding at a high rate for a while longer and then dropping off to 2 percent in 1999 All signs look positive for consumer spending in the short run, among them the historically high level of sentiment portrayed at the right Surely, one of the factors accounting for these favorable attitudes is the run-up in stock market wealth  As I noted earlier, we are expecting the market to give back a small share of its gain, causing the wealth-income ratio to fall off--as shown by the black line in the middle left panel The experience of the past year has reinforced our belief in the significance of the wealth effect on consumption; thus, we are predicting that the personal saving rate will drop further over the next few quarters in lagged response to last year's market advance and then level out in 1999  An added attraction in the story of strong consumer demand is the current wave of mortgage refinancing The run-up in the MBA refinancing applications series, plotted at the right, probably exaggerates the relative dimension of the interest savings that will be realized by households in this episode, but there should be enough to give a small lift to spending The decline in mortgage rates obviously has made home purchase more affordable As documented at the lower left, our usual measure of the cash flow burden of ownership shows that, by this criterion, now is the best time in decades for the average family to buy a house In our forecast, this remains so, and--with little supply of unsold new units overhanging the market--we see single-family housing starts holding up well through next year, despite the slowing of job growth A very close inspection of    2/3-4/98  the right panel, perhaps requiring a magnifying glass, shows that multifamily starts--the reddish upper layer--spurted in the fourth quarter of 1997 We do not expect that higher level to be sustained--although there may be some upside risk here, given the generous availability of financing for developers The bottom line is that residential investment, which rose substantially in 1997, is likely to flatten out soon and then edge lower  Softening export and consumer demand will tend to cause businesses to trim their capital spending programs over the coming months--the so-called accelerator effects The upper left panel of Chart 9 shows that through some large quarterly gyrations indicated by the red line, real business fixed investment remained on a strong growth trend last year We foresee a notable slowing but not a collapse Indeed, as indicated at the right, we estimate that the level of spending will sustain the recent 3 percent-plus growth of the business capital stock through the next two years  This is high enough to produce further sizable increases in the amount of capital per worker Among the forces spurring this capital deepening is the rapid decline in the price of computers, shown in the middle left panel The combination of further price reductions and increasing power should be enough to keep real computer purchases on a steep growth trajectory  Orders for nondefense capital goods, ex aircraft, shown at the right, have waffled a bit in recent months, but from what we hear, we do not think this is a major turning point in domestic equipment spending I might note that, in the near term, this series will have to be read with extra caution when gauging the strength of domestic purchases International trade is very important in this sector, and by all reports--and perhaps reflected in yesterday's NAPM survey-- equipment orders from Asia have begun to weaken Likewise, at some point, US firms may find some bargains in imported capital goods, although this is likely to be a lesser part of the story and more concentrated in computers  Another key element in the projected economic deceleration this year is inventories Nonfarm stocks rose around 5 percent last year, clearly an unsustainable rate We are expecting a deceleration over the next few quarters to roughly 2 percent Admittedly, we have been telling this story for some time Perhaps, however, the risk of another upside surprise has been diminished by the rise of the stock-sales ratio that you can see in the right panel In retrospect, it looks like firms found themselves with leaner-than-desired inventories at the end of last year and have been restocking--with the added ingredient of the Boeing production ramp-up Of course, with no broad overhang of unwanted stocks at this point, any upside surprise in final demand relative to our forecast could again be reinforced by an inventory response    2/3-4/98  Let me turn now to the question of the implications of the projected growth for inflationary pressures Chart 10 shows some key features of our labor market forecast In the upper panel, you can see that we expect a slowing of labor productivity growth in the near term and then a return to roughly trend growth in 1999 As we noted in the Greenbook, a number of considerations came into play in this forecast, but central is that there will be some lag in the adjustment of hours and employment to the slowing of output growth  Certainly, at this point there is no sign of a major slackening in hiring Initial claims and a variety of other indicators suggest that the January and February labor market reports will show still sizable increases in payrolls--albeit not on the scale of those reported for the fourth quarter But we expect firms to respond before long to the evidence of softening demand, and--as you can see at the middle left--we are looking for monthly payroll increases to drop below 100,000 this spring  On the other side of the ledger, we do not foresee any significant movements in the labor force participation rate A reduced growth in job opportunities will tempt fewer people to enter the labor market, balancing off a modest positive effect of welfare reform  On balance, as I noted earlier this all results in a rise in the unemployment rate, but not to what we would regard as implying the absence of wage pressures The latest ECI release showed a big jump in compensation in the fourth quarter, which we are discounting heavily in our assessment of ongoing trends First, we always downplay the quarterly numbers because they are so noisy; but, second, in the present case they seem to have been importantly influenced by a few non-recurrent industry developments and the minimum wage hike That said, we do believe that the tightness of the labor market gave an underlying lift to the trend of compensation gains last year, especially on the wage side Our forecast, however, is that wage increases will diminish slightly this year and next, owing to the lagged effects of falling price inflation and inflation expectations Meanwhile, benefit cost increases are expected to be a little larger, owing primarily to rising health insurance premiums The net outcome, tabulated at the right, is a slight drop-back in compensation inflation to just over 3 percent by 1999  If one viewed prices as being determined in the short run by a mark-up over trend unit labor costs, this might suggest a pretty sanguine outlook for price inflation An alternative view, though, is that the more reliable modeling approach is to link price inflation directly to resource utilization, letting wages and the share of income going to labor be a side show But, in implementing this latter formulation, one must choose a measure of resource utilization Traditionally, it has been the unemployment rate, but it is far from clear what really works best    2/3-4/98  The upper panels of Chart 11 illustrate this quandary On the left side is a scatter plot of the unemployment rate versus changes in CPI inflation; on the right is the corresponding plot for the manufacturing capacity utilization rate As your eye will tell you and the cited R-squares will confirm, there isn't much to choose between the two versions That is because the jobless rate and the capacity utilization rate generally have moved together But that has not been so true of late; capacity has been growing very rapidly in manufacturing, and the factory utilization rate has been only a bit above average in the past year while the unemployment rate has fallen to quite a low level by past standards Reflecting this, the inflation forecasting ""error"" in 1997, as measured by the vertical distance to the regression line, was smaller for the utilization rate than for the unemployment rate relation  We do not want to make too much of this observation First, these clearly are loose relationships historically And second, we have yet to develop a compelling story for why plant use would systematically be pivotal in the overall inflation process Under the circumstances, our forecast involves what we hope is a judicious weighting of the signals coming from the two indicators of inflationary pressure Certainly, at this juncture, despite the tightness of the labor markets, there is no anecdotal support for the notion that prices are about to firm; indeed, in goods markets, prices may well decline in the near term The competition from cheaper imports obviously is a factor there  Also pointing to a lower inflation outlook this year than might be suggested by the unemployment rate alone is the likelihood that food prices will increase relatively slowly--the middle left panel--and the favorable consequences of the oil cost developments that Karen described for consumer energy prices--the right panel In both instances, however, we are looking for some pickup in 1999  The bottom panel summarizes once again our projection for total and core CPI inflation, the value-added in this version being the addition of the effects of the technical changes in the index made by the BLS since 1994 As you can see, the trend of inflation--as indicated by the total height of the bars--is somewhat less favorable when viewed from this perspective, but the acceleration in prices still is not dramatic From where we were last year, the pickup by 1999 is only on the order of a quarter percentage point in the core CPI; even measured on a basis consistent with the 1994 figures, core and total CPI inflation would still be less than 3 percent next year As the Bluebook simulations suggested, a plausible extension of the Greenbook baseline might show inflation trending up still further after 1999, in the absence of some policy action, but perhaps only a moderate one Under the circumstances, and with all the uncertainties in the outlook, we did not think it unreasonable to stick with a stable funds rate assumption in formulating this projection    2/3-4/98  The final exhibit summarizes the forecasts you submitted You folks generally are predicting stronger growth and higher inflation, but with an unemployment rate similar to ours It is tempting to enter into some mind-reading about what might lie behind the different behavioral relationship, but I expect that this will become apparent in the discussion I might also note that in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, the Board is effectively required to comment on the consistency of your forecasts with those of the Administration; their CPI forecast is at the high end of the central tendency range I have constructed for you, while their growth rate is at the low end and their unemployment rate above yours  I will stop here; we will be happy to answer whatever questions we can   Let me say that in our forecast we anticipated that a considerable  proportion of market participants would be expecting us to ease in that economic  environment So, we actually have long rates coming down from their current levels We  indicated in the Greenbook that they probably would go down to their recent lows and  possibly through them We think the incoming news in the next few months is going to    2/3-4/98  create a much more bullish atmosphere in the intermediate- and long-term sectors of the  market   It is not uncommon to find forecasts that indicate a little more  strength in the bond market than ours does over coming months Those forecasts are  associated with predictions of 30-year Treasury rates in the area of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and  there are those who are looking for a rate of 5 percent in the not too distant future   I think our economic forecast is weaker than most of those in the  market There are people with even weaker forecasts than ours for 1998, but the Blue  Chip consensus looks more like your forecasts at this juncture, and it appears to be  associated with essentially stable short-term rates   Peter may have greater insight into this than I, given his proximity  to more market participants I guess my sense is that real growth alone is not going to be  the critical variable I think a more crucial factor will be signs that inflation is picking up  in a way that would be perceived as making the Fed very nervous If this were an  environment in which we did not see signs of the Asian shock feeding through, I think  that would make markets all the more anxious because developments in Asia are seen  right now as balancing out, in the Fed's eyes, the high level of resource utilization and the  inflation risk that that entails   Yes But I must say that exactly what has been happening to house  prices is a little unclear By most measures such prices have been rising somewhat faster  than the general inflation rate The rise varies from measure to measure and seemingly  month to month, but I think there has been a real increase We anticipate a further real  increase over 1998 and 1999, something in the 3 to 4 percent range for single-family  houses   I don't know if it is the area in which we have our greatest  uncertainty, but I would certainly agree there is uncertainty attending this part of the  forecast It probably is unwise to put too much weight on the quarterly progression of  these compensation numbers We have found them to be extremely erratic and the  seasonal adjustment of this series is uncertain I think the best way to look at these  numbers is on some moving average basis We took a look at them on a four-quarter  change basis, and we saw an acceleration over the past four quarters, but it was only on  the order of about 1/4 percentage point That included the effects of a considerable boost  to the fourth quarter from commissions and bonuses The surge in the latter was  associated with the high level of activity in the real estate and mortgage banking business,  and it does not necessarily imply ongoing rapid growth from that high level We also had    2/3-4/98  a minimum wage increase that probably affected the fourth quarter to some extent on a  lagged basis But when we look at the ECI components by industry and so on, there is no  broad, across-the-board acceleration that one can observe So, I think it is reasonable to  take those recent numbers with a grain of salt They are affected to an important extent  by the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors, and they may also be capturing some of  what we have been hearing about temp workers and computer people When we get  beyond that, we do not see much going on  In the first quarter, yes, we expect another slug of bonuses That is apparently  when the majority of the Wall Street firms will be paying them out, so we have them in  our numbers That tends to keep the first-quarter benefits number from dropping back as  it might otherwise, given the fourth-quarter bulge The really big issue going forward, I  think, is the inflation expectations story Now, there are different ways that people model  the momentum in compensation Some look at wages as the momentum variable If we  did that, we would forecast an acceleration Depending on which compensation variable  is selected, it could be a slight acceleration or one that is considerable  An alternative view is to look at price expectations, and we have models that do  that It is not clear which model works best, but the ones that incorporate price  expectations are predicting much slower inflation in compensation than we have written  down If we take the latest Michigan reading as our measure of current inflation  expectations, there seems to be some movement of these expectations into closer  alignment with the actual inflation rate over the past year When employers sit down to  consider what kind of pay increases they may grant their employees, to the extent that  they take the cost of living into consideration they will be looking back at 2 percent    2/3-4/98  inflation, maybe a bit less Some of our models are using lagged inflation terms that have  higher inflation expectations implicit in them So, we see this as a balancing act We do  not know which is the optimal formulation to use, but we think we have a reasonable  projection to work with at this point   I don't know the answer to that question, but I suspect the  correlation is very weak in the short run In fact, we get some of our largest  compensation increases when productivity increases are beginning to fall near the end of  a cyclical expansion But I would not venture a further statement on that   Some of this has been touched on in the simulations of the effects  of a productivity surprise that we have discussed in the past and how it might feed  through to wages, profits, and prices in a short-run dynamic One of the things that  presumably happened in the fourth quarter is that people working in mortgage banking  firms and in some other finance and real estate areas probably were more productive, and  they got larger commissions So, there was a direct link between compensation and  production   The multiplier might be as high as 112   I don't know that it is more important I think they're both very  important in the short run here   Setting aside the very fine points of the effects of seasonal  adjustments, net exports are the bigger drag in the first few quarters of this year There is  a dynamic here that I alluded to very briefly I think you are right As I have looked at  other forecasts and tried to figure out the arithmetic I have seen, our consumption forecast  looks relatively strong compared to many of the outside forecasts   Business fixed investment is in the ballpark of the outside forecasts  So, I think you've put your finger on two key elements On inventories, I have seen  forecasts that anticipate rates of over $40 billion of inventory accumulation through the  year That is well beyond the final sales growth that they are forecasting and suggests  that they feel businesses will be happy with an ongoing rise in their inventory-sales ratios  I don't see any reason to anticipate that in the market that we see now Nothing is in  short supply The latest purchasing managers' report said that absolutely zero things were  in short supply, and prices are falling It just does not look like an environment where    2/3-4/98  goods producers or merchants want to stock up So, we think our forecast is internally  consistent and reasonable, but if anything in the final demand dynamics pushes the  economy toward stronger-than-expected growth, we do not have a cushion here  Inventories would in that event add to the upside surprise relative to our forecast  I don't want to intrude too much on Karen's territory but in regard to the comment  that we have net exports falling off the fence on the international side, I think in the  pre-FOMC briefing that we gave the Board yesterday--and you have all received copies of  that briefing--there were some very interesting indications in the data from the other side  of the Pacific that suggested very abrupt adjustments in current account balances in the  fourth quarter So, having something happen very quickly in the United States as a mirror  image of that does not seem unreasonable   I don't want to extend this unduly, but I should remind you that not  everyone is expecting a stock market decline As I said, our consumption forecast does  not look weak and our business fixed investment forecast does not look all that weak  relative to other forecasts But if we were to assume a modest rise in the stock market or  something more, then our forecast would be very much closer to the consensus   I think as a way of characterizing this, Governor Meyer in his  earlier incarnation frequently used the term ""an effective NAIRU"" as a short-run, maybe  transitional, phenomenon in the context of a more permanent NAIRU That permanent  NAIRU would re-manifest itself after the shock had run its course   May I just inject a thought? I do not want to deny the argument  about the real interest rate level, but I would like to remind you of some analysis we have  provided you in the past, for example, with regard to the Akerlof-Dickens-Perry notion  that at very low rates of inflation, the economy is going to run into nominal rigidities that  will effectively raise the NAIRU I think that view rests on some potentially questionable  notions about the inability of our wage-setting institutions to adjust to a new environment  I have in mind the recent experience in which we seem to have been making faster  progress toward price stability as inflation has gotten lower There has been no evidence  that nominal rigidity has been a major problem As I said, one would think that more and  more of those institutional and psychological barriers would break down over time So, I  think the list of arguments one can propound to support the notion that we need to be    2/3-4/98  worried about low levels of inflation seems to have shrunk I just wanted to remind you  of that "
5937,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think it would be appropriate for me to begin this morning by acknowledging that, yes, you did tell us so last month You said that our GDP forecast for this year probably was too low, and now we have raised it appreciably Moreover, a little reading between the lines of the Greenbook would indicate that, even with the revisions we have made, we are somewhat more concerned about the possible upside risks to our forecasts for demand and inflation than about the downside risks  With that as preamble, let me engage in a little mind-reading and attempt to anticipate a few of the questions you might have about our revised forecast  First, isn't the upward-revised GDP growth rate of 31 percent that we're showing for the first quarter still rather skimpy, especially in light of the strength of the labor market indicators?  That's certainly a reasonable question Judging by the growth of employment and hours through February and the continuing low level of jobless claims, the increase in labor input almost surely was well above the average of recent quarters Moreover, the data on consumption, housing, and equipment purchases point to a large gain in private domestic final sales However, it is also true that the January figures for net exports and inventory investment were much weaker than their respective fourth-quarter averages Even when we plug in what seem like ample numbers for these two variables in February and March, we still end up with a drop-off in GDP growth  But, you might ask, doesn't that just imply an implausible drop in labor productivity? Yes, it does imply a drop, but obviously not one we find implausible Output per hour has risen considerably in the past two years relative to the underlying trend embedded in our projection--the kind of pickup that one might expect to accompany an acceleration of production If we have it right, a movement back toward the trend line was to be expected over time--and, given the erratic character of the series, a substantial drop in some quarter would be far from shocking That said, in    3/31/98  the present case, we also would not be stunned if the spending data coming in over the next few weeks were to point to a larger gain in Q1 GDP  Well, you are thinking, the first quarter is history, anyway; so the real question is what makes us think that the still greater moderation of GDP growth that we long have been forecasting is here at last? Isn't domestic demand proving to be strong enough to override any damping effect that might be coming from the external sector?  It certainly is conceivable to me that what we are going through now will turn out to be the obverse of the 1987-88 experience In that case, a strong upswing in net exports helped to keep the economic expansion on track in the face of the stock market decline This time around, a booming stock market might offset the effects of a slump in net exports  However, a few considerations lead us to conclude that this scenario is not the most likely I will leave it for Larry to discuss the incoming evidence on the trade front Suffice it to say at this point that the recent news has not undermined our notion that there is--and will be for a while--an appreciable drag on activity coming from the external sector It is not just an Asia story; it is also the lagged effects of a sizable cumulative appreciation of the dollar over the past few years  But, that said, could we be seriously underestimating the ongoing thrust of domestic demand? As we look at it sector by sector, we do not think we have stinted on expenditures Among other things, demand has been boosted recently by the decline in longer-term interest rates over the past year, and we do not foresee that interest rate trend being extended in any meaningful way As many have commented, this has in part been the dividend of the Asian crisis for the US economy To be sure, the predicted softening in economic indicators could revitalize hopes of Fed easing But, unless the bond market bulls are able to push yields materially below the recent range, this should not provide a great amount of additional stimulus  Where we might be especially vulnerable, though, is with respect to the stock market At this point, it appears that the market has entered a phase in which the gravitational pull of valuation may no longer be operating The PE ratio for the S&P 500 recently reached 27, based on trailing 12-month earnings, even as companies were issuing warnings and analysts were lowering their 1998 profit forecasts In the prevailing psychological environment, with people increasingly convinced that the market will inevitably yield returns vastly greater than those available today on liquid fixed-income instruments, the market can keep going appreciably higher on its own momentum--at least until there is an event jarring enough to cause people to reassess their general view of the world    3/31/98  For now, the market is an integral part of a perpetual motion machine that keeps the economy powering ahead We have seen this before, recently in Asia, and while I do not want to overstate that comparison, the issues about bubbles that the Chairman raised in his famous ""irrational exuberance"" speech do seem increasingly relevant We pointed out once again in the Greenbook the difference it might make to the outlook if the market were merely to rise moderately from here--rather than falling somewhat, as we have predicted If the market were instead to keep zooming upward at 20 or 30 percent per year, then the consequences for aggregate demand and thus for inflationary pressures could be quite striking  This brings me to a final question There seems to have been some increase in concern about inflation risks of late, with commentators noting such things as the continued tightness of the labor markets, the recent upturn in oil prices, or the heating up of real estate markets Is there something going on here beyond what we have captured in the Greenbook? Perhaps, but we think that the upward revision we have made to our inflation forecast leaves the risks reasonably balanced--assuming that the predicted output and unemployment path is about right  As we noted in the Greenbook, increases in average hourly earnings --the only broad statistic yet available for this year--have not been getting discernibly larger or smaller of late However, the anecdotal reports seem to be indicating with increasing frequency an acceleration of compensation rates and an increase in recruiting and training costs The picture is still uneven, with many firms saying they are holding the line on pay and others that they are tightly targeting increases to those workers in key positions or with ""hot"" skills And, where pay is raised, it often is through flexible forms of compensation that can be trimmed more easily when business slackens--a feature that we think may be significant in determining the momentum of wage inflation going forward In the end, we bowed only slightly to the anecdotal news and raised our compensation forecast just a touch more than we would have on the basis of the lower unemployment rates in this projection  At this point, we are sticking with the notion that the decline in inflation and inflation expectations over the past year will exert a significant damping influence on nominal wage increases Thus far in 1998, the trend in overall CPI inflation has remained very favorable, owing to the sharp decline in oil prices Moreover, even with the recent firming in oil prices, the outlook for this sector through 1999 now looks more favorable than it did in late January, and we have lowered our forecast for retail energy prices  On the other hand, though it may be splitting hairs to say that the core CPI has increased more rapidly on average in the past couple of months,    3/31/98  there certainly has not been any further downside surprise there The deflationary impact of the Asian crisis appears to be no greater than we anticipated, and with a slightly lower dollar exchange rate path this time, the projected decline in non-oil import prices outside the semiconductor and computer sector is a little shallower Overall, our interpretation of the incoming price news--coupled with the more inflationary labor market conditions in this projection--has been mirrored in the quarter-point elevation of our core CPI forecast  In concluding, I might remind you that we have not built into the baseline projection any allowance for the big hike in cigarette prices that looms as a distinct possibility The legislative proposals keep changing, as they did just yesterday, and the only thing that seems certain right now is that there are lots of people willing to provide the manufacturers with an excuse to raise their prices sharply It is easy to come up with numbers that would add several tenths to the CPI inflation rate at some point This would present the Committee with a challenge it has not faced in some time--that is, deciding whether to accommodate an adverse, rather than a favorable, supply shock  Larry will now comment on factors bearing on the external outlook   I think we need to consider what the source of that difference might be  before we would characterize that as fiscal drag We have not gotten totally inside their brains to  be able to say exactly why their numbers differ from ours, but it appears that one element in the  picture is, in effect, New York's expectation of much larger revenues from capital gains We  normally would not think of that as a particularly restrictive fiscal element People get wealthier;  they presumably anticipate that they will be paying more taxes; and they are not bound by any  liquidity constraint, given their wealth So, if that is the source of the difference, we would not  regard that as implying much additional fiscal restraint Also, I wouldn't say at this point that  the difference is outside the range of normal noise We have had some substantial surprises in  the last few years As the economy gets bigger and bigger, the possible dollar errors grow Even  so, it is a significant difference, and we shall know a lot more in the next few weeks Some of  this is speculation about whether people anticipated their tax liabilities for last year better than  they did for the previous few years There also is uncertainty about the sources of the income  We are not adamant in saying that the New York forecast is wrong, and I am sure that they are  humble about the precision of their forecasting ability, too, at this juncture   It is my understanding that the difference in the projections of the  surplus for the fiscal year, which I believe is on the order of $40 billion, is mostly on the revenue    3/31/98  side, but not all of it is there There are the ongoing questions concerning how appropriations  will play out in terms of authorizations and expenditures   I cannot cite a rule of thumb off the top of my head, but in some of our  models we do have terms for food and energy prices feeding through to the core CPI We did a  simulation that indicated that the effect of the downward movement in energy prices in our  forecast on the core inflation rate this year is somewhere between 1 and 2 percent   It is not negligible, to be sure   We do not have real wages declining, but in 1999 the gap between the  ECI increase and the CPI increase is smaller We are not at all sure that that is the number to  focus on In fact, we prefer to focus on a product price measure rather than the consumer price  index in looking at real wages, and it feeds through, too, to the implications for income shares  We have had very substantial acceleration of real compensation gains over the past two years  We are anticipating sizable further increases in 1998 and 1999 In 1999, it is a smaller increase  and one could explain that in part by the fact that we project a little upcreep in the unemployment  rate We also are banking to some degree on the notion that the ECI and other wage measures  have been boosted over the past year or so by minimum wage hikes These are not present in  this projection One could regard that, I suppose, as another upside risk on the inflation outlook  because there obviously is discussion, albeit fitful, of further minimum wage increases We also  saw a very big increase in commissions and bonuses in the latter part of 1997, which we think  probably will be repeated in the first quarter of 1998 These are associated in part with the huge  level of profits and activity in the financial and real estate sectors We foresee an abatement of  that contribution to compensation increases as we move forward  As I said earlier, we are fairly convinced by all the anecdotal and survey evidence--  indicating that employers have been utilizing more flexible forms of compensation such as cash  bonuses and incentive pay of various sorts--that future adjustments to compensation should be  more sensitive than previously to a deceleration in the economic expansion and a falloff in  profitability such as we have in our forecast In other words, the inertia in adjustments to  compensation that formerly might have been present in such circumstances may not quite as  evident in this cycle Those are the elements that lead us to be fairly sanguine about the  prospects for holding the line on nominal compensation increases even in this tight labor market    3/31/98  We still anticipate sizable increases in real wages that we think are in general conformity with  the Phillips curve model   I am not sure about the ability of John Q Public to filter out all the  cumulative changes from the 1994 approach to measuring consumer prices to the method used in  1999   In the world of instantaneous flows of information, all the economists  will be talking about it and maybe it will filter out into the real world to some degree I guess we  are not totally persuaded one way or the other on this We are inclined to think that in terms of  formal cost of living adjustments and, more informally, to the extent that people look at what the  CPI has done over the past year, they are probably going to be influenced to a considerable  degree by the headline number I did note some tension between the anecdotal and the statistical  news on the wage side This does make us nervous In our survey that all the Reserve Banks  participated in, the focus was more on what business firms are doing, if anything, if they are  experiencing a shortage I think a majority of the firms that were in that predicament said they  were doing something But I think it is difficult to judge the timing and dimension of an    3/31/98  acceleration--how much more they are doing now than they were doing before And in general,  based on this anecdotal evidence, I wonder if there isn't some sort of Heisenberg problem here  We are looking so hard and we are asking so many people that one wonders whether we are  finding a few more stories than we would have if we did not have a neutral expectation about  what was going on We are a bit nervous about this, but I think there is a little upside risk in the  wage outlook  On the price side, I believe the markets and the commentators have gotten a whiff of  the inflation that may be out there Recent housing market developments have intensified that  impression The indexes have been distorted by shifts in geographic mix, but I think the large  increase in prices that was reported in connection with this new home sales figure the other day  is one more instance where people are not looking at those subtleties What they sense is that  this is a really hot market and prices may be moving   This is an area in which economic science has not given us anything  that we want to stake our lives on We have various results with the various models, but I think  we are persuaded that the appreciation of the dollar has had a significant effect Looking at what  is going on in the goods markets, I think the evidence is quite persuasive that we are getting a  significant effect As we go forward, the waning of that effect, given our dollar assumption, does  add a little to the acceleration of prices that we have in the forecast   All of that reflects the arithmetic that I described at the outset as to how  we have added up the GDP components There is the tension between the labor input indicators  and what we can add up on the expenditures side We've seen this before We will see it again  It leaves a lot of room for surprise, but we have reconciled this discrepancy by pumping up the  missing expenditure numbers as much as we felt was reasonable, particularly on the inventory  side We are left with the implication that there was a substantial decline in productivity in the  first quarter As I said, that is not inconceivable to us in terms of our general outlook on the  cyclical, so to speak, element of productivity performance over the forecast period However,  the quarterly change in productivity is sharp and that raises a question We might yet find that  GDP growth did not slow in the first quarter   This is a policy issue on which I have no expertise You are asking  whether I am comfortable with that? I guess what you are saying is that the characterization of  economic activity need not be a reference to GDP growth per se, because the latter may not  capture the sense one has of the vitality of the economy in the first quarter of the year Perhaps  there is some other way that you folks might want to express your view of what you heard at this  meeting   If we talk about it simply from a straight arithmetic point of view,  obviously we would have to find some more expenditures Where might we find them? It could  be in any number of places One could conceive that, despite what looks like a very strong  consumer expenditure number in the first quarter, people really have had a lot of income, though  it is overstated in the first-quarter number because of seasonal adjustment quirks Nonetheless,  consumer spending is strong and is supported by a lot of wealth and people feeling really great  So, there could be an even boomier picture in consumer expenditures than we have projected   In the end, BEA is only going to publish a number that adds up on the  expenditure side, and the productivity numbers are measured that way So, that is how we are  going to have to get there We have only one month of data for net exports and that is a volatile  number, so we could be surprised there Over the past year we have been surprised on final  sales, and there has been an accompanying upside surprise on inventory investment We could    3/31/98  see larger amounts of inventory investment that would be consistent with higher final sales and  with our basic sense that no troublesome accumulation has been occurring Getting up to 4 or 5  percent GDP growth is not totally implausible We could also have some revisions in the  employment figures or something precipitously on the weak side in March that would make up  for the string of upside surprises that have helped to generate this weak productivity number   Again, arithmetically it is Certainly, what we have in this forecast for  1998 in essence is a story where unit labor costs are increasing more rapidly because of the  lagging adjustment of labor input to the deceleration in output Weaker productivity means  weaker profits   I think they have been hiring people in part because business has been  very good and they expect business to continue to be good On the basis of the anecdotal reports,  firms have had such a difficult time finding workers that they're probably still catching up to  some degree That may be one of the reasons the workweek has been on the firmer side than we  would have expected, even allowing for statistical problems I think that continues to happen  There is momentum to this process If we get that stronger first quarter, it is going to imply  accelerator effects and possibly a stronger investment outlook beyond If we get that    3/31/98  performance and stronger profits, it calls into question our expectation of a weaker stock market  So, one could envision, as happened last year, that things could come together in a way that  propels the economy forward and keeps going on with the support of the financial markets On  the other hand, that would imply that we might be moving toward a 4 percent rate of  unemployment this year, and I think that strains one's sense, given what one can already see, of  what is possible without really substantial inflation pressures   It could be less I apologize if word about what we are assuming did  not get to you We have a 10 percent decline in the market from its level last week to the end of    3/31/98  the year and we then have a flat market in 1999 So, in comparison to what we've seen in the  past few years, which as I recall were a couple of close-to-10-percent corrections that were  quickly reversed, this more permanent correction would be a distinct contrast We provided a  simulation in the Greenbook of an alternative GDP path in which in essence the stock market  rises roughly 5 percent a year, enough to keep pace with the growth of nominal disposal income  It makes some material difference when we move out to 1999 As I suggested in my remarks, if  you think the market can do appreciably better than that--and that is really a paltry performance  by the standards of recent years or in relation to what the average investor seems to be  expecting--then the economy's performance will be dramatically different as we move out into  1999 "
5963,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman I might call your attention to the housing data that were put at your places this morning I won't go into that at any length Let me just say that the single-family housing starts and permits data were very close to our expectations, while the multifamily starts were on the low side and really surprisingly low given the trend in permits Multifamily starts are of lesser importance in dollar terms, and we would also expect to see some bounceback So, on the whole, I think these data do not represent a significant departure from what we had in the Greenbook for residential construction activity  We have seen some astonishing economic data since the last meeting, and we have worked hard to make sense of them In the end, what we have    5/19/98  presented to you in the Greenbook is a forecast that, from the current quarter on, looks much like the prior version in terms of both growth and inflation I hope that this is not simply because we are unimaginative or stubborn, but rather because we have shown good judgment in processing the various surprises that came our way  For some of you, the central question probably is how we could have looked at a first-quarter GDP increase that we now estimate at more than 5 percent, along with April's 4-1/4 percent jobless rate, and still not have come up with a scarier price forecast I will focus my remarks on that question, with the expectation that I will end up addressing some of your other concerns along the way  First, there is no doubt about it The first quarter was a stunner As you may recall, I did say at the last meeting that it would not be a shock to see the forthcoming expenditure data come in strong enough to push the GDP growth rate a point or two above our 3 percent prediction But, at the time, we knew only about the huge increases in payrolls in January and February; I would have been more conservative if we had known that employment had declined in March  In any event, the incoming spending data prior to the April 30 release of BEA's advance estimate really did not prepare us for a GDP number as high as the 42 percent they published The major surprise was their big inventory component It was not a matter of their writing down a questionably high set of assumptions for the missing March data They did not Instead, it was mainly the translation of the available book-value data for January and February into real terms We talked with the BEA staff who did the calculations, and we could not find any flaws in their methods  That said, though, $67 billion of nonfarm inventory investment still looked awfully large to us, coming as it did on the heels of a similarly high rate of accumulation in the fourth quarter It seemed odd that stocks could be piling up so much more rapidly than final sales without our hearing more reports that firms were concerned about excess inventories  All things considered, it looked in late April as if there was a good chance that subsequent data would point toward a downward revision to the Q1 GDP number--most likely in the inventory category Well, you know what happened We got a string of stronger-than-anticipated inventory readings for March, plus some upward revisions for prior months All told, we think these ran the nonfarm inventory tab up to a whopping $93 billion--more than 3 times what might plausibly be sustainable in the steady state  Recognizing the important implications this would have for the dynamics of our forecast, we considered again whether there were any chinks in the data    5/19/98  that might be grounds for discounting them in anticipation of later revisions Finding none, at least of a statistical nature, we went ahead with the straightforward translation in the Greenbook What we did was to adjust our expectations regarding the March international trade report, which will come out tomorrow, with the thought that some of the increased inventory accumulation might be reflected in a wider trade gap than BEA assumed This did not alter the inventory picture itself, but it seemed sensible in terms of better aligning the production and expenditure data  So, as it stands, it is the high level of inventory investment in the first quarter that is the key reason why, despite the indications of strong momentum in private domestic final demand, our GDP growth rate for the remaining seven quarters of our forecast is virtually the same as it was a couple of months ago There are many risks here One is that the Q1 inventory bulge really was not so large, and thus that the drag of the forthcoming adjustment will be less than we have anticipated Another is that, even if the number is right, we could be wrong in our prediction of the timing of the adjustment We have a substantial deceleration occurring already this quarter and carrying into the summer, and that is a crucial ingredient in the immediate, and quite marked, slowing of GDP growth in this forecast  That such a slowing in activity is indeed in train is far from clear right now For a variety of statistical reasons, discussed in gory detail in the Greenbook, the labor market data are unusually opaque at this time; however, it is our general sense that if there has been a reduction in the growth of labor demand, it has not been commensurate with the degree of GDP slowing that we are predicting In other words, we are expecting that the slowing in output growth will be mirrored in large measure by a slackening in productivity gains Of course, I told you a similar story at the last meeting in regard to the first quarter; I will understand if you are a little skeptical now  But while I'm on the subject of productivity behavior, let me take this opportunity to segue to another conjectural aspect of our forecast, namely the revised productivity trend Based on a review of recent developments and of the newly available data on multifactor productivity through 1996, we have raised our assumption regarding the trend growth of output per hour in the nonfarm business sector by a quarter percentage point per annum This might not sound like much, but it is significant in offsetting the surprise we have had with respect to the unemployment rate It provides an offset in two ways It mutes the effect of a higher GDP path on the unemployment rate, and it also means that a given rate of compensation gain translates into a smaller increment in standardized unit labor costs This helps to explain why, despite the recent surprises, the unemployment rate is only a hair lower by next year than in the last forecast and why we have not raised the inflation forecast    5/19/98  Of course, we not only have not raised our inflation forecast, we actually have trimmed it a tenth This puts us more clearly below the consensus, although I am not sure how many of the private forecasters are being as assiduous as we are about keeping track of the damping effects of the ongoing BLS technical revisions to the CPI I may not be able to persuade the doubters among you of the wisdom of our view, but for the purposes of setting the stage for discussion, I will remind you briefly of the major ingredients of the forecast  First, on the compensation side, we have absolutely no doubt that the labor market is extremely taut We are a bit skeptical about the 4-1/4 percent unemployment rate registered in the survey last month, but whatever the true number is, we are sure that workers have gained some clout in the pay-setting process Nonetheless, the March ECI figures showed wage and salary increases right in line with our expectations and benefit cost increases below our guess Thus, there was nothing in that report to negate the basic premises of our forecast of flat nominal compensation inflation namely, that low price inflation will damp wage increases; that there will be no repetition of the minimum wage hikes that boosted pay rates in the past couple of years; and that, though health insurance costs will be increasing more rapidly, a slowing of the economic expansion will take some of the ""oomph"" out of commissions and bonuses Time will tell whether this sanguine assessment is right, but we are sticking with it for now  On the price side, the incoming data have been close to our expectations, though we can find some reasons to worry The tobacco price increases keep coming at us, and we have not incorporated a legislative action that might lead to much steeper increments than we have been seeing of late The 04 percent jump in owners' equivalent rent in last month's CPI could be a harbinger of a more adverse trend in a stronger housing market And there are signs of price increases happening elsewhere, too  But, against that consideration, one must also weigh the continued indications of softness in prices in many sectors--the lack of ""pricing leverage"" still so widely reported, especially in goods markets The fact is that there are substantial segments of the economy where prices are going nowhere or downward because there is slack industrial capacity, intense import competition, deregulation, cost-saving technological advances, and so on Commodity prices clearly are not signaling an upturn in inflation In fact, oil companies will tell you of a supply-demand picture that leaves them concerned that prices might go down from here The predictions regarding the likely fall grain harvest suggest the possibility of price-depressing inventory buildups, especially if the Asian crisis countries are not able to reverse the dramatic contractions in their ag imports Semiconductors are in abundant supply, leading to steep declines in the prices of chips going into computers and innumerable other items I am told by an auto company economist that his firm    5/19/98  is actually thinking about targeting declining vehicle prices in future negotiations with their parts suppliers In short, there is no sign that goods prices are on the brink of acceleration, and they could be even weaker in the near term than they have been  We have noted for some time that, if one looked at the factory utilization rate as the indicator of pressures on productive resources generally, one would not only have done better in predicting what has happened to overall prices to date, but one would also be looking for appreciable further deceleration ahead We have not gone that whole hog by any means We have stayed closer to what might be suggested by the unemployment rate outlook We think a little caution is called for, given the possibility that the end of the favorable supply- side shocks of the dollar's appreciation and health care cost-cutting might be more important than is apparent at this point  I have gone on, now, at some length, without touching on perhaps the most crucial issue in the economic outlook--namely, the prospects for final demand The risks and uncertainties here are obvious Asia is one that remains prominent; the possibility that we shall yet head toward one of the ""worse case"" scenarios is still out there, but at least thus far the direct effects on the United States through the trade channel have been in line with our expectations On the domestic side, the latest reports on the retail sector and the housing market have given further evidence of the robustness of demand trends  It was not a slip that we mentioned in the Greenbook the current catch phrase, ""bubble economy"" We continue to believe that the rise in equity prices has been a key element in the persistent strength of spending And we remain concerned about the possibility that the market will continue to climb even in the absence of earnings gains It is commonly remarked that this is a ""liquidity driven"" market, the implication being that it will take an appreciable tightening of monetary policy--or the fear of one--to prompt a serious correction Perhaps the hints of a little sterner antitrust posture will put a damper on mega-merger speculation, but that has not materialized yet And the market has largely shaken off the renewed slump in Asian equity markets So, at this point, I think one has to consider the possibility that, rather than weakening even slightly, as we have forecast, the stock market will climb appreciably further and give an added boost to domestic demand   I think the analysis is a little more complicated than that, and I will  spare you some of the details I would probably stumble over them in any event We have been  building into our forecast a substantial allowance for a positive effect on productivity from capital  deepening We did not have a set of numbers that was as up-to-date as we would have liked, and  the recent statistical release has clarified that picture What we found was that the productivity  effects on the capital deepening side probably were not as large as we had estimated earlier, and yet  we also saw more favorable data on other components of the productivity picture  One of them was a step-up in the rate of improvement in labor quality That always  seemed to be a possibility We know that college enrollments have been increasing We have seen  recently some increase in participation among older, more experienced workers Whether such  workers are truly as productive as one might assume on the basis of their experience is conjectural,  given the changes in technology and other innovations But looking at the compositional changes  in the workforce and the influx of recent college graduates who may have more current skills in  terms of what employers are looking for, it seemed reasonable to us to extrapolate that recent  improvement in our forecast  So, taking our investment forecast, extending what we have learned about the capital  services contribution, extrapolating in a sensible way in light of recent labor markets developments  the information we have on the quality of labor stemming from greater education, we concluded  that it was reasonable to raise our assumption about the productivity trend We triangulated against  all the other information that was available--the continuing surprises in the recent labor    5/19/98  productivity growth figures and how these fit with the Okun's law relation--and we concluded that  this elevation of our number was reasonable  I must say that we are not alone in our estimate of a 1-1/2 percent productivity growth  trend I think DRI is there People bringing different technology to these estimates come up with  different conclusions, but we feel that this is a reasonably sound move for us at this point   I think I voiced my concern in this regard, maybe not clearly enough  There are a couple of possibilities here One is, as I indicated, that while we cannot find a flaw in  the data at this point, inventory investment may still have been significantly less rapid than the  first-quarter numbers currently seem to add up to On the other hand, we have to cut such  investment back a long way to get to as lean an inventory picture as we had just a couple of  quarters ago in terms of inventory-sales ratios Another possibility is that businesses are so  optimistic or they see so many opportunities to pick up relatively inexpensive supplies--perhaps  because of what is happening on the import side--that they are building up their inventories  willingly, and we will see this in the data that will get released in the weeks ahead Thus, there  may not be as big a drag from inventories in the near term as in the Greenbook forecast  MRPARRY Voluntary accumulation, but unwise!    5/19/98   In the short run, that provides a little more support to production,  employment, and income growth, and this process can be self-sustaining to a point But I think the  level of inventories is high enough now that one has to anticipate a gearing down in the rate of  inventory accumulation at some point in the coming months Whether it will be as quick and sharp  in the second quarter as we have in the forecast is an open question  I might note that a good part of that dropback is in the oil sector where inventories ran  up very substantially in the first quarter We are not expecting a repetition of that When we strip  that out, the moderation in inventory accumulation in the second quarter is not quite so dramatic  In fact, for the remaining components of inventory investment, there is still quite ample additional  accumulation that would be quite unsustainable by our lights   The process by which price movements enter into the determination of  wages is very complex The movements in the CPI are a benchmark in some collective bargaining  situations where employers are gauging an appropriate pay increase to offer their employees in the  hope that the workers will not be so perturbed about where they stand relative to others that they  will leave Movements in the CPI also serve as a benchmark in many cases outside of collective  bargaining where a one-sided decision has to be made Employers will look at what has happened  to the published index over the past year, or some other relevant period, and make that an important  element in their decision In some cases where there are complex systems of general base pay  increases that are supplemented by merit pay increases and bonuses and so on, that first element  may be very much influenced by the perception of what has been happening to the cost of living I  think these year-by-year changes that you are talking about--you referred to the Greenbook level of  CPI inflation in 1999--involve comparisons using 1994 methods They are cumulative and  overstate the differences from year to year We are talking about differences of only 1 or 2  percentage point for each of these years That is a subtlety that probably is missed in those cases  where people are simply looking at the published CPI to gauge what the appropriate pay increase  might be Part of this process is, I think, simply a backward-looking one as I described It is a  cost-of-living catch-up, formal or informal  There probably also is some influence from expectations that may not be entirely  backward-looking On that score, we have no evidence that people are expecting a dramatic pickup  in inflation The recent survey evidence has shown a declining trend in inflation expectations,  though with some small uptick in the Michigan Survey last month The expected level of inflation  is not down to the measured level of inflation yet That might suggest that some people are not  going to conclude that if they get a 2 percent wage increase, that increase is going to keep them    5/19/98  whole over the next year But I think the downward progression of readings on inflation  expectations would suggest that, whatever their influence on wages was a year ago, it is probably  going to be less this year So, we think that both the price changes we have seen and the  expectational changes will tend to moderate nominal wage increases  An important point is that real wage increases have been very sizable, as measured  against product prices in particular but even against overall consumer prices in the last year What  we are forecasting in the next seven quarters is a continuation of very sizable real wage increases in  product price terms It could be that this whole process will escalate, but at this point we don't see  a big surge coming from the price side So, we don't see any reason to think that the way to  reconcile these things is to jack up both our wage and price forecasts in the near term There's a  certain momentum here that I think is quite favorable for the wage outlook  Benefit costs are very erratic from quarter to quarter We did get a downside surprise  for the first quarter We are assuming that there will be some catch-up in the quarters ahead You  may have seen the horror stories about medical benefit cost increases in this morning's Wall Street  Journal The second page had another story about how businesses are trying to head these  increases off or offset them in some way by making employees pay for a bigger proportion of the  cost if they do not take the cheapest plan Our expectation is that there will be a perceptible uptick  in medical benefit costs and in the total compensation picture Just to give you a rough handle on  the quantities involved here, if we had an extra 5 percentage points added to the rate of medical  benefit cost increases going forward, that would add about 2 or 1/4 percent to the overall increases  in labor costs The cost of benefits is important, but it takes really big numbers to greatly disturb  the trend here   That is an interesting question, and it may suggest that the way I  approached the prior question was not right In a sense, we think these changes are improvements  in the measurement of inflation because they better capture reality I guess that suggests that if all  along people had been making their decisions based on something more like the reality than the  published numbers, then they would not perceive, for example, that their real wages were going up  faster than the measured numbers suggest   We think these numbers better capture the reality We also think that it  is important to keep tabs on this in thinking about whether there is an acceleration or not in the rate  of inflation   We are moving only incrementally toward reality in the measurement  changes The fact that we are getting there gradually means there is a distortion in the underlying  acceleration   I'm sure they would be happy to accommodate us for a price  [Laughter]   I suspect that the Michigan survey people might have some qualms  about injecting that question, given the possibility that it would disturb the answer to the  subsequent question   They don't have to give survey participants the correct answer for some  index In fact, I don't think the question relates to any particular index   That would be a safer approach in that respect   We have talked to a number of business people and have attended  meetings where economists from various corporations talked about these things There are not a lot  of industries where the accumulation of inventories stands out I can cite a few anecdotes and a  few statistics that I think might be worthwhile The chemical industry clearly has had a substantial  increase in inventories and a big run-up in its inventory-sales ratio That is probably at least partly  related to Asian developments I believe there has been an upturn in pulp and paper I have heard  of some stocking up by electronics firms that thought it was a good time to buy because prices were  good We have a few anecdotes, including some in the Beigebook, that indicate that some firms    5/19/98  have taken advantage of low prices being offered by Asian suppliers to build up their inventories in  some materials   There is no doubt on the oil side My sense is that the buildup was  only to a modest degree the result of price speculation It appears to have been much more the  result of softer-than-anticipated demand for petroleum products because of the warm winter  weather   Right   Yes We showed these data in our briefings for the Board yesterday  that I hope the presidents received Neither the Purchasing Managers' survey nor the NFIB survey  provides significant evidence that there has been any unintended, undesired accumulation of  inventories in the first quarter One of the things we did not highlight in our briefings but that also  is part of the survey is a question about inventory plans The April reading in the NFIB survey  showed a startling jump in plans to build inventories   It may be that they are reflecting what has happened but, be that as it  may, the April number took a big jump It actually looks weird For what it's worth, no concern  was expressed there, and in fact the NFIB survey overall, as interpreted by their own people, would  suggest that the growth of the economy in the second quarter will be as strong as it was in the first,  and that did not come as any surprise to them According to their survey, second-quarter growth is  going to be stupendously strong   Let me offer two very brief final points One is on the financial side  If one looks at the business financing flows, short-term business credit in particular, those flows are  not inconsistent at all with there having been a strong run-up in inventories earlier in the year And  what we have in hand for the first part of the second quarter is entirely consistent with a big  reversal, sharper than the one we have in the Greenbook   Yes I was going to caution that this is not an entirely reliable  indicator There are a lot of things going on in the financial sector   The other point I want to make is that it is not simply a question in our  minds of whether this inventory buildup is involuntary It is in large measure simply a question of  whether the inventory accumulation was as rapid as was indicated for the first part of the year  because, one way or another, that rate of inventory investment needs to come down If it was  involuntary, then we might expect a more rapid orders and production adjustment, but the drag  would still be there over time   Right   On the stock market, President Poole, this is a recurring question and it  puts us in a tough logical bind You suggested a formulation that would have grossly  underforecasted what happened to stock prices over the past couple of years but not as much as we  have [Laughter]   We took a punch on that one, and it has been painful But the other  issue is one of simple coherence To the extent that we have any inkling of what is built into the  stock market in terms of expectations about monetary policy, interest rates in general, earnings, the  behavior of the economy, and so on, it leaves us uncomfortable to ignore all that and write down  something that implies a vast extension of price-earnings multiples beyond what we have seen So,  we have taken the approach of trying to put in a stock market path that seemed more consistent It  has not stood us in good stead to date Over the past couple of years, we certainly would have been  better off using the approach you outlined Whether that could be said going forward, we do not  know But it is a point we continue to think about   Are you talking about nominal figures here?   Total personal income, not disposable?   I have not focused on that measure We have a considerable slowing in  the economy--   I can see in the detail of our forecasts a number of components that we  have shifting Transfer payments, for example, fall off, presumably because of the spurt in social  security payments in the first quarter But I guess I don't have a compelling answer for you Total  personal income in the first half is still rising at a rate close to 5 percent, which is not far below the  average pace last year when employment growth was even faster than we have over the first half of  this year Perhaps there's something in these quarterly numbers that I can't immediately put my  finger on to explain this   When we go out that far, I don't have a big problem reconciling this  growth path with the much more modest increases in employment that we are forecasting It is  more with regard to this first quarter-second quarter pattern that I am not prepared to give you a  nice crisp answer as to why we have that particular gyration But as we move out in time, the  question is whether the economy is going to moderate as we have forecast If it does and if  productivity holds up reasonably well, employment gains will be much smaller and they will be  entirely consistent with this kind of slackening in the growth of nominal personal income in our  forecast   You're switching gears on me! Before I was addressing the question of  employment growth and how that is slackening substantially over the forecast period and  accounting for a good part of this slower growth in personal income The other question is what is  going to happen to real wage rates or nominal wage rates I discussed that earlier There is not a  great deal I can add to what I said about our theory in that regard What we are predicting, given  the price path, is not at all at odds with what history suggests in terms of models that relate wage  changes to past price changes and measures of labor market tightness The situation in terms of the  workers being fooled for a period and then some catch-up occurring is something that we have  made some allowance for, at least in our minds, in that we anticipated that the NAIRU would come  down a bit as the productivity trend shifted upward This productivity gain was not immediately  recognized, so employers might have been able to get away with more moderate nominal wage    5/19/98  increases, some of that showing up in lower inflation and some of it showing up in higher profits in  the short run That process may be reversing We are assuming a little tick back up in the NAIRU  Maybe it will be more dramatic than what we have allowed for  In the end, we are monitoring the incoming data as closely as anyone can As I said,  what we have seen in the recent numbers has not been at odds with our expectations You can  eyeball the moving averages on a number of these series and see an upward drift that you will  extrapolate, given your sense of what is going on Or you can look and see that, after you have  allowed for some of the bumps along the way with respect to the minimum wage and have looked  at the recent period, it is not clear that there is an ongoing acceleration in the recent numbers  Maybe more of this compensation is taking forms that are not captured well in the measures That  means there may well be a cost that employers are incurring that is not going to be reflected in the  wage data That would be something one would want to take account of, I think   Obviously, we would look at a number on personal income and adjust  our forecast as appropriate The personal income number is rarely something that is of enormous  importance in itself because we think we have some rough handle on how those numbers are  estimated from the available data on hours and average hourly earnings and so on   No, it reflects the thought that our stock price assumption might be too  low or that we might be putting too much of a premium on what we think is rational investor  behavior As we see it, if the market continues to go up, the wealth effects, cost of capital effects,  and so on would stimulate greater aggregate demand We leave it to you to determine whether the  implications of stronger aggregate demand for inflation would be troubling and thus whether some  policy action might be warranted In all likelihood, a substantial monetary policy tightening would  have some damaging effect on equity prices That is, I think, how we see this sentence   Exactly   There is some massaging As we have indicated, at the present time  with all of the uncertainties about the measurement of the average workweek and average hourly    5/19/98  earnings, that massaging is more important To a first approximation, we think we know how BLS  is doing this, and that is not normally an independent piece of information of great importance   We tried to address this issue once again I assume that President  Poole noticed this in Part I We do have a simulation where the stock market rises moderately  Given the uncertainties about equity premiums, I am not sure what your formula translates into, but  basically the alternative has the equity values rising with nominal personal income So, running  this through the model, we get a significantly faster growth of GDP We think that what we have  assumed is reasonable given our expectations of earnings against what seem to be still very buoyant  earnings forecasts While they have come down for 1998 among private analysts, it seems as if  most of them think the damage is entirely behind us and that earnings are going to be moving up  rapidly in the second half of this year and into 1999 "
5989,1998-06-30," We will be using the set of charts titled ""Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook""2/ But before I turn to the first exhibit, I want to take a minute to update you on the implications of the late-breaking data--particularly Friday's report on personal consumption As you know, the downward revisions to spending in March and April, along with a mild downside surprise with respect to the May increase, left us on a path that makes it unlikely we will see the 5+ percent growth of real PCE that was predicted in the Greenbook If we were starting afresh today, we would write down something in the low 4 percent range  Some of the surprise in these data appears to have reflected a different split of auto sales between consumption and producers' durables, which does not affect GDP But that is only part of the shortfall, and we would now trim our forecast for second-quarter GDP growth to about 1-1/2 percent Seemingly, some of what the GDP gods unexpectedly gave us in the first quarter they may have taken away in the second--still leaving us, though, with a quite impressive overall first-half performance for GDP  2/ Copies of the charts are appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)    6/30-7/1/98  Perhaps there was a more graceful way to start our presentation than with a correction of the Greenbook forecast, but at this point we do not see this news as undermining the major themes in the outlook that we will be addressing So, let me turn now to the first chart, which provides a brief summary of our projections  In the top panels, you can see that we are forecasting a marked slowing of the economic expansion The thin red line shows the quarter-to-quarter movements in real GDP, while the black line captures the broader contours via a four-quarter percent change We believe that growth will remain low over the next six quarters--indeed, considerably below the trend growth of potential output, which we put at almost 2-3/4 percent over this period  Under these circumstances, we expect to see unemployment drift upward, as indicated in the middle panels By the end of this year, the jobless rate approaches 4-1/2 percent and by the end of 1999, 5 percent  Even with this rise, labor markets will still be tight, putting pressure on real wages and on prices as well We see the CPI rising only 1-3/4 percent this year but picking up to 2-1/4 percent next year In the chart, we have also shown the time series adjusted for technical changes to the index since 1994, the red line, so that you can get a sense of the ""true"" degree of deceleration and acceleration over time  Chart 2 addresses some facets of the financial backdrop for this projection We have once again predicated our forecast on the assumption that there will be no significant shift in the federal funds rate through next year Although we anticipate that nominal bond yields eventually will back up a bit, as you can see in the top panel, there are no really exciting movements in real rates in the forecast Given that the economy has been chugging along in the face of the current monetary policy setting--at least up to the current quarter--this might naturally lead one to ask what we think is going to produce the sustained weakening of aggregate demand growth we have predicted  From the financial side, one answer is merely that we do not have a repetition of the decline in longer-term rates that has provided a boost to economic growth over the past year But another answer can be found in our stock market forecast We are anticipating a decline of just six percent in share prices, occurring over the next several months As the middle panel shows, we estimate that this would roughly flatten out the price-earnings multiple on the S&P 500 I won't take up your time with the umpteenth restatement of our skepticism regarding the sustainability of these valuation levels The panel points up just one extraordinary aspect of the market's performance--which is that the P/E is not only at an historic high, but that, in    6/30-7/1/98  contradiction of past patterns, it has reached that level well past the trough of the earnings cycle  Indeed, it is our sense that the current market level reflects, in part, unrealistic expectations about future profitability The lower left panel shows the divergence between Wall Street strategists' predictions for earnings and our own One might argue that this difference is the stuff of a greater market correction, but the ability of the market to continue its levitation act thus far this year makes us reluctant to go much further than we have In any event, the end of the stock market uptrend will itself remove another source of impetus to demand  Finally, in fixed-income markets, we expect that, if and as the economy shows signs of persistently slower growth and weaker profits, lenders and bond investors will turn a bit more cautious As you can see at the right, there has been only a slight widening of risk premiums in the bond market to date, and that reflected at least in part a heavy supply of new junk bond issues rather than a fundamental shift in investor attitudes We expect spreads to remain relatively modest, but again, we see things moving in a less stimulative direction than they have over the past couple of years  Of obvious importance for financial market sentiment and for demand trends in the economy is the denouement of the drama playing out overseas And so, we turn now to Peter Hooper for his assessment of the outlook in that regard   I think the domestic demand picture is sufficiently familiar to you that I can run through the highlights quite quickly We are expecting a substantial deceleration of both household and business spending Chart 10 summarizes the household side The Greenbook predicted a quite noticeable drop-off in the growth of consumer spending in the wake of the first-quarter surge, and the latest data suggest that that slowing has come a bit faster than the previous figures had indicated But, even 4+ percent in the second quarter is a pretty hefty further gain, and the fundamentals at this point are still highly favorable to demand So, we would be inclined to stick with the general contour of the forecast represented by the heavy black line in the upper left panel, which shows the four-quarter change in PCE dropping off from over 4 percent at this point to something closer to 2-1/2 percent in 1999 One indication of the favorable fundamentals is the still high reading on consumer sentiment in the June Michigan survey, portrayed at the right For many households, I suspect that the rising value of their stock portfolios has been a significant source of their confidence and willingness to spend The middle left panel documents the remarkable run-up in the ratio of wealth to income, the black line Historically, the personal saving rate has tended to move inversely with the wealth ratio, and the current episode is no exception The anticipated decline in share prices implies a drop in the wealth-income ratio over the next year and a half and--allowing for lags--this contributes to a leveling out of the saving rate, thereby explaining the moderation of spending growth  In the housing market, all signals on demand are still flashing green Yesterday, the Census figures showed new home sales edging up to a new high in May, and--as plotted at the right--the homebuilders' survey for early June showed their index of sales activity also setting a record As we look ahead, a modest updrift in mortgage rates in combination with a slowing in employment and income gains will take some of the ""oomph"" out of the market, but, as shown in the bottom left panel, housing affordability as measured by the cash-flow burden of ownership will remain very favorable Thus, we are projecting a decline in housing starts that leaves the level still comparable to the high readings of the past few years  Turning to the next chart, which relates to business spending, the upper left panel highlights one of the most important elements in the dynamics of our forecast Over the past year, a significant component of the growth of GDP has been the rise in the pace of inventory accumulation--the black line Stocks have been rising much faster than the trend of final sales--the red line This is not a sustainable pattern, and we think we see signs in the April data that a drop-off in stocking may be in the cards We still have a sizable accumulation of non-auto stocks in the current quarter, however, and so we    6/30-7/1/98  expect that a further slowing of inventory growth will be putting a considerable damper on demand over the second half of the year  As the expansion of demand is perceived to be slowing, businesses will likely be less anxious to invest in plant and equipment as well The black line in the right panel shows that we are projecting that real BFI growth will slow from about 12 percent over the past year to half that pace in 1999 Because the level of investment will still be rising, though, we estimate that this forecast implies that capital stock growth, the middle left panel, will remain substantial--exceeding the pace of output expansion  Although we believe that declining capacity utilization will be causing discomfort in some sectors--especially in manufacturing--there are some basic considerations favoring a rise in the desired capital-output ratio An obvious one is portrayed at the right the declining relative cost of equipment, particularly computers and communications equipment It is with the expectation that the prices of such information technology will continue to decline rapidly that we are predicting that investment in capital equipment will continue growing at a good clip through next year  As you can see at the lower left, the data on new orders booked by domestic manufacturers of nondefense capital goods are already providing a possible hint of the projected pattern of investment, with orders for computers and communications equipment having risen appreciably, even in nominal terms, this year, while orders for other equipment have leveled out I should note, however, that it is tricky to translate these data into GDP expenditures, given that international trade is so important in this sector  Finally, we are predicting that the structures component of BFI will be rising modestly over the coming quarters As suggested by the vacancy rates at the right, trends and conditions differ across the various markets, but it is our sense that there are enough areas of strength to push aggregate construction somewhat higher The recent upturn in the monthly data on construction was heartening in this regard; but, frankly, we are not yet sure whether the latest data are reflecting an actual change or simply the first stage of a statistical improvement that will be followed up subsequently by significant upward revisions to the historical time series  But, before I lapse into further discussion of statistical arcana, let me turn the floor over to Dave Stockton for a more important subject--the outlook for inflation   The last exhibit is the usual summary of the projections you submitted for Humphrey-Hawkins purposes If you scan down the second column, where we have listed the central tendencies, you will see    6/30-7/1/98  that most of you are expecting real GDP to grow 3 to 3-1/4 percent over the four quarters of 1998, with CPI inflation running 1-1/4 to 2 percent for the year and the jobless rate holding in a 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent range This is a stronger, more inflationary forecast than ours, and you remain slightly to the high side of the Greenbook in 1999 The central tendency range for GDP growth next year, at 2 to 2-1/2 percent, allows the unemployment rate to inch upward to between 4/2 and 4 percent, but inflation also edges up, into the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range  We have included in the table the Administration's forecasts, because these must be addressed in the Humphrey-Hawkins report As you can see, in the mid-session budget review document, the Administration predicted smaller increases in nominal and real GDP than your tentative central tendency ranges for the two years and a tad less inflation, on average I have my doubts, though, that this will lead to harsh criticism from the Administration that you are intending to pursue an excessively accommodative monetary policy!  This concludes our presentation, and we will be happy to answer any questions you might wish to raise   As you know, there are no direct observations on this One significant  element in the rapid accumulation of inventories in the first quarter was oil Clearly, the greater  flexibility in supply in the short run will be on the import side as opposed to domestic  production So, as that buildup in oil stocks unwinds, we would expect the impact to be more on  the import side Actually, we have seen some further accumulation in the second quarter as best  we can tell The buildup has gotten to the point where there is not much more room for storing  oil Some is probably being stored on ships in distant places on the oceans We expect this  continuing accumulation of oil inventories to end in the near term  Outside the oil sector, if we look at the normal ratios of imports to various categories  of domestic expenditures, I think we can make a case that a very substantial component of the  inventory pickup in the first quarter was probably in imports There have been anecdotes to the  effect that some stock building has occurred to take advantage of bargains that were available  either in components or in finished goods So, yes, we think that while a complex interaction is  involved--just because something was imported doesn't mean that the offset will be in imports in    6/30-7/1/98  the future; the adjustment could still involve displacing domestic production--our forecast  contemplates this in terms of our overall import growth and our domestic spending patterns   Part of it is simply an assessment of what the underlying trends would  be and the fact that consumer spending was at such a high level in the first quarter Even if  second-quarter consumer expenditures were to drop off to the 4 percent plus growth area, or  somewhat below our forecast, the first half would still be very strong That is a significant  element in the picture Another is that the second quarter would be weaker still were it not for  the extra incentives that were provided for auto purchases, and that is a factor that will reverse in  the second half of the year So, it is distorting the intra-yearly pattern   I think we crossed the Rubicon on this We recognize that it is hard to  express this thought, but we have come to the conclusion that everyone understands this area   Peter Hooper will say something in response to your question about oil  prices   I think one has to ask, too, whether the current prices are not  abnormally low because of the oil storage constraints We are getting a contango in the market  that may be extreme There also are some fine points in the current situation that may be  exaggerated   As to the general outlook for domestic demand, your point is well  taken There is an alternative view in which the multiplier-accelerator effects that flow from the  external shock and the inventory investment correction are inadequate to precipitate the kind of  slowing of employment growth and domestic demand expansion that we are anticipating Were  the stock market to continue going up, that would certainly add something to the prospective  growth of domestic demand We have been surprised repeatedly in the last couple of years, and I  cannot rule out a further surprise On the other hand, one could point to some risks on the other  side We have had very high rates of accumulation of consumer and producer durables The  capacity utilization rate in manufacturing is already below its historical average, and if indeed  profitability begins to wane and manufacturers decide they want to cut back some more, there  could be a weaker business investment picture than we have projected  We think this is a reasonably balanced forecast Our model simulations in effect say  that we currently have rather high real interest rates If we take out the extra stimulus that has  been coming from the outsized increase in share prices, at least as many models would interpret  that stimulus, we then have this factor weighing on demand going forward So, I think a case  can be made on either side of this forecast I cannot rule out your being right If you had said  this a year ago, we would have been in the same position and you would have been proven to be  the one who was correct    6/30-7/1/98   There is an obvious circularity in our forecast in that, were it not for the  slowing of demand, we would not have the cyclical deceleration in productivity that Dave  Stockton talked about and the related deterioration in profits It's not that we are anticipating  any deterioration in the productivity trend In fact, we are anticipating a continuation of the more  favorable trend that we have estimated for the past couple of years It has been in a sense a  supply shock of the type President Jordan has talked about a number of times That supply  shock, working through the stock market as you described, has created the compensating  aggregate demand to absorb that additional supply In a sense, as we have shown in simulations  in the past, we need a higher real interest rate to equilibrate things in the face of that kind of  shock   I don't drink beer! I am wondering how the record will look in five  years [Laughter]   Given the turnover of the Committee, it probably would be sensible for  us to recirculate that material, at least to all those who have not received it "
6013,1998-08-18," Frankly, I'm hard pressed to see where I can add much of value to what you already have heard this morning or read in the Greenbook Much of the drama during the intermeeting period was on the international side, which Ted has just covered The domestic development that has attracted the most attention, the decline of the stock market, has been pretty much of the dimension we predicted last time and for the reason we gave--namely, disappointing corporate earnings  Looking ahead, our forecast has been altered only a little, mainly to incorporate the more negative outlook for the external sector and to deal with the additional short-run gyrations associated with the longer-than-anticipated GM strike The basic story, however, remains one of a deceleration in economic activity and some worsening of inflation  Perhaps the interesting point is that we appear to be predicting a considerably weaker expansion of aggregate demand than are the majority of forecasters For example, the latest Blue Chip consensus shows nominal GDP growing around 4-1/4 percent over the six quarters of our projection period--the    8/18/98  better part of a percentage point above the Greenbook prediction--even though their short-term interest rates are, like ours, flat  I can't tell you for sure why our forecast differs from the average view of the several dozen Blue Chippers, but the available detail on their forecasts contains one compelling clue Only two members of the Blue Chip panel have real net exports in 1999 as low as the Greenbook forecast, and the consensus view is that the trade gap will widen only around $25 billion over the next six quarters, versus more than $100 billion in our forecast Even allowing for the endogeneities that President Poole emphasized at a prior meeting, I feel quite comfortable in asserting that this difference is a key factor in our more subdued outlook While I can't prove who is right on this, I will note--because humility would prevent Ted from doing so--that in the past couple of years he and his colleagues have been much more on track than the private analysts with regard to the deterioration in our trade position  Of course, even if we don't seem to be at odds with the Blue Chip panel with respect to the tenor of the domestic demand outlook, that doesn't mean we're right on that side Expectations of a slackening of demand have repeatedly been disappointed in the past couple of years, and there is no assurance that it will materialize this time We continue to think that the performance of the stock market has been, and will be, a key factor The revisions to the national income accounts have done nothing to diminish our belief in the significance of the ""wealth effect"" Although the recent slide in equity prices has erased only a modest portion of the gains that had accrued to investors, the mere cessation of wealth increases relative to income would remove an impetus to household demand And this, in turn, would prompt businesses to curtail the growth of their inventories and fixed capital  This is, of course, the scenario that we have described in our forecast We have the Wilshire 5000 running at a level around 10,000 through next year; it closed less than one percent above that level yesterday after exceeding 11,000 a few weeks ago As we noted in the Greenbook, even with that correction, shares still seem to be very generously valued, given what we see as the plausible scope for corporate earnings growth from the high levels already attained But, while some hints of rationality perhaps have crept into the market, one still hears people saying that there is no other good place to put investible funds A sure return of 5 or 6 percent on a fixed-income investment doesn't provide much competition for equities that, as surveys have repeatedly shown, people expect to yield double-digit returns over the coming years To be sure, there were signs of some hesitation in flows into equity funds during the recent market downdraft, but we've seen such episodes before in this long bull market It seemingly takes merely a whiff of favorable-news oxygen to get the bulls running again In fact, yesterday they even rallied the market on what might have been construed as bad    8/18/98  news Under the circumstances, we've thought it wiser for now to treat a deeper market decline as an explicit risk rather than as part of our baseline projection  Let me turn, then, to the inflation side of the ledger Given our softer real outlook, it probably isn't surprising that we also have a more moderate inflation forecast than the Blue Chip Again, without knowing their perspective about such things as the dollar, oil prices, and crop prospects, it's difficult to pinpoint the sources of the difference in forecasts I think we've given due emphasis in the Greenbook and in yesterday's Board briefing to the uncertainties that attend the price outlook The trimming of our core inflation forecast since the last meeting represents in large measure a fairly straightforward reaction to the slightly weaker outlook for aggregate demand and the lower import prices that now appear likely But, at the margin, we've also been moved by some of the recent economic data to give a little more weight to the stories we've been telling all along for why inflation should be slow to pick up even with such tight labor markets Those data have included a smidge lower readings on wages and prices recently than we had predicted Given that the July CPI was to be released this morning, just before my briefing, moving our forecast farther below the consensus obviously was risking some immediate embarrassment But the Fates have been kind, with the two-tenths increases in the overall and core indexes being in line with our expectations  The bottom line of the inflation story is that, although labor markets are tight, experience suggests that prices respond only slowly to such pressures And, in the recent period, and for a while longer, the underlying tendency for inflation to pick up in response to those pressures is being offset by favorable shocks with respect to the terms of trade and supplies of food and energy--not to mention an ample amount of unutilized factory capacity Some of the favorable shocks are expected to turn around next year but not with sufficient force to do much damage within our projection period We'll be extending our Greenbook forecast through 2000 next month, and I hesitate to venture now beyond our current horizon However, recognizing that the lags in the effects of policy on inflation are long, I probably should offer the observation that, with a stable funds rate, there's nothing in the direction of our present forecast that points to a take-off in wages and prices in 2000 Of course, with things as unsettled in some important areas as they are now, we'll have to take a further close look at this over the coming weeks That concludes my prepared remarks, Mr Chairman   We have not anticipated that prospect in our forecast, as our numbers  might suggest The one thing that we have anticipated is a pattern of earlier than usual  acquisitions and installations of computer equipment over the next few quarters in an effort to  avoid doing a lot of that in late 1999 But I take your point; what you describe is possible  Certainly a lot of people may consider stockpiling some cash over that weekend That is an  entirely different issue   Obviously, we will have to confront this question more concretely when  we write down year 2000 numbers in our Greenbook forecast for the next meeting We will do  that with some trepidation I don't recall hearing anything from business firms that suggests they  have focused very much attention on this matter thus far In fact, even in talking to some of the  computer firms, we find that they sometimes seem surprised when we raise the question about  business strategies with respect to equipment purchases toward the end of next year It is a bit  puzzling that people seemingly have not given more attention to that question, but there is, I think,  plenty of time for them to undertake that kind of stockpiling   Obviously, firms that provide goods that their customers might want to  add to stocks will have to decide whether to increase production or just let their shelves be depleted  and then not have to reverse an increase in production With the just-in-time production chains,  there may have to be some producer responses   We're looking forward to it! [Laughter]   We are engaged in a multifaceted research effort on that issue In a sense,  the work that the Reserve Banks were kind enough to do for us in conducting the survey is a small  component of that research We have been talking to firms, interviewing them in some depth, and  we are going to be doing more of that Our contacts emphasize that this is a new labor  compensation regime and that flexible compensation practices will enable them to cut back on  labor costs if the economy and their fortunes deteriorate That outcome is untested and time will  tell We also are doing some statistical work at a micro level, using employment cost index data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to try to estimate at the firm level how businesses are  managing in this new regime, perhaps by trading off various components of their compensation  packages and so on We hope to have some additional insights on this in the next several months,  but I think this is something that ultimately will have to be tested in the real world by a real change  in the cyclical situation We will only be in the conjecture phase on this for now, but I think that  too is a potentially meaningful exercise  I would stress that our projection of the ECI does not assume a major change in  compensation behavior Some of these compensation elements do not even show up in the ECI  That is another factor we need to take into account in thinking about cost pressures in the economy  and how those may wax or wane Basically, the most important element going forward is the    8/18/98  potential role of the continuing low inflation that we are experiencing in damping nominal wage  increases On that basis, models embodying that mechanism suggest that there is considerable  potential for deceleration in compensation increases over the coming quarters As the pressures in  the labor markets abate in our forecast, these factors combine going out through 1999 to produce  what I think is likely to be some moderation in spending   That might be true at least for those people who are not living essentially  from hand to mouth I think a lot of these flexible pay schemes tend to affect people who are in the  upper income brackets and have no liquidity constraints   Maybe not with wage change, but with total labor costs in some way   Theoretically you might want to include those payments as your argument  suggests, but I don't think we have any data that quantify them I suspect that they are not a huge  element in the picture On top of that, we have payments that actually go to employees that are  not counted in the ECI The reason is that they are regarded by the definitions used in the ECI as  out of scope because they are recruiting expenses   Yes, except to the extent that in a sense they also are substitutes for the  internal management of labor resources   If you eliminate a janitorial function and outsource it to another firm, that  firm is taking over various fixed administrative-type costs The analysis gets complicated   Obviously this is an incredibly complex matter As I said, I hope that we  are going to make some headway in our effort to discern the effects that some of these changing  practices have on the cyclical variability of spending   I do not think that you need to go that extra step The stock market is  in effect one of the financial market channels through which the impulses that the Committee  generates through open market operations create a financial environment that influences the  growth of aggregate demand Exchange rates are another channel We also would include the  bond market and the shape of the yield curve We can think about what the consequences of the  Committee's actions might be with respect to the bond market if we were to change money  market conditions We also need to consider the effects on the stock market in that context, which  may be harder, though I am not sure, than anticipating the effects on these other financial markets    8/18/98  In any event, the whole complex of financial variables does influence spending decisions I don't  think you can avoid that conclusion   If you felt that the market was likely to start to rally again, even against  the fundamentals, and to spur aggregate demand in a way that you felt excessive in terms of the  inflation prospects that would go with that, I think that would argue at the margin for considering  a tightening of policy that you would not otherwise have wanted to institute were it not for that  expectation Now, what I think I heard from many people around the table is that they want to  remain humble about their ability to anticipate movements in the stock market, especially  nonfundamental movements So, that might cause you to be reluctant to move with great force on  a hunch about which way the market would go But I think you have to have one It is manifest  in the behavior of the economy in the last couple of years that the stock market's movements are  of considerable importance You need to take a position on this  Mr Chairman, I might just add one small fact I can't say for sure that we have this  nailed down, but I am told that our first look at the trade data suggests that about 3/4 of the imports  of capital goods would be offsets to PDE So, we would have weaker producers durable  equipment expenditures than is written down in the Greenbook However, the GDP effects are  trivial That is a tentative conclusion    8/18/98   Mr Chairman, I just want to make clear that while we were praying that  we would not be humiliated by incoming information, there was no divine guidance when we  drafted the Greenbook "
6078,1998-10-15," Thank you There have been some significant developments since we  prepared the last forecast, but what we have on balance is more a matter of uncertainties at this  point than clear-cut changes in the outlook We have had some weaker economic indicators  at the margin for the third quarter than we had anticipated The employment report for  September was on the weak side We have no special story It may simply be statistical noise,  but employment growth was discernibly weaker than recent trends and below our expectations  Tomorrow, we will be publishing industrial production for September We anticipated some  modest growth in production, and instead we will report a significant decline for the month  In the consumer sector, this may be too fine a reading, but around the edges the picture  looks a little weaker than we had anticipated Nonauto retail sales for August and September  were quite subdued Even allowing for the strength we have seen in the sales of motor vehicles,  consumer expenditures look to have been marginally weaker than the 3-1/2 percent growth rate that  we had in the September meeting Greenbook Of course, we have seen some slippage in the  indicators for consumer sentiment The stock market has dropped even more than we    10/15/98 2  anticipated, though at this point I think it is still much in line with the level we had predicted as  the average for the fourth quarter But to date the market has had a more negative tone and that  may be taking some toll on sentiment  On the inflation side, the wage news has been good Average hourly earnings in  September are giving us still greater confidence that we are on the right track in our forecast of a  leveling out in wage inflation and possibly some deceleration in coming months With regard to  the price news, the PPI this morning was much worse than we anticipated Basically, the entire  surprise was in the motor vehicles area, which accounted for almost all of the rise in the core PPI  We have found it very difficult to guess what the changes in motor vehicle prices will be in  September when there is a model change occurring I guess I would interpret that figure as  suggesting a little less favorable trend in producer prices for finished goods than we had in mind  previously But basically we see that PPI number for finished goods and the fact that prices of  crude and intermediate materials were down as not calling for any fundamental change in our  assessment of the underlying price trends in the economy Indeed, at this point a relatively low  capacity utilization rate suggests that the goods market is quite comfortable  Looking ahead, certainly we have heard negative reports about the manufacturing sector  that suggest that there is some greater weakness than we might have anticipated We do not hear  very much yet that indicates that there is any greater erosion in capital spending plans than we  had anticipated would be occurring, but that is clearly a question mark I think where the greatest  uncertainty arises and leads to a bias perhaps in the risks to the economy going forward is that  private financing conditions have deteriorated further, particularly in the lower quality area That  has occurred despite the easing of the funds rate and despite the decline in Treasury rates, which    10/15/98  we had not foreseen I think our sense is that the tenor of the markets is much more adverse to  private borrowers than we had anticipated If this were to persist for very much longer, I believe  there would be a risk of undermining the momentum of private demand beyond what we had  forecast previously, and thus a softer economic outlook as we move into the first half of 1999  But we were very uncertain in our assessment last time of what the dimensions of the risk  spreads would be, how soon they would narrow, how soon access to markets would be restored,  and we are no less uncertain at this point Clearly, that is a much more negative element of the  economic picture at this juncture  Mr Chairman, I think that is about all I can contribute at this point unless there are any  questions   The PPI for September was up 03 percent and its core component was up  04 percent   Mr Chairman, if I might just supplement that with one other observation  I am told that to date the rating agencies have not put very many companies on their watch lists  for potential downgradings This suggests that they have not at least to this point perceived,  given their economic outlook, that the default risks for these firms have increased greatly "
6103,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman Over the past couple of weeks, participants in the financial markets have become less certain that this meeting will bring another easing step My sense is that they continue to perceive that you're strongly committed to keeping the economic expansion intact, but that they see recent developments in the markets and in the economy as raising some question about at least the urgency of further policy action  The sources of this uncertainty about what you will decide to do have their parallels in risks that we noted in Greenbook While our forecast hasn't changed very much from that presented at the last meeting, this doesn't mean that we have a great deal of confidence that this is what would transpire under the assumed policy We are still confronted with an uncomfortably broad range of plausible outcomes    11/17/98  For example, it's not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the credit markets continue their healing process, the stock market moves to new highs, and aggregate demand barrels along You can get a sense of what that might look like by blowing up the differential between the baseline and the ""higher stock prices"" simulation in the Greenbook, which involved only maintenance of last week's market level On the other hand, it's just as easy to imagine a scenario in which there is another significant disturbance to the world economy and financial system, perhaps precipitated by a ""meltdown"" in Brazil; we have offered a far from extreme version of this in the Greenbook as well  Karen will have something to say about the international outlook but, before that, I would like to offer a few comments on the forces currently at work domestically  First, the fact that GDP growth in the third quarter apparently outstripped our expectations invites the conclusion that we've once again underestimated the momentum of demand in the economy However, the upside surprise appears to have been pretty much an inventory story In that regard, I should note that this morning's report on retail inventories showed that, outside of auto dealers, stocks were little changed in September-- probably implying only a marginal downward revision to our third-quarter guess As we said in the Greenbook, we don't think that there is a major overhang of unwanted stocks in the aggregate; but inventory-sales ratios have climbed, and they are quite high in a few industries At a minimum, I believe we should anticipate that businesses, at least outside the auto sector, will be attempting to curb the pace of accumulation That may well be one reason why the tenor of news from the manufacturing sector has been quite negative of late  Over the past couple of years, we've often underestimated the desire of businesses to maintain rapid rates of inventory accumulation, basically because we underestimated the strength of final demand But, recently, domestic final demand has not been any stronger than we anticipated; it wasn't in the third quarter, and last Friday's figures showing a hefty October advance in retail sales were closely in line with our expectations Moreover, the greater growth of output evidently has not generated any extra jobs and labor income Instead, payroll growth has slowed more than we expected, and there seems to be some pickup in corporate downsizing announcements This may be one reason why the early November Michigan SRC survey-- while showing a considerable bounceback in the sentiment index--didn't show much improvement in employment expectations  The flip side of the more moderate growth of labor income may have been a shade healthier corporate profit performance than we anticipated    11/17/98  But the trend of profits is still weak over the past several quarters and, though hope springs eternal in the stock market, the deterioration in corporate cash flow is a negative for capital spending The anecdotal evidence suggests that, whether for that reason or simply because they don't see current and prospective demand warranting further additions to capacity, many firms--especially manufacturers--are gearing back their investment programs  I've not mentioned the developments in the debt and equity markets, per se, in my comments on the spending picture The jury is still out on whether the recent turmoil is going to leave a substantial mark on the real economy On the credit side, the bond markets have reopened for business in terms of new issuance activity, and spreads are narrowing The commercial paper market is having some difficulty accommodating the over-the-year-end borrowing by firms that are not in the top credit rungs, but banks are filling in--sometimes reluctantly--and those tensions presumably will be behind us in a couple of months  Nonetheless, we still think it's reasonable to anticipate that it will take a while for the sting of the recent experience to wear off fully, and that the capital markets will continue to show a greater sensitivity to liquidity and credit risk considerations The commercial banks are not insulated from the capital markets, and they too have learned something about the risks facing them in their lending activities; consequently, we don't expect the recent tightening of loan terms and standards to be reversed immediately And, although the decline in the level of interest rates for prime borrowers, supported by the Fed's easing, takes some of the bite out of this tightening, credit terms overall have deteriorated for some higher risk enterprises and certainly the trend toward ever easier access to credit has been halted  Similarly, despite the rousing rally that has occurred in recent weeks in the stock market, unless that rise continues we also should see the impetus from wealth effects waning in the coming months As we indicated in the Greenbook, this is a real wild card in the outlook We believe that the market is skating on thin ice, at best, given the trend of profits; in that context, our prediction of a 10 percent price decline might even be said to be conservative, as it would leave the averages considerably above their recent lows But tell that to an investor who has once again seen demonstrated the virtues of buying on dips and who hears market gurus chanting the mantra that ""you don't fight the Fed"" And one might ask what earnings have to do with share prices, anyway, when any company with ""dot com"" can generate a huge market capitalization overnight on a base of nothing but losses  In sum, while we believe you should view financial conditions as having shifted in a less accommodative direction since August, this clearly    11/17/98  is a situation that will have to be monitored closely in the coming weeks We're dealing with volatile phenomena, the implications of which can be difficult to judge  In any event, even if we have the aggregate demand outlook right, that still leaves considerable uncertainty about the prospects for inflation Recent news has been quite ambiguous on this score The ECI for the third quarter, on the face of it, raised some serious questions regarding our forecast of a peaking in wage and compensation increases, but it was followed by hints of a moderation in the trend of average hourly earnings Among the major price indexes, with an increase of two-tenths last month the year-on-year change in the core CPI dropped back to 23 percent--not far above its low point However, the chain price index for GDP apparently decelerated further last quarter Going forward, the recent softening of the dollar suggests that the prices of imports may not continue to exert so great a disinflationary effect, but anecdotally one hears that the oncoming flow of cheap Asian goods will result in significantly lower retail prices in the first half of next year There is something for every taste in this wage-price stew I think we've taken an honest sampling from the pot, rather than picking out the bits that most appeal to us; but you may disagree, and we'll be happy to answer any questions you may wish to put to us regarding our view  But, first, if I may, let me turn the floor over to Karen   Dave Lindsey follows that more closely than I do   President Poole, may I try to move from the big picture to the very  small picture? Looking at the flows in the last few weeks--and recognizing your point about  somebody is paying someone and that makes it a little difficult to track this sensibly--it does look  to me in the data that I have, though I think we may have more recent estimates, that savings    11/17/98  deposits have leveled out in the last few weeks and money market fund growth has decelerated  substantially This coincides quite precisely with the time when we see the reflow of money into  the equity mutual funds, not in quite the same proportions we saw in the first part of this year but  still substantial So, there does seem to be a correspondence here that is consistent with the story  that people were hesitating and parking money in these very short-term assets And with  Treasury bill yields having come down so sharply the opportunity costs actually had narrowed  for putting the money in savings accounts   I am looking at weekly numbers where growth has been inching up by  comparison "
6126,1998-12-22," As Karen noted, the October trade report seems to point to a considerably higher level of net exports than was built into our Greenbook estimate of real GDP growth in the current quarter However, yesterday we received the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) for November, and it points to lower federal purchases than we were expecting The two adjustments are almost offsetting, leaving us now just a hair above the 31 percent GDP figure in last Wednesday's Greenbook  That said, activity this quarter appears once again to have surpassed our previous forecasts What is the explanation this time? Unfortunately, I can't give as neat an answer as I would like Clearly, one piece of the story is our earlier underestimation of the rise in motor vehicle production, which accounts for about half the extra growth of GDP in the current quarter Some of this reflects the automakers' competition for retail market share, but heavy trucks have been strong, too Another piece of the story is that, while we thought that homebuilders had a sizable backlog of demand to meet, we couldn't foresee that the weather would be as cooperative as it has been Builders have been able to keep workers on construction sites, avoiding a good part of the normal seasonal downswing in activity Of course, the fact that this Committee chose to ease policy faster than we'd assumed hasn't hurt either the auto or the housing markets    12/22/98  Beyond that, though, things get murkier That's partly because of the incoherence of the current picture in the industrial sector, outside of motor vehicles In particular, one might think from many company reports and surveys that the output of other manufacturers would be weaker than our industrial production estimates show them to be But, to deepen the mystery, the IP data themselves are weaker over the second half of this year than would be suggested by the corresponding expenditure components of GDP Perhaps subsequent data will narrow these gaps, but for now all this raises some question about just how strong the economy has been of late and it makes it more difficult to get a handle on the dynamics of the situation  That brings me to the prospects for the further slowing of GDP growth in 1999 As you know, we're putting a lot of weight on the notion that accelerator effects should be shifting into reverse over the coming quarters That is, the flatness of output growth for a while now implies that we should expect the level of investment to tend to stabilize  As the perceptions of businesses and households regarding the prospects for their sales and incomes moved up in recent years, they presumably wanted to expand their stocks of capital goods to levels that would help provide the larger flows of production and consumption services Spending on business equipment, houses, and consumer durables consequently rose markedly At this point, though, such spending is so high that, even if it leveled off, the net additions to the stocks of these goods would remain substantial For producer and consumer durables, declining relative prices likely will continue to elevate desired ratios of capital to output, but we doubt that it will be by enough to override this basic accelerator mechanism  How can we be sure that this pattern will play out in the near term? We can't be But the evidence of low capacity utilization and profit compression in many segments of manufacturing gives some concreteness to this model, and reports of companies actually planning to trim their capital outlays or seeking to take out capacity through mergers do give some credibility to the prediction One might even be tempted to argue that the recent upside surprises in investment expenditures reinforce the case for anticipating a moderation going forward because they have further elevated the rate of capital accumulation However, there are a couple of obvious retorts to this assertion First, the mere fact that there have been surprises in investment spending underscores the imprecision of this analysis It's not easy to gauge the desired stocks and the time profile of the adjustment processes Second, the desired stocks can change over time for a variety of reasons Among them are changes in the cost of capital or in household wealth, and in this regard the behavior of the equity markets has repeatedly confounded us in our forecasts    12/22/98  The stock market remains a major wild card in the outlook Heartened at least in part by what has been viewed as a supportive Fed, investors have been willing to stick with equities even as corporate earnings have declined PE ratios have reached very high levels Neither our earnings forecast nor our interest rate forecast would seem to justify a further rise in share prices over the next couple of years, and thus we're expecting that wealth effects will ebb, taking a good deal of the steam out of aggregate demand  The behavior of stocks like eBay and Amazoncom might suggest that we're applying an obsolete paradigm for share valuation But, it may be noted that the market as a whole really hasn't made much further headway on net since the early spring, when the year-on-year profit comparisons began to turn negative We're essentially predicting that share prices will continue to fluctuate around the average level that has prevailed since that time A continuation of crummy earnings and poor returns might provide the basis for a deeper market correction, but we're hesitant to predict it when the market has shown such a capacity for levitation and when we aren't anticipating any monetary policy tightening Indeed, as our selection of alternative simulations in the Greenbook suggested, we wouldn't rule out a further rise in share prices, and another year or two of double-digit increases could trump the reverse accelerator effects that are key to our forecast The market surge of the past three trading days is perhaps a sign in that regard  Finally, a few words about the supply side of our forecast The recent upside surprise in GDP growth does not appear to reflect any unexpected improvement in productivity trends Rather, what we've seen has been consistent with the trend we have been assuming So, going forward, our higher output path has translated into a lower unemployment rate We've raised our inflation forecast, but not quite commensurately Recent news on wages and prices has been favorable, even in the face of tighter labor markets and higher capacity utilization rates than we had anticipated would be prevailing In addition, the prices of oil and other raw materials have fallen out of bed recently, and these lower input costs will be passing through the production pipeline for a while, in the process helping to hold down inflation expectations One might question whether this commodity deflation is an unalloyed blessing in terms of international economic stability, but it is one more timely shock helping to check inflation here  That completes our presentation, Mr Chairman   We try to track their production and delivery plans as closely as  possible, with the help of some inside contacts One of the uncertainties at this point is whether,  indeed, they will be able to make the volume of deliveries to foreign customers that they hoped  to make, because there seem to be financing problems still to be worked out   They have been in inventory We think those inventories are being  reduced in this quarter, and that is part of our forecast There is coherence in our arithmetic In  fact, in the ultimate GDP numbers--when we try to sort through all of this--we can't find the  coherence that we have as we put these numbers together ourselves So ex post, it is very hard to  trace   But, in terms of our forecast, we have taken into account their  production intentions and their delivery patterns   It is potentially significant on a quarter-to-quarter basis I think we  sometimes overestimate the importance of aircraft in total producers' durable expenditures in the  United States, but certainly it can be a significant quarter-to-quarter swing factor   There is a lot of room to maneuver at this point with the data that are  now in hand I would not put 4-1/2 percent out of the range of possibilities They did not have the  benefit of the MTS, though That can be pretty tricky to read We made that effort and it did  chip a bit off the fourth-quarter number Another possibility is that people have not interpreted  the net export figures the same as we did We have one month of data, the first month of the  quarter Does one extrapolate an upside surprise or anticipate an offset? I think Karen's  colleagues scrutinize these data perhaps with greater care than others, but it is still very difficult  to judge whether this component or that component will drop off Finally, on that score, one  needs to look also at whether there are offsets in domestic expenditures Relative to what we had  assumed, the net exports of capital goods were stronger in October than we had anticipated That  means less of the flow of shipments will be going to domestic customers So there was a  significant offset in producers' durable equipment expenditures as we did the adding up But in  the end one is looking at production indicators employment, hours, the industrial production  data, and so on As we balanced these things out, we felt uncomfortable going higher than we  did because there just seemed to be considerable tension We wrote down a relatively low  inventory investment number--much lower, I think, than did many of those outside forecasters  That is a product of this balancing act We had some low October inventory numbers but there is  still a lot of room for November and December to surprise us That was one of the balancing  factors I suspect that if you looked at these other forecasts, you probably would not find    12/22/98 17  inventory investment as low because others didn't feel as constrained as we felt by these  production-side indicators   I guess I feel the fatter tail of this probability distribution is on that side  On the other hand, as I pointed out, there are inconsistencies in some of the information we are  getting It is really hard to determine where all these goods are that supposedly have been  produced Anecdotally, it does not sound right; and our own statistics just do not show it And  that is true over the second half of the year as a whole   In inventories for the time being, I take it   A lot of imported apparel   Mr Chairman, if I could just respond briefly I am not sure I fully  grasp the point that President Broaddus is making I will follow up bilaterally with him to make  sure I have an understanding But just to be clear on the basis of our assumption for the funds  rate, let me say that our default is to assume a stable funds rate unless we see when we run  through our projection that we end up with an outcome that is glaringly at odds with what the  Committee in its discussions and its policy decisions has suggested would be acceptable Having  listened to the discussions at recent meetings, people have basically said they would be very  happy if we had an outcome like that So, I do not have a sense that, with our forecast based on a  stable funds rate assumption, we are giving you something that does not provide a baseline for  discussion Then, obviously, we try to give some indication of what different interest rate paths  might produce So, that is how we approach this I hope that's helpful in some degree, but I will  try to clarify it    12/22/98   That is going to be very difficult to portray because there is a good deal  of judgment involved In addition to the use of the quarterly model, we get input from sector  experts and so on As you know, we have invited Reserve Banks to send staff members--and  they have--to join us during a portion of our forecasting process so that they can get a better  handle on the various steps and the different inputs If your Bank hasn't sent someone recently  or if your staff's memory of what they saw has faded, we certainly invite you to send someone in  the near future I think that is perhaps the best way to understand what goes on "
6151,1999-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will start the presentation We will   be referring to the package of charts entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic   Outlook,” which may be at the bottom of the pile of papers in front of you 2/   Chart 1 provides a basic summary of the staff economic forecast As  you know, the BEA published its advance estimate of fourth-quarter GDP  on Friday; it was a half point above our 5 percent guess However, given  that the BEA numbers do not really point us in a different direction--and  they are only tentative, in any event--we have stuck with the Greenbook  figures for our presentation today   The top panels of the chart show our projection for real GDP, on a  four-quarter percent change basis We are looking for a substantial  deceleration, from 4 percent in 1998--41 percent, according to Friday’s   2/ A copy of the material used by the staff is appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)     2/2-3/99 21   report--to around 2½ percent this year and next As the bars in the left  panel indicate, the slowing is entirely accounted for by domestic spending  The negative contribution from net exports is expected to diminish  considerably over the forecast period   Though the growth of output is much slower, it is pretty close to our  estimate of the trend rate for potential, so that the unemployment rate--the  red line in the middle panel--changes little from where it was last quarter  The chart also shows the movements in the factory utilization rate Over  the past year, we observed the odd pattern of the plant utilization rate  dropping somewhat below its long-term average even as the jobless rate  was reaching a 28-year low We are anticipating that these indicators of  supply pressures will continue to send conflicting messages, each of them  changing little on net over the next two years   As Dave will be discussing later, we have given greater weight to the  labor market tautness in arriving at the inflation forecast shown in the  bottom panel We foresee a noticeable pickup in the pace of price increase  over the next two years--about a percentage point as measured either by  the CPI or by the GDP chain index   Chart 2 presents some of the financial backdrop for this projection  The basic assumption is that the federal funds rate will be unchanged  through next year As you can see in the top panel, given our forecast of  rising inflation, this implies a further decline in the real funds rate-­ proxied by the nominal rate minus the recent inflation rate In fact, it is  not at all clear that inflation expectations have come down as far as actual  inflation in the past year, so this measure may overstate the current level  of the real rate--and consequently may exaggerate the decline that lies  ahead But I would characterize our forecast as incorporating a real short- term interest rate that is at the low end of the range since 1995   The real short rate is scarcely an unambiguous or comprehensive gauge  of the financial impetus to demand, so it is worthwhile to look at a few  other indicators of credit market conditions The picture is mixed In the  middle left panel, you can see that nominal yields on Treasury and  investment grade corporate bonds have fallen over the past couple of  years--probably by more than longer-term inflation expectations Junk  bond yields also eased a bit until the market was jolted by the Russian  default shock last summer The junk rate index plotted here is now up  roughly 1½ percentage points from a year ago, suggesting that the typical  low grade firm is facing a considerably increased long-term borrowing  cost   The senior loan officer survey--the basis of the right panel--indicates  that businesses also are facing a little less friendly reception at commercial     2/2-3/99 22   banks, with loan underwriting standards having been tightened some in  recent months, especially in the case of larger firms   Credit has not dried up, however, as may be seen in the bottom panel,  which plots the real debt growth of households and businesses combined  Through the fourth quarter, the end of the solid portion of the line, debt  growth remained rapid We are forecasting a moderation, but this is  scarcely a credit-crunch scenario--as might have been feared for a while  last fall Lenders have turned a bit more cautious, but most of the  explanation for the projected slackening in debt expansion comes from the  demand side   If there are corresponding signs of increased caution in equity markets,  they are rather difficult to find Share prices have continued to soar, and  where they are headed from here clearly is a crucial question for the  economic outlook The top panels of Chart 3 don’t answer that question,  but they provide some provocative perspective by comparing the  performance of the US stock market in the 1990s with a couple of other  impressive bull markets of yesteryear--Japan in the 1980s and Wall Street  in the 1920s Given the amount of artistry involved in choosing the base  periods and thus aligning these curves, I would recommend taking the  pictures with at least a grain of salt But, if you have a taste for salt,  perhaps they are suggestive of some of the risks confronting us   The middle panels come at the issue from an angle that is perhaps a bit  more analytical At the left, I have repeated an exhibit I’ve used in prior  presentations to demonstrate why share prices had to peak soon Perhaps  you should stop me before I do it again! [Laughter] The latest  observations are rough approximations, given yesterday’s prices and our  estimates of earnings through year-end The S&P 500’s aggregate P/E is  at an unprecedented level And, to underscore the abnormality, it has  achieved this multiple not when earnings had a cyclical upturn in front of  them but rather, as you can see in the bottom left panel, when the profit  share of GNP has risen to a multi-decade high And, if the S&P multiple is  remarkable, that for the NASDAQ composite--at the right--is astonishing,  moving rapidly toward triple digits!   Although some analysts would say--indeed, have said--that earnings  are beside the point in valuing stocks in this New Era, we have not been  able to break the habit of looking at them--which may help to explain our  forecast errors I have shown, in the bottom right panel, annual percent  changes in NIPA corporate profits--the black line--along with those for  S&P 500 earnings per share The accounting concepts and coverage of the  two series differ, but they have tended to move together In that light, the  divergence between our forecast of NIPA profits in 1999 and the S&P  predictions of Wall Street strategists is worth noting It suggests that the     2/2-3/99 23   market will continue to have to cope with earnings disappointments in the  months ahead If we had an adequate sample of the Wall Street  expectations for 2000, I suspect that the story would be reinforced Such  disappointments have not stopped the market to date, but we have  assumed that--from such high valuations--it will be difficult to extend the  uptrend in prices   If we prove to be anywhere close to right about the trend from here, the  market will cease to provide the impetus it has to spending over the past  couple of years Chart 4 summarizes some of the key considerations in  our forecast for domestic demand Because these are familiar stories,  I shall just run through the list very quickly   The upper left panel highlights the fact that though we have the wealth- income ratio declining, the lags in the effects on spending lead us to  expect that consumer outlays will continue to grow faster than income for  a while longer, pushing the saving rate still lower But spending growth  does moderate   In the housing market--depicted at the right--we expect that with  mortgage rates remaining near current levels, the monthly payment burden  of home-ownership will remain attractively low This should keep  housing demand from falling sharply as income and wealth growth  weaken   In the business sector, the slowing of output growth, depicted in the  middle left panel, will turn the accelerator effects on capital spending  negative But that should be partly offset by the favorable effect of a  continuing decline in the relative price of equipment--charted at the right   Inventory investment, the red line in the bottom left panel, is expected  to move pretty closely with final sales Not much of a story there   And, finally, government purchases are projected to run a little stronger  on balance over the next two years In the state and local sector, surpluses  are growing to the point where we would expect to see some greater  expenditure on infrastructure In the federal sector, real purchases are  expected to come closer to bottoming out, with some obvious upside risks  in defense and other outlay categories The pickup in government  spending, however, is only a modest offset to the slackening in the growth  of private demand that we foresee   Lew will now shift the focus from the domestic side to the external  sector    The rise in oil prices that we have assumed is accounting for a very   substantial portion of the overall CPI increase in the forecast In thinking about the story   in terms of underlying resource pressures, as Dave indicated, we have leaned more   toward the unemployment rate as the indicator of resource pressures rather than capacity   utilization But the core price measures definitely do not accelerate the way the overall   CPI measure does    It certainly has an analytical basis It is an abstract notion that is   unmeasurable    Yes One of the active hypotheses is that investor perceptions of   the holding periods over which they need to assess the volatility in different assets may   have changed, so that investors are not as preoccupied with the greater short-run volatility   of equities as they were historically People may have recognized that they had been   giving up excessive amounts of yield historically by avoiding equities, given this new   perception of risk That might make higher valuations sustainable for given earnings   trajectories and interest rate levels That said, we are really squeezing these things down   by some estimates to very, very narrow risk margins And there is a certain euphoria that   one senses in the markets; people may be exaggerating the safety of equity investments   So if a shock occurs that jars investors out of this complacency, if that’s what it is, we   could see a reversion to wider equity premia that, on top of more realistic earnings   expectations, could result in a very marked adjustment of equity prices I might note that   the simulations that Dave Stockton presented were concocted basically by assuming   changes in the equity premium  So it is essentially a totally autonomous shock of this   sort that leads to these numbers    I doubt that there is much that I can add to Dave’s expertise on this,   but one thing we have talked about among ourselves is whether the models that we use   really pick up the importance of the dollar and import price movements Given the   confluence of events recently and the way they have impinged on the manufacturing   sector, this alternative is perhaps picking up a bigger import-price effect than is manifest   in the model simulation we have used for the unemployment rate version of the Phillips   curve    To be honest, I don’t have a good number in mind It has varied   considerably over time The table on page III-2 in Part II of the Greenbook shows the   gross issuance of bonds by U S corporations in 1998 Sales of investment grade issues   averaged $14 billion a month, whereas those at the speculative grade were $95 billion   per month    If one wants to take into account the degree to which these data   represent refinancing, this becomes a tricky question to deal with One of the problems   in trying to examine the changes we’ve seen in credit market conditions over the past   year is that the variations depend not only on a firm’s credit rating but on which   institution it turns to for financing and also the maturity range Take, for example, a non-  prime borrower looking at bank loans, where the money market rates have been coming   down considerably Even if the spread widened a bit--and it may not have yet--the firm   might still be borrowing more cheaply at a bank as opposed to trying to sell securities in   the bond market The cost may not be unambiguously higher   It is a very difficult situation to assess My judgment would be, taking the   totality of this picture going forward with our stock market assumption, that we do have   perhaps a modest degree of overall financial restraint But it is hard to read at this point,   and thus you might not have discerned a clear-cut bottom line in my presentation I think   it is a mixed bag    I suspect so    People certainly remember how much they paid for that last pack   of cigarettes I suspect that even if they are underweighting it in the survey, it is on their   minds    We don’t get the members’ estimates of the deflator I must say   that, when I look at the numbers you give us, I can see that in some cases people are not   distinguishing between the CPI and the deflator in getting to the nominal GDP number   People may have been on top of that more this time than at a prior time There is, I think,   a considerable looseness in these numbers Also, we simply eliminate the high three and   low three from the individual distributions to get the central tendency and there can be a   lack of coherence across the components in some instances I don’t know whether that   was the case, but that distortion can creep in    Yes, it was 6½ percent    It is just an editorial-­   Don, I might suggest that another way to think of this is as follows   If the NAIRU is really more like 4½ percent, we might be around the NAIRU now and   looking at the prospect of a steady inflation path, which is the sign that we are essentially   around the natural rate of interest That’s different from what is in our forecast, which   suggests that we are headed toward an acceleration of prices at the prevailing level of   interest rates I think that’s a very simple way to look at that    In a sense there is some link between what you just said and what   the Chairman said earlier I may not have known exactly what charts the Chairman had   in mind from prior years’ simulations, but if you view what has happened as having   benefited from some supply-side shocks, basically those things have become engrained in   the inflation expectations And as long as the Committee follows a policy that doesn’t   lead to excessive pressures in the market, it can consolidate that progress and continue   the lower path But if these are transitory developments and you pretend or hope that   they are changes in the structure, then you could be faced with a very severe turnaround   And what we could be looking at a year or two from now is a much-elevated set of   simulations of inflation paths going forward It is a judgment call that each of you has to   make at this point as to just what has led to the positive surprises on inflation It’s not at   all clear that it is entirely due to permanent structural changes I think one can see clear   risks in the medical care market, for example, that the benefits from some structural   changes there may have run their course and that costs pressures are turning things   around in that area    As always    You don’t even need a structural change If somehow, for reasons   we don’t understand, capacity utilization really is the true measure rather than the   unemployment rate, then that simulation reflects the fact that the level of economic   activity is actually below the natural rate of capacity utilization  There is slack in the   economy, putting downward pressure on inflation If you were looking at the   unemployment rate and you thought the NAIRU was 4½ percent or a little below, it   would be a close call We are in the neighborhood, but that means we would not have the   depressing effect that we would have by looking at capacity utilization What we noted   yesterday is that, as an approximation, that approach may be telling us roughly the same   story and not that we are a point below somebody’s notion of the NAIRU at this juncture    I would just add a note of caution on the basis of bitter experience,   which does not have to be repeated admittedly When one studies the history of the past   few cycles, it is not unusual to see a tendency to reinterpret capacity constraints because   the inflation turnaround isn’t in sight I think it is manifest in the current episode that   there have been extraordinary shocks in terms of world activity, exchange rate   movements, declining import prices, and structural changes in various markets And   there may be still more structural changes on the horizon after the electricity deregulation   and so on A lot of these developments are, in the abstract, in the nature of one-time   shocks, which we can’t depend on being repeated But we can consolidate the gains we   have made if we are able to figure out where that level of sustainable resource utilization   is in this model    If I understand the construction of this--please correct me if I’m   wrong, Don--basically this represents the staff’s baseline assumptions naturally extended,   at least for the near term Those assumptions include a rebound in oil prices and the turn   of the dollar and so on So in a sense this is already the lower NAIRU path It adjusts   down the NAIRU, but it doesn’t remove that modest reversal of the favorable supply   shocks that we have experienced    One reaction, though, is that in a sense you are beginning to bring   Chart 5 into the picture    That raises the question of whether some of the demand-shock   surprises we have been experiencing will be sustained My sense of the discussion   yesterday, as we were thinking about the coloration of the Humphrey-Hawkins report, is   that this group might see greater risks that we will have stronger demand, other things   equal, than is assumed in the current staff forecast It does raise the question of whether   you want to blend in some of the flavor of Chart 5 in terms of the policy content    That proved to be an error, in a sense The economy got very   overheated partly because of the optimism about how low an unemployment rate could   be sustained without inflation To go back to what your eyes have been perceiving, labor   markets clearly have been tight and wages have been accelerating Pressure has been   manifest in the labor markets Now, that hasn’t fed all the way through to prices,   depending on what measure one examines If one looks at the core CPI adjusted for the   technical changes, that has been accelerating The PCE measures and the GDP measures   look a whole lot better The answer is not entirely clear We may have had a   productivity surprise that helped We could get another I think the case for a   substantially lower level of unemployment that is sustainable without a buildup of   inflation is perhaps a bit wishful, though I can’t rule it out But we on the staff resist that   notion pretty strongly at this point I would not be as resistant to the notion that the   NAIRU might be below 5 percent or maybe significantly below 5 percent It is hard to be   strongly opposed to that notion based on recent experience    A simple rule-of-thumb exercise using our model is that a 100 basis   point higher funds rate implemented immediately and sustained would knock about ¼   percentage point or a little more off the inflation rate in the first year The inflation rate   in the second year would be about ¾ percentage point lower I suspect there would be   overshooting in terms of getting that inflation rate to flatten out    I think that would be more than enough to get you there very   promptly, so Don’s response of perhaps ½ percentage point sounds about right    Just as another minor housekeeping matter Could everyone let me   know whether or not they want to change their individual forecasts? That way, even if   there is no change, I will know that we haven’t missed anyone That would be helpful   END OF MEETING      "
6177,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman For the benefit of those of  you who didn't get your fill of basketball cliches over the last few days, I  perhaps should characterize the US economy as continuing to hit “nothin’  but net”--rapid expansion and low inflation In any event, as you know,  GDP came in even higher in the fourth quarter than we anticipated at the  last meeting, and we’ve now raised our sights on first-quarter growth the  better part of a percentage point, to about 3½ percent Meanwhile, recent  readings on wages and prices have been even more benign than we  expected Under the circumstances, I guess I’m obliged to explain why we  won’t just get with the new era program and simply extrapolate the good  news--rather than predicting, once again, that the economy will decelerate  appreciably and that inflation will pick up I’ll be brief, just emphasizing a  few key points in the Greenbook   Our basic thesis is still that domestic demand growth will slow  enough over the next several quarters to more than offset a lessening drag  from the external sector The two key elements in that story are by now  familiar--indeed, in danger of becoming quite shopworn   The first is that the stocks of consumer durables, houses, and business  equipment are already growing so rapidly that, absent some deceleration,  they’ll get way out of whack with longer-term income and output trends  The second element is that if share prices continue rising at anything  approaching the pace of the past several years, they’ll get way out of whack  with profit trends Of course, there can be an interaction between the two  elements--a virtuous cycle up to a point, but one that can carry too far on  the basis of unrealistic expectations   So, what are the most recent signals as to whether we are on the verge  of some moderation? Frankly, on the face of it, there aren’t many signs of  slowing as far as household and business investment is concerned Real  expenditures for consumer durables appear to be headed for about a 12  percent annualized gain in the first quarter; residential investment appears     3/30/99 6   to be headed for about a 12 percent gain; and business equipment outlays  appear to be headed for--you guessed it--about a 12 percent gain   But, let me try to put a little spin on these numbers In the case of  business equipment spending, our guess for the first-quarter growth rate is  off considerably from the 17 percent increase last year, and the recent  orders data and other indicators suggest further moderation ahead  Meanwhile, for both consumer durables and residential investment, one can  point to special factors that have boosted activity of late and that might  reasonably be expected to prove transitory   One of these is the intense competition among automakers sparked by  GM’s effort to regain market share The companies are making enough  money on light trucks that they probably can afford to continue this  competition for some time, but it seems unlikely that they would escalate  the pricing battle enough to push sales above the recent elevated pace-­ especially given their capacity constraints More likely, with some demand  having already been pulled forward by incentive programs, sales will fall  this spring   Another special factor is the mortgage-refinancing wave, which is  now receding Pinning down the effects of refinancings on spending hasn’t  proven an easy thing to do, but intuition, anecdote, and some statistical  work suggest that demand has received an extra boost from refinancings  stimulated by lower interest rates last fall   Finally, the further run-up in housing starts in recent months likely  has reflected the efforts of builders to satisfy the backlog of orders that  built up with the surge in demand last year--efforts aided by a mild winter  Going forward, tight supplies of construction workers could make it  difficult to achieve, from where we have been of late, the normal seasonal  pickup in activity But builders may not even want to try, given the recent  hints of peaking demand for homes Consequently, we are projecting a  substantial negative swing in residential investment over the next couple of  quarters   Of course, other components of household demand conceivably could  pick up the slack, if the fundamentals of income and wealth are still  favorable This is where the stock market comes in With some  trepidation, we stuck with our assessment that the bull market has pretty  much run its course We were encouraged in this regard by the  nervousness that has been expressed by market analysts about high  valuations and earnings prospects Time will tell whether the enthusiasm  of breaking the Dow 10,000 barrier will override those concerns As the     3/30/99 7   simulations in the Greenbook indicate, though, it probably would take quite  large further increases in share prices to totally undermine our forecast of  demand deceleration It could happen, but it is far from a certainty   This brings me, in a way, to the supply side of the picture and the  inflation outlook The bull market might be said to need a continuation of  low inflation--and thus no greater threat of substantial Fed tightening--and  strong productivity growth to extend the recent uptick in profits We’ve  become more optimistic on both these scores, but not enough to transform  the picture and lay out a really upbeat scenario   Labor productivity increases in the fourth quarter and, on our  estimate, in the first quarter have been impressive Looking at how the  various relationships in the economy fit together in light of those readings-­ and recognizing that we could be making a mole hill of a pebble--we’ve  tacked on a tenth of a percent per year to our assessment of the average  pace of structural improvement in productivity since 1995 In addition,  considering what seems to be going on with respect to investment and the  apparent unceasing drive for efficiency, we’ve extrapolated that small  increment through 2000   The cumulative effects of this slight change in trend productivity are  great enough to offset most of the effect of our higher GDP path on the  prospective level of the unemployment rate and also to ease somewhat the  apparent squeeze on the markup of prices over trend unit labor costs  Consequently, we’ve been able to carry the recent good news on inflation  through in the forecast Owing to the backup in oil prices, however, the  picture is still one of a noticeable rise in headline inflation over the coming  months By this summer, we’ll probably be looking at year-on-year CPI  increments in the 2s, once again   It is, of course, arguable that the latest productivity numbers are a sign  that we’re entering a period of even better performance than we’ve  anticipated If so, that’s clearly a good thing But, if it means that the  demand for capital goods is stronger, it could reinforce the assessment in  our baseline forecast that interest rates probably will have to be raised at  some point to maintain economic stability   Karen will now offer an update on some of the key external influences  in the outlook    Well, our forecast for real compensation in terms of the   employment cost index is greater than 2 percent over 1999-2000 when measured against   product prices--for example, nonfarm business prices And I think that is the more   appropriate metric to look at in this context It is more consistent with thinking about the   shares going to labor and to capital It also makes more sense of what we saw in 1998   when we had not only a tight but a tightening labor market So, that is what we have   been focusing on and I think our forecast makes reasonable sense in that regard There   are still questions, too, about what the nominal wage might do and I think we tried to be   quite clear--for example, in the Chart Show last time--about the uncertainties that   surround that aspect of the forecast and the different models one can apply But in terms   of real wages, I think we have fairly sensible numbers    Let me touch briefly on another aspect of your question There   is a school of thought--John Makin comes to mind, for example--arguing recently that an   improvement in the economies of Japan and some other Asian countries will have   negative effects for the United States The view is that demand abroad will reduce the   supply of savings--which as you indicated has been flowing readily into the United States   because we appear to be a safe haven or an area with fast improving technology--and that   will exert general upward pressure on interest rates, which will be damaging It is rather   hard for me to get my arms around the thought that better economic performance in the   rest of the world is a detriment to the United States But I suppose when one thinks about   1998 and the shocks that we’ve had and the beneficial effects in our financial markets,   the argument is that the accommodation that in a sense the Fed provided actually added   to aggregate demand and pushed the unemployment rate perhaps below sustainable   levels There might be something to the view that we have to give that back at some   point if we have overshot sustainable levels of resource utilization That is another   version of the worry about the reversal of the “supply shocks” that we have been   experiencing and how we might have to cope with that    I’m sorry, I’m not sure I caught the last part of your question I   was thinking about answering the first part and I lost the thread on the last part    The latter question is extremely difficult to answer, as is the first   one There are questions of definitions here What do we mean by “new economy” or   “new era” and so on?  I don’t think that’s easy to pin down In many accounts it is   something that rejects all the known rules of economic behavior, or what we thought   were known rules In other views, as I suggested in a briefing some time back, it may be   that what we need isn’t necessarily a new paradigm but simply some new parameters   We know that productivity historically has not grown at the same rate in all eras We   know that the composition of the workforce and other factors can affect the natural rate   of unemployment So we are always in search of what the current values of those   parameters are As we have gained experience with how the economy is operating, what   we have been trying to do is to put those numbers into better alignment with the facts   And that is what we have been doing over the past few years as we have seen better   productivity performance than we thought could be reconciled with a continuation of the     3/30/99 14   weak trend we had seen in the post-1973 era We could also see that investment was at a   very high level, producing considerable capital deepening That emboldened us to move   apart from most of the pack and raise our estimates of productivity trend And as we   looked at the experience of the past year or so in our latest forecast round--and we looked   at all the various behavioral relations in the economy--we once again thought that edging   up that productivity trend estimate a bit further was warranted If we were to go to the   new era concept, I think we would probably start by saying that resource utilization   levels have absolutely no influence on inflation That seems to be one of the tenets It is   not clear what does determine the rate of inflation in this new paradigm, but the new era   tenet certainly seems to be rejected by most people And it is not part of our forecast; we   haven’t incorporated that We basically just jiggled the parameters of a fairly   conventional model   Now, if we had knocked a couple of tenths off the productivity trend, the   effects would depend on where we started and whether we sensed that trend was   perceived by people in the real world or not I guess I’d have to say that the outlook for   inflation, if we reached back a couple of years and changed this productivity trend, would   deteriorate fairly rapidly relative to our baseline To the extent that we give any weight   to the markup over trend unit labor cost, which is a fairly conventional model of price   determination--and I must say we don’t give it the preponderance of weight--we would   find that the markup was being squeezed considerably over the past few years with a 17   percent productivity trend And that would have negative implications going forward,   especially in the tight markets that we have; firms would be trying to restore their   markups, and the price pressures would show up fairly promptly We’re talking tenths in   terms of the differences but, given that we already have an upward tilt, it would perhaps   make a material difference in our perception of the upturn in inflation    Not as much as we’d like We’ve actually been thinking about   examining the data on some aspects of that One assertion that has been made is that   wages are being held down because manufacturing has been weak and thus   manufacturing wages haven’t been rising, and that might be a sort of pattern-setting   element in the picture We don’t find any systematic relationship over time in that   regard It is an interesting hypothesis but not one for which we have been able to find   confirmation in the data   It is possible to look at the movements of workers One question I raised was   whether this trend in manufacturing employment could be providing some relief in the   construction industry People who could not get jobs on assembly lines or had lost jobs   on assembly lines might be filling the gap there    Well, they are not always similar; the skilled construction   worker has special skills that someone who has worked at a steel plant doesn’t   necessarily have But in terms of the opportunities available, a relatively low skilled   construction job might be attractive as opposed to working at McDonalds At this point   we have looked at this hypothesis in only a limited way and we haven’t found much   confirmation of it--statistical or anecdotal     3/30/99 16   I’m really not sure precisely what has happened on unemployment in   manufacturing; I don’t have the data in front of me Those are shaky numbers because   the survey asks what a person’s last job was, and a laid-off manufacturing worker could   have been employed elsewhere after he lost his manufacturing job Those data would be   one place to look, and perhaps I should, to see if there is evidence that idled   manufacturing workers are still lingering out there among the unemployed My suspicion   is that the decline in manufacturing employment hasn’t been going on long enough that   these people have totally abandoned their hopes of getting another manufacturing job   Unfortunately, in our forecast manufacturing does not grow rapidly enough to generate   any increases in employment While trade is improving, we really are going to be   generating little, if any, additional employment in manufacturing over the forecast period    Is that a short person joke?  [Laughter]  "
6199,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman The April Consumer Price  Index, published the day after we printed the Greenbook, obviously is  occupying center stage in the financial markets and I would guess that it’s  a pretty prominent question mark for many of you today But, before  getting into the nuts and bolts of that report and our interpretation, I’d like  to say a few words about the broader aggregate demand and supply  setting   First, on the demand side, the picture is still one of strength overall  We think, however, that the first-quarter increase in real domestic final  purchases of 7 percent greatly overstates the underlying trends A variety  of transitory factors combined to boost outlays the dip in interest rates last  fall, since reversed; the stepped-up incentives for auto-buyers, as GM  drove to restore its market share; the abnormally mild winter weather; and  so on Given those considerations, it’s quite reasonable to anticipate a  noticeable slackening of expenditure growth this quarter   And the latest retail sales figures support that assessment--although  we didn’t realize it fully when we finished our forecast last Thursday The  surprisingly large increase in goods prices in Friday’s CPI report implied  that the softening in real spending was even more marked last month than  we had thought on the basis of the nominal retail sales data If we’re right,  real PCE growth in the current quarter will be somewhere in the  neighborhood of 4 percent, at an annual rate--scarcely a weak number, but  one that would be at the low end of the range of recent quarters   Another area of deceleration in our forecast for the second quarter is  residential investment Our thesis has been that, although the demand for  homes probably hasn’t fallen off much, builders would find it difficult-­ perhaps practically impossible--to maintain the seasonally adjusted level  of starts they recorded during the late fall and winter months This  morning’s report is consistent with that notion Actually, single-family  starts fell more than we anticipated, 11 percent; but, as we thought last  month, the single-family permits figures may be telling a more accurate  story, having fallen about 4½ percent in March and another 3 percent in  April     5/18/99 12   The final major element of deceleration in spending this quarter is  state and local purchases--especially outlays for construction In this case,  we still have no useful data beyond March, but it just doesn’t seem  plausible to extrapolate the surge that we saw this winter Unusually  favorable weather almost certainly helped move building ahead of  schedule, and some reversion to trend is to be expected in the near term  This is not to deny that the underlying trend in public construction could  be relatively steep at this time Among other things, the transportation bill  passed last year is helping to spur activity, and states and localities have  been experiencing a bit of a wealth effect themselves, as their revenues  reflect, directly or indirectly, the capital gains taxpayers have been  enjoying   The wealth effect remains central to our projection of domestic  demand and economic activity through next year To be sure, we believe  that waning accelerator effects should be a moderating force with respect  to houses, consumer durables, and business capital goods--and, as we  noted in the Greenbook, one can discern some hints of this already in  various categories of expenditure But, if the stock market continues to  soar, consumers’ perceptions of their permanent income will rise and so  too will businesses’ perceptions of their sales prospects; target levels of  household and business investment goods will move still higher So, the  fact that we’ve anticipated that the market will peak soon is crucial to our  prediction that GDP growth will moderate over the coming year   As it is, the run-up in stock prices last month prompted us to raise our  forecast of demand growth during the next several quarters However, this  has shown through to output rather than to prices because of the more  favorable supply-side environment we are now projecting Perhaps most  notably, we’ve raised our sights on the prospects for gains in labor  productivity, and that has permitted us to raise projected output without  commensurate increases in pressures on labor markets   Our reassessment of the productivity outlook is yet one more in a  sequence of adjustments we’ve made on the basis of incoming data over  the past few years We’d prefer to rely on deep analytical insights, but the  fact is that the behavior of productivity is not well understood, let alone  readily predictable; if it were otherwise, economists wouldn’t still be  scratching their heads over the post-1973 deterioration in the trend of  economic growth Consequently, we’ve had to feel our way on this   In our view, the pickup in output per hour over the past year or so has  been greater than is likely attributable simply to the rapid growth of  output--the so-called “cyclical” influence Firms do seem to be achieving  substantial structural gains in efficiency through technological     5/18/99 13   innovations, investments in more and better equipment, improved  information management, and reorganization of production and  distribution processes Given the continuing high level of investment and  what we hear from business people about their efforts to improve  productivity, there doesn’t appear to be any reason to anticipate that these  gains will fall off markedly in the near term--apart from some tendency for  reductions in worker hours to lag those in output as the rate of GDP  expansion slows And even that cyclical element might be weaker than in  the past, given the heavier use of contingent workers and the pressures on  executives to deliver strong earnings quarter after quarter--except, I  suppose, in the dot-com sector So, putting this all together, we’ve added  several tenths to the rate of increase in output per hour through the year  2000   Obviously, the outlook for productivity is a consideration in the near- term prospects for inflation Among other things, the recent surge in  productivity has helped boost profit margins and thereby given firms more  room to compete for market share without forgoing acceptable rates of  return on equity Moreover, the compensation part of the unit labor cost  ratio is also looking more favorable Even taking the first-quarter ECI  with a large grain of salt, we now have some evidence that, perhaps in part  because of a lagged response to the lower price increases of the past  couple of years, nominal pay gains are not moving up--despite a tight  labor market These considerations encouraged us to take a smidgen off  our core inflation forecast--as did the surprisingly low price numbers  through March But, especially with oil prices and other “special factors”  already, or expected soon to be, taking a turn for the worse, we’ve  maintained our view that an unemployment rate in the low 4s will in time  prove incompatible with stable or declining inflation The question is  whether the four-tenths leap in the April core CPI is telling us that the day  of reckoning actually has arrived   We’re inclined to be fairly sanguine on this score at this point In  part, this is simply because what we hear from businesses doesn’t suggest  that there’s been anything approaching a sea change in the pricing  environment But on the statistical side, while it’s almost always possible  to slice and dice these data to find some residual that fits your priors, we  think there are elements in the April CPI report that provide at least some  grounds for skepticism that the burst in the core index is truly a sign that  the trend of inflation has now turned upward For example, the sizable  increase in apparel prices merely reversed surprisingly large declines in  the first quarter; we expected an offsetting firming of prices somewhere  along the line, and we may simply have missed the timing And the  rebound in tobacco prices after some discounting in March probably is  telling us little about fundamental macro imbalances in the economy  Incidentally, it’s perhaps worth noting that, setting aside tobacco prices,     5/18/99 14   which have risen 33 percent since last April, the twelve-month change in  the core CPI is the same as it was a year ago, even after we add back in the  effects of the technical changes in the index   All that said, though, we didn’t anticipate the outsized April increase  and we wouldn’t feel comfortable ignoring it If we were redoing our  projections now, we’d tack a tenth or two onto our inflation projections for  1999 and 2000 This would not really alter the basic conclusion that we,  and now many bond market commentators, have reached that the best  news on inflation is behind us and that prices will most likely tend to  accelerate over time unless domestic demand softens considerably or we  experience additional fortuitous external shocks   Given that we cannot divine those shocks, we’ve pointed to the likely  need for some monetary policy tightening aimed at reining in aggregate  demand The fixed-income markets have been firming on their own in  recent weeks--especially in the case of Treasury securities But it isn’t  clear that this is wholly a real tightening, as opposed to an escalation of  inflation premiums Moreover, many lower quality corporate bond issuers  have seen rates fall and their market access improve of late, and the stock  market has weathered the negative news of recent days in remarkably  good fashion Barring further adverse news, we can easily see stock and  bond prices turning back up in the coming weeks Thus, we don’t believe  that the markets alone can be relied upon to do the work of curbing the  financial support for unsustainable levels of aggregate demand    I don’t have any additional detail beyond the knowledge that total   starts were down something under 3 percent in April    Yes But, given that the level of starts looks low relative to   permits at this point, I suspect that in reality we probably did not have an unadjusted   decline in permits That is a rough judgment at this point and I don’t have the additional   data to refine that immediately    I don’t have that information     5/18/99 15    Yes, we do    I think the seasonals do continue to move in that direction to some   degree I have those numbers with me, so let me check Well, actually, the seasonal   factor in May is about the same as in April and then June is the low point for the seasonal   factor It is just a little lower We have had the major swing in the seasonal factors in the   last two months    It’s basically February to April The surge starts in February, but   from January to April is the story    On the first question, part of the increase in the productivity   growth that we have in our forecast reflects the stronger demand trends and the cyclical   component I would say that a little more than half, roughly, of the increase in   productivity growth going forward is attributable to the more positive view we have of   the structural improvements in productivity The second question is obviously very   important if one is in the business of making 10-year budget forecasts or 75-year social   security forecasts It is not a totally uninteresting question for us, either, even with our   shorter time frame, in part because one would want to have a sense of what expectations     5/18/99 16   might be and what would be built into peoples’ permanent income views If people felt   that we were just experiencing a brief period of prosperity with these huge productivity   gains, they might behave differently than if they viewed this as a new era, as it were, that   will last decades I think in a sense the stock market is probably behaving as if it is a new   era That is the way one can best understand the longer-term profit forecasts and so on   So, while we prefer to be noncommittal, it appears that what is going on in the economy   may be more reflective of an extrapolation of the kind of performance we built into the   forecast, if not a better one I can easily see this productivity performance not persisting   I can also see this as being a transition phase into a sustained period of more rapid   growth After all, we have had periods of more than decades in duration in which   productivity growth has averaged 3 percent The numbers we are working with are in   line with the very long-term trends in the United States So we are not looking at a   radically high productivity advance here in a broader historical context    Some of this reflects changes in measurement--the introduction of   new weighting that has altered the history by a few tenths But, as we look at it, we also   had a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s when in particular capital was shallowing,   and the low levels of investment did not help to boost productivity in that period In the   mid-1990s and since then, we have seen that change considerably So there are factors   that are readily identifiable It isn’t possible to pin down what contribution investment is   making, but the normal kinds of calculations one can do suggest that investment has been   a significant element in boosting productivity improvement in recent years On top of   that we do seem to be getting some extra productivity increase, so-called multifactor   productivity gains All that fits with one’s sense of what has been going on in the   business sector--that firms have been taking advantage of new technologies, have   reorganized the way they do things, and so on It has not been just the brute force   addition of capital goods that has promoted this improvement We are extrapolating this   out for a limited time here, given our projection period    If the locus of the uncertainty is productivity, I’m not sure that we   are more uncertain about it now than we were three years ago or six years ago I think   there has always been a considerable band of uncertainty around the prospects for   productivity We were puzzled by why productivity gains were so low for many years I   guess I don’t feel any more uncomfortable on that score The only way I feel   uncomfortable is that, in a sense, we are moving a bit beyond the pack But I think others   are moving up their assessments of productivity trends, too, as they overcome the basic   scientific skepticism reflected in the often heard statement that this recent experience   isn’t yet a statistically significant deviation from the previous trends    This is an area where many forecasters have been reluctant to take   a position, and thus it probably hasn’t shown up in their forecasts I know that the   National Association of Business Economists just completed a poll of their members, and   they indicated that they expected about a ¼ percent addition to third-quarter GDP growth   and a ½ percent addition in the fourth quarter But there is still some reluctance, given   the lack of hard information, to go out on a limb and write down a number that will stick   out in any way Now, I might note that the latest forecast by Goldman Sachs, which I   just received yesterday, looked somewhat like our forecast They have a considerable   increase in inventory investment in the fourth quarter, driving GDP growth up to about 4   percent and then a drop-back in inventory investment in the first quarter, though not to a   very low level, which gets their first-quarter GDP down to around zero I know from   having talked with their economists that their security analysts are hearing reports from     5/18/99 18   various companies that firms are planning to do some precautionary stock building It is   not across the board, but they are hearing this and I think gradually economists are   probably building something into their forecasts But this is an area of enormous   uncertainty It is very difficult to quantify What we have in our forecast is a very small   increase in the number of days’ supply; in fact, it isn’t even a day’s supply So there is a   lot of room to maneuver here if people begin to get worried In some sense this is just   flagging the fact that something may happen There probably is going to be some   turbulence in the data I am afraid we are going to have a hard time sorting out the   underlying trends late this year and early next year    I would say that we have some reasonable anchors for our   assessment of capacity utilization The series is periodically benchmarked to Census data   in which companies report what they perceive to be their level of capacity utilization   based on a given definition That definition has been uniform over time, so we think we   have a consistent time series The National Association of Purchasing Managers semi-  annually asks its members to report on what they believe their capacity utilization to be   It usually isn’t exactly our number But the two series track together over time, and the     5/18/99 19   readings through the end of last year still looked reasonably aligned We should get   another reading in a few weeks in the midyear survey of the purchasing managers   Finally, if one looks at vendor performance, which historically has been pretty   well correlated with capacity utilization, we don’t see anything to suggest that we are far   off the mark One additional point is that there is nothing in the behavior of producer   prices that is signaling that the capacity utilization numbers are leading us astray Now,   one might wonder--given a world in which many goods are available overseas and have   relatively low transportation costs and where plants may have the flexibility to adjust   their production on a tighter schedule and so on--whether the supply curve has precisely   the same slope in the short run that it used to have That is an interesting analytical   question, which we need to continue to explore But in terms of the reading on capacity   use at this point, I don’t think we are any further off now than we have been in the past in   judging that    That is true of the estimation of capacity utilization up to a point     5/18/99 20    Then we look at investments and so on to judge what capacity   growth would be going forward I think the question they are asked to answer is what is   their capacity utilization rate given a normal operation of their plants, not allowing for   additions of extra shifts and those sorts of things It is a question that is consistent over   time So whatever it is measuring, it is measuring it on a reasonably stable basis Given   all the other pieces of information, I don’t see anything that seems particularly odd    They are not reporting that they have the same capacity as before   nor that they are using the same amounts as before, but the question they are responding   to is consistent So, conceptually what they are trying to measure is consistent over time   As I said, I just don’t see anything that looks particularly odd in the variables that we   would expect to respond to capacity utilization    The other point to raise is one that the Chairman reiterated in a   speech recently And that is, if you see incipient labor cost pressures, how readily can   you adjust the productive capacity of your plant?  How quickly can you purchase and   install capital goods?  That is another element that one would have to think about in terms   of the dynamics going forward     5/18/99 21   I might just respond to the Chairman’s earlier question on permits My colleague   handed me the press release, which I didn’t have with me earlier The permits for single-  family homes in April were the same as they were in March; the drop was in multifamily   permits    Yes, unadjusted    Need I say more?  [Laughter] I wish I could! We are flying blind   again Maybe we are overly influenced by our experience with snowstorms in   Washington DC when everybody runs out and buys milk and toilet paper and cleans off   the shelves of the grocery stores I think we should expect, even if we don’t get all kinds   of dramatic Y2K programs on television and scary stories on talk radio, that people are   going to be concerned Polls suggest that if people are prompted to think about the Y2K   issue, they say “Yes, we will take some precautions” So the notion is that people will   buy some extra food and those who are dependent on prescription drugs will try to refill   their prescriptions early so they don’t have to worry about computer glitches creating a   problem in early 2000 There are various things I think people will want to buy, figuring   that they will just use them up in January if they don’t need them over the year-end   period We also hear stories about people planning to buy guns and ammunition,   dehydrated food, electrical generators, and wood burning stoves These things are   happening The question is whether they are economically meaningful But some little   movement at the end of the year seems inevitable    From what I understand about the thorough preparations that   people are making at the Federal Reserve Board, I suspect we would be able to meet here   even on January 2nd if we wanted to    We have allowed for that on a very limited scale in both cases    It is obviously very difficult and it is a judgment call But I think   the kind of situation you are describing, though complicated, is one reason to anticipate   that at least some companies will hire additional workers You say companies are   working beyond sustainable levels of labor utilization, but you also say they are   absolutely determined not to add workers In other cases, I think people are working very   hard, and firms would like to add workers but are finding it difficult to do so in a very   tight labor market For the latter group, we would anticipate that, even if business begins     5/18/99 23   to flatten out, some of these firms will follow through on their hiring plans to reach a   more comfortable position    And that would be a source of a cyclical weakening in   productivity On the other hand, there is still obviously a very strong culture of cost   control--that may be your first group--and managers will do absolutely anything they can   do to keep their labor force to an absolute minimum  And where they use temps and   other contingent workers, those people will probably find their hours or employment   reduced fairly rapidly So I think there is a balance in this prospect  "
6223,1999-06-29," I don’t know how real the economics are, but there are tangible   charts to which we will be referring 2/   I thought I’d begin with a brief update on the second quarter, taking  into account a few data we’ve received since the Greenbook was  completed   As usual at this point, we’re still attempting to blend the labor market  data with the expenditure figures to get a fix on current-quarter GDP The  relationship is loose, but the weaker growth of production worker hours in  April and May, shown in the upper left panel of Chart 1, suggests that we  should look for a moderation of real output growth this quarter  Considering the spending numbers as well, our best guess for the real  GDP increase is still about 3 percent   Yesterday’s report on consumer spending for May contained no  major surprises Anticipating a moderate increase in June, we see real  PCE this quarter running something over 4 percent--off markedly from the  6¾ percent first-quarter pace   Housing starts, at the middle left, fell off considerably on average in  April and May--we think mainly because of limited supplies of labor and  materials, rather than any shortage of demand Owing to the lags between   2/ A copy of the material used by Mr Prell and Ms Johnson is appended to the transcript  (Appendix 2)     6/29-30/99 13   starts and construction outlays, real residential investment probably will be  up, but only modestly, this quarter   As plotted at the right, last week’s advance report from manufacturers  showed that shipments of non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft,  were strong through May This reinforces our view that there will be a  hefty increase in PDE this quarter, although various anecdotes and the  NAPM survey would suggest that some of the rise in shipments of capital  goods might show up in export sales   In that regard, the panel at the lower left shows that overall exports  firmed in April Even so, the trade gap still was somewhat larger than the  first-quarter average, as we continued to exhibit an enormous appetite for  imports   Turning to the right panel, it would appear that few of those imports  ended up in business inventories in April The book value of  manufacturing and trade stocks, ex motor vehicles, rose only modestly-­ roughly matching the first-quarter rate of accumulation   All told, then, the picture is one of a step-down in GDP growth this  quarter But final demand can scarcely be said to have turned weak--and  inventories probably are lean enough that desires to build stocks will spur  production in coming months   With that prelude, let me turn to the summary of the staff forecast,  contained in Chart 2 As has been the case for a long time now, we are  projecting a considerable moderation in the trend of real GDP growth  The quarterly numbers represented by the bars in the upper left panel  gyrate later this year and in early 2000 because of our allowance for some  Y2K effects, but the general drift is toward a slightly sub-par growth  trend Being just slightly sub-par, though, that growth probably would be  sufficient to hold the unemployment rate in the low 4s through next year   Largely, but not solely, because of the continued tightness of the  labor market, we’re expecting that the rate of inflation will trend higher, as  may be seen in the bottom panels The recent rebound in crude oil prices  generates an acceleration of the overall CPI to a 2¼ percent increase this  year; a leveling of oil prices holds total CPI inflation at the same average  pace in 2000 even as the core component accelerates The acceleration in  overall GDP prices is smoother, because the direct oil price effects on this  index are smaller   As we emphasized in the Greenbook, the stock market outlook--the  subject of the next chart--is quite central to our forecast With the “drag”  from the external sector likely to be diminishing, the projected moderation     6/29-30/99 14   of GDP growth hinges on a substantial slackening in the growth of  domestic demand The half percentage point funds rate increase we’ve  assumed to occur in the next several months and the sustained higher level  of intermediate- and long-term interest rates should work in that direction  However, a cessation of the uptrend in share prices is an important  ingredient as well, and whether that is indeed at hand is open to question   The top left panel updates the provocative comparison of the 1920s  and 1990s bull markets that I included in the last chart show We’re still  pretty much on track, with some upside ahead of us Certainly, the fact  that the market has given up so little ground in the recent period of interest  rate run-up is testament to the abiding exuberance of investors   That point is given further emphasis by the right panel, which shows  the current extraordinary narrowness of the equity premium, as proxied by  the gap between the earnings yield on the S&P 500, based on analysts’  profit expectations for the coming twelve months, and the real 10-year  Treasury rate   The middle panels plotting price-earnings multiples alone are perhaps  less insightful analytically--but may still be of some interest The left  panel in particular illustrates that the run-up in PEs has been unusual in  that it has occurred at a time so distant from a cyclical trough in profits   Together, as we’ve suggested repeatedly--and evidently wrongly-­ these indicators would seem to suggest that the market could be vulnerable  to a quite sizable decline, if and as rosy corporate profit expectations are  disappointed Nonetheless, we’ve projected only a flattening in share  prices That still produces the decline in the household wealth-income  ratio charted in the lower left panel, however, which should help take the  steam out of consumer demand   The little table at the right is intended to highlight the relative potency  of stock market effects today Because of the huge run-up in the wealth- income ratio since the end of 1994, a given percentage change in share  prices translates into a much greater consumption effect than before As  indicated, when we apply our standard rule of thumb to a 10 percent  decline in share prices, the effect on real PCE growth in the ensuing year  is now 04 percent, twice what it was earlier   In the Greenbook, we simulated a rapid 25 percent decline in the  market, which had notable but not devastating effects on the growth of  activity Looking at the panels above, one might be able to envision a  much deeper bear market But, even with the simulation we performed, it  might be asked whether there could not be greater effects on demand than  predicted because of financial imbalances that our model cannot capture     6/29-30/99 15   This is no simple matter to pin down, but Chart 4 provides a few  clues First, the upper panel tends to allay one concern Although the  volume of margin debt outstanding has skyrocketed, when scaled by the  value of equities, as it is here, it doesn’t look so startling   However, this is a very narrow measure of leveraging and consequent  risk exposure The right panel shows two aggregate ratios of households’  indebtedness to their holdings of liquid assets The black line reveals that  debt has been rising considerably relative to holdings of the most liquid of  financial assets--deposits, money funds, and governments But the red  line indicates that debt has been falling relative to a broader range of  assets that comprises as well corporate and municipal securities and  mutual funds So, there’s not much sign here that even though debt has  been growing appreciably faster than income, household balance sheets in  the aggregate have become more illiquid   Is there something lurking out there at a disaggregated level that  might imply a different assessment?  We’ve generated some preliminary  tabulations from the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances to address that  issue, and these are laid out in the middle panels I’d note on the left panel  that there’s been a considerable shift in the distribution of household debt  from those without stock (a smaller portion of the population today) to  those who have significant amounts of stock--defined in the second  column as a holding equal to at least one-half year’s income   But, if shareholders have taken on a larger amount of debt, they’ve  not incurred extraordinary debt-service burdens As indicated in the  second column of the right panel, the median monthly payment burden as  a percent of income for significant shareholders has increased, but it is  somewhere between the ratios for households with smaller or no  shareholdings I should add the caveat that the income concept in these  ratios often includes realized capital gains, which might suggest the  possibility of some greater exposure for the shareholding households, but  another fact is that the significant shareholders also have relatively large  amounts of other assets Thus, even if one were to assume a very deep  drop in the stock market, it would not generally have drastic effects on  their ability to cover their debts   The bottom panels focus on another conceivable point of  vulnerability, the banking system As you can see at the left, the black  line indicates that almost all banking assets are held by institutions that are  well capitalized The comfort one might draw from that fact today is  perhaps a little less than would have been the case a couple of years ago,  however, because--as shown by the red line--the margin by which the  banks exceed their regulatory capital requirements has shrunk a bit     6/29-30/99 16   If one were to think about how the banking system might be affected  by a stock market plunge, at least one can rule out the more direct links  that proved devastating in Japan when their bubble burst Having  consulted with our supervisory folks, it appears that the greatest concern  might be that loans have been made to firms that have engaged in  aggressively priced acquisitions, with the expectation that those loans will  be repaid out of proceeds of subsequent stock or junk bond issues The  junk bond market looks better today than it did last fall, as reflected in the  yield spread at the right; but with defaults already rising the spreads have  remained appreciable A broad retrenchment in stock prices might cause  an edgy junk market to turn very sour and leave banks with either losses or  impaired assets that would in turn make them more cautious lenders My  sense though, is that--short of a severe market setback--we are not talking  about financial dislocations of such a scope and intensity that we need to  mark up the customary wealth and cost-of-capital effects substantially   The kinds of pressures financial markets will face obviously will  depend considerably on the amount of inflation that lies ahead Chart 5  summarizes the labor market forces impinging on wages Our forecast of  labor demand is premised on what is, relative to prevailing professional  norms, a pretty optimistic assessment of the dimension of recent and  prospective structural gains in labor productivity As you can see in the  top panel, however, we’re expecting that growth in output per hour will  slow in the near term, not because the structural improvements will ebb,  but because we expect that hiring won’t be geared down immediately and  commensurately as production decelerates   In any event, we don’t foresee much relief from the labor market  tightness The labor force participation rate, plotted in the middle left  panel, has been fluctuating in an essentially sideways direction for a while,  after having risen a bit as people perhaps were drawn into the workforce  partly by the perception that jobs were readily available As indicated at  the right, the percentage of respondents to the Conference Board survey  who say that jobs are easy to get seems to be leveling out, and we’re  expecting labor force participation to remain in the recent range   In this tight labor market, workers have achieved some leverage in the  wage-setting process, and we’re forecasting that compensation increases,  plotted at the lower left, will be tending to grow We believe that we were  probably correct in expecting that the low rate of price inflation in the past  year or two would be moderating nominal wage increases, but the first- quarter fall-off in the ECI measure of compensation looks too low to  believe In fact, doing some rethinking, partly in light of other  information that has come in of late, we have moved our ECI forecast  back up noticeably this time, after having initially dropped it quite     6/29-30/99 17   markedly in response to the first-quarter surprise But, the basic point,  conveyed in the forecasts of both the ECI and the Productivity and Costs  series for hourly compensation, is that tight labor markets--with a helping  hand from Uncle Sam on the minimum wage front--are likely to produce  ongoing large real pay increases   The right panel documents the real compensation gains in the  forecast, responding in part to questions that have arisen at past meetings  I’ve based this on the Productivity and Costs series in part because it  relates more directly to the movements in income shares in the NIPAs  The point that is highlighted here is that, though the projected real pay  gains may look rather skimpy relative to productivity trends when they are  measured against consumer prices, when they’re measured against product  prices they are quite sizable Workers have been capturing a bigger share  of the pie   This spells a squeeze on profit margins--unless businesses can find  some leverage of their own on the pricing side We don’t think that they  will do so, but there are some risks As you can see in the top panel of the  next chart, we have core consumer prices accelerating over the next year  and a half This reflects in part the labor cost pressures I’ve just described  In addition, there will be some pass-through into core prices of the  rebound in oil prices via higher transportation costs and other channels   The middle left panel highlights another unfavorable factor--namely,  the turn that is likely to occur in non-oil import prices as the dollar peaks  and foreign economies manage to generate more domestic demand for  their output One can already observe that import price trends have  become somewhat less favorable than they were earlier, with a rise in  materials prices being a significant element in that pattern   Looking for signs of whether the tide might be turning in domestic  prices, one indicator that people sometimes consult as a measure of so- called “pipeline” inflation is the PPI core intermediate component,  graphed at the right These prices don’t bulk large in terms of their weight  in overall production costs, but they can be an early indicator of broader  inflationary pressures They’ve probably now posted their first quarterly  increase since 1997 Some of this is metals prices, which rallied in part on  Asian growth prospects; some of it is the effect of higher petroleum  feedstock costs; and some of it is the pressures on capacity in the  construction materials industry These don’t quite smell like a broad- based inflationary surge, though Moreover, the below-average overall  factory utilization rate in our forecast, shown at the lower left, suggests  that, although competitive pressures from abroad may ease a bit, a major  flare-up in goods price inflation is not in the immediate offing     6/29-30/99 18   There have been some comments in Reserve Bank reports that  consumers have become somewhat less price conscious This might  suggest some shift in inflation expectations The final panel shows the  Michigan SRC median readings on 1 year and 5-to-10 year expectations  On the moving average basis plotted here to filter out some of the noise,  both series are off their lows, but whether the downtrends of the past  several years are in process of reversing is not clear A sanguine--and  quite plausible--interpretation would be that expectations were damped to  an extra degree last year by the plunge in energy prices and that we have  seen a one-time adjustment back up in light of the recent rebound in those  prices The pattern here is not dissimilar to those in the charts of the price  series themselves In neither case is the direction unambiguous and as a  result they perhaps serve best as a sort of Rorschach test for one’s degree  of inflation phobia   Karen will now discuss the international picture    The final chart summarizes your forecasts In short, the  central tendencies--constructed here by dropping the high three and low  three of the distributions for each variable--are closely in line with the  staff’s Greenbook numbers Y2K effects are minimal   Perhaps more interesting--and potentially more relevant in light of the  statutory requirement that the Humphrey-Hawkins report comment on the  relationship of the Fed’s monetary policy objectives to the Administration’s  forecast--is the comparison of your forecasts to those in the right-most  column of the table, drawn from yesterday’s Mid-session Review budget  document Your central tendencies are noticeably more optimistic about  real GDP growth this year and next than they are, but little different with  respect to CPI inflation I’m not in a position to read your minds or those  of the Administration forecasters However, I’d note two things First, it  would appear that the Administration forecasters have anticipated no  change in short-term rates, so monetary policy does not seem to be key to  their slower growth forecast; second, although they’ve raised their  assumption regarding trend productivity growth, at only 16 percent for  nonfarm businesses it lies well below the 2¼ percent implicit in the  Greenbook projection    We have taken account of three categories of effects here One is a   precautionary stockpiling, and we have a very modest amount of stockpiling occurring on   the part of both households and businesses Businesses in many cases will want to have     6/29-30/99 25   some extra supplies on hand beginning in 2000 just in case the normal supply channels   are disrupted The second element is some disruption There will probably be,   somewhere, some malfunctions--electrical outages or whatever--that disrupt some public   services at the beginning of next year But again, we made the assumption that those will   be very minor and quickly resolved The third set of considerations relates, I think, to the   point you are raising In our case, we focused it entirely on the computer area We have   assumed that the remarkable strength of computer purchases in 1998 and hefty purchases   in the first part of this year reflect in part some speeding up of replacement cycles to   replace non-compliant equipment And we think there will be, at least in some firms, a   lockdown of computer systems in the latter part of this year, a falloff in computer outlays,   and probably a lot of scurrying around to get the last minute fixes done So there may be   some subtraction from productivity on that score Next year there will probably still be   some fixing up of glitches that are discovered early in the year But as we move through   the year, we would anticipate a rebound in computer outlays and perhaps associated   investments as firms feel that they are in the clear and can go back to the normal   strategies for their companies   We scaled all of these things, I think, pretty small The computer swings are quite   marked, but I think the inventory question is really quite open at this point Our sense is   that a lot of firms have not yet really settled their plans on how much they are going to   stockpile They are still in contact with their suppliers, trying to get assurances that there   won’t be problems and trying to assess where the risks may be We anticipate that they   will firm up those decisions over the next few months and, therefore, that most of the   inventory building will occur in the latter months of this year That is when the   production effects will probably show up for the most part    I would just reiterate the thought that we have really very small   effects built in here When they are annualized, they whip these numbers around In the   recent NAPM survey at midyear, one of the questions asked of the purchasing managers   was what they might do We tried to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations based   on those numbers And I can tell you from just looking at that, in manufacturing   materials it is a multiple of the inventory effects we have built in here If people begin to   get a little panicked--if they get stirred up by the end-of-the-world TV programs or   articles that undoubtedly will be offered in the closing months of this year--the $25 worth   of precautionary expenditures per household that we built into this forecast will be a   fraction of what will occur   Now, some of this will just mean that stocks will run down in some places   because firms will not have produced enough to accommodate that demand, so it will all   come out in the wash here But I think the potential is for even bigger swings than this     6/29-30/99 27   It may be that people will be sufficiently reassured only to take a few hundred dollars out   of their bank account, but that’s symbolic of the kind of concerns that will lead people to   do some other things as well I guess I’m somewhat conditioned by my experience here   in Washington, DC when there is the slightest hint of a possible snowstorm and people   buy six months’ worth of toilet paper People do get carried away at times And for a   purchasing manager, the cost of ending up with a few extra materials on the shelf that can   be used up in the first weeks or months of 2000 is not very high as opposed to being short   in what is needed to keep the production lines running So we are highlighting something   that potentially could make for a considerable amount of noise in the data In terms of   your numbers and what we would be presenting to the Congress in the Humphrey-  Hawkins report, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis the effects are so small as to   be trivial So I don’t think there is cause to make any big to-do about this other than to   highlight the bit of uncertainty that exists about what might occur at the end of the year    I think there is much to be said for that point, and that is why I   focused on the ratios I have here I focused in these Survey of Consumer Finance runs on   proportions of payments to income, thinking that that represents people’s ongoing cash   flows As I noted, for shareholders that may include some realized capital gains But   even if the market goes down, I suspect some people in their panic might realize some   capital gains, so they will get some cash from that in some instances    As a percent of GDP, sure In the recent period, corporate debt has   been rising relatively rapidly Again, it’s a question of what balance sheet ratios one   wants to look at Many firms have a good deal of cash right now, so I don’t think the     6/29-30/99 28   corporate balance sheet picture looks particularly troublesome And I don’t think the   behavior of the rating agencies suggests that there has been any clear deterioration    That’s what I was suggesting These are the numbers from the   Mid-session Review that was published yesterday They have characterized it as being in   line with the Blue Chip forecast and conservative    I don’t know what the longer-term numbers they might have from   the Blue Chip forecast look like But I must say that they have tended to err on the low   side, I think publicly and purposely in their process, which makes some sense if they are   trying to be cautious about counting revenues  On the other hand, it may skew a fiscal   policy decision by suggesting that things are tighter than the numbers might otherwise   have indicated There is clearly a political element in that decision    Yes, they’ve tended to be very, very low    In fact, what little insight we have would suggest that their surplus   numbers look on the low side relative to ours in part because they put in higher   expenditure numbers than seem to be in train at this point, as opposed to it being simply   the difference in our economic assumptions    Sure Fortunately, we have not gotten into 15-year budget   forecasting yet  "
6245,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman   At first blush, it might seem odd that in this edition of the Greenbook  we’d be talking about heightened inflation risks and raising the assumed  fed funds path in our baseline forecast  After all, real GDP growth was  surprisingly weak in the second quarter, and the core CPI increased only  a tenth-and-a-half per month on average in June and July   Given that you’ve all perused the text, I’m sure that you appreciate  the compelling logic that lay behind our forecast revisions! [Laughter]  But, just for the record, Karen and I shall highlight for you some of the  key considerations Because a significant part of the explanation comes  from the international side--and because some interesting developments  have occurred in that sphere in the post-Greenbook publication period-­ Karen will lead off    Even with the revision to net exports, the biggest surprise  in the second-quarter GDP picture, relative to our last projection, still is  the very low rate of inventory accumulation A forecaster’s fairly typical  response to such a surprise, especially when it occurs against a backdrop  of solid final demand, would be to assume that the shortfall will translate  into additional impetus to subsequent output growth, as firms seek to  bring their stocks back into normal alignment with expected sales  Unfortunately, however, one must judge just what the normal alignment  is; and that is something that can shift over time in response, among other  things, to changes in price expectations or interest rates, or structural  improvements in “supply-chain management”   In the present case, the persistent--and now sizable--decline in the  aggregate inventory/sales ratio in recent quarters and the lack of evidence  that this is causing any discomfort have caused us to reassess our  judgment about firms’ objectives for stocks In essence, we’re putting  considerable weight on the structural improvement story and,  consequently, we’re not looking for any meaningful rebound in the stock- sales ratio But, on the assumption that firms will not seek still lower  ratios in the near future, we still get a step-up in inventory investment that  makes a positive contribution to GDP growth similar to what we had in  our previous forecast   So, in addressing the question of where our heightened inflation risk  came from, inventories are not the answer Nor, of course, is it from  recent domestic financial market developments Indeed, though we’d  been expecting that the markets would be afflicted with Y2K anxieties,  we didn’t anticipate that the fears would exert the force they apparently  have so far before the end of the year To be sure, the recent backup in  interest rates didn’t arise solely because of anticipated Y2K pressures;  concerns about monetary policy tightening contributed as well But it  seems quite clear, as has already been noted this morning, that the  concern that market liquidity would dry up later this year gave rise to  pressures on an array of rate spreads for which there were not the  arbitrage resources available to offset fully     8/24/99 39   The further rise in longer-term interest rates--especially those on  home mortgages--should exert some additional restraining force on  domestic demand in the coming months But we anticipate that the  spread widening, which already has reversed some this month, will  reverse more fully once we’ve negotiated the century date change   This is one reason we’ve assumed another 50 basis points of  tightening by next spring All else equal, if the System failed to validate  the market’s expectation of at least that much firming in short rates, the  tendency probably would be for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates  to drop back even more than we’ve anticipated Moreover, the absence  of tightening could well provide the all-clear signal that would help the  stock market to extend its uptrend The rally of the past few days, as the  markets became a little more sanguine about Fed policy, I think  underscores that risk   The final point I’d make on the domestic demand side is that the  outlook for the federal budget has turned a tad more stimulative for the  coming quarters, with the addition of about $20 billion of outlays for the  coming fiscal year that was not anticipated in our previous projection  Obviously, this amount isn’t a big deal in a $9 trillion economy, but it  comes on top of the additional impetus expected from export demand   So, on balance, aggregate demand growth prospects--even with a  notch more nominal monetary tightening--look to us to be at least as  strong for the coming year or so as they did at the time of the last  meeting But our inflation concerns stem also from the supply side,  where there are indications that cost pressures are mounting to a greater  degree than we’d perceived before All the recent wage readings have  surpassed our expectations, some by quite substantial margins  Admittedly, all the measures have their limitations as representations of  the cost elements that might be influencing short-run pricing behavior,  but it would seem wrong to discount them entirely as factors that could  contribute to larger increases in the prices of goods and services   In addition, recent news on crude and intermediate materials prices  has been disappointing, with the increases in the core PPI measures as  well as in oil prices pointing to more pipeline inflation We don’t expect  that either of these will provide a major jolt to core inflation, but the  picture is less favorable at this point than we thought it would be The  prospect that the recent weakness of the dollar will foster an earlier  upturn in non-oil import prices reinforces that concern   All told, then, we felt that a modest elevation of our wage and price  inflation forecasts was appropriate, and the 25 basis points of additional  fed funds increase that we tacked on did little more than keep the real     8/24/99 40   short-term interest rate path as high as it was last time Clearly, if the  recent sinking spell of the dollar continues, the alternative 10 percent  depreciation simulation in the Greenbook potentially comes into play,  and the inflation problem could be significantly intensified   We didn’t see that as the most likely outcome, but as a quite clear risk  that is worthy of your attention To put it in terms of an overused fairy  tale analogy, it could well be that Goldilocks, the international investor,  has pretty much gotten her fill of US dollar porridge--be it hot, cold, or  just right--and has begun to develop an appetite for some Kobe beef or  Euro truffles   That concludes our prepared remarks, Mr Chairman    Drywall and some other construction supplies certainly would be the   exception    I don’t think one can ever have confidence in an inventory forecast, and   I certainly don’t at this moment We are conscious of some areas in which it is likely that   firms would want to build stocks I’m not sure that’s the case in retailing on a broad front,   but it certainly would be true in many areas of building supplies There are still industries,     8/24/99 41   by all reports, with more inventories than firms would like to have--construction equipment,   farm equipment, chemicals still to some degree, and so on Our sense is that if there are   cases where inventories are leaner than desired, it is not a pervasive phenomenon If one   looks at survey evidence--for example, the purchasing managers’ reports on perceptions of   customer inventories--nothing has happened recently to suggest that firms in general have   been greatly surprised by the strength of sales and that their inventories have been depleted   beyond levels they would be happy to live with Going forward, we are expecting a   substantial step-up in inventory accumulation, augmented over the remainder of this year by   some Y2K hoarding So we do have a substantial contribution to GDP growth from   inventory investment over the next several months We are hopeful that with the   cooperation of the Reserve Bank research staffs we will be able to come up with a little   more concrete notion of just how big the Y2K inventory hoarding effort will be, and we will   report on that before the next meeting That’s certainly a wild card in the picture    I think we’d edge above the 3 percent mark in core inflation on the   assumption that the unemployment rate will be drifting up ever so slightly as we move   through 2001    We have some bits and pieces of information from various censuses and   some notion about what the reports from the unemployment insurance system are suggesting   about revisions to wage and salary income On both sides of the ledger, the information   points to upward revisions in the level of GDP this year I should caution though that this is   fragmentary  There will also be some changes in the scope of GDP, in a sense, as they     8/24/99 42   introduce computer software; what the year-to-year growth pattern will be there, one cannot   be sure Even on the compensation side, we really only have information about one very   important component of compensation--wage and salary income There is still the   possibility that other labor income could be revised in ways that would alter the picture   Based on what we know, we’d anticipate that we are not talking about more than a couple of   tenths on the current definition of GDP in terms of what the higher trend output growth   might have been over recent years That’s sort of the upside limit based on the fragmentary   information we have at this point  "
6267,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman   As we noted in the Greenbook, the information received since the last  meeting has strongly confirmed the notion that the low GDP growth reported for the  second quarter grossly overstated any moderating tendencies in the economic  expansion Indeed, the data available as of last Wednesday persuaded us to raise our  sights regarding the pace of output growth over the second half--bringing us back up  to the 37 percent Q4/Q4 total that we discussed in the midyear Chart Show   The incoming statistical data and the anecdotal evidence found in the  Beigebook paint a fairly consistent picture of robust private domestic demand in  recent months Consumer spending has continued to rise at a fairly brisk pace, with  the advance of light vehicle sales to around the 17 million unit mark underscoring  that households remain confident enough to tap into their accumulated assets or  borrow to finance their purchases   The same positive fundamentals seem to have buoyed the residential real  estate market well into the summer in the face of higher mortgage rates The initial  estimate of August new home sales that was released late last week and showed  them rising monotonically since the spring, likely was biased upward by some  technical problems But, that said, it’s our assessment that demand for homes will     10/5/99 8   be subsiding only gently over the remainder of the year and that a backlog of  projects will help to sustain building activity   The biggest surprise of the third quarter was the apparent acceleration of  business fixed investment I say “apparent” because there are considerable gaps in  the source data in hand, and these numbers can be quite erratic But the strength of  the computer and communications equipment industries seems pretty clear, and  shipments from that sector likely paced a large increase in overall equipment  spending   Finally, on the private spending side, the fragmentary evidence suggests that  inventory investment picked up this summer from the very low pace of the second  quarter Still, by all reports, stocks remain comfortable, if not lean, overall, leaving  room for further appreciable accumulation in the coming months   All told, then, there’s no reason to doubt that domestic demand has retained  substantial positive momentum into the fall Moreover, as Karen will be discussing,  improving foreign economies are giving an increasing lift to our export sales  Though some of the demand in the economy is leaking abroad in a very steep rise in  imports, there’s enough left over to this point to provide ample impetus to domestic  production   Indeed, under the circumstances, one might reasonably ask whether our  projection of a slackening in the pace of expansion in the coming year, with only a  little further policy tightening, is realistic   In responding to that question, I want to begin by noting that, as impressive as  the economy’s strength has been of late, it does appear that the expansion actually  may already have moderated somewhat this year On our estimate, real GDP  growth thus far this year has been about 3½ percent, at an annual rate, versus the 4¼  percent increase registered in 1998 as a whole Granted, this is a thin reed  statistically--perhaps especially on the eve of a major revision of the national  income accounts--but it’s certainly not at odds with our longstanding expectation of  deceleration   Furthermore, a little of the strength in demand we’ve observed lately could be  a Y2K phenomenon, and thus inherently transitory We highlighted in the  Greenbook our hunch that the recent surge in computer sales was in part simply a  more exaggerated version of the story of information system remediation and then  lock-down than we previously had allowed for Likewise, it’s also possible that the  economy is already beginning to feel the effects of Y2K-inspired precautionary  stocking by households and businesses   That said, I wouldn’t push either of those points very far And I’d give at  least as much consideration to what may be one of the major upside risks to our  forecast of moderating aggregate demand in the intermediate term As we’ve  emphasized, that forecast hinges importantly on the flat path for equity prices that     10/5/99 9   we have anticipated To be sure, past, and what we have assumed to be prospective,  increases in interest rates imply some restraint on activity going forward However,  that restraint--occurring against a backdrop of a depreciating dollar, a rebounding  world economy, and a somewhat more expansive fiscal policy--doesn’t seem great  enough to outweigh the impetus to demand that would be supplied by a resumption  of a stock market rise even remotely resembling the average performance of the past  few years   As we indicated in the Greenbook, we can see a rational basis for anticipating  an even weaker market than we’ve built into our forecast, but we’ve said the same in  the past, only to be trampled by the bulls of Wall Street From a policy standpoint,  it would seem a central issue whether you want to bet on this recent correction being  a major break-point in the market trend, or whether you will want to take the  initiative yourselves to impose some added restraint on demand   Obviously, there would be no reason to worry about restraining demand if it  weren’t for the danger of an unsatisfactory inflation outcome In our forecast, that  danger is manifest However, a forecast is a forecast; it’s not a fact And the facts  are ambiguous at this point The broadest measures of goods and services inflation  have picked up this year, but if one parses the indexes, the story is the sharp reversal  of oil prices Indeed, some measures of “core inflation” have even slowed--for  example, the CPI excluding food and energy   One must of course exercise some caution in engaging in such slicing and  dicing in the effort to assess the underlying trends It usually makes sense to try to  filter out the noise in short-term movements in indexes like the overall CPI that  stems from erratic elements like energy prices; but this becomes an increasingly  risky approach when you do it over ever-lengthening time spans At some point,  you have to take the overall price measures as the better indication of the macro  phenomenon of inflation   Put differently, over time the movements in energy prices influence those of  other prices--either through their effect on production and distribution costs or as a  factor influencing wages In this regard, last year’s sharp drop in oil prices probably  contributed significantly to this year’s favorable wage and price performance, and  this year’s even sharper run-up in oil prices is likely to leave its mark on wages and  core prices in coming quarters   We can already see some of that effect in the behavior of intermediate  materials prices The PPI for core intermediate materials has risen considerably in  recent months and the September jump in the NAPM index of prices paid probably  bodes ill for the PPI measure in the near term   Items for which petroleum is an important input have played a significant part  in this surge  But oil isn’t the only factor Another is the strengthening of foreign  economies and the peaking of the dollar on exchange markets These have brought  a cessation of the declines in core non-oil import prices that we enjoyed in 1998 and     10/5/99 10   early 1999 This undoubtedly has contributed to the pickup in “pipeline” inflation  If our expectations about foreign growth and the dollar prove correct, one can  anticipate a further lessening of the disinflationary force from the external sector   That still leaves the crucial questions of productivity and compensation  Recent productivity developments have been pretty much in line with what we  would expect, given the strength of output and our basic assumptions about the  “trend” of output per hour On the other hand, they cannot be said to rule out a still  more optimistic view that structural improvements in efficiency are in an ongoing  escalation, which might translate into a temporarily more favorable trade-off  between unemployment and inflation  This is one of the issues that we shall have to  review carefully when we get the revised NIPA data at the end of the month   As regards pay rates, the most recent average hourly earnings figures have  shown no intensification of wage inflation--quite the contrary But there have been  some disturbing signs as well On the benefits side, it’s becoming increasingly clear  that health insurance premiums are in a substantial acceleration And the recent auto  agreements, coming on the heels of the Boeing settlement, suggest that labor has  gained some bargaining power in a tight economy With Congress seemingly  headed for an agreement to raise the minimum wage next year and this year’s higher  consumer price inflation likely to be showing through in pay decisions, there is in  our view a likelihood that nominal compensation will accelerate   Thus, though there clearly are many interesting things going on in terms of  technological innovations and other changes in the business environment, under the  present circumstances we think the odds favor an upward drift in inflation over our  projection period  "
6290,1999-11-16," Mr Chairman, Karen Johnson is going to lead off our remarks, but let   me just mention to the Committee that we released industrial production data this morning--I   trust a few minutes ago We failed to put a copy of the release in front of you, so let me just tell   you about it There were some small net revisions to the data for August and September that left   September IP down 01 percent instead of the 03 percent decline that was published previously   And the October increase in industrial production was 07 percent  In manufacturing we had a   01 percent increase in September, also an upward revision, and 06 percent in October I think   these numbers are significantly above market expectations, so perhaps those of you with   electronic gadgets can see whether there has been any market reaction    I’m not sure whether that’s good news or not    I think it’s pretty clear that, even gauged with our re-calibrated  GDP thermometer, the economy has continued to run hot in recent months The  bigger issue right now would seem to be whether its temperature has reached the  inflationary flash point The recent indications have been mixed on that score, but  as you know, we aren’t very optimistic We see underlying price trends moving in  an inflationary direction, even as demand growth slows a bit from the recent pace   In that regard, we noted in the Greenbook that there have been some signs of  moderation in the expansion of household spending since midyear However, the  news received in recent days has taken a bit of the edge off those signs Friday’s  report on October retail sales showed a 04 percent gain at the so-called “control”  category of stores That isn’t an especially large gain, but it’s more than the chain  store figures and anecdotal news had led us to expect And what makes the  surprise still more disquieting is the fact that the early results of the Michigan  SRC survey point to a considerable resurgence in sentiment this month   Of course, PCE is not the only component of domestic spending for which  ongoing moderation is less than assured In the housing market, the rise in  interest rates this year appears finally to have taken some of the wind out of  builders’ sails However, with consumer confidence seemingly so strong and  mortgage rates having slipped back some in recent weeks, we’ll have to keep a  close watch on the indicators of demand in this sector as well As it is, continuing  reports that short supplies of inputs have been delaying projects suggest that  actual construction spending may hold up fairly well for a while   On the business investment side, apart from our reading of the zig-zags in  computer shipments as supporting our notion of a near-term Y2K lock-down  effect, there are no compelling signs that the strong uptrend in spending on capital  equipment is weakening  Meanwhile, yesterday’s retail inventory figures left the  overall stock picture for the third quarter about as we anticipated it--lean, and ripe  for some greater buildup in the near term, perhaps even apart from any Y2K  hedging   The bottom line is that it’s far from certain that we’re on track for the  substantial deceleration of domestic demand needed to offset the oncoming  external impetus Karen described and thereby avoid a further escalation of labor     11/16/99 11   market pressures As you know, in our forecast, we only get there with 50 basis  points of funds rate tightening over the next year and, importantly, a plateau in  share prices The renewed exuberance of the stock market this month seems to  underscore the upside risks to demand coming from that realm   One might argue that such upside demand risks are of little concern because  they in effect mirror an upside risk to aggregate supply in our forecast As you  know, looking at the patterns in the revised national income accounts, we’ve  found grounds for upgrading the structural gains in labor productivity in the  period ahead It is, of course, possible that we didn’t go far enough It might  even be asserted that the unanticipated strength of the stock market, especially  with its focus in the tech sector, is an indication that we’re still lagging beyond the  reality of the information revolution I’ll admit to remaining more than a little  skeptical that the market is providing an informed, rational assessment of the  prospects in this regard But, in any event, as we attempted to illustrate with a  model simulation in the Greenbook, it would take a much greater improvement in  productivity performance than we’ve allowed for to avert a deterioration in  inflation trends   Another way we might avoid that deterioration would be for 4 percent  unemployment to prove sustainable without putting pressure on real wage  increases A look at some of the data we’ve received in recent weeks could easily  tempt one toward that conclusion Certainly, the third-quarter ECI and October  average hourly earnings figures were benign Even the rather large, 4¾ percent  annual rate, rise in nonfarm compensation per hour in the third quarter did not  interrupt the broader deceleration since last year But these observations don’t  provide much comfort with respect to the outlook if one buys our explanation for  the slowing in nominal wage increases--namely, last year’s particularly low price  inflation, since reversed   Moreover, anecdotal indications of wage behavior have been less than  propitious While the picture is far from uniform, what I hear is that coping with  a tight supply of qualified workers has become a preoccupation for many  managers; that short-staffing is creating strains, with excessive pressure on  workers and sometimes quality problems as a consequence; and that more  employers are concluding that they will have to break down and raise wages by  more or on a broader front Of course, these stories aren’t entirely new, and my  perception that they’ve become more common and intense may be colored by my  analytical priors So you’ll certainly want to check them against your own  impressions   Switching gears, however, and looking directly at prices for the signs of  mounting inflationary pressure, the data again are mixed Awkwardly, the  October CPI isn’t coming out until tomorrow Like private analysts, we’re  expecting that both the total and core indexes will post increases on the order of a  quarter percent--something that would not alter significantly the recent trends in     11/16/99 12   either measure One question is which measure to regard as most informative  about the prospective trends, and I’ll repeat the thought I conveyed at the last  meeting that we should not focus entirely on the more subdued core index  People and firms do buy energy products, and the rise in oil prices this year is  likely to leave its mark on wages and core prices going forward In this regard,  the spurt in crude prices in the past few days is scarcely good news   But there are other indications as well that inflationary forces may be  intensifying The prices of non-oil imports have continued to rise, and this  probably has contributed to the further noticeable increase in the core crude and  intermediate PPIs Manufacturers of final goods and retailers still complain that  they lack pricing leverage, but these developments in the pipeline would seem to  heighten the likelihood of at least some up-drift in inflation   Broadening the perspective a bit, I might say a few words about inflation in  assets--a popular theme in some circles these days I won’t return to the matter of  the stock market; nor will I talk about what has been happening in the rarified  world of the art auction houses Rather, I’ll focus on the houses we live in The  latest numbers for house prices--the Freddie Mac repeat sales index and the  Census constant quality new home index--show accelerated increases of about 6  percent over the past year It isn’t at all obvious that this is a reflection of  increased inflation expectations; indeed, judging by the responses to the Michigan  SRC survey, people haven’t been buying because they view homes as an  especially good investment In the main, I think we’re simply seeing the kind of  relative price movement that occurs in a market where demand, driven by strong  gains in jobs, income, and stock market wealth, is pressing on what is an inelastic  short-run supply of land, labor, and materials   But, even if these price increases don’t reflect heightened inflationary  expectations per se, they’re not irrelevant to the outlook It is likely that the  higher house prices will show through at some point in the CPI through higher  owners’ equivalent rents And the price increases can themselves contribute to an  inflationary psychology Certainly, rising prices on reproducible assets like  houses tend to spur more investment activity in the future and add to the general  strength of demand--as may the increases in wealth enjoyed by the owners of the  assets As I’ve noted, this is not an economy in need of more positive wealth  effects on demand   This brings me to a final observation There has also been a lot of discussion  recently about the internal and external saving imbalances in the economy The  NIPA revisions shuffled things around a bit, but the basic contours remain the  same The personal saving rate has plummeted in this decade; the private saving- investment balance has swung sharply into the negative, the counterpart being a  considerable run-up in business and household debt that might someday prove  burdensome; and we’ve opened up a big current account deficit, mirrored in a  rapid growth of external liabilities that might weigh on the dollar     11/16/99 13   These patterns reflect a complex set of forces, one that I fear is beyond the  state of the art to sort out But it seems likely that part of the story is the  “crowding in” of private investment by the shift in the federal budget, some of  which has been structural Another element undoubtedly is the recent slump in  emerging market economies and the attraction of the United States and US dollar  assets as a safe haven Probably the central question for you is to what extent  these so-called “imbalances” are reflective of an unsustainable cyclical boom  fostered by excessive financial ease   This, of course, just brings us back to the same fundamental issues I was  discussing earlier In essence, the ex post saving-investment balances don’t seem  to add much to the picture; they simply provide a different vantage point on the  matter before you    That is a good question and one to which I do not have a precise   answer We do not anticipate a plummeting in oil prices; we have a gradual decline over the two   years The level clearly has moved up since we established our assumption; oil prices rose after   the Greenbook was published There is still a downward tilt in the futures markets, though   maybe not quite as sharp as there had been earlier The futures price is still pretty high for the   next several months But if the prices were to remain where they are now, it would add at least a   little to the core inflation rate, particularly in 2001 I do not think it would create a night-and-day   difference in the inflation outlook    This is not going to materially affect the additional-­   Yes    I think if potential had been as low as we previously had been gauging   it--this gets a little confusing because we have changed the books here--one might have     11/16/99 16   wondered why the unemployment rate had not fallen more So I think this does fit And indeed   we have reestimated our Okun’s Law relationship and feel reasonably comfortable with the   conformity of our assumptions with what has occurred in terms of the movement in the   unemployment rate    Yes It wasn’t a really big problem, but it does seem to be compatible   with our assumptions Indeed, it is even compatible with Okun’s Law relationships that are   estimated from the income side of the national accounts There doesn’t seem to be a great   mystery in that respect The little uptick in labor force participation rates we have had recently is   a bit of a comfort in terms of our understanding of the basic dynamics in the labor market We   don’t feel too uncomfortable with things in that regard    Mr Chairman, could I make a minor suggestion?    You referred to the firming of conditions in our financial markets “over   recent months,” and there’s been much discussion about the slight easing recently So if you   changed that to “over the course of the year” or something like that, the wording might accord   better with the facts    Throw them in the middle of the table!   SPEAKER(?) Pass them to me  "
6314,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman   If I were to put the Greenbook in a seasonal nutshell, I suppose I  would say that we’ve brought you tidings of great joy, but maybe not great  comfort   In broad macro terms, the economy has been performing splendidly  Though we can’t be especially confident at this point, it looks as if real  GDP growth in the current quarter will be close to 5 percent, at an annual  rate If so, 1999 would be the fourth year running of growth of 4 percent  or more With job gains still strong, we’ve now enjoyed three straight  years of average unemployment rates below 5 percent The chain index  for GDP prices has increased less than 2 percent for four consecutive  years   Moreover, the outlook as described in our baseline forecast is almost  as good GDP growth is projected to fall a little short of the 4 percent  mark over the next two years But the unemployment rate is expected to  remain near 4 percent and GDP price increases below 2 percent This is  among the most upbeat forecasts for the US economy that you’ll find  today   So, if we’re right, the basis for joy is pretty clear You’ve entered  Humphrey-Hawkins heaven Unfortunately, you haven’t been granted  unconditional permanent residency there, and this is where the comfort  side of the story comes in We believe that the economy may be getting  seriously overheated and in some ways significantly distorted   This Committee has, of course, announced its focus on the mounting  pressures in the labor market as the most likely potential source of  deteriorating inflation performance and thus cyclical instability But,  though there’s a near consensus among employers that qualified workers  are terribly scarce, the official data actually show decelerating wages I’ll  make just three quick comments on this dissonance   First, we continue to think that the wage deceleration this year owes  considerably to the downside surprise in price inflation that occurred last  year when oil prices plummeted; on this view, this year’s pickup in prices  should be showing through in wages over coming quarters Second,  judging by the nonfarm compensation figures--though not by the less  inclusive ECI--real wages (deflated by product prices) have been     12/21/99 9   increasing quite substantially even this year But, third, none of the  official pay series seems equipped to provide an accurate reading on labor  costs in today’s world where plain vanilla wages are becoming less  important relative to many other components, including deferred--and less  certain--compensation in the form of stock and stock options This latter  point is underscored by the stream of stories about people passing up big  salaries to go to young firms offering equity lottery tickets and about  established companies restructuring themselves so that they can compete  on those terms This suggests that the linkage between compensation  changes and price pressures--never an especially tight and predictable one  --has become even more problematic   Given these vagaries of the wage picture and its interpretation, and on  the thought that the proof of the inflation pudding might be in the eating,  perhaps we should simply ask whether there’s any evidence that prices  themselves are beginning to accelerate I would say that there is some  evidence, though it may not yet be compelling   Certainly, we’ve seen an upturn in core PPI crude and intermediate  goods prices At the same time, and helping to explain the acceleration of  the PPI pipeline measures, the prices of non-oil imports (ex computers and  semiconductors) have begun inching up as the dollar has stopped  appreciating on a broad basis and as foreign economies have recovered  At the final goods and services level, with some greater firmness in the  monthly figures of late, the core CPI has edged a couple of tenths above  its low on a twelve-month change basis   And, of course, as I’ve noted repeatedly, overall consumer prices  have accelerated noticeably this year with the run-up in the cost of crude  oil, something that may provide some momentum to inflation in the near  term One way in which that could occur is via expectations, and  households’ short-term inflation expectations do appear to have risen  some this year It might also be noted that the latest semi-annual NAPM  survey showed purchasing managers expressing somewhat greater concern  about increasing costs and inflation in 2000   All of this may well be stretching the point statistically, but I think  it’s worth sounding a note of caution that strong productivity gains and  intense competition--even accelerating productivity and intensifying  competition--do not by themselves ensure that there can be no step-up in  inflation Unless supply is completely elastic, which seems unlikely in the  short run, demand can become excessive   That, we fear, is the current situation, with the rising stock market  overriding the effects of monetary tightening Once again in recent weeks,  the market has defied our notions of valuation gravity by posting an     12/21/99 10   appreciable further advance Moreover, it has done so in a way that seems  to highlight the risk that it will continue doing so I refer to the incredible  run-up in “tech” and e-commerce stocks, some of which have entered the  big-cap realm without ever earning a buck   To illustrate the speculative character of the market, let me cite an  excerpt from a recent IPO prospectus “We incurred losses of $145  million in fiscal 1999 primarily due to expansion of our operations, and  we had an accumulated deficit of $150 million as of July 31, 1999 We  expect to continue to incur significantexpenses, particularly as a result of  expanding our direct sales force… We do not expect to generate sufficient  revenues to achieve profitability and, therefore, we expect to continue to  incur net losses for at least the foreseeable future  If we do achieve  profitability, we may not be able to sustain it” Based on these prospects,  the VA Linux IPO recorded a first-day price gain of about 700 percent and  has a market cap of roughly $9 billion Not bad for a company that some  analysts say has no hold on any significant technology   The warning language I’ve just read is at least an improvement in  disclosure compared to the classic prospectus of the South Sea Bubble era,  in which someone offered shares in “A company for carrying on an  undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is” But, I  wonder whether the spirit of the times isn’t becoming similar to that of the  earlier period Among other things, it may be noteworthy that the tech  stocks have done so well of late in the face of rising interest rates Earlier  this year, those stocks supposedly were damaged when rates rose, because,  people said, quite logically, that the present values of their distant earnings  were greatly affected by the rising discount factor At this point, those  same people are abandoning all efforts at fundamental analysis and talking  about momentum as the only thing that matters   If this speculation were occurring on a scale that wasn’t lifting the  overall market, it might be of concern only for the distortions in resource  allocation it might be causing But it has in fact been giving rise to  significant gains in household wealth and thereby contributing to the rapid  growth of consumer demand--something reflected in the internal and  external saving imbalances that are much discussed in some circles  Whether our assumed 75 basis point increase in the fed funds rate would  be a sufficient shock to halt this financial locomotive is open to question   A model simulation in the Greenbook gave some sense of what might  happen if the stock market shrugged off that further tightening and  continued rising But another factor that will help determine just how  much policy restraint is needed is what happens in the rest of the world  economy, and Karen has a few words to say about the risks in that regard     12/21/99 11    Well, no one has had a particularly good track record on forecasting   auto sales this year Even the automobile manufacturers themselves, I think, have been   quite surprised by the high level of sales Our forecast of overall economic activity is, as I   suggested, in the upper brackets of forecasts that one would find at this point and auto sales     12/21/99 13   are a cyclically sensitive sector of the economy I think therein lies a very important   element of explanation I don’t think there is much more that I can say on this We consult   a number of models, and they give somewhat different results about the likely pattern of   auto demand over the next couple of years But as we look back at recent experience--at   how much sales seemed to be above reasonable trends in the past two or three years--we   don’t see a compelling case for a precipitous decline from here, especially in a   fundamentally strong economic environment    I’m not sure that I can provide a very good direct answer to the   question of sensitivity to policy actions We have looked to see whether the responses--in   terms of long-term rate movements and so on--to changes in the funds rate are different   now I think there may be some small amount of evidence supporting that thesis    I should say that one of the nice features of our model is the ability to   change the expectations formation mechanisms And the one that we have used in doing   these simulations is a very simple, small model that is supposed to capture the way people   will react to a certain set of variables  It isn’t a fully consistent model of expectations in that   we are not taking a full rational expectations kind of approach That would be another way   of doing this This is one of the areas of active continuing research, and conceivably there   could be some changes in this small model in the not-too-distant future that would perhaps   enrich that a bit One of the things that we have pointed out repeatedly in the presentation   of our simulations is the difference in the effect of lower interest rates versus higher stock   prices for the inflation outcome That’s because the interest rate change induced by   monetary policy is affecting people’s inflation expectations to a greater degree than the   higher stock prices, even though they both create more aggregate demand So, this is one of   the areas that I think we need to work on a bit further in an effort to come up with something   that would be a little more realistic    We have a government sector to account for and I think that is   probably the--    12/21/99 15    I don’t think there is a particularly good way And I’m not sure, in   fact, whether in the real world we don’t have a mixture of both occurring In a mechanical   way we have cost of living adjustments in various contracts, so that is clearly backward-  looking I would think that in many informal wage adjustment systems people are looking   at what has happened to the CPI over the past year or some other recent period to get a sense   of what might be an appropriate wage increase In other instances, people may be more   forward-looking and the question is how they shape those expectations We have tried to   capture that econometrically in various ways by using lagged prices, survey measures, and   so on I don’t think we can really separate the two in a clear way    We have looked at how robust those estimates are, examining   different estimation periods and so on, and one would find some variation in that respect   On a priori grounds, one might think that this effect would not necessarily be perfectly   stable over time as the demographic distribution of wealth changes If more of the wealth   was held by people with shorter expected remaining life spans and there was not a strong   bequest motive, one would think the coefficient would go up because people would be   spending that wealth more quickly If younger people are getting wealthy and they spread   the spending over a lifetime, one would expect the coefficient to go down I think there are   any number of reasons to expect that the coefficient is not going to be perfectly stable    They have to find some workers to do the census! [Laughter]  "
6337,2000-02-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I almost hesitate to refer you to this rather   tame set of charts after the abundance of color you have just seen  But this is what we have!  2   Chart 1 summarizes our forecast  But, before I get into the numbers  here, I should take note of some late-breaking news  First was the upside  surprise in the BEA’s advance estimate of fourth-quarter GDP, published on  Friday  The 58 percent real output increase exceeded our guess by about a  half point  However, we decided not to redo the forecast and to go with the  Greenbook numbers for this presentation  This wasn’t simply for the sake  of convenience  To be sure, BEA knew more about the fine detail of the  fourth-quarter data than we did, but the key differences between their  estimate and ours related mainly to assumptions about missing numbers    And we were reasonably content to stick with ours for the time being     We would have said that if BEA’s estimates proved closer to the mark,   it would have tended to argue for weaker GDP growth in the near term than  we forecast, with lesser contributions from defense purchases and inventory  investment  This morning’s release on construction put in place in  December has reinforced that argument  Construction spending now                                                               2  A copy of the charts used by Mr Prell, Ms Johnson, and Mr Stockton are appended to this transcript     (Appendix 2)          16  appears to have been stronger than either BEA or we anticipated, especially  in the state and local sector, where good weather may have given a  temporary boost to building         All things considered, however, our basic assessment still would be   that the economy is running strong enough that--absent a considerable  further tightening of financial conditions--pressures on resources will  intensify over the projection period  We’ve assumed, though, an increase in  the fed funds rate of about a point and a quarter by this fall, and on that basis  we’re projecting that real GDP will grow in the vicinity of 4 percent this  year and next  As you can see in the upper panels, we are anticipating that  domestic spending will decelerate appreciably; however, that is largely  offset by a lessening of the negative contribution to GDP growth from the  trade sector      With potential output rising at about the same pace as actual GDP, we   expect that the unemployment rate--in the middle panel--will remain near  the recent level, in the vicinity of 4 percent     The tightness of the labor market and other factors suggest that   inflation will generally be tending to move higher, but we’re projecting that  the price of crude oil will decline and damp the rise in overall consumer  inflation this year and next  As you can see in the bottom panels--most  easily in the table--we have PCE prices rising 2 percent, the same as in  1999, while the CPI rise slows a bit from last year’s pace  I have also  included in the chart, as the red line, a plot of the “current-methods” version  of the CPI, for those who might wish to make historical comparisons for that  series on a more consistent basis     With that overview, let’s turn to the guts of the forecast  Chart 2   explores the financial backdrop  The top left panel shows the P/E for the  S&P 500, but with the index broken into two components the top 50 by  market cap in each period, and the remaining 450  This may be a dubious  analytical device in some respects; however, it does illustrate that, while  investors’ craving for big-cap growth stocks--especially “tech” stocks--has  lifted the favored few to very high P/Es, even the rest of the index has  enjoyed a considerable valuation boost  The result is that, at this  aggregative level, nothing looks especially cheap by historical standards-- even when the P/Es are measured, as they are here, in terms of the rosy  earnings forecasts of security analysts  We don’t have the earnings forecasts  for the full set of NASDAQ stocks, but I’m confident that, if we did, the P/E  rise for them would be only a little less startling than that shown on the basis  of trailing 12-month earnings in the right panel              17  I won’t belabor the point, but we continue to believe that the  valuations are unrealistic and that this creates the risk of a large downward  adjustment  However, we also recognize that it is impossible to predict  when the bubble--if that’s what it is--will stop expanding, let alone burst   Therefore, once again, we’ve taken a sort of middle position, anticipating  that stock prices simply will fluctuate around their January average as the  Fed tightens and earnings growth disappoints  That would leave price- earnings multiples not far below their recent peaks; by that measure, equity  capital would remain relatively cheap, but it probably wouldn’t be an  environment in which the new issue market was quite so receptive     In the credit markets, the alternative measures in the middle left panel   both show that real 10-year Treasury yields have moved up considerably in  the past year or so  And the prevailing real rate levels are not low by the  standards of the past decade and a half  But, if you buy our analysis of  productivity trends, you might suspect that the equilibrium real rate has  risen in the latter half of the 1990s       In our forecast, we have nominal bond yields rising--to around 7   percent for longer-term Treasuries  This implies some flattening of the yield  curve, shown at the right; if, however, market participants should sense that  the Fed is not in the process of reining in the emerging step-up in core  inflation, such a flattening is less likely  We have, in effect, assumed that  longer-term inflation expectations will ratchet up only a little during the  projection period       Looking beyond the Treasury sector, the bottom panels suggest that   there has been some diminution in the froth in private credit markets since  the Russian and LTCM shocks of 1998  However, with Y2K concerns  removed, junk bond spreads have reversed a portion of their late-1998  widening--even as default rates have continued to rise  And banks, though  not reversing all of the tightening of business lending standards they did in  the wake of the 1998 turmoil, have not been firming aggressively since then;  by most reports, banks and other institutions continue to be actively seeking  lending opportunities  And we anticipate only a mild tightening of credit  availability over coming quarters because we don’t see an especially scary  deterioration in business or household debt repayment performance, given  the continuing high level of economic activity      In sum, we’re anticipating that financing conditions will become less   accommodative of demand growth but not harshly so    The most important element of restraint, as we see it, is the loss of   impetus to consumer spending from the stock market  As shown in the top  left panel of Chart 3, consumer sentiment according to the Michigan SRC          18  index has been trending upward since 1994  This has been a period of  strong growth in employment and income, and people have become  increasingly confident that the good times will continue to roll  The stock  market has both reflected and reinforced that sentiment  But, as indicated at  the right, our flat stock market path implies that the household wealth- income ratio will be falling  The wealth effect on consumption will  gradually move from positive to negative, and as may be seen at the middle  left, this (along with the dynamics of the accelerator effect for durables) is  expected to push PCE growth below that of disposable income by 2001     Soaring consumer confidence and wealth also have played a role in the   housing market  As you can see at the right, perceptions of homebuying  conditions, as reported in the SRC survey, have deteriorated as mortgage  rates have risen since the end of 1998  And, as shown at the lower left, the  combination of higher rates and rising house prices has raised the ratio of  the fixed-rate mortgage payment on a new home to personal income over  this time span  Some buyers have moderated the immediate cash-flow hit  by opting for adjustable rate loans, but this avenue will become less  attractive under our monetary policy assumption  With builders whittling  down their sizable backlogs of orders, we expect that housing starts-- especially singles--will be trending lower through 2001  However, with  home purchase still relatively affordable and people remaining quite  wealthy, we’re looking for only a mild contraction in residential  construction     Chart 4 examines the outlook for business investment  We’re   projecting that real spending on equipment and software will continue  growing rapidly, while the decline in outlays for nonresidential structures  seems likely to bottom out at some point in the next two years  At the right,  you can see that the net result is total BFI growth of around 10 percent, up  from 1999, but in line with the trend of recent years     As we indicated in the Greenbook, this might seem a remarkably   strong forecast, given the normal pattern of accelerator effects that is, with  output growing at a pretty steady pace for several years, one might have  looked for investment to weaken  However, that effect is overridden in our  projection by the ongoing decline in the relative price of equipment-- especially the sharp drop in computer prices shown in the middle left panel-- and by the increased contribution of replacement investment  As reflected  in the right panel, the increasing importance of investment in computers and  other short-lived items has caused the ratio of depreciation to the size of the  capital stock to rise rapidly in this decade, implying that more and more  gross investment is needed each year simply to replace old equipment and  software  The contribution of replacement investment to spending has risen          19  by several percentage points and is projected to account for more than half  of the increase in gross E&S outlays this year and next     As for inventories, in the bottom panels, we’re expecting that the   aggregate ratio of stocks to sales will drift lower as a consequence of  improved supply-chain management--and with some inducement from high  real interest rates  Nonfarm inventories are projected to grow a little more  than 4 percent per year--a shade faster than GDP on average, but a bit  slower than business sales     Turning to the final segment of domestic demand, Chart 5 offers some   perspectives on the outlook for the government sector  For the federal  government, the question is whether any of the ex ante on-budget surplus  will survive  As you can see from the lower black line in the upper left  panel, we have the on-budget surplus rising to nearly $50 billion in fiscal  2001  Our assumption--depicted at the upper right--is that discretionary  spending will be held at the higher real level reached in the current fiscal  year  In part, we made this assumption on the thought that Congress and the  Administration would be constrained by less optimistic official surplus  projections, such as that of the CBO shown at the left as the red line  But  the risk is that, before a deal has been inked, the budget outlook will shift in  our direction and there will be an irresistible temptation to add more  spending or cut taxes  If so, the fiscal impetus, which we see as essentially  zero next year on our assumption, will turn out to be positive, continuing the  pattern of 1999 and 2000     In the state and local sector, large budget surpluses also may prove a   temptation for more expansive fiscal postures  We are anticipating that the  aggregate surplus will be reduced somewhat by another year of cuts in state  income and sales taxes, shown at the right, and by a continuation of  relatively rapid growth in purchases        Karen will now examine the influence of the external sector on the   outlook for the economy       Just to wrap up quickly, the final chart summarizes the   forecasts you submitted  The central tendency for real GDP growth is 3-1/2  to 3-3/4 percent, somewhat below the Greenbook number, and you see no  significant change in the unemployment rate over the course of the year, as  is the case in our forecast  Your PCE price inflation forecast is a tad lower  than ours, with a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2 percent  We don’t yet have  the Administration’s forecast, to which we customarily compare yours in the  Humphrey-Hawkins report  My suspicion, however, is that the  Administration will be predicting less growth of GDP, with a weaker  productivity performance         That concludes our prepared remarks, Mr Chairman           30      It may just be that we are wild and crazy guys here!  [Laughter]      However, we tried to temper our wildness and do a little homework,   and I think Dave Stockton laid out the crux of our analysis  We’ve looked in particular at what   has been--and we expect will continue to be--rapid growth in the capital stock and the flow of   capital services  That growth does seem to have been paying off  We expect a sizable   contribution from capital deepening  We have assumed what would seem to be rather moderate   improvements in multifactor productivity, given recent performance  But there is a great deal of   uncertainty  And many forecasters are wrestling, as we are, with the question of how much of   the improvement in productivity is solid and permanent and how much reflects a transient   element, with businesses surprised by the strength of demand and thus pressing their available   resources very hard in the short run  If the improvement is more permanent than transient, they   are going to attempt to bring their work forces up into what might be considered a more normal          31  alignment with their production levels  And they may have difficulty doing that in this labor   market  But our assessment, as we look at the steadiness of the productivity gains in the last few   years and the ongoing acceleration, is that one should not attribute as much to the cyclical   elements of productivity performance as I think perhaps the average private forecaster has       I don’t have enough information on all of the individual forecasts to be   able to analyze these differences  I think the productivity assumption difference is part of the   story  It is propelling permanent income growth higher  It is affecting the stock market  Some   of the forecasts--Macro Advisors, for example, for which we have the explicit pieces--are still   anticipating a decline in stock prices, which we are not  In some instances I think these forecasts   do not have the same analysis of investments that we have, taking into account this large   component of replacement investment  Our investment forecast, I believe, is above the   consensus  And on housing we’re stronger than the consensus  Again, we’ve been above the   consensus for a while, partly on our analysis that there was a good backlog of orders and that   wealth effects might be significant  We think those conditions are still in place  So, on all   elements of private final demand we have a little stronger picture and a somewhat stronger view   of the underlying fundamentals in many instances  Now, some other folks have rising stock   prices and still have weaker demand  So it’s very hard to--      One can have different coefficients or a different view of the wealth   effects and so on  One can attribute less of the strength in consumption demand to normal   wealth effects and more to the spate of mortgage refinancing last year or to just erratic elements    We recognize that we are above the crowd but we are hard pressed, given our analysis, to come   to the conclusion that we should be materially lower at this point     I might just say, in terms of signs of strong demand, that we have   received a preliminary reading on January auto sales  And they seem to have come in at almost   18 million units--179 million--for light vehicles, which is well above the rate we are anticipating   for the first quarter  So that in combination with the construction data this morning means that   we’ve had two pieces of much stronger spending data than we had built into the Greenbook   forecast     In the short run the exchange rate dynamics exaggerate this response    That’s probably an important element in getting an effect this big     One of the things we have pointed out before repeatedly in these model   simulations is that the same output path generated through a different stock market assumption   versus a different monetary policy assumption will have much larger expectational effects in the   monetary policy case  It is quite plausible that if the Fed were perceived to be doing nothing in   the face of this decline in the unemployment rate and the acceleration in prices, people's inflation   expectations would be marked up considerably  So, that change in expectations would   exaggerate the effects in this kind of scenario  But this does generate a significant decline in the   dollar on exchange markets and that exacerbates the inflationary effect     This contradicts to some degree what I was saying earlier in my   comparison of various forecasts  But, if you look at outside forecasts, many of them have the net   export balance reaching a nadir sometime this year--either flattening out or turning  And they   have had this kind of pattern for a while  We have not been able to understand why, given our   analysis of the elasticities involved  Yet people still do seem to have this notion in their minds   that strength in these foreign economies will have this result or that our import elasticity isn’t as   strong as it seems to be     To underscore that point, I hope all of you saw the pre-FOMC briefing   from yesterday  Our multifactor productivity trend here pales by comparison to what has been   experienced in some long periods of this country's economic history  So that could well be a   component of a better productivity performance          But if one thought that this investment was merely the prelude to   putting in place more efficient operations and so on, one might say the payoff in multifactor   productivity still lies ahead  If one wants to be a new wave optimist here, it is certainly possible   to come up with stories in which the assumptions are more generous  We feel that we have a   reasonably balanced scenario in our baseline forecast, obviously  We are far more optimistic   than other forecasters by and large, and yet we think this is a sensible look at the prospects     Just to grab onto one more string, though, it is possible that the   buoyancy of the dollar has had something to do with what some might argue was a bubble   situation in the equity market  So people may have exaggerated ideas of the prospective returns   from these investments     Domestic and foreign investors  But foreigners are playing a role in   this, investing in what they perceive to be very, very profitable US ventures     In a sense the logic that is being applied here is the very logic that got   you to the current targets  It’s just recalibrating the targets to a new, longer-term trend     In each case, we’ve done little more than extrapolate the recent   experience for a near-term period  In thinking about what you might want to do if you adjusted   the ranges, one question would be your assumption about potential GDP growth  Would you   want to rest your assumption on the experience of the past few years--where the behavior of the   unemployment rate relative to GDP, for example, would seem consistent with potential output          93  growth somewhere in the 3-1/2 percent range or a little higher?  Or would you want to look   forward in the optimistic way that we have with an assumption of about 4 percent?     A few tenths came from the change     Sure     But forward-looking, relevant to thinking about the bias adjustment in   the price measure, if that were all that was going on, switching from one component to the other   in nominal GDP, then there would be a wash     Mr Chairman, may I make a couple of comments?  One is that I would   encourage people to look at most of these simulations in a broad sense, simply in a directional   sense  I think the message will carry even if one adjusts some of these coefficients significantly           113  On the question of the statistical discrepancy, many of the things that would be affected by that   would affect both the potential output and the aggregate demand side of the equation     If it is a matter of mismeasurement of output growth over the recent   period, then that is something we would need to recalibrate--both in terms of our estimate of   potential as well as actual growth     True     Actually, in this case we are assuming that the second derivative is   positive for the forecast period relative to the recent period and we are making no assumption   about it past 2001     That’s a very long-term assumption in the simulation, yes     I take a backseat to no one in terms of humility about these models, but   I just want to close a loop on one other thing so everyone understands what we have done in the   projection  This is getting into how the sausage is made  In fact, in balancing the income and   product sides of our forecast, we actually do have a continuing widening of the statistical   discrepancy  So that’s built into our baseline forecast through 2001  The model extension, in   effect, takes some of this on board because it is deriving the structure that is carried in the future   beyond 2001 based on the structure of the judgmental Greenbook forecast  "
6362,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman The economic picture  remains the same in many respects as it has been for some time  The  now record-long expansion has continued to outstrip most analysts’  expectations--including our own; meanwhile, inflation--apart from the  price of energy--has remained relatively low  Beneath these broad  trends, there’s the usual abundance of interesting sectoral details, but  sifting through them, as we did in the Greenbook, doesn’t seem to add  a great deal to the story  Certainly, it provides no clear indication as to  when this extraordinary performance might end              - 29 -       Obviously, a key element in the continuation of the favorable   pattern has been productivity  Just as the Chairman predicted, the  incoming data have prompted us to raise our sights on the pace of  structural improvements in output per hour  We’re now putting it at  32 percent per annum for the nonfarm business sector this year and  next--two-tenths more than the already elevated figure embedded in  our prior forecast  While the better than 7 percent fourth-quarter gain  in real GDP is to some extent suspect, even when we pare away the  questionable defense surge, we’re left with an impressive increase in  productivity for the year--close to 3-3/4 percent  Some of that  probably was cyclical, in the sense that it reflected a stretching of the  work force in a period of surging demand Anyone who went to a retail  establishment during the holiday shopping season and had to wait in a  check-out line will attest to that!  But we also think that the sustainable  improvements in efficiency coming from the use of more and better  capital equipment and from operational changes likely are coming at a  faster pace     The result has been an absolute decline in unit labor costs that   evidently has restored most of the squeeze in the profit share of GDP  that occurred as the world economy weakened in the wake of the  Asian crisis  At the same time, competitive pressures have translated a  portion of this reduction in costs into subdued core price inflation-- especially in goods markets, where at least physical plant capacity  remains ample here and abroad  The unmentioned factor in this  arithmetic is wages  It seems to me that the anecdotal accounts in the  Beigebook and elsewhere are telling us that it’s costing employers  more to hire and retain staff--if not in straight wages, then in bonuses,  stock options, and other fringe benefits  Still, the aggregate statistical  data we have in hand don’t reveal any significant pickup in the pace of  compensation increase  Perhaps it’s a reflection of the measurement  problems to which we’ve repeatedly called your attention  But, when  we look at the behavior of prices and profits, it really is rather difficult  to argue that the data have been giving us a misleading signal about  the general direction of labor costs     This is not to say, however, that there are no inflation risks in the   near-term outlook  It’s quite possible--indeed, in our view probable-- that the reports of compensation pressures will be mirrored in an  accelerating trend of wages and benefits in the coming months  Apart  from the tightness of the labor market, we would expect the now 3-1/4  percent year-on-year CPI inflation to show through in the wage-setting  process, and there are no signs of an abatement of the step-up in  medical insurance premiums              - 30 -       The run-up in oil prices was, of course, the major factor in the   CPI acceleration I just mentioned  We’re hopeful that the price of  crude has crested, but even if that’s so, there’s the possibility that-- apart from the wage effect--the increased cost of fuel and energy  inputs will begin to show through more than they have to date in the  prices of finished goods and services  There are many reports of  transport charges being raised, and the imprint of higher petroleum  costs is visible in a wide range of materials prices; but one is hard- pressed at this point to identify the pass-throughs at the consumer  level, aside from airfares  This is something that bears close watching,  however  And so, too, are indicators of inflation expectations; in this  regard, Friday’s preliminary results from the March Michigan SRC  survey, showing a noticeable rise in average short- and long-run price  expectations, may be a worrisome sign       Speaking of worry, the SRC survey also showed a drop-off in the   overall index of consumer sentiment  That said, though, people still  appeared to be in an extraordinarily good mood  And the downturn in  fuel prices that we’re anticipating will begin in a few months should  help buoy their spirits--and their real incomes  The moderation in  domestic demand in our forecast thus continues to hinge largely on the  influence of the less accommodative financial conditions that we’ve  anticipated       Peter has covered much of what has occurred of late in fixed-  income markets  I won’t subject you to another lengthy recitation of  my jaundiced view of what has been transpiring in the equity markets   I’ll just say that, despite some movement toward reconvergence in  recent days of “old economy” and “new economy” stocks, I still find  the valuations of many so-called tech companies--and the rationales  analysts give for them--rather wacky  The fact is, though, that at  yesterday’s close the Wilshire 5000 was up fully 4 percent from the  13,500 level prevailing a week ago, when we locked into our  Greenbook assumption of a flat stock market through the projection  period  Whether this is just noise or a significant signal of a different  direction for the equity market than we’ve assumed, I’ll leave for you  to judge  As you know, we’ve judged that it could well take a  substantial further increase in the fed funds rate to raise bond yields  appreciably and hold the stock market down       It’s possible that consumer demand will soften even if share prices   exceed our expectations; there undoubtedly have been some accelerator- type effects at work in the case of homes, motor vehicles, and other  durables, and these could abate more quickly than we have anticipated               - 31 -     But we remain persuaded--even if some other analysts are not--that  lagged wealth effects are important, and so we would expect that,  barring a sizable stock market correction in the near future, the tendency  will be for household spending to remain robust  Abundant capital that  is viewed as cheap relative to the anticipated return is also supporting  business investment  Consequently, we think that a considerable  tightening of financial market conditions is likely to be needed if this  economy is not to overheat more as a stronger rest-of-the-world  economy begins to leave its mark on our trade balance over coming  quarters     With that set-up, let me turn the floor over to Karen       Real rates have been more difficult to gauge than usual in this period   because of the distortions, if I can put it that way, that have occurred in the fixed-income market    We've seen Treasury yields come down substantially, while movements in others rates have been   something of a mixed bag  But in many cases long-term rates have actually come down a bit and   run below our expectations  In terms of inflation expectations, there are some hints--but only              - 35 -     some--of an upward movement, largely in response to what has been occurring in the oil market    And there are some counter indications, too  The TIP spread, for example, certainly hasn't been   moving up lately  Again, that might be confounded by the Treasury market illiquidity   So it is   rather difficult to gauge  Bottom line, we felt that while the stock market seemed to be on the   track we were anticipating--at least up until the time we fixed the number for our assumption   here--interest rate developments certainly were not on the tighter side of what we were   anticipating  The economy was showing more momentum coming into the year  And we felt   that some greater tightening of policy probably would be required to keep aggregate demand and   supply in a balance similar to what we had in the prior forecast  At this point, we have what I   would perceive to be a rather similar degree of tightening in the real funds rate because we do   have a somewhat higher inflation path  We have added only a 1/4 point on the funds rate  We   have long-term rates going up more than before in the corporate market, in part because my   sense was that we really had too much yield curve flattening before and more tightening will be   needed in the long end  Perhaps it will take more tightening in the short end in order to impose   an upward restraint on the economy and bring aggregate demand and supply back into balance       It’s not a major change  I'd say, on balance, that the picture might be a   little tighter in terms of the overall fixed-income market assumptions     I’m not sure which numbers you are looking at  The faster productivity   growth simulation has substantially higher real GDP growth; it’s 08 percentage point higher in   2000 and 14 percentage points more in 2001  So nominal GDP growth is much more rapid in   the high productivity simulation     Yes, I’m seeing that  I perceive this as a situation where policy is very   accommodative  It is taking this favorable shock in significant part through higher output and a              - 37 -     downward movement in the unemployment rate  Over time we will find ourselves in the   situation where the labor market has gotten tighter  People will perceive that they have not been   getting their share of this faster growth of the pie and there will be a tendency for inflation to   pick up  And thus you will need to tighten monetary policy significantly relative to the baseline   path  This simulation is generated by the exact same model that generated the other simulations    It is the same story we've told all along  That you have a choice in the short run of how to   respond--how much you are going to take in lower unemployment or how much you might take   in a permanent lowering of the inflation path by holding the line on resource utilization with a   prompt tightening of policy       Yes, that is almost always the case in these exercises       For us, the basic rule is that in the long run monetary policy is going to   determine the inflation rate  If you wanted to achieve the baseline path--while you might have to   be fleet of foot here in adjusting policy--presumably you could do it  But you would have to   move promptly or else you will get this short-run dynamic     It is a very complex question, and I'll try to be as brief as possible  Let   me cite our basic premises  One is that real interest rates and financial conditions in general are   not evidently so tight as to be very restraining on the growth of aggregate demand  I think what   we have been observing in the performance of the economy is consistent with that  Second, we   do believe--more so than was the case a few years ago--that we are in a period in which   productivity growth has improved and may well improve somewhat further in a fundamental and   sustainable fashion  And that may be giving us some favorable short-term dynamics in the sense   of an effective lowering of the NAIRU in the short run  The third basic point is that we think the   labor markets are unsustainably tight  If we were to maintain labor markets as taut as they are   now, we think that over time--and fairly soon--we would begin to see the real wage pressures   creep into the actual outcomes for compensation growth  And we believe that would tend to put   upward pressure on unit labor costs and ultimately on prices   But there are uncertainties in all of these  And what these simulations hopefully were   going to help you assess was what the outcome might be if one were more optimistic about some   of the assumptions  One might look, say, at the period since the middle of last year--when the   economy has grown very rapidly and we've seen a sustained low core inflation rate and a              - 39 -     relatively stable unemployment rate--and view that as consistent with even higher productivity   growth than we’ve put in this alternative simulation  Or we could be seeing the results of an   even lower NAIRU than we have contemplated  Is 4 percent a sustainable unemployment rate?    We don't have a way of answering that question  We've wrestled with this  We've looked at how   much can be explained by various models on alternative assumptions and so on, and this is our   best guess  But we can't by any means rule out more optimistic views of the current thrust of   productivity or of sustainable lower levels of unemployment  We are pretty sure that current   financial market conditions are reasonably supportive of an expansion of household and business   spending  There is no shortage of credit available  There are still people willing to throw money   at IPOs to finance just about any idea that anyone can come up with  Moreover, the cost of   equity capital seems to be very low for many firms and there are only hints that the rise in   mortgage rates has begun to bite on housing, the most interest-sensitive segment of demand     I don't think the B2B Internet connection story has been a very big   factor to date  There have been closer connections between firms and their suppliers for a while    It is an ongoing process that has employed various technologies  Our sense is simply that this              - 40 -     isn't just talk--that many firms are entering into B2B Internet arrangements that will facilitate a   continuation of this process  It will enable them to have tighter control over inventories and   continue the downward trend that has emerged in the inventory-sales ratios in the last few years       It's using a somewhat different technology, one that has more   flexibility  It seems to be enveloping an increasing proportion of our business firms     Mr Chairman, may I just put in an informational note here?  I think the   ECI is designed to capture the kind of medical cost phenomenon you described, President   Jordan  It's very difficult, I suspect, to get it just right, but it may be one of the reasons why we   have not seen an acceleration of medical insurance costs in the ECI commensurate with the huge   price increases that we've heard businesses talk about  "
6382,2000-05-16,"   I’ve missed a few     Thank you    Vince will begin     As you know, two major statistical releases came   out this morning housing starts and the CPI  We’ve distributed a table  summarizing those reports     Total starts were up about 3 percent in April, reflecting a rebound   in multifamily units from March’s low level  That single-family starts  were stable, rather than falling off, runs counter to our expectation, but  the significance of that reading is called into question by a 6 percent  decline in permits  Thus, the pattern of indicators in this sector  continues to be ambiguous, with just hints that the residential building  cycle is about to turn down       As for the CPI, the overall index was flat and its core component   rose 02 percent last month  Food prices increased less than we  anticipated, but energy and core prices were in line with our  expectations--the latter admittedly with a surprising jump in the tobacco  category  The 12-month change in the core backed off to 22 percent,  after spiking to 24 percent last month  That number is the same as a  year ago, but still about a quarter point above the cyclical low      At this stage of our analysis, I don’t see anything in today’s news   that would require us to make any fundamental change in our Greenbook  forecast  If I were to summarize that forecast briefly, given my  imminent departure--and with apologies to Madame de Pompadour--it  could be apres moi le deluge  Maybe that’s just a tad overly dramatic,  but the picture we’ve painted of what lies ahead certainly is less  attractive than the landscape of the past few years     To be sure, our baseline projection is that, with only a moderate   policy tightening--just a little more than the markets already anticipate-- aggregate demand growth will slacken appreciably and overall PCE      22  inflation will run only in the low 2 percent area in 2001  But that result,  in our analysis, hinges on a flat stock market and a considerable decline  in oil prices--two notions to which the markets have proven notably  resistant in the few days since the Greenbook went to press  And,  importantly, our baseline projection indicates that, as you exit 2001,  you’ll find yourselves confronted with still extremely tight labor markets  and an uptrend in core inflation      We, of course, offered a simple solution to the projected inflation   problem in one of our alternative scenarios a bigger rise in short-term  interest rates  The model simulation suggested that, if our baseline is  correct, then a sharper elevation of the funds rate, to 8 percent by year- end, would check the pickup of core inflation  Indeed, this scenario  might be characterized as akin to the “reverse soft landing” that has been  mentioned so often  Another, perhaps less appealing, way to describe it  would be a “growth recession”       The central point is that we think the signs are clearer now that the   labor markets have become unsustainably tight and that an appreciable  rise in the unemployment rate probably will be required to hang onto the  bulk of the disinflation progress that you’ve made in recent years     If our analysis is correct, even a further escalation of productivity   growth will only postpone the day of reckoning  As productivity  accelerates, you may get a temporary lowering of the effective NAIRU;  but once wages begin to catch up with the improvement in productivity,  the effective NAIRU will move back up and inflation will tend to rise   To be sure, it’s possible that the longer-range natural rate has fallen, so  that we may not have to see unemployment reach the level we would  once have thought necessary, but our guess is that the increase will have  to be noticeable  This is where an unhappy fact comes into the picture   There isn’t any precedent, at least in our modern economic history, for  realizing a substantial rise in our unemployment rate without a  recession--not just a growth recession, but a meaningful absolute decline  in activity     One may reasonably ask  Are we really destined to repeat history,   or might there be reason to hope that this time will be different?  I’m not  prepared today to offer you a full exposition of the ways in which the  cyclical conjuncture or the structure of the economy today might be  dissimilar from what it was in past episodes  I’ll offer a few, brief  comments, however       First, from the viewpoint of the simple macro model, there are no   logical grounds for ruling out the possibility of a fairly soft landing   One can envision a period of relatively slow--but continuously positive--     23  growth during which the pressures on resources are gradually relieved,  and inflation is contained and then brought back down  How far above  zero that growth might be on average would be a function of how large  the current output gap is and how high potential GDP growth is   Combine a low NAIRU and a high potential growth rate, and there could  be room for a distinctly positive expansion pace     But, backing away from the ethereal, it does seem as if our formal   models and even our judgmental analyses routinely fail to capture the  sorts of “nonlinearities” that come into play once the economy starts to  decelerate appreciably  Such phenomena could go a long way in  explaining why, when we’ve attempted to apply the brakes in past  expansions, we generally ended up skidding into the ditch      I think that at least part of the problem relates to the fragilities that   typically develop during the expansion phase of the business cycle  The  Chairman has, in effect, been addressing one source of such fragility in  his admonitions to bankers that they need to be more cautious  Loan  losses and capital impairment, their seeds having been sown in the  enthusiasms of the preceding boom, have often created credit crunches  that exacerbate the multiplier-accelerator effects damping private  investment  These difficulties can be especially great if banks and other  financial institutions have financed a construction boom, because an  overhang of supply in real estate markets--where the assets  collateralizing loans are immobile and long-lived--is not easily absorbed   At this point, I’d judge that the problems in this sphere aren’t as great as  they have been at some times in the past  And, if there are latent  problems, they may lie this time relatively less in the commercial area  and relatively more in the residential, where we haven’t had a cyclical  test of the underwriting standards that have made mortgage credit more  accessible in the past decade     I am still less sanguine about another asset market--that for   corporate equities  Share prices clearly are susceptible to exaggerated  swings as the balance of greed and fear tilts in a bearish direction--with  marked effects on the cost and availability of equity capital and on  household wealth  In the current cycle, there would seem to be a risk of  a particularly large decline in the market, given that, by many  conventional metrics, we’ve experienced a speculative bubble of  extraordinary proportions  The market-correction scenario in the  Greenbook--though involving a considerable, 25 percent decline from  the March peak for the Wilshire--may well understate the downside  potential here  But, even if you vastly increase the dimension of the  decline, our econometric model would still say you can avoid recession,  if you cushion the effects by backing off on your tightening          24  Is this realistic?  Maybe yes, maybe no  I certainly wouldn’t  question your nimbleness, but it could be challenging to gauge what is  required to avoid an undue weakening of demand and yet avoid igniting  another bull run  I personally am concerned, moreover, that consumer  sentiment could prove volatile  This hasn’t been much in evidence in  the past couple of months, perhaps because the NASDAQ slide reversed  gains that were enjoyed only briefly--and perhaps mainly by investors  who were riding what they must have recognized was a wild wave  But  I suspect that in recent years many households have been lulled into  complacency about the adequacy of their savings by the run-up in share  prices and that a major shrinkage of their nest eggs would severely dent  their spirits  On the other hand, though, it isn’t clear that we have seen  outsized wealth effects on the up side as consumers’ spirits have soared,  so perhaps we need not be greatly concerned about the consequences on  the down side      I’d be remiss if I did not mention one other likely reason that soft   landings have proven elusive  That is that, in part because of the lags in  the effects of interest rate increases and our foggy crystal balls, we  probably have had a tendency to tighten too much or too long  This  undoubtedly would be an argument of those who would caution against  more aggressive tightening action right now, with the effects of your  first five policy actions still in the pipeline  However, I would raise the  question whether that pipeline has not sprung a leak, draining off some  of the restraint; I refer, of course, to the considerable further increase in  share prices, on net, since you began your sequence       This, to be sure, is not a comprehensive assessment of the risks   that lie ahead  Vince noted the potential ramifications of our external  imbalance  The interactions of all these forces could be complex and  certainly are impossible to foresee  However, I don’t think this adds up  to a prescription of hesitation in the move toward greater monetary  restraint  Indeed, one might argue that the pattern of too much, too long  that I noted a moment ago has been a byproduct of doing too little early  enough  The bottom line judgment I would offer is that, if anything, the  news of the intermeeting period has highlighted the basic imbalances in  the economy that probably will become more serious and more difficult  to deal with if aggregate demand is not reined in at least moderately   And I don’t think you can depend on the markets to do the work without  your participation  That concludes our remarks, Mr Chairman         It certainly wouldn't justify it, but one would hope that by getting   ahead of the curve, to use the parlance--      Presumably you never want to overreact       But as one perhaps gets frustrated in not seeing the desired response   and as the problem seems to be getting worse because inflation lags the changes in the output   gap, there is probably always going to be a risk of overstaying on the tight side     We get inflation continuing on up  This is all finely calibrated   through our judgmental forecast and then what the model produces, which is this upward   trend in inflation  Part of the problem in that scenario is that the funds rate is stable at 7-1/4   percent and thus it begins to decline in real terms  In essence you begin to have less and less   restraint and you're accommodating an acceleration of inflation  It so happens that running   the exercise with our model and holding the funds rate steady at 8 percent avoids that problem      26  and you have a stable inflation path  In fact, a couple of years down the road you probably   will find that the unemployment rate is drifting up above the steady state of the NAIRU and   you will need to begin to ease policy in order to avoid overshooting on the disinflation  But   how far you want to go down this road depends in part on where you want to end up  If you   want to end up at 2 percent core PCE inflation, then this 8 percent scenario might fit the bill    If you want to get inflation down closer to what we think is true price stability, that tighter   scenario and related output gap may need to be there for a while     Well, I'll confess that we did not extend the flat funds rate scenario to   the out years, but I certainly anticipate that it would be a much worse looking picture  The   extension of the 7-1/4 percent funds rate in our model extrapolation--and this involves some   extrapolation of the baseline forecast to begin with--results in inflation by 2002 moving into   the 3 percent area on core PCE     First, I would caution against taking any of these numbers as   seriously as we seem to be doing here     That’s a caveat I would issue about these long-run simulations, let   alone the shorter-run forecast  I guess I'd say that as we assess the trends in aggregate demand   and take as given certain features of the external environment, we don't see 7-1/4 percent as   doing the job of capping inflation  Now, if you were trying to figure out what strategy to      29  adopt if you had to make a decision today on where to move the funds rate by the end of the   year, I'd certainly characterize the 7-1/4 percent as a more cautious approach  That strategy   lowers the risk of so sharp a deceleration in the economy that you begin to set off the   momentum of these nonlinearities  But this conclusion is very speculative, and shocks could   come along that would significantly alter the picture  It is a gentler policy  Whether it's   kinder in the long run [Laughter] depends on how things evolve  If it merely delays what you   feel is going to be needed to catch up, thus producing a more violent response, it would not be   kinder in the end     No, definitely not  That is our thesis  As for whether it is correct or   not, I can't provide any guarantees        It is an installment, but we think you are going to need more   installments down the road to really hold the line on inflation  Inflation will be tending to   drift up as you move through the forecast horizon     Well, my concern--particularly in light of the developments in the   last few days--is that the markets are entirely too comfortable with the policy of gradual   increases in the funds rate  We may find that the stock market continues to trend upward and   we do not get the negative wealth effect that we have in our forecast, but rather a neutral or      30  positive wealth effect  That would create an aggregate demand picture that was much less   compatible with holding the line on inflation  So I would identify that risk  Vince identified   the risk that at some point the dollar could have a more precipitous decline, and obviously that   would exacerbate the pressures on domestic resources  I don't want to paint the picture as   completely asymmetric because, as I also suggested, the market might be vulnerable to a   significant reversal if the basic, positive psychology is shaken by some event  Who knows?    In that case the dollar still might look like the place to be  So, there are risks on both sides     Clearer!     We were expecting 5 percent nominal     We’ve made a few mistakes in the past!  [Laughter]  So we could be   making a mistake this time  We could be making a mistake this time even if we had been   perfect in the past  But in essence our judgment is that the rise in interest rates has to some   extent reflected the pressures of an extraordinary expansion in aggregate demand that is in      32  part a product of the run-up in stock prices  And, in all likelihood, it’s also partly a reflection   of an adjustment to a higher potential growth rate that has come with an acceleration of   productivity  As we look at what has been an accelerating pattern of economic expansion, it   seems to us that we probably have not moved interest rates up enough to curb that   acceleration of aggregate demand and real growth  So, we believe that we need to move rates   up still further for a period in order to rein in this expansion somewhat and restore a balance   between aggregate supply and demand  Whether rates will have to go as high as we forecast   and remain that high is difficult to say  Fiscal policy developments could play a role in   determining that  But this forecast is our best shot  And it's not one that is grossly at odds   with what the market seems to be anticipating, with one exception  And that is that we are   looking for a significant further rise in nominal bond yields because we don't think the market   really has built in this upward trend in inflation that we believe is commencing  So as we look   forward, we expect there will be a need for a high real interest rate, and we anticipate that   inflation expectations are going to be deteriorating somewhat in the environment that we are   forecasting     Well, that is all folded in there  That is a reflection of the distributed   lag of those effects      35    Were it not for those lagged effects we'd have a negative effect this   year on balance  But we still have a good part of the effect of the 1999 rise in particular   impacting the economy this year     The stable stock market means that the ratio of wealth to income is   falling  And that's the indicator on which one would base an anticipated drag on consumption     In the first half of this year we are getting a substantial effect  But at   this point it is decaying and in the second half of this year it will have disappeared  We   expect to get a very large proportion of the effect within the first year and a half, and it   diminishes after that     Roughly a percentage point      36    No, basically it's pointing to levels of resource utilization  Whether   we look at the unemployment rate or industrial capacity utilization, in both cases the level of   utilization has been rising  So, by definition in essence, the growth of aggregate supply has   been less than the growth of aggregate demand      37   I guess I'm more comfortable putting it the way I did   And as you   noted, one could also point to evidence on the wage and price side that is confirming this   increasing pressure     I will take half a loaf!
