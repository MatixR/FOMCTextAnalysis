8428,2009-01-27," As shown in the top left panel of your first international exhibit,  equity prices in the advanced foreign and emerging-market economies have turned  down over the past couple of weeks amid very gloomy economic indicators and  intensified concerns about financial institutions  Bank stock prices, in the next panel,  have been especially hard hit As Trish and Spence noted earlier, strains in interbank  funding markets have eased on balance since your last meeting, despite deepening  concerns about the banking sector  As shown in the middle left panel, three-month  LIBOR–OIS spreads have continued their gradual descent  Demand for dollar  funding abroad appears to have eased following the turn of the year, as evidenced by  recent declines in outstanding draws from central bank liquidity swap facilities  With  a good chunk of these swaps currently having an original maturity of three months, it  will take some time for these draws to roll off even if funding pressures ease further   In foreign exchange markets (the bottom panels), the dollar dropped sharply  following the December cut in the federal funds rate target  But since that time, as it  has become increasingly clear that deteriorating conditions would lead foreign central  banks also to ease policy further, the dollar has reversed course and has appreciated  slightly on net over the intermeeting period  As shown in the bottom right, we  continue to project a modest depreciation of the dollar over the next couple of years,  but this reverses only a little of the late-2008 appreciation   The table at the top of your next exhibit summarizes our outlook for foreign  growth As shown on line 1, we estimate that total foreign GDP contracted at a pace  of 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter, the weakest quarterly reading in our thirty-eight­ year history of this series We expect foreign output to fall sharply again in the             January 27–28, 2009 93 of 267  current quarter  These figures are considerably weaker than in the December  projection, as incoming data, which we had expected to be grim, nonetheless  surprised us on the downside We continue to project foreign GDP to stabilize  toward the middle of the year and then to begin to recover as financial conditions  gradually improve, fiscal and monetary stimulus supports activity, and the US  economy regains its footing  Of course, there are downside risks to this view, and  data received in the past few days suggest that we may make additional downward  revisions to our near-term outlook One of the most striking recent developments has  been the very sharp drop in global manufacturing and international trade, as shown by  the plummeting purchasing managers indexes in the middle left panel  As  manufacturing is pro-cyclical, steep declines in output and trade should be expected  given the broader downturn  That said, for many countries the recent movements  have been breathtaking   The Japanese economy has been particularly hard hit  As shown in the middle  right panel, real exports have plummeted with the decline in foreign demand and the  appreciation of the yen Real household spending, while far from a source of  strength, has held up better As shown on line 4 of the table, we estimate that  Japanese GDP contracted at a 5¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter and expect that  GDP will keep shrinking until late this year  The euro area (line 5) is not faring much  better, with GDP contracting at a 2 percent pace in the fourth and first quarters  As  shown on the bottom left, industrial production in the euro area, as elsewhere, has  fallen sharply Retail sales have slumped but have not collapsed  The emerging  Asian economies (line 9) are taking a severe beating, with output contracting at a  6½ percent pace in the fourth quarter amid widespread declines in exports  Real GDP  in Korea and Singapore (not shown) plunged 21 percent and 16 percent, respectively,  and growth in China (line 10) came to a standstill  As indicated in the bottom right  panel, continued strength in Chinese retail sales has countered some of the weakness  in external demand, but growth in industrial production has fallen considerably  With  Chinese authorities taking strong measures to support the economy, we see growth  strengthening in the quarters ahead but remaining well below the 10 percent average  over the past decade   The weakness in the US and foreign economies has shown through to US trade  flows, the subject of your next exhibit As shown by the green line in the first panel,  our exports have dropped sharply  Imports, however, have dropped even more,  leading to a marked narrowing of the trade deficit in November, as indicated to the  right Much of this narrowing is attributable to the value of oil imports, which has  plummeted with the fall in oil prices  As shown on the middle left, imports have also  been held down by the decline in motor vehicle sales, which has led to a sharp slide in  automotive imports  Although we expect overall imports and exports to continue to  fall in the current quarter (as indicated by the dots), the drop in exports is tempered  somewhat by a projected rebound in aircraft exports  As shown in the middle right,  last autumn’s strike at Boeing and subsequent production delays resulted in a notable  drop in aircraft exports, which should be reversed  As shown on line 1 of the table,  we estimate that real exports plummeted at a 20 percent pace in the fourth quarter, a              January 27–28, 2009 94 of 267  much steeper rate of decline than previously projected and a very sharp reversal from  the strong performance seen earlier in the year  Our markdown to real import growth  has been nearly as large, resulting in a contribution of net exports to GDP (line 3) that  is down only about ½ percentage point in the fourth quarter from our December  projection, bringing it close to zero  We see trade continuing to contract in the  current quarter; but with the fall in imports exceeding that for exports, the net  contribution is projected to be positive Thereafter, however, the contribution of net  exports turns negative   Your next exhibit provides some historical context for this projection  As shown  by the red line in the top panel, the downturn in foreign growth that we anticipate is  similar in magnitude to the 1982 and 2001 episodes but is somewhat more persistent   As shown by the solid red bars in the middle panel, exports subtracted about  1 percentage point from US GDP growth in 1982 and 2001  Thus far in the current  episode, however, the contribution of exports to GDP is less negative, as the plunge  in exports at the end of last year followed robust growth in previous quarters  One  key difference in the current recession is the real value of the dollar  As shown in the  bottom panel, the dollar was relatively strong and on an upward trajectory heading  into the 1982 and 2001 downturns, providing additional restraint to exports  Leading  into the recent period, in contrast, the dollar was notably weaker and thus provided a  boost to exports  But with the dollar recently taking back some of its previous decline  and with foreign demand remaining depressed, exports are projected to decline again  this year, marking the first two-year consecutive decline in 50 years   Your next exhibit turns to commodity prices  As shown in the first panel, oil and  other commodity prices have plunged from their July peaks  These dramatic  movements have led some observers to conclude that speculators played a key role in  these price dynamics, particularly for oil Evidence for this hypothesis, however,  remains elusive  As shown in the top right, the two main villains in this story,  noncommercial traders (mainly hedge funds) and index investors, were reducing their  exposure to crude oil over the first half of 2008, when oil prices were surging  Over  the past couple of months, noncommercial traders have rebuilt their positions, even as  oil prices have continued to decline Moreover, the pattern of observed inventories is  not consistent with the speculation hypothesis  As shown in the middle left, US  crude oil inventories declined well below typical levels as prices were rising and hit a  low right as the oil price peaked Since then, inventories have moved up sharply,  reflecting the collapse in oil demand  As shown to the right, the growth of world oil  demand turned negative around the middle of last year  Emerging-market demand  decelerated sharply late in the year, leading to the biggest annual decline in global oil  use since the early 1980s In response to the downturn in demand, OPEC has  announced several production cuts in an effort to support prices  As indicated on the  bottom left, OPEC production (the red line) moved lower in the second half of last  year and will fall considerably further if the cartel complies with its January target   These production cuts are unlikely to lead to a quick turnaround in oil prices given  the large shock to demand  But over time (as shown on the bottom right), lower  production along with firming demand should contribute to higher oil prices, as                                                                                   3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   January 27–28, 2009 95 of 267  reflected in futures market quotes and our projections  Nonfuel commodity prices are  also expected to move up going forward, albeit more slowly than oil prices   Commodity price fluctuations have been a key driver of broader price  movements  As shown in the top left panel of your next exhibit, we project consumer  price inflation in the advanced foreign economies to continue to drop sharply from  elevated levels, largely reflecting swings in food and energy prices, although  increasing slack also plays a role  As shown in the middle left, inflation excluding  food and energy in the advanced foreign economies has moved in a much narrower  range At this point, the risks of a prolonged period of deflation appear small for  these economies, with Japan being the clear exception  As shown below, the central  banks of the advanced foreign economies have cut policy rates sharply in recent  months, and we expect a little additional easing going forward  Inflationary pressures  have also diminished sharply for the emerging Asian economies, as shown in the  middle right  For Latin America, however, inflation has remained elevated, partly as  a result of currency depreciation Consequently, monetary authorities have been  reluctant to ease policy while inflation concerns persist  Within the past two weeks,  however, both Brazil and Mexico have begun to lower policy rates, and we expect  additional easing in the coming months  Brian will now continue our presentation  "
8998,2011-06-21,"  Our forecast for solid growth abroad that Beth Anne just described  underpins our favorable outlook for US trade  As shown in the first panel of  exhibit 7, we expect real exports to expand at a robust 9 to 10 percent pace over the  projection period, with a good part of this growth reflecting the fall in the dollar since  its crisis-related run-up a few years ago   The lower dollar, along with subdued US demand, also provides some restraint  to real import growth (the blue line in the first panel)  In addition, imports are held  down in the current quarter by disruptions from Japan’s earthquake but then bounce  back  Smoothing through these disruptions, imports expand at a 4½ percent pace this  year and next  With exports outpacing imports, the external sector’s contribution to  US GDP growth, shown in the next panel, averages ½ percentage point though next  year   As illustrated by the blue bars in the lower-left panel, the recent depreciation of  the dollar has also pushed up US import prices  We see nonfuel import price  inflation falling from 7½ percent in the first half of this year to just 1½ percent next  year, reflecting slower dollar depreciation and, as shown in the final panel, a  projected leveling out of commodity prices   Since April, commodity prices have declined amid heightened concerns about  global growth; oil prices were down about $10 per barrel when we finalized the  Tealbook and have fallen further since  Following the repeated upward revisions to  our commodity price projections over the past two years, this recent downshift may  make our futures-based projection for flat prices seem less far-fetched  Nonetheless,  we recognize (and share) the widespread dismay with how poorly futures predict  commodity prices  Accordingly, the Division of International Finance has been  engaged in research to improve our commodity price forecasts  In the remainder of  my remarks, I’ll summarize our key results   The first panel of your next chart shows how futures markets missed the run-up in  oil prices from 2003 through 2008 by calling for prices to remain flat  But, as noted  to the right, flat futures curves should not come as a surprise  Through adjustments in  inventories, market participants can arbitrage between spot and futures prices, thus  embedding expectations for future supply and demand conditions in current spot  prices  For example, if futures prices are far above spot prices, it will be profitable to   June 21–22, 2011 78 of 282              buy the commodity in the spot market, store it, and sell it forward in the futures  market, thus tending to push spot prices up and futures prices down   There are limits to how far this arbitrage will flatten the futures curve, as the costs  and benefits of holding inventories create a wedge between spot and futures prices   When these costs or benefits are not large, futures curves will tend to be flat  In other  times, such as when inventory levels are very low or very high, futures curves can  have a significant tilt  And in these instances, we find that futures prices do better at  forecasting than a random walk   With commodity prices incorporating forward-looking information, the reason  futures missed the run-up in prices may be that markets were simply surprised by the  evolution of supply and demand  As shown in the middle-left panel, consensus  forecasts of industrial production in emerging Asia—a key source of commodity  demand over this period—were indeed revised up in step with the upward shifts in  commodity prices  And forecasts of world oil supply (not shown) tell a similar story  of repeated surprises, but to the downside  More generally, our empirical research  confirms that revisions to forecasts of economic growth explain commodity prices  better than growth itself   Based on these findings, we’ve devised a new approach for forecasting  commodity prices that begins with futures prices but adjusts them to account for the  extent to which we think markets will be surprised by the evolution of global growth   We predict these surprises as the difference between the staff’s forecast for global  activity and private-sector forecasts, then map these surprises into prices based on the  historical relationship between such surprises and commodity prices  As we have  also found the dollar to be informative for commodity prices, we include dollar  surprises in our adjustments as well   The lower panels show a few examples of the predictions this approach would  have generated in the past (the dashed lines), along with the forecasts from futures  prices for oil and our nonfuel commodity price index  The new approach delivers a  forecast that can vary noticeably from the futures path, sometimes for the better and  sometimes for the worse  Unfortunately, as noted in your next exhibit, this approach  does not deliver an improvement in forecasting accuracy  As shown on the right, its  root mean squared error over the past decade is actually a touch worse than a random  walk or futures—though the difference is small and not statistically significant   However, our proposed approach has two important advantages  First, it yields a  forecast that is more internally consistent with the staff’s Tealbook forecast  Second,  it helps us to characterize the risks to commodity prices  For example, in the middle- left panel, the flat forecast of oil prices generated by our new approach (the solid  black line) is almost the same as the futures curve used in the June Tealbook forecast  (the dashed line)  But in an alternative scenario, where world growth next year  exceeds market expectations by ½ percentage point, we would expect oil prices to  move up about 15 percent   June 21–22, 2011 79 of 282              We plan to implement this new framework on a trial basis starting in the August  Tealbook, although we will not blindly adhere to it if problems emerge  In addition,  we intend to continue our quest to better understand—and hopefully predict— commodity prices  Dan will now continue our presentation    That is right  We actually did a little bit better on the dollar than our   perception of outside forecasters, which we take to be, basically, a random walk, because   through most of that period we were projecting some modest depreciation; but we lost a little bit   on global growth    Well, actually that observation is a big reason that we retained futures as   our starting point in the first place  Alternative approaches that we tried along the way were just   relating commodity prices more directly to our expectations of global economic growth and the   dollar and any other factors that we could find, disregarding the information in futures  But we   June 21–22, 2011 86 of 282              found that you really are throwing away that useful information when you have a material slope   to the futures curve  So this was a way that we wanted to preserve that useful information but   then basically just tweak it based a bit on how we view the world evolving a bit differently than   maybe outside forecasters do    There are always risks  We’re always mindful of them and looking as   carefully as we can to find them  In the case of China, obviously, policymakers there have been   trying to engineer a slowdown from unsustainably rapid growth  So far they seem to have done a   pretty good job at doing that  One of the main indicators for that is that outstanding bank loan   chart that is shown in the exhibit  There were some fears earlier this year when some soft   readings were coming in; they were a little bit hard to interpret because of the lunar new year and   the strange dip in retail sales and so forth  But I think a lot of people took confidence from the   May readings, which showed investment picking back up and retail sales still expanding at a   healthy pace  House prices, which are a big concern in a lot of cities in China, have essentially   stabilized and are not either increasing at really rapid rates or in a freefall  So far, it seems like   the overall pattern of macroeconomic policies that the authorities have undertaken is achieving   the type of reduction in the very rapid rates of economic growth that they were looking for  And,   of course, as you noted, that’s our baseline forecast  There certainly are risks around it  Some   people are worried about power outages later this year and other disruptions that could emerge    But so far, we actually feel quite positive on the Chinese outlook    Well, the way that shows through in the way we do our projections is   really through the exchange rate  And, certainly, the lower value of the dollar in this projection   over time is a restraining force on imports and a supportive force for exports  In that sense, I   think some of that actually is occurring  But in terms of the question, are imports out of line with   domestic demand growth or GDP growth?  Not really  Our model, which includes US activity   and the exchange rate, is doing a pretty good job tracking import growth  If anything, core non-  oil imports are maybe just a touch higher than that model would suggest, but not materially so   "
