6,1976-03-29,"  Could I raise a point [about] that?  Steve, we’ve done some fairly  simple kinds of relationships covering some of those earlier periods, and there is apparently a  favorable performance in relationship [before] lagged reserves are put into effective force    Yes, a better relationship between nonborrowed reserves [and money]  before the [institution of] lagged reserves than after  This raises, I think, a significant policy  question, that if we institute a policy whereby the Desk operates on the basis of nonborrowed  reserves, with lagged reserves accounting, we may not get very reliable results  It raises a  question as to whether we should ask the subcommittee to proceed with its phase III on the  lagged reserve question before we start to operate on the basis of nonborrowed reserves     3/29/76 - 17 -     May I ask Alan to clarify something he said before?  Is RPD positively  misleading the [unintelligible] market?     3/29/76 - 27 -     So, as far as--    I see    Mr Chairman, would that be in the same context, the same paragraph  related to the--    Would the public interpret that as if they were in that close  relationship, that you were actually substituting when indeed we have not so agreed?    Okay  "
27,1976-04-20,"  Loan demand has been very sluggish in the reports  Numerous  discussions that I have had recently with small to medium-sized country banks suggest to me that     4/20/76 - 13 -           demand is much more vigorous than figures would suggest, and this may be reflecting itself in  the numbers as they are coming out of the next--     The question has to do with productivity  Our assumption has been  fairly bullish on the rate of increase in productivity, which tends to lead to a fairly optimistic  view as to the impact on wage push and so on  What kind of a figure do you have?    Mr Chairman, there is a problem defining what is better and what is  worse, it seems to me, without criteria as to what you are trying to do    Well, I like this proposal, Mr Chairman  I’ve come prepared to  suggest that [myself], as a matter of fact  I think it moves in a desirable direction for two  reasons  One is that it is the direction in which policy should be moving over time as the cycle  proceeds  I think if we’ve made mistakes, it’s been in moving too precipitously toward the end  of the cycle, and I think this would help to remedy that    The other reason is that it does move toward a narrower range, and as we gain experience  with our long-term targets, I think we should be trying to move toward narrower ranges  As for  M3, I’ve always some difficulty with the idea of having this included in our exercise at all, and I  think that maybe one solution to this would be to drop M3 if we could find a convenient way to  do that    Could I ask a question on the other appeal?  The appeal on the Record  of Policy Actions, is that under consideration now?  Is that where that stands?    If we were to move to 30 days, it would have no effect on that?    Could we be informed about the status of the Government in the  Sunshine [bill], because it may be that if we give up [preparing] this Memorandum [of  Discussion], we may find ourselves giving the equivalent anyhow [under] the Government in the  Sunshine Act    Is there any [indication] what the timing of that bill might be?  And the  timing as it might relate to this Committee?    May I, Mr Chairman, raise a question as to whether it’s feasible for us  to delay action with respect to the Memorandum of Discussion until we get clear indication of  that?  Would the timing be such as to make that a feasible course of action, or do you see it  dragging out for so long that it wouldn’t be feasible?     4/20/76 - 56 -            The reason I asked that question was it seemed to me we incur certain  costs in cutting out the Memorandum of Discussion--in terms of implications to others on the  outside, that we’re being more secretive, if you want to put it that way, that this is a devious way  to get around the law      Well, I’ll finish with--there may be others who interpret it otherwise,  and the reason I was asking the point was that, if we’re going to be disclosing through tape what  our procedures are, then we needn’t incur any cost on [unintelligible]    I think the Memorandum is vastly to be preferred if we had a choice of  one or the other, there’s no question in--  "
76,1976-06-22,"  Do you have any idea where the British expect the pound to be?    Mr Chairman, I might follow up on Ernie’s point with the comment  that Bicentennial tourism has not proved to be as large as expected  Our hotels are running only  80 to 85 percent of capacity, which is lower than they expected  I understand that this is not  confined to Philadelphia but it also applies to Washington     Could be, and I think people are waiting to see [whether] their  expectations have been fulfilled    Peter, I was [unintelligible] pleased to see the analysis in the Bluebook  about the nonborrowed reserves and how they work  Do you have any feeling at this point as to  how realistic the [nonborrowed reserves] simulation is now that you’ve seen this?    May I comment also on that, Mr Chairman?  [Unintelligible,] the  recommendations of the Subcommittee on the Directive, we did, after all, have in there a federal  funds constraint [unintelligible] so that it is a little difficult--in fact, it’s impossible, I guess--in a  simulation, to really tell what would have happened, because if we had a fed funds constraint to  live with [unintelligible] reserve operating target, the outcome that we were talking about  wouldn’t necessarily have to come about  That is, it is not completely clear to me if we would  have greater funds rate variability [with] that nonborrowed reserves target than we do now  Is  that wrong, Peter?    Mr Chairman, I would go along with your prescription  I think  alternative B as prescribed would be appropriate  I would like to take a second, however, to  revert to the earlier discussion about where we find ourselves with respect to the pattern of  money growth and so on and interest rates    We have done some exploring with other forecasts, particularly work on DRI and a little  bit with Michigan  And, comparing them with the Greenbook and as far as the real economy is  concerned, the results are pretty much the same for all of those  The interesting thing, however,  is that these private forecasts come to this conclusion with the expectation that M1 will grow  considerably more rapidly in the next three quarters than the Greenbook has projected  It’s  something like 3 to 4 percentage points     Similarly, these outside forecasters are more optimistic on interest rates  They see a  Treasury bill rate about 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points lower at the year-end than does the  Greenbook  They see interest rates more along the line of what Steve was coming to, interest  rates rising less than the Greenbook would have it     In other words, what this suggests is that the Greenbook forecast, given those assumptions  with respect to money supply and interest rates, is optimistic  And what this also suggests is that  we may see some long-run implications--particularly next month, when we come to look at the  long-run target--for whether we should reexamine those targets in the light of this, or at least to  forgive the overshoot that we have had in the second quarter       6/22/76 - 30 -           This is, I think, a problem in the making which we are going to have to consider  For the  moment, however, I think that things are uncertain, but I would be content to hold where we are  with alternative  B  "
100,1976-07-19,"  I would like to come back briefly to fixed capital investment  The  readings we got on a qualitative basis is that things are slow and cost less  We don’t see any  evidence that businessmen are really anxious to step up their investment, and this leads to a  question, Lyle, as to what the basis is for that quite optimistic longer-run projection that you had   Is it simply based on the normal cycles of spending in this phase or--    Could I follow that with one other question?  Suppose, Lyle, that this  optimistic projection for fixed investment is too optimistic  Does this encourage you in the  sustained expansion or does it mean that we might abort?    I think this is very relevant to the long-run target, because if you have  uncertainty in this vital area, it certainly has [unintelligible] implication for which way you go    Mr Chairman, can I ask a small question here?     Lyle, would you say that, on velocity, your forecasts are in line with  forecasts that other people are making?    I would like to subscribe to the views that Governor Wallich has  expressed, and essentially I agree with the specifications under alternative B    Mr Chairman, I certainly think this discussion reinforces your  comment this morning that we need to have a session where we discuss this at more length--  "
126,1976-08-17,"  Alan, what prospects do you see that we are going to be out of the  Belgian franc situation?    Lyle, you touched on the elusive question of confidence, and as I heard  you, I get the impression that you think confidence will continue and perhaps build  We do a  survey of business opinion and so on in the area once a month  And one of the questions we ask  is the outlook for the next two quarters ahead  The latest month shows that only two out of three     8/17/76 - 9 -    executives see better business conditions over the next two quarters  Previously, that was about  four out of five  So there has been by this qualitative measure some deterioration in confidence  about the outlook  Of course, nobody knows what’s going to happen to that, but I think that this  does suggest some question as to whether confidence is going to hold and what this might mean  for capital expenditures    Well, I would share the views expressed earlier that there is some  concern about this so-called pause that we seem to be having, that it may well be that we’ll come  out of it satisfactorily  But it seems to me that the risks, as Chuck Partee has pointed out, have  changed somewhat  So my feeling would be that we should be moving a little toward A from B   I could accept B, but I think, given these increased risks, that we could afford to move a little  toward A  One way to do this would be to change the range under B to raise the lower end of  that range somewhat, say, to 5 to 8, and perhaps drop the lower end of the range of the federal  funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point  I would like to see the range on the aggregates     8/17/76 - 21 -    narrower anyhow, and the range on the federal funds rate wider, so this would be a move in that  direction  I wouldn’t consider this a major move of any kind, but simply leaning, as Chuck has  indicated, to a little bit more ease than we have under B  "
149,1976-09-21,"  Just one comment  As I’ve compared the quantitative information,  such as that in the Greenbook, with qualitative comments being made by businessmen and  others, I think there’s a considerable difference  The qualitative information is more pessimistic  than the other  I just wonder whether this is your experience too  Second, whether you see this  as some kind of a forecast [with] less bullishness--    One of our directors in chemicals, for example, was discouraged about  the current [unintelligible]    Mr Chairman, I would be happy with prescriptions appropriate in the  current situation of the [unintelligible] be able to see the funds rate maintained about right where  it is  I do think that we are confronting an issue in the future where we are going to have to have  more flexibility  I think in a longer-run proposition we should be using the aggregates directive  rather than the money market directive, and I would hope that we could come to address this  issue in a special session as soon as it could be worked out    May I follow up that point briefly?  I think it would be helpful to have  a little bit more on costs and benefits of publishing daily what the Desk did    All right, or whatever the period is  If you go on the assumption that  services of this kind continue, I think maybe rather than trying to stop the tide, say that we don’t  want to add to concentration on short-term developments in the present--the market would do it  anyhow  Then, it seems to me, the thrust turns into a question that you raised, Mr Chairman,  that is, what is our public posture with respect to information we have   MR, GARDNER  Alan, the way this is written, it says the Desk “has”--upon inquiry  I  hope you don’t respond to one inquiry and not to another  "
170,1976-10-19,"  Peter, I would have inferred from your action that the Desk gave more  weight to what happened to M1 than to M2  Is that a correct inference?    I’d like to follow up on the comments you just made, Mr Chairman,  and also refer to Lyle’s very intriguing comments about the efficacy of monetary policy in this  current situation  I think this includes Ernie and Henry as well  I guess I’m less prepared to give  up the faith in monetary policy in the situation we seem to be confronting, as Lyle indicated--that  there are two disadvantages, one is that you may stimulate inflation if you ease further and that in  any case you wouldn’t have any effect in the short run  And I think those same arguments would  apply at any time and may raise the question, even if the economy were to worsen, whether those  two objections still wouldn’t exist  Second comment is, if, in the present situation, monetary  policy cannot be very effective, the question might be whether fiscal policy might be used to step  in here  Would you care to comment on that Lyle?      May I respond to the first part?  Seems to me, Lyle, the question  is--and I don’t disagree with you, what you’ve [said] about the immediate impact of monetary  policy--seems to me it’s a matter of tradeoff  If the economy were to worsen--if your forecast  were to get progressively more pessimistic--this does not foreclose the use of monetary policy,  even given some of those weaknesses      Mr Chairman, I would agree with your specifications  I have some  preference on the funds rate to having a range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, but I think your specifications  are acceptable      Mr Chairman, we prepared a memorandum which we distributed to  the members of the Committee, making some suggestions about--     Yes, I was going to suggest that very thing  I might just say one thing  with respect to that memorandum  That it obviously owes a great debt both to Governor Wallich  and Bill Poole, who advanced these kind of suggestions before and I think I should make sure  that that is understood     With respect to that memorandum, the thrust of it is that, for current decisions as far as  long-run targets are concerned, to hold policy where it is, where we mean to make no change,  would require an increase in the specified percentage growth rate  That is, we have had a  shortfall, and if we intend to hold policy where we meant it to be, then we would have to have  some increase in specified percentages      Well, I think that would bear studying to see what the magnitude of  that should amount to  My guess is that, over this time period that we examine, we’ve had more  drift than would be accounted for by those kinds of factors      Well, I should think that when the time comes to analyze the proposal,  that that should be an important thing  My offhand feeling is that at least our announcement  would suggest that we’re some 6 billion below the fixed-based target, and I would suggest that  that would be greater than would be allowed for in this philosophy  The point I want to make,  however, is that so far as the immediate determination of long-term targets is concerned, I would  come out different from your specification  Rather than lowering the specifications for Ml, I  would raise them  I would have 5 to 7-1/2 percent, midway between alternative A and  alternative B  5 to 7-1/2 percent for Ml; 9 to 11 for M2; and 11 to 13 for M3    "
208,1976-11-16,"  I have heard some talk that the peso may now be undervalued  Is this  optimistic?    Mr Chairman, my comments are similar to this type  The question is,  what does this mean in operational terms--to make less automatic?    I’d like to mention, Mr Chairman, some of us have board meetings  this coming Thursday  Did you say you intended to send this today?    Peter, what would be the market reaction to a 1/4 percentage point cut  in the discount rate?    Third from last    Well, Governor Partee has expressed my views  I think the economy  needs some stimulation and that monetary policy ought to play a role in that  I find it difficult to  accept the idea that there isn’t [anything] that monetary policy can do  We don’t have a liquidity  trap operating in the economy at the present time, and I think some modest easing is in order  I  would prefer alternative A as far as the aggregates are concerned, and I would prefer a funds rate  of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 administered on the asymmetrical downside  And I would like to see the  discount rate cut [unintelligible]  "
233,1976-12-20,"  A matter of clarification in the first paragraph, the word “behavior”  Is  there special significance to that, Henry, as opposed to “action”?    Will there be any kind of a record as to what “actions” and “behavior”  mean?     12/20-21/76 - 15 -          Will that be always an underlying document?    I can understand the desire for flexibility here, but I wonder whether  this does resolve the questions as to how much you are going to intervene in the market or how  much you are not going to intervene    Could I ask one other question now?  The reason for removing that  earlier section referring to sustaining artificial values of currency, or something like that  What  is the consistency of removing that and leaving this so open ended here    Mr Chairman, could I ask a question first?  I think most of us got this  document very late last week, and some of our staff’s have been doing some work on this  Am I  right in assuming that we are not reaching any decisions on this today?    I have no problem with discussing it, but I think that in view of the  short time period and the lack of ability to circulate studies that various people have been doing,  it might be wise to do that    I think related to this is the cost of interest rate fluctuations  This is  something that we’ve been doing some work on and I think it’s--    Yes     Could I ask a question, Mr Chairman, to Governor Henry Wallich and  John Balles  Do you see any possibilities of adoption of the subcommittee recommendations that  it’d make [it] more difficult to move in the direction that Henry presented in this comments?  Do  you see these [as] quite independent?  Do you see the adoption of the report’s recommendations  as being independent of your--    And you don’t see adoption of these recommendations hindering the  direction that you want to move in     Two points, Lyle  First on your changes from [your projections] last  time  I wonder why there isn’t more effect on unemployment, with the increase that you have in  real GNP from the last time  Second, did you do anything with alternative kinds of fiscal action,  a rebate or anything of that kind?    Peter, I would take it that a cut in the discount rate would be hoped for  but not expected  Is that correct?    Well, I guess I come out closer to Governor Coldwell that any of those  that have spoken so far  I am encouraged by the fact that the weakness in the economy doesn’t  seem to be feeding on itself  On the other hand, I am concerned about the very high projections  for unemployment that we have for 1977  I do think that fiscal stimulation is necessary, and I do  think that monetary policy should cooperate and go along with that stimulation  My preference  would be for alternative A, so far as aggregates are concerned, and with a funds rate that would  range from 4 to 5 percent  I specify that funds rate because I think, although the Desk may not  find it necessary to move, it does provide some more room on the lower side in case that’s  necessary  "
260,1977-01-17,"  Mr Chairman, my forecast agreed, for the most part, with the  projection of the Board staff  One possible difference has to do with inventory  Once a month  we survey manufacturers in our area, asking them their intentions [unintelligible]  And although  they’re not doing much right now with respect to either reducing or adding to inventories, our  survey indicates a considerable accumulation for the months ahead, and I just wondered whether  your increase in inventory is enough  In your projections, do you think the risk on inventories is  on the downside?    Yes, but my figures would be for the shorter run      Mr Chairman, I’d like to spend a little bit more time on the question  of the degree to which monetary policy should work with fiscal policy in this coming quarter  I  think this is a very difficult task    Well, in setting a long-term target, of course, we’re setting a year’s  target, but since we do this quarterly, I think we do have another shot at it in a few months, and I  think it would be in the near-term when the fiscal package would be going into effect  I find it  helpful to go back and look at what happened in 1975, when we had a similar situation--had the  tax rebate in the spring and, as you say, the Fed has been criticized since then for frustrating the  fiscal action     1/17-18/77 - 43 -            Well, it has given rise to some speculation that the Fed will try to  avoid that kind of criticism by doing something different  Anyhow, I found it helpful to go back  and look at ’75, and I’d like to review that briefly  What happened was that the funds rate  moved up somewhat to help keep the aggregates under control in the spring of that year  The  aggregates, as you may remember, considerably exceeded the targets for a time  M1, for  example, grew at an annual rate of 11 percent in one month, and 18 percent in another  month--two successive months  The Committee did not change the long-term targets to  accommodate those overshoots  And so, in effect, the Committee permitted some increase in  rates, it permitted some overshoots in the aggregates temporarily, and it held the long-term  target    I think this is a good model to follow because it does have the advantage of supporting the  fiscal action, of being careful to hold any increase in interest rates to moderate amounts--to only  those amounts it would be necessary to prevent the aggregates from getting completely out of  hand  It would permit the Committee to explain that its main concern is with the longer-term  growth of the aggregates, and I would prefer, I think, to see us hold to the long-term target in that  kind of a model    It is a question as to what we mean by targets    Steve there has been some talk in the market about the uncertainties of  seasonals, particularly at this time of the year  Do you have any feelings to whether they are  more uncertain now than--    If I understand what is referred to by “the bulge,” then I guess I have  some difficulties with it because it seems to me that, if it comes from a rebate, it’s just a  temporary cessation in the flow of funds [to which] we shouldn’t pay all that much attention  So  far as rates are concerned, it seems to me that rates are going to be moving up, and we should  permit them to do so moderately  So I would have no objection to 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent  But I  would stick with alternative B [for the] aggregates    That effectively would be sort of stopping the downward drift and  imperceptibly tightening up  "
284,1977-02-15,"  Mr Chairman, you mentioned today in a memo about the National  Security Council, are there other agencies which come under this--    Mr Chairman, on prices, a comment and a question  Our projections,  Jerry, would have a little bit more price effect as a result of the cold weather that we have been  having  You might want to comment on that  And second, I have seen some scenarios--we have  a chart here, for example, from DRI, which projects the deflator through this year by quarter,  which has a rising trend in the price component  I happen to be more in agreement with what  you have here  But what kind of odds do you attach to a rise in the deflator in the latest  increase?     2/15/77 - 15 -            Mr Chairman, may I comment  Once a month, in the preparation for  these meetings, one of the things that we do is to take the yield curve and try to make projections  of the rates on the basis of what the market seems to be expecting and reflected in the yield  period  In recent months the market projections have not been as high an increase for the funds  rate as the Bluebook would [make it] seem  But the latest one that we have done indicates that  the market was expecting increases in short-term rates which were quite similar to those that the  Bluebook projects  Which indicates to me that, if and when it’s necessary for rates to go up, that  the market apparently is expecting that  It would not be surprised    Mr Chairman, may I follow up?  I was also struck by this table, Steve   What kind of historical precedent is there for this kind of a velocity rate at this stage of the  cycle?    This would be higher, though, even for the first year    I would align myself with those who would stay with alternative B and  the specifications noted under that  I would like to have a wider federal funds range, but given  the way the Committee’s operating, I’m satisfied with what we have, and I do think that there’s  ample room to move if the aggregates were to come in large  And I feel better about that based  on the comments I made earlier, that the market, I think, would not be surprised if this were to  happen     We need to reemphasize what Chuck said, that the big advantage of  this is that it does away with the specification sheet, which I think always made us vulnerable--as  far as our public posture is concerned--in having some kind of a secret document   "
309,1977-03-15,"  I want to give some support to Governor Lilly’s comment on  chemicals  One of our directors is in the chemical business, and he was extremely bullish the  last time we had a go-around in our--    Well, the volume of business he said was very strong, and then he  expressed some concern about the price situation    One difference between our projections and the Board’s, particularly  with respect to the unemployment rates--the Greenbook has this about a half percentage point  lower than ours by the end of the year  Now this is partly because you have greater strength in  the economy than we do, which is attributable largely to the capital goods sector  And also this  is my question having to do with the anticipated growth in the labor force, which is slower in  your case than it is in ours  It has been very strong, of course, and I just wondered if you have  some basis for slowing down the labor force growth    And what follows, I suppose, is that, if you are underestimating price  increases, this could have an upsetting effect on your labor force projections    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve been impressed with the earlier  discussion of the degree of uncertainty that I think exists for the next few months  I think if we  had perfect knowledge, we’d try to anticipate some things--we’d try to anticipate the price  increases which a number of us feel are likely but we’re not sure about, and we’d do some  anticipation of the rebate and its effect  Probably do some anticipation of the interest rate  increase, so that it doesn’t come too sharply       3/15/77 - 27 -           But in view of the uncertainty about all three of these, I think it is the best thing to do to  stay approximately where we are  I don’t think we should be permitting interest rates to go up  substantially until the money supply seems to be behaving quite differently than it is  So I  generally like very much, Mr Chairman, your specifications for the aggregates  And I also  would hold to the specification for the funds rate     I would like to suggest, however, one possible modification on the funds rate  I think we  have the makings, [in] this fuzzy range of 4-5/8 to 4-7/8, of the possibility of getting more  movement in the funds rate from week to week than we have been getting  And one possible  way to do this is to widen that inside spread very slightly and make that something like 4-5/8 to  4-3/4  With Paul, I think I agree that this already happened    I think one thing this might do, with Paul’s suggestion, would be to put  us in a position of being prepared to introduce greater flexibility on the upside if that appears  necessary  "
332,1977-04-19,"  My comment is a question on price indexes  In our exercises before  these meetings, we project on through 1978, and we have the deflator ranging around a 6-1/2  percentage increase in that period  Your projections don’t go that far, but they’d been starting  out at a much lower base  Have you done anything through 1978 that you would--it seems to me  that one of the big problems with the equation is 1978 rather than 1977?    Isn’t it possible that, in addition to creating uncertainty, which would  have a negative effect on real output--[it would] enhance price expectations--higher price  expectations?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I came to the meeting with the notion that  the M1 floor should be lowered by 1/2 percent, and I discovered, listening to the conversation,  that it is a more complicated issue than I thought  There has been a great deal of discussion  about the public impact, the psychological effect of what we might do--the appearances  And it  seems to me that these cut so many different ways that they are very difficult to analyze  On one  hand, the reduction of that kind would seem to be consistent with the President’s anti-inflation  program, but on the other hand it might seem to be inconsistent with the rebate situation   Because that is so confusing, I am inclined to resort to what I think is more basic, and that is the  economic considerations     In that sense, it seems to me that we do have a much stronger economy than we had the  last time  There is, to be sure, an uncertainty about the impact of the energy program, and that is  an uncertainty in my own [mind]  My own hunch is that that will [be adopted], and it will leave  higher inflation expectations in its wake  As I indicated earlier, our own projections for 1978  indicate a higher rate of inflation  And I think it could be quite possible that, a year from now,  we will find ourselves looking back on this period having committed excessive growth in money   For those reasons, I’d be inclined to bite the bullet and lower the M1 floor by half a  percent  I am less concerned about M2 and M3 because, as you indicated Mr Chairman, I think  these growth rates have been coming down, and they are likely to come down further  So I  would concentrate on M1, and I think that this would stand us in good stead for the future    If I understand Paul’s position, I think I can also support that  It seems  to me that we should be prepared to let the funds rate go up  But had we had more time last     4/19/77 - 43 -           time, we probably would have done so  And I can buy your range, Mr Chairman, of 4-1/2 to  5-1/4, but I really think we should be ready to move that promptly as the figures materialize   And so far as the ranges are concerned, I’d combine that with the alternative C aggregates  specification  "
358,1977-05-17,"  How soon would you think that feedback would come?    What kinds of probability would you assign to that kind of scenario?    I’d like to come back again for a minute to this question of a possible  lull or rolling readjustment  We’ve been talking about this, too, and I think the probabilities that  I would assign would agree with the ones that you have  At the same time, I’ve been concerned  about the possibilities for further price increases  And I’m just wondering whether some kind of  a rolling process, as long as it doesn’t adversely affect the capital goods area, might not be just  what we need, in terms of the price pressures we might be experiencing later on this year   Would you think that if those probabilities were to materialize and we were to have something  like the situation that we had a year ago, that this would have a material effect on the price  changes?     Well, the irony of it would be, Chuck--and this was the thrust of my  question--that you might suffer a higher unemployment rate and still gain no ground on the price  front    Steve, you mentioned that you’ve revised your interest rate forecast  upward  One of the things that we have been doing regularly once a month is to look at the  interest rate patterns to see what this tells us about expectations and forecasts for interest rates on  the part of the market  And, with the exception of one month, the market pattern has consistently  forecast lower interest rates than the Bluebook has expected  Do you have any feeling about  what that means?  The only thing that occurred to us was that the market may believe that we’re  going to be more liberal with the aggregates than in fact we think we are going to be    Have you ever gone back to check the accuracy of these two methods  of--    Well, I would agree essentially with the staff’s projections on the  economy, with the possibility that we will be seeing a slowdown in the latter part of this year   And as I indicated earlier, that might not be too undesirable  So I approach this session with two  main points of view  One is that we should be seeing adjustment toward our longer-range targets  for the aggregates, and that requires a small increase for this two-month period  Second, that  unless unusual developments occur, the funds rate should not decline  So I like your  specifications, Mr Chairman  I think that I would be reluctant to see a significant negative  figure for the two-month period because, if May comes in at 5 percent, as now forecast, that  would imply a significant decline for June  And I’m not sure that I’d like to see a very large  decline--    Well, all I’m saying, unless I don’t understand what you’re saying, you  have a zero or a significant negative figure for the two-month period--I think [that] is a little  risky, and this leads me a little bit to alternative B    So I think the important thing is to have the funds rate reasonably  stable and be prepared to move it up, if necessary  "
394,1977-06-21,"  A comment and a question  I noticed in the New York Times that there  was a listing of forecasts for 1978--some 35 forecasts  Which, as I read what the Greenbook has,  would put your forecast at the upper end of the list, probably at the top end of the list  I have  some reservations as to whether that will materialize, and I’m partly influenced by some  meetings that we have been having in the last couple of weeks with several dozen businessmen,  and I must say, sentiment is very pessimistic Partly this is a function of the fact that it’s being  held in Philadelphia, and the Philadelphia area is not very strong, and there is a special problem  attached to that  But I think that the degree of optimism is very low     We had one participant express this quite eloquently  He said, “In the past, I have always  had a kind of well of optimism that I could dip down into and draw when there was a shock,”     6/21/77 - 3 -         and he said, “My well has run dry” And shocks do come along to the economy--so, I think that,  first of all, the forecast--    Yes, I think it’s a function of several things  One is the fact that  businessmen feel lost, that they don’t know where things are going, that the old rules no longer  apply, that they don’t know what government is going to do, particularly in the area of energy   And although they have become used to uncertainty, I think the degree of uncertainty is a great  deal stronger than they have had in the past     This year has led, I think, to distrust of what the consumer is going to do  For example,  one retailer talked about his doubts and uncertainty  I pressed him for his forecast for sales in  the second half of the year as compared to the first, and he said the second half is going to be  about as good as the first  And I said, how can you be so pessimistic?  And he got off on costs  and various other uncertainties      That was the way I interpreted it--that, in fact, his forecast is not  pessimistic, but his attitude is pessimistic  And I suspect that the pessimism is overdone in many  cases, but I think it is there and is reflecting itself in attitudes toward capital spending and  willingness to take ventures and to move out in the near future  My question has to do with the  forecast projections--to what extent this is judgmental and to what extent it represents models      Is there a difference between what the model is saying and what the--    Well, I think these differences may account for our tendency to be  somewhat lower      That’s gross rent, that’s not net rent, which is a little bit--    Net rent may well have gone down, based on those figures     As long as you are talking about this, there may be some function in  age, because I happened to speak to a group of young businessmen who, by definition, had to  have been president before they were 40, and they could not be over 50 and still attend this  meeting over the weekend  They were all very exuberant about everything, in fact so much so,  that approximately 80 percent of them indicated with a show of hands that they thought  monetary policy ought to be tightened--that things were running well     6/21/77 - 9 -          Mr Chairman, I like your suggestion of alternative B  I think, also,  that it is consistent with the uncertainty that I was talking about earlier  And one of the things  we also hear when we talk of businessmen is that they do look to the Fed for some source of  stability  And in that connection, I was interested to read in the Redbook a comment by  Professor Samuelson--zigzagging around the desirable range as new information cumulates is the  optimal policy posture in a changing world filled with uncertainty  I am not about to take on  Professor Samuelson, but I understand that that position, even in technical terms of optimal  control theory and rational expectations, is questionable, and certainly [it is] in terms of the  intuitive feeling that I have about uncertainty  It seems to me that whatever we can convey to  the business community that we’re going to move gradually, I think would be for the good  In  that context, it seems to me that it would be well for us to go with alternative B    Could I ask you a question on that?  You mentioned consideration of  charging  I think we have a potentially explosive issue  It involves a whole group of services to  central banks  It involves some benefits to both parties  Is it possible to cost out--    I am assuming that in addition to the courtesy that’s involved in this  kind of service, that there must be some advantage to the foreign central bank in dealing with the     6/21/77 - 50 -         Fed rather than with the market  And the market may stay quiet about this forever, but then may  not  "
419,1977-07-19,"  Mr Chairman, could I ask a factual question?  Alan, how does the  amount of intervention by all countries in this current situation compare with other situations  since we’ve had trouble with the British?    Mr Chairman, my own view of the economic outlook would support  the staff view that, if anything, the factors have become less strong than they had been before   This is partly a function of the situation in our own area, which, as the Redbook has indicated, is  probably less ebullient than it is elsewhere  It is also partly a function of the fact that, in our  staff estimates, we have made fewer judgmental adjustments to the model as the results come off  the computer     Which leads me to a question  Last time, I asked the extent to which you were making  judgmental changes and how the judgment compared with the model  My understanding is that  generally the experience is that forecasts that are judgmental, well, that judgmental changes of  computer printouts are better than a straight model result  Is this the case for the projections that  we have had here in the Greenbook over the years?  Have you tested the model results compared  with the judgmental adjustments to the model?    Well, the main thrust of my question has to do with comparing our  results as against the Greenbook results, because we have made fewer judgmental adjustments  than I presume you have  As a result, our projections are less optimistic    Well, I think they’ve had the same kinds of errors that models have,  and we have not--    It’s essentially the [Federal Reserve] System, not a [Federal Reserve]  Board--    No    Well, this might answer the question, then--    --under the circumstances, since we all are using essentially the same  model    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My view of the economic outlook calls for  essentially no change in the intent of policy  I’d be willing, however, to modify this to continue  the policy of gradually nudging down as you suggested  But I think there is the question of base  drift; the staff figures, incidentally--I think in the Bluebook--were most helpful in this respect  I  think this was a big, big step forward in bringing that problem to light     Now it seems to me we have two alternatives on how to deal with base drift  One would  be to adopt your suggestion, Mr Chairman, and make a small move in M1 and then to work  between now and the next quarterly decision time on how we’re really going to deal with base  drift as it occurs in the future  The other possibility is to begin to deal with it now  And that’s  the one I opt for, and that leads me to prefer a growth rate for M1 of 4 to 6 and for M2 of 6 to 9,  and clearly to explain in the testimony that this is an attempt to deal with this recurring problem  of how the base drifts back and forth, so that the [congressional] committee will understand and  the public will understand that we’re now coping with our problem     7/19/77 - 37 -      I would agree with that position too  "
446,1977-08-16,"  Well, I would second those last words Paul gave us  A couple  meetings ago I reported on the sentiment of businessmen in our area, which of course is not the  most vigorous area in the country, and it’s one of concern and remains one of concern  I think  [their sentiment] is more pessimistic than the statistics would suggest is warranted, but I think  that Phil Jackson is entirely correct that inflation is a primary concern to businessmen     Along that line, one question I would have about the staff’s projection is that the  assumption about money growth clearly, I think, is under what we’re likely to have, at least what  we seem to be having now  And I presume that would be a factor on the other side--when we  make revisions on the basis of current events, you would make some further revisions, I  presume, for a faster rate of money growth    I see    Governor Coldwell asked my question, but just to make sure I  understand it--Peter, is it fair to say that there would not be much adjustment in the market if the  discount rate went up 1/2 percentage point?    Some adjustment, but not a great deal    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I begin with a view that the economy is  stronger than the sentiment would suggest and also with the uncomfortable feeling that we may  someday look back on the current period as being a mistake, so far as monetary policy is  concerned  We have a second and third quarter with M1 growing more than 8 percent  If you  were to assume a fourth quarter at the same rate, this would create money growth in 1977 that  would be the second fastest since 1970     The question, of course, is what to do  I think two observations that have been recently  made are helpful  One is the observation that, although we’ve been consistently and persistently  lowering our targets, that the actual growth rates have actually increased  Second was the  observation made last time that it’s important to make sure that we do in the short-term what we  want to accomplish in the long-term  And it seems to me that this is a good test of that principle     This leads me to a position that at least the aggregates of alternative C would be desirable   I like very much your proposition of lowering the lower limit [of M1] to 0  I also would lower  the upper limit to about 4 to give a range of something like 0 to 4  I am concerned, of course,  with what this would mean for the federal funds rate, and I would approach that somewhat  cautiously and opt for the ranges that are specified for alternative B, 5-3/4 to 6-1/4, with very  close consultation between the Desk and the Committee     As far as the discount rate is concerned, I think it is time to raise the rate  I’m prepared to  recommend to my board of directors an increase of 1/2  I think that, from what Peter said, the  market has almost adjusted to that  It hasn’t quite adjusted to it  I think maybe the additional  amount might have a good announcement effect at this particular time, given the kind of growth  rates that we’ve been having in the money supply    I would do it right away    Yes    Yes  "
472,1977-09-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I reported, I guess about three meetings  ago, about a meeting that we had of businessmen which produced a very pessimistic tone  We  had another meeting last week, which Governor Lilly attended  And there, I think, they were  considerably less pessimistic  It wasn’t actually bullish--I think this reflects the region in which  we are operating--but I think indicates that despite a great deal of uncertainties, businessmen are  feeling better about the outlook  As far as the projections for the economy are concerned, ours  are quite similar to the Board’s staff, and we feel reasonably good about the outlook, as far as we  can see it       9/20/77 - 8 -   There is one difference that we have with the Board’s projections  This is not a major one,  but there is a difference in the assumption about the productivity increases that underlie  forecasting  We’re lower than you are, and we note that DRI and Wharton are closer to us than  they are to you and that all three of us are closer to the recovery and the average recovery period   You might want to explain    Isn’t it also because interest rates didn’t rise for so long, contrary to  expectations?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly agree with you that the increase  in M1 is disconcerting and that the increases in the other Ms are higher than we would like to see  them  I think these indicate that it’s a matter of judgment, and my own judgment [is] that these  are more than random shock developments and we need to deal with them  I would disagree, I  think, with Governor Jackson, that no overt moves should be made by the Desk to raise the funds  rate  The Bluebook points out that, to meet our longer-term goals, a substantial increase in the  funds rate will be necessary and that the increase probably will be greater if it’s delayed than if  taken earlier     So I think the Desk should move fairly promptly to move the funds rate up, and my own  preference for the range is for 6 to 6-3/4 with a 6-1/4 midpoint  But I would settle for 6-1/2 if  it’s understood that there would be a discussion if the aggregates were coming in exceptionally  high  On the ranges for the aggregates, I would buy our 2 to 7, which you said first on M1, but I  think the same kind of logic that you used last time to use the zero floor would apply this time   The only difficulty is that a 0 to 7 percent range is a very wide range  But I think in terms of our  intention we should really think of a zero floor  And even though we may publish it as 2 to 7   That’s my view  "
525,1977-11-15,"  Mr Chairman, may I ask Tom a very firm question on this?  What is  the court’s attitude with respect to the spirit and the letter of this question?  Because I think  that’s pertinent to this issue here    How strictly would the court hold us to sticking to our present  procedures?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I continue to worry about the growth rates  we’ve had in the past for M1, because I think that we’re going to find, looking back, that we  have followed a procyclical policy  However, the recent performance has been more  satisfactory, and furthermore, I think there are uncertainties now that we haven’t faced so much  in the past  One is the business, the economic situation itself, and the other one has to do with  this discussion we just had about the uncertainties in velocity and the demand for money  It  seems to me that when you face uncertainties of that kind, you stick pretty much to what we  have  I think alternative B would be satisfactory, but given my basic concern about the excesses  in money that we’ve had, I’d like the 1 to 6  I think that would be very good  "
549,1977-12-19,"  If the Supreme Court were to accept it, what kind of timetable do you  suppose would be involved?      Well, I would like to say something, Mr Chairman  I support the  thrust of the report  I happen to feel that we not only can live with the kind of solution that the  report recommends, but we may find that more information may actually improve the  functioning of the open market operations     I’d like to [make] a comment, however, on the last subject, having to do with the treatment  of dissents  If counsel is correct that we can’t withhold the names of people who have dissented  on the day that the announcement is made, I am concerned about the problem of waiting for  some 30 days for the explanations behind this  I think that the report explains what must be done  in the context of our present practice, and therefore I do agree with that  But I’d like to see us  explore a little bit the possibility of changing our procedure so that we can get a summary of our  discussion out sooner than 30 days, perhaps as [early] as 3 or 4 or 5 days after the meeting     I’ve discussed this with Art Broida, and, of course, this is a very difficult task for the Secretariat   I happen to think that the way the present policy record is formed is excessive, so far as a lot of  background information is concerned anyhow  And with an abbreviation of that, and with a  relatively short and concise statement of the majority view behind the current position, together  with a very short statement on behalf of the dissenters, it wouldn’t be at all impossible to get a  summary of this out within say 3, 4, 5 days after the meeting  I’d like to hear us discuss that    Mr Chairman, could you add to that analysis how many [times] we’ve  had special intermeetings?    Does anybody want to make a guess as to how much more  depreciation we are going to have before these three policy changes are in place?     I asked the question  What is the--    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree essentially with the staff  projections, although, as Frank indicates, I come from an area that isn’t booming  But there is  one development that I think will have some effect in the near term, and that is the implications  of the coal strike  One of our directors is in the utility field and is very much concerned about  this and makes a point that there is too much complacency about the adequacy of the stocks, that     12/19-20/77 - 57 -         they are not well distributed, and that you can’t count on anything happening until they run out   Because once you are about half-way through, then they start to put into effect rationing devices  that will affect users of coal, and they will have to be making decisions as to who they will  ration, and they are likely to ration the large consumers first  And we can see this showing up   Particularly since he feels that it is going to take some time for the strike to be settled--feelings  are running high, and it’s going to take time for the negotiators to get to the table  We could  have some short-term serious effects on our output      That’s why I stressed the near-term aspects; it seems to me [that] at the  end of the year you will find it      Peter, we have had a 6 point spread on M1 for some time now  Could  you tell us what your concept of the zones of indifference are on that?  For example, alternative  B [in the Bluebook], this time, is 3-1/2 to 9-1/2  What point would the aggregates have to reach  before the funds rate would be permitted to go up?    Suppose it is an aggregates directive?    I’d like to say a word about the general posture--I agree, I think we  ought to make no change, essentially  But I’m increasingly disturbed by this 6 point spread that  we have in the aggregates for M1  I’d remind the Committee that the original purpose for this  was to extend on the downside at a time when we really wanted to put all our risks down there,  that we were not concerned with the aggregates coming in low  It seems to me that a 6 point  spread, even with an 8-1/2 percent ceiling, is a higher top than I would like to see  And I would     12/19-20/77 - 69 -         narrow that  I would buy your 2-1/2 bottom and lower that top point to 7-1/2, to 6-1/2, or  something like that   "
589,1978-01-17,"  Question to Scott  You use the terms “orderly” and “disorderly” and   “efficient” markets  It would be very helpful to me if I had a more precise feeling about your  definitions of those      Well, because it seems to me that this goes to the issue--to Chuck’s issue   as to what is a proper exchange rate and when do we intervene and when do we not     1/17/78             12     Well, as long as we’re getting everything out here on the table, I think   there is a further question, and that is  What are the risks of disorderliness and what are the gains  of injecting order?        Well, I understood Larry’s question to have to do with the value of the   dollar--the more permanent aspects and not the fluctuations from day to day     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I would have some sympathy for the   view that Governor Coldwell expressed about the longer-run outlook and the possibility of  recessionary developments next year  This is supported by the views that I get in Philadelphia  which, of course, are biased by the very slow activity that we have there  [There is] concern about  inflation and the intractable nature of it and concern about the dollar, with no light on the horizon  so far as the solution to that is concerned  There is one aspect that I think might work on the other  side in a small way and this is in the housing area  It occurs to me that one of the phenomena that  is different this time than in the past, so far as the housing sector is concerned, is the strong  tendency on the part of individuals to use [real estate] as the main way of hedging against inflation   It is clear when you talk to real estate people that families are seizing on this as the way to protect     1/17/78             23  themselves Given some sustaining flow of mortgage money, it would seem to me that housing  might look better, given this strong demand factor at this time, than it may have looked in the past   Perhaps you might react to that      I think Steve [Axilrod] is right that we are going to have to be in the  process of raising money rates as we move forward  However, having taken the action earlier this  month that was taken, I would prefer to stay about where we are at this time with respect to the  funds rate  Like last time, however, I feel that the spreads that we have on the [ranges for the]  aggregates are larger than we need, particularly on the M1 measure  And as long as we stick with  the money market directive, it doesn’t give adequate incentive to the Desk to move the funds rate  soon enough  So rather than move toward the alternative C specification, I would prefer to stick  with the alternative B aggregates and reduce the upper limit of the M1 range to something like  7-1/2 percent  And I’d urge the Desk to move on the funds rate if [that limit] starts to be  approached    "
615,1978-02-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I=d like to take some issue with the snapback   scenario that seems to be quite prevalent  We=ve been doing some research on the question of   uncertainty and this research suggests that there is some connection between the level of  uncertainty about inflation and the effect that that has on unemployment  Apparently there is a  connection  And the relevance of that for the current situation is, I think, that we have been  experiencing external shocks to the economy in the form of the weather and the coal strike, and it  may be not appropriate to think of this as simply temporary, as it was last year  The reason is that  the declines that we have been experiencing have been larger than they were last year  If you look  at industrial production, retail sales, durables, housing starts, and so on, the declines have been  larger than they were a year ago  Another reason is this fundamental change in the automobile  sector, which was strong last year and is weak now  And, finally, on the demand side there’s the  overhang of the rapid money growth we=ve had in past months, suggesting that this will increase  relative demand as compared with a year ago      So the shocks affect the supply side and the demand pressures affect the demand side,   possibly accelerating expectations and [increasing] uncertainty about inflation  As we see data  coming in, like the consumer price index figures released recently, I think we will be seeing  uncertainty about the inflationary outlook  And if our research is right, this will be showing itself  in real output and unemployment later on  On balance, I do have some concern, as I gather Chuck  does, with [what is] perhaps an undue readiness to think that these are simply temporary  phenomena that will pass, as they did [after the first] three months last year  I guess this [makes]  me a little more pessimistic than the Greenbook      In Pennsylvania, the banking secretary has ruled against [the honor bond]   as being unsound     Well, I join the ranks of prudent men, too  The only question I have is   that M2 ceiling  Really, this turns into a factual question more than anything else  In the short-  term ranges, it=s expected for the next two months that the large denomination time deposits will  grow enough to offset the slow growth in time deposits subject to Regulation Q  I wonder if that  assumption is true, however, when you=re going a year out and whether, with Regulation Q ceilings  biting into those smaller denomination time deposits, the relative weights of those would tend to  shift in that time period  Making a guess that that might be true, my inclination would be to cut 1/2  point off of that M2 ceiling      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I listen to the discussion, I think this is an   illustration of the danger of getting captive to our machinery here  It seems to me, given the short  [intermeeting] period and the desire, as I hear it, of most people to stay where we are, that we need  to tell the Desk to hold the rate where it is and watch closely and have a special meeting by wire if  necessary, but it probably won=t be necessary  So I=d accept alternative B and wait for three weeks    "
637,1978-03-10,"  I’d like to ask a question, Mr Chairman  I’m not clear on this package   about [the issue] of a Treasury takeout  Will there be some commitment from the Treasury with  respect to this whole issue or are we out there by ourselves?      I would like to comment that I support those who feel that it is vital that   this be a part of a package because it seems to me that you gain strength that way  And I think we  shouldn’t be there by ourselves  That’s all    "
652,1978-03-21,"  A question to Scott, please  One of the factors expressed in the   disappointment of the market was that there was no element of exchange controls in the package  How hip is the market on this question and is it likely that nothing very constructive will be done  absent some action on exchange controls?      You have the right of prepayment     Just a request of Alan  In your paper, Alan, I would personally find it   helpful if you would go back a little bit and review the basic principles and the experience in other  currencies  That would serve as a background for us      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a comment I’m still thinking about the   remark you made about the need to slow growth [to improve] the balance of payments [and] the  dollar      Yes, some sentiment about the need to do it  I detected some sentiment   that it goes even further than that and that it really may be necessary to have a recession and that  the thing to do now is to try to choose the kind of recession we’d like to have  This gives me some  concern, partly because coming from the area that I come from--      This gives me some concern because we haven’t come out of it  We   have some banks that would have a good deal more difficulty than they are having now if we had a  recession      Yes, it is  It’s just a comment that I think we need to emphasize   inflation, as we have been, but preferably stress the point that more and more we’re coming to  believe that inflation does lead to recession--that there are built-in factors that lead from one to the  other  So the posture that we ought to have is to work persistently on the inflation front but to  indicate to the public that we’re clearly going to avoid overkill in doing this      You and Governor Jackson have expressed my opinion  I think the   federal funds range should be 6-1/2 to 7, with the arrangements you have explained on  consultation And I’ve felt for some time that our ranges are too large  We moved to 6 percentage  points and we’re now down to 5, and I think we could take another cut  I would endorse the view  that we should cut the range for M1 to 4-1/2 to 8 percent      I meant 4-1/2 to 9 percent and 6 to 9-1/2 percent  I’d cut 1/2 point off   now and maybe take another cut later on     I would agree with that     3/21/78              59   "
677,1978-04-18,"  Well, I would agree with that  It seems to me that if we lived in a  different kind of world, maybe this would be a good way to go  If we lived in a world where we  had been able to hold to our intentions and had the kind of credibility that we would like to have     4/18/78             8  and had more knowledge of the future, I think this would be a good way to go  But that is not the  world we live in at the moment      Mr Chairman, may I add one more thing?  I think the Humphrey-  Hawkins issue is very relevant to this  Maybe the Subcommittee on the Directive could simply     4/18/78             13  monitor developments in that field, and if it appears that we are going to be back in that business  because of Humphrey-Hawkins, bring it back up      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to pick up a little bit on the  comments about prices earlier--particularly Jim’s comment about the exogenous nature of the food  and dollar price increases  I remember last year, roughly about this time, a number of comments  were made around the table with respect to policy that we were building in a pro-cyclical policy  with the rates of expansion in the aggregates that we were seeing  And going back to February  l977, the forecast at the time for price increases for the first half of this year was 5-1/4 percent  annual rate and it is now 74 percent  This, I think, is very relevant to the issue of credibility that  we discussed earlier  It seems to me that it’s very easy to find specific reasons for price increases  which appear to be exogenous  But it may be more difficult to see the connection between [price  increases and] the growth in the aggregates with a lag--seeing that changes particular aspects of the  price picture  Perhaps you would like to comment on this  Do you see a delayed impact of the  earlier increases in money supply growth?      Time for discussion?      Well, I would like to support that, Mr Chairman  I came prepared with  that view and I think Steve’s analysis was very helpful  It seems to me that some of the items that  Steve presented were in the area of public policy and more of them were in the area of public  psychology  We are dealing, it seems to me, with this credibility problem and we should  concentrate our efforts on trying to get better performance with the targets than we have  Rather  than aggravate our credibility, I think we ought to hold where we are on the targets and try to do  better on the performance      I would assume, Mr Chairman, that if you felt that your testimony on the  economy was way out of line with everybody else’s view that you could put that in some kind of  context      Well, with that kind of assumption, it seems to be perfectly reasonable to  continue with your own views      I think we are all heading in the same direction; it is only a question of  the specifications  I also get the impression that there is a tendency to be bold with the aggregates  and rather prudent with the funds rate  I think we should try to be reasonably consistent      I’d resist the temptation to slash the aggregates specifications  That is,  [I’d favor] perhaps cutting another 1/2 point off what you had, Mr Chairman, and make it 5 to 9 or  perhaps 5-1/2 to 9-1/2--within that area  But I like your specification for the funds rate because it  accomplishes something that I think has been highly desirable for a long time--that is, it widens the  range and also provides amplitude to move up if these aggregates do come in strong      Paul, one way to resolve that would be to ask for a wire vote or  something like that      Especially if you hit the 7-1/4    "
716,1978-05-16,"  May I ask Henry a question?  In your view of the attitude of the German  central bank, would you assume that some repayment would stand us in good stead for further  drawings in the future--if the fundamentals start to reassert themselves, in other words?      My question is on consumer spending in anticipation of higher prices  I  have the impression that studies somewhere--perhaps earlier in the Katona studies and others--have  indicated that consumers have reacted adversely to expected price increases  (A) Is that wrong?   and (B) have things changed?      Well, I already agree essentially with the staff forecast and I would also  agree with what [seems] to be the sentiment around the table so far that if the forecast is wrong, it  underestimates the [rate of] price increase  I have also listened with considerable interest to the  groping around for [answers to] the question--Ernie started it, I think--of whether factors are  building here for a possible recession in ’79  I’ve asked this question in our [Bank] several times  and as nearly as we can see, these forces aren’t building, at least in our forecast, autonomously  within the economy  There is a great unknown as to how people will behave with respect to the  uncertainty of inflation  And that was the reason for my question to Jim as to how consumers are  reacting  It may be that we are in a new kind of psychological environment that makes it very  difficult for us to understand and forecast these factors  But as nearly as we can see, we are not  building these cumulative forces for a recession     Now, the other possibility of bringing on a recession is what we do here around this table  with monetary policy  If I understand the research that has been done on this by Bill Poole and  others in the past, to bring that about would require considerably lower money growth rates than  the kinds we’re contemplating  So I don’t see that as building, and I don’t think we are about to  [foster a recession] through monetary policy  So my risks are all on the inflationary side      Well, let me say first, Mr Chairman, that I found your opening  comments very provocative  However, I think I am following in the same trend direction as Ernie  and Phil  On the April bulge, I think there are two risks  One is that it is essentially temporary and  that to respond too promptly to something like that presents a problem of having to undo something  that you wish you hadn’t done  I think an example of this is two years ago when we did respond  too quickly to bumps and had to undo it  So that’s one risk  The other risk, however, is that with a  bulge of this kind followed by subsequent but more moderate rates of growth that these more  moderate rates of growth will not be sufficiently low to average out to the kind of growth rates over  the whole period that we really should have  I’m inclined to think that that’s the more likely  possibility and that we may find ourselves with growth rates over an average of the first half, for  example, that will be higher than they should be in this kind of an economic environment  So, I  would be inclined to move very cautiously and moderately toward somewhat less expansion  The  funds rate range that I had is from 7-1/4 to 7-3/4, although Ernie’s would be acceptable to me  I’d  be inclined to place the midpoint low in that range      Not to be picky about it but I’d say 7-3/8 or something like that  I  wouldn’t object to 7-1/2  In any case, it shouldn’t go down  I think we are agreed on that  On the  aggregates, I would prefer something like 3 to 7 percent for M1 and whatever is appropriate for M2  to conform with that    "
742,1978-06-20,"  Mr Chairman, in our briefing discussion last week, we spent a good  deal of time talking about what has already been discussed here  We discussed the difference  between the forecast that would come from the model and the one that we have in the Greenbook  and the kinds of judgmental decisions that are made to revise the model  My inclination is to  move closer to the model results than the judgmental Greenbook results  The main reason is the  third point that Jim mentioned and that is the uncertainties that come from inflation  We have  had a number of discussions with businessmen and I think I have one clue to what appears to be  developing here in terms of assessing their sentiment  I have detected that when you talk to a  businessman about his own attitudes toward his own business, it is good, generally  But when  you talk to them about the overall environment, it is bad  And the main factor there is inflation   I think this may account for some of the difference in the tone of the Redbook, Chuck, where  you get individual reports from individual businessmen, as against the overall sentiment that may  exist  So my conclusion is that we are likely to have less growth than the Greenbook has  In  terms of numbers, generally speaking, I would say 1 percentage point or so below the  Greenbook; in terms of unemployment, it may be up to 61, 62, or 63 percent, and inflation at  something around 7-1/2 percent     There is one other aspect that has not been touched on that may have some implications for  the future and that is that if you look at the term structure of interest rates, it does suggest a  leveling off of interest rates as you move out in the future  Some of this may simply be  uncertainty but I wonder whether the money market isn=t already telling us that the economy  may be slowing down more than we think and if [market participants are] feeding this into their  own judgments about the likely course of interest rates      Steve, I wonder if you have any thoughts about the possibility of a  leveling of interest rates five or six months from now      Well, I think there are risks in further tightening, but I think they are risks  that we have to take, and I like Paul=s prescription  I think that we should move the funds rate up to  7-3/4  We might want to pause at that time and consult depending on what the aggregates show   And somewhat lower on both the top and the bottom of the ranges I think would be preferable-- perhaps something like 5 to 9 for both M1 and M2      Would this be an aggregates [directive] or--      It makes some difference      May I ask the Desk what this would imply in terms of maturity and how  many are coming up?  I don=t have to have specifics but I think we need to have some [idea]    "
768,1978-07-18,"  Well, I would like to second what Henry started with and some of what  Frank said  My most probable forecast is very close to the Greenbook forecast, with 3-1/2 percent  GNP, 7-1/2 percent for inflation, and 6 percent for the unemployment rate  But I am nervous about  this because it is taking place in a very high inflation environment and I suspect that to say that the  risks are on the downside is probably to minimize that likelihood  One reason relates to the kinds  of things that Frank pointed out--financial stringencies  I think that was well brought out in the  charts that Jim showed and it was supported by some discussions that I have had in the last week or  so with small businessmen  We often meet with big businessmen but never met with small  businessmen, and it’s quite clear that they have a cash flow problem and have had one for some  time  They are at the end of the line as far as receivables go  If you were to have the kinds of  financial pressures which Jim’s charts indicate happening at the corporate level, you would see that  it is exacerbated even as you get into smaller business  And I think some substantial change in  their expectations would have a negative effect on the economy      Yes sir  I would opt for staying where we are with the long-range  targets, and the reason is not for any positive rationale but mostly because there are disadvantages  in almost every other way we might go  There are disadvantages in raising the ceiling for M1 and  there are disadvantages in lowering it  So I would keep it just as it is and I think this will help you,  Mr Chairman, in your public comments with the Congress and also serve our policy needs      Well, I would pause for this month and go with alternative A or B  That  would seem to me consistent with the kind of economic uncertainties that were revealed in our  discussion  And those aggregates ranges would be satisfactory to me; I would wait and see what  happens next      It might not be the most undesirable thing in the world to have a little  uncertainty just as to where that is and let it move      Well, I would support that for another reason  And that is that in my  experience the most frequent contribution that a President makes in the phone calls is not on the  techniques of the day-to-day call but if he feels the Desk is not moving promptly enough or is  moving overly promptly [relative] to the directions of the Committee  [The President on the call] is  kind of a burr in the saddle  And I think he could be as effective at that after he has had the news as  he is at the moment [of the call] because it is a day-by-day cumulative process       7/18/78              58  "
793,1978-08-15,"  My figures are quite similar to the Board [staff projections] and are  quite similar to last time real growth 3-1/2 or a little under; the deflator at 7-1/2 percent; the  unemployment rate 6 percent plus a little bit  I think it's quite clear that the economy is running out  of steam  The only question that I was trying to resolve between the meetings was this question  that we explored last time about liquidity problems  Remember, there were a number of charts  discussed at the last meeting and I took the occasion, on the basis of those charts, to talk to a  number of bankers about liquidity conditions both in the corporate and consumer areas and at  banks  And uniformly I got expressions of no concern  They didn't see evidence of corporate  sector problems and they didn't see evidence in the consumer sector  [Their views] supported the  kinds of figures that have been mentioned about delinquencies in consumer loans and they felt  reasonably comfortable as far as their own situations were concerned     I raised the question as to whether they might have said the same thing in 1974  They said  that's possible--that things can happen of which they're not aware and can happen fast--but they  don't think so  They're really much more aware of the problem than they were at that time  So this  gives me some feeling of reassurance that we're not going to have that kind of crunch [or] up and  down situation  I think it's going to go out with a whimper, if it goes out, rather than a bang      Mr Chairman, for the last month I've been on the morning call and, up  until recently, I have shared the opinion the market had, as reflected in the Wall Street Journal  article this morning, that the fed funds rate had been held remarkably under control--I think  because of the Desk's precision--and that the aggregates were behaving  And actually we were  having a rally in the bond market and it looked as though we could come into the meeting with a  more comfortable feeling about where we were  However, with the aggregates projected as they  are, I think we don't have that luxury  So my proposal would be quite similar to yours, Mr  Chairman, with some modifications  I would have an M1 range of 4 to 8 percent and an M2 range  of 6 to 10, with a funds rate range of 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 and a money market formulation [of the  directive]  My inclination on the international is not to move precipitously for that reason  I would  be influenced mainly for domestic reasons, relying on other kinds of devices which you've cited as  possibilities to deal with the international situation  But I think what I'm suggesting would be  consistent with that Where I might differ is in the promptness of action  I think I'd be more  inclined to let the aggregates move the rate rather than move promptly with the rate itself      Mr Chairman, do I understand this initially to be a contravention of the  instructions that we gave the Desk as to promptness of movement?      What does “initially” mean?  Does this have a bearing on the  instructions that you gave the Desk as to how promptly we'd move?      Well, that's the way I read it      Do you need it at all?     8/15/78             33      And it could be understood that the Desk would move as you  suggested      Very briefly, Mr Chairman, I'd just like to join those who have  expressed reluctance on this  That’s not from the point of view of any fondness or lack of fondness  for swaps per se, but I have skepticism as to how much effect this will have and how well it will  work  We're dealing with credibility and psychology here to a great extent  I think our record on  that is not good and I don't see any reason why it should be any better in the new situation  So I  would be very careful about this      I'd just like to say that, speaking for myself, on a matter like this it  seems to me important for the Committee to be fairly united and not to have considerable dissent  on this kind of action     "
818,1978-09-19,"  Jim, I have a question--or really two questions  One has to do with the   Greenbook forecast compared with what I understand to be most of the other forecasts around  As  near as I can determine, the Greenbook is more optimistic than any other projection, and I wonder  if you would speak to that a little bit  Second, it's my understanding that implicit in your  relationships between money growth and velocity and GNP is an assumed fairly substantial shift in  the demand for money  And I wonder what basis there is for that assumption      Well, as my question indicated, I'm a little less optimistic this month   than I was a month ago  And I’m a little less optimistic than the Greenbook forecast, probably  tracing down to the consumer sector where I think there is going to be more weakness than [in the  staff projection]   Housing I suspect may hold up fairly well, basically because it is the only  inflation hedge that the average person has and I think that will hold the demand up pretty well  As  Henry indicated, a very basic factor is the inflation rates that we're having  I think it's quite  remarkable, with that kind of inflation rate, that we have even the moderate growth that's forecast   I think we're doing quite well, given that inflation rate      I am influenced by two countervailing forces, as I guess many other   people are  On the one hand are rates of growth of money that I think are excessive  Take the  September increase plus the revisions; it gets us up to rates that are higher than we really would  like to see  That consideration would lead me to something like a 3 to 7 percent range on M1  But  then the other consideration, which I expressed earlier, comes into view and that is the increased  pessimism about the real economy  So I would moderate my first view on the ranges, reaching  some kind of a midpoint there  I think I would come out to a 5 to 9 percent range on M1 with a 6  to 10 percent range on M2  And I'd go along with your range on the federal funds rate of 8-1/4 to  8-3/4      I would, too   "
843,1978-10-17,"  Scott, how would the market view a recession?      Quantitatively, I have no major difference with the Greenbook forecast   Qualitatively, I have two comments--picking up on Jim's comments about where the risks lie--that  the risks are on the downside for the real economy and on the upside for inflation  I'd certainly like  to stress on the real economy that qualitatively and intuitively I have the feeling that we are  building a good possibility of a recession into our forecast  One reason I feel this is that, looking  back into history, I find no instances where we've had the combination of slow, gradual rates of  decline that the standard forecast has together with the very high inflation rates that we're also  forecasting  That in my experience is a unique combination, and I would have a real question as to  whether that's a sustainable combination  On the price side, I think it's quite clear that the risks are  on the upside     [Let me mention] just one item of information  We've tried to make some assessment of  what businesses think about the President's forthcoming announcement, whenever it's going to be   In particular, we’ve tried to find out if there's been any anticipation of this in terms of pay increases  and price increases  The main impression we get is a sea of vast indifference  [It seems] that they  don't particularly care and they're cynical, to use Scott's term, about what's likely to come of it   And if substantial teeth are attempted to be built into it, they'll resist it  So I think it's a very  pessimistic kind of outlook      I've voted my preferences  I'd just like to join those who would express  a good deal of caution about M1+  Instead, I'd concentrate my efforts between now and February  on devising a new basis for doing this and saving the consideration of M1+ until then      I would go the money market directive  I would retain M1 but give  much less weight to it and have an 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 funds range, and I too would move to 9 percent I       10/17/78 45             think it would be easy to get there and the market impact has already been accomplished with a  discount rate increase      Yes      I'd take alternative 2      No, I'd leave it 5-1/2 to 9-1/2    "
868,1978-11-21,"  Mr Chairman, could I ask two questions?  I'll put them in the form of  comments that you can react to  These are both looking to the future  One, I'm assuming that the  market will look to our policy to be responsive to what happens in the aggregates  That is, they  will not necessarily be disappointed if interest rates don't go up further if the aggregates are soft   Second, my assumption is that as we move further toward the possibly of a recession, [our trading  partners] will be increasingly concerned about the impact of that on their own economies and  perhaps won't be pressing so hard for us to hold our economy down  Would you react to those?      Perhaps there’s a difference between the markets and the authorities  with respect to that       11/21/78              4    Thank you      Well, reacting to what Phil said, I continue to find it difficult to see  how you have this kind of soft landing with the very high inflation rates that are forecasted  And  just on the other side of Mark's comment, at a recent meeting we had with business people, the  view was unanimous that we are in for a recession  I think there is this kind of talk going on      I would agree with Nancy and Chuck  As I indicated before, I think it  would be unprecedented to have the kind of slow rates of growth that are being forecast with the  very high inflation rates that also are being forecast  So I would see by this time next year some  modestly negative rates of growth in GNP with higher unemployment--maybe 6-1/2 percent       It seems to me that we are working 100 percent on a money market  basis, so I would certainly cast the directive in those terms  I would also focus attention primarily  on the funds rate and hold it at 9-3/4 percent  I’d not let it go below that but have a consultation if  it looks as though the aggregates are coming in too high  I would not really fuss too much on the  parameters of the aggregates because it seems to me that when--      A 9-3/4 percent effective rate; a 9-1/2 to 10 percent range is fine with  me    "
892,1978-12-19,"  I have a question about the Greenbook; it’s on this subject and perhaps  Ted could address it  The last paragraph of the Greenbook supplement talks about the prospects for  the dollar in the next year and concludes that with an improvement in the trade surplus and the  relative inflation performance the dollar should about hold where it is  I would have thought you’d  say it might improve  Would you comment on that?      Before this      Well, I would hold steady for this meeting, and I’ll try to give the  explanation for that position  It seems to me that until recently there have been two general  scenarios about the business outlook  One is the one that’s in the Greenbook, which is a gradual  steady downward movement without recession  The second is that that will continue on down  through the zero point and we will have a recession  A third one, which I think is gaining more  currency and which I find more intriguing, is what might be called the ""last gasp"" scenario  [In that  scenario] the economy is now showing strength because it’s in the last phase of expansion  And it  will be seeing a fair degree of strength through the rest of this quarter and the first quarter, which  will lead to higher interest rates than most people are now forecasting--more along the [lines of the]  Salomon Brothers forecast than the Board’s flow of funds forecast--and then lead to a recession in  the second half of the year  I think that is becoming a more and more likely possibility      In view of that, we have been re-examining “Poole’s rule,” which you may remember  Bill  Poole formulated the [rule] that when you have prolonged and substantial deviations of money     12/19/78          18    growth from the trend rate of growth, you will have a recession  We find that we are not in danger  of that at this point, but we have a concern that we might be in danger of that [soon]  And we feel  that we need to be careful about further restraint and unexpected weakness in the money supply     So my position on that account would be that we ought to hold steady now and watch and  see for more evidence with the aggregates  I would prefer a money market directive in that kind of  situation and I would widen the funds range  As far as meeting dates are concerned, I think we can  either have a shorter [intermeeting] period or have telephone conferences  I think telephone  conferences probably could take care of it if necessary         Could I ask a question about that funds rate range?  Steve, would you  contemplate a reduction to 9-3/4 percent?  Does the bottom of that range really mean anything?      As I indicated earlier, my preference would be for alternative A straight  through, but I think that the proposal is acceptable  I do have a concern, as I indicated to Steve in  my question, about a reduction in the funds rate given the international situation  And I’d like to  suggest that if that appears to be imminent we have a consultation on that     12/19/78          28         I think this is a very good point  I had worried about it when that wire  came through about the warehousing procedure  I just wonder whether one way to tackle this  would be to have a staff paper on this, Mr Chairman, which lays out the alternatives and the  implications for the moment of the various ways to go       My point has been covered       Yes, if I may speak just briefly      A good deal of what Paul referred to was produced in the Philadelphia  Bank because we were concerned about the slippage between short-term and long-term  [objectives]  We did a good deal of research on this and we were persuaded that the only way  discipline could be introduced into the process was to have some very direct linkage between the  short- and long-term ranges  However, Humphrey-Hawkins came along just about the time we  were in the midst of this discussion  And in considering the impact of Humphrey-Hawkins on this,  I am persuaded that that itself introduces enough discipline into the process that I don’t think we  need to do it by mechanical means  Now, I may wish a year from now that I felt the way I used to  feel about this  But I think that we do have that kind of discipline in the Humphrey-Hawkins  process and that we don’t need that [automatic] kind of mechanism  And that mechanism does  have other disadvantages         I would just like to say that I did, as Chuck indicated, have sympathy to  this at the outset  I’ve had some reservation since and it seems to me it is not central to the whole  Humphrey-Hawkins process and procedure  And I would suggest, given the differences that there  are, that we not pass it at this time and come back to it       I move that we not pass 7     "
916,1979-02-06," Scott, what conditions would be necessary to  permit a decline in the funds rate without a serious impact on the  dollar? I presume that a decline at this time would have adverse  effects on the dollar   Would it require obvious indications of a  weakening in our economy?   I was trying to find out to what extent they  really want us to have a recession   M R   PAFLDEE The knee-jerk reaction at the moment in exchange  markets is to respond positively to any indication that the US  economy is a little less buoyant After the decline in the leading  indicators, there was some buying of dollars So, any indication that  the economy is cooling off is seen as bullish for the dollar by some  market participants who are willing [to buy dollars] just after the  numbers come through   Well, Chuck has expressed my views about the  projections--the lowness and the smoothness of the dotted lines--very  well and I won't repeat that I would say, however, that the often  [repeated] statement that we have no imbalances in the economy  overlooks the fact that we have an 8 to 10 percent inflation rate, and  I think that's a severe imbalance I suspect we'll have a recession  toward the end of the year   A s  far as the long-run ranges are concerned, I think we need  to give evidence that we are proceeding on a course of systematically  cutting back our ranges to deal with inflation over a longer-term  period, yet not cutting them back so drastically as to precipitate a  recession That's because I think that a recession could be in the  long run the most inflationary thing we could do I have no strong  feelings about the specific numbers that have been cited But I like  Steve's alternate suggestion on M2 and M3 much better than alternative  B Because there is such great uncertainty about what's really going  on and what's going to happen to the demand for money, I'd be inclined  to be on the upper side One way to handle this would be simply to  knock 112 percentage point off our current ranges as an indication of  proceeding on a systematic course of getting [the ranges down] That  would come close to what Steve has suggested with the expection of M1,  which would then be 1-112 to 5-1/2 percent I think that might be a  good middle position   I’d prefer something a little higher   I would prefer Steve’s original [suggestion]   Yes Can I assume, in the part of the report  that asks us to talk about the consistency between [our objectives]  and the Administration's program, that this will pose no problem of  inconsistency?   All right, the relationship   It seems to me that we get caught up in the  formality of our system here as against the reality of the way we  operate In reality, the way we operate is that we have a federal  funds rate that we more or less peg We've been pegging it at 10  percent plus If I interpret your recommendation right--and I would  agree with you that we should keep it there--it seems to me that we  can put any ranges in here that we want and we're going to peg the  funds rate at 10 percent plus and we're going to have a telephone call  if it varies   And there is a significance attached  internationally to what happens to the funds rate   Well, I would hold the funds rate at 10  percent plus and consult if any of us feels that the aggregates are  getting out of hand   I have no particular concern about how we  express this as long as the policy action--   I would buy these  "
940,1979-03-20," I think I understood I’m not sure I agree  Steve, we did calculations similar to the ones you did, although not  as sophisticated trying to find what these other sources of funds  might add to the aggregates--the money market funds, the RPs, and the  ATS We added them back in different ways and just didn’t find enough  money there to add to the actual figures for either M1 or M2 to make  that look as if it could be the full explanation Then the question  is What is left? My inclination is to look at what happens to money  as an indicator of what is happening to the real economy If one  looks at the shortfall in that respect, I think one might come to a  different weighting of these policy conclusions than you did My own  conclusion, even after all these adjustments one might want to make,  is that the weak money supply is telling us that the economy is going  to be weaker in the future, and that that would call for a different  policy prescription   Could I follow up with one more question?   The other part of my question is How much  validity is there to the idea that what is happening to money is  supply induced and not demand induced?   Supply in the real economy [sense or] just  weakness in the--   I was impressed by the Vice President‘s  comment, I believe over the weekend, in which he mentioned monetary  policy and continued restraint on the monetary front as being  important I wondered if the Administration might be starting to put  us in the forefront of--   Well, my view could be summarized by reporting  on a meeting that we had last week with some business people and  [other contacts] The discussion around the table was very optimistic  about current conditions, almost uniformly so, until I took a [poll]  asking who thought there would be a recession this year And about  three-fourths of the hands went up And that’s where I come out I  agree very much with the analysis Chuck gave I think the staff’s  projections are too optimistic I‘m also skeptical about the Bluebook  projection that the money supply will bounce back in the next month or  so I think that the slow growth of money is telling us something  about the real economy and that that has implications for policy I  would dearly hope that we could hold the funds rate where it is in the  next month but I would like to have policy tilted so that if the  aggregates continue to be weak, we could edge that rate down   I would keep the funds rate where it is and I  would use the bottom of the alternative A range [for Mll as the guide  I’d accept any growth in the aggregates above that bottom And if the     3120179 -30-   aggregates started to break through that bottom, I would have a  telephone conference call  "
984,1979-04-27," Yes, I’m on I would hold where we are at the present time  Judging by last year’s experience, as Larry pointed out, following an April surge May and June  were still relatively high If that happens again, I think perhaps we should take action But I think  we need to watch that and I wouldn’t take the action right away  "
1003,1979-05-22," Take Henry's question first, because I have a  question for Ted Truman   This question comes out of the Greenbook  Supplement, so I would like to ask Ted if I may With the improvement  of the balance of payments position, why don't you expect a better  performance of the dollar?   I continue to think that we are going to have  a recession of probably moderate dimensions and I believe we may be  pretty close to a turning point if not there I would agree with  Frank that ordinarily we should be anticipating that and should not  run the risk of overstaying the expansion as we have often done In  view of that, I have spent a little time trying to think through the  strategy for the next year or so In thinking about that I am  assuming that we will continue to have substantial inflation and that  the dollar will continue to be in some jeopardy And if we do have a  recession, even of relatively modest proportions, the budget situation  will turn around and we'll see increased deficits So we will be  getting more stimulus from fiscal policy Given the characteristics  of the situation that we will be confronted with in the next year, I  think we should probably have less easing in monetary policy than we  ordinarily would in a recessionary environment This leads me to feel  that we should not be as hasty to ease as we ordinarily might be And  when we do ease, we should perhaps not be overzealous in easing and  should strive for what Chuck has suggested--the kind of moderate  increases in the aggregates that we need to have for some sustained  period of time With that kind of a strategy fo r  the longer range, it     5 /22 /79  -25-    seems to me that the message for today is that we ought to hold where  we are I'd watch [developments] and not be hasty to ease So, I  would stay where we are  "
1046,1979-07-11," Scott, perhaps you've said all you can say on  this but let me try [a different question] What kind of money policy  do you think would satisfy?   The people who are bearish on the dollar   Reverting to the questions asked earlier about  the shallow saucer that you have and the sluggish recovery, Jim--   Yes, shallow, long saucer It has been said  that the way to lick inflation is to have moderate growth for some  period of time 3 to 5 years or something like that Have you done  any work or do you have any views as to how long this type of pattern  would have to be continued to have some impact [in the sense that]  Mark was talking about?   My guesses on the economy are about the same  as the staff's The exception is that it's my sense that the staff  may have underestimated the fiscal stimulus that might be coming  along In that context, I think the statement to the Congress should     1/11/19 -24-   reaffirm our intention to move the monetary growth rates down in a  consistent, gradual way And I think the specifics that Steve has  suggested would conform with that kind of general thrust, so I would  agree with them   I think these are very real concerns The  main concern on the other side, drawing from our experience with these  targets in the past, is that once we get locked into a certain range  it's very difficult to change And the longer we go without changing,  the more difficult it is to change So if we go this way, I think we  should do so with the understanding that if policy has to change, we  will change the numbers Let's not find ourselves locked into that  same old situation as in the past If we suspect at all that there's  a danger of getting locked into that, there's some advantage in  changing the numbers simply for technical reasons just to change the  numbers   Alternative I1     7/11/79 -45-  "
1091,1979-07-19," My preference among the choices--  Well, I was just about to do so Can you hear me now? I was saying that my preference would be to do nothing at the moment and wait a little while But if action is to be taken, I think the appropriate move is to raise the discount rate I say that because I think that would be an effective signal internationally and would follow the directive up I would announce it on the basis of the dollar problem "
1112,1979-08-14," I share Phil's concern about the precedent I am somewhat concerned, however, about  what would happen--the matter having come this far--if we were not to approve it Would there be adverse [consequences]?  Paul, could I ask one more question? Are there any implications if we were to have a less than unanimous vote on this? Is this made public, Murray?  Votes are made public?  But the votes are made public?  Paul, I was very much interested in your recital of the almost upside down economy that we are in, where usual roles really have reverse implications There is one, however, that occurs to me that you didn't mentioned and that is the possibility that in this kind of world a recession of any magnitude can be inflationary in a longer-run sense I think that's a real possibility particularly if, as I suspect, the staff's assumptions about fiscal action underestimate the stimulus that we would get if we were to have a recession, particularly one of greater magnitude than now forecast So I think it's quite possible that we run the danger of overstaying restraint--creating a worse recession than is now projected, stimulating very sharp action on the fiscal front to get the economy moving, having very adverse psychological and expectational effects throughout the economy, and thus in the long run doing more to stimulate inflation than perhaps anything else we could do All this is by way of saying that my inclination is to be very careful about moving vigorously toward restraint at this time, particularly given the lags that we all know exist between what we do now and the time that it is going to affect the economy  I'd like to end by asking Steve a question because his answers will determine in part just how confident I feel about all of this Steve, on your fourth-quarter projections for M1 and M2, you have something like 4 percent and 7-1/2 percent with any of the    8/14/79  alternatives--""A"", ""B"", or ""C"" Given past history with recessions and what they do to money growth, does that change your confidence level with respect to those fourth-quarter figures?  Thank you "
1141,1979-09-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to take  a little different position than has been taken up to this point I  believe one thing that is very good in the discussion that we have  been having is that we are talking about longer-run strategy--a kind  of cyclical strategy, I think Everything that has been said up to  now is in that vein, and that’s good because I think one of the  problems we have in these meetings is that we tend to operate month-  to-month and get short-sighted My strategy is somewhat different  than Phil’s or Henry’s I happen to think we are in a mild recession  and that the recovery will be a protracted one In that situation I  also think that in our strategy we need to avoid mistakes that we have  made in past cycles One mistake that we have made is overstaying  restraint and the other mistake is overstimulating when the economy  weakens I think Phil is entirely correct that we need to take an  action that [makes] a dent on expectations; it’s just that my course  would differ somewhat from his because I feel we need to take  increasing care to avoid precipitating a serious recession That  would have bad effects on expectations that would ultimately confirm  inflationary expectations because it would precipitate action that  would be designed to stimulate the economy and would in the longer run  have negative effects on expectations   That means that in the current situation I would be willing--  not happy, but willing--to see somewhat higher growth rates in money  for a time than I would ordinarily like to see But that‘s in the  expectation that we will be getting slower growth in the months ahead  I think it also means that we will have to exercise care against  overstimulating as the economy proceeds to weaken, and that means  resisting somewhat declines in interest rates that might otherwise  occur and having somewhat slower money growth than we would have had  in similar periods in the past In other words, [I’m suggesting] a  strategy of kind of leveling off the peak and filling in the valley   There are risks in that, many risks First of all is the  assumption that the economy will behave the way I am assuming Second  is that the money supply in fact will start to slow down in coming  months But for the moment I would take that risk and stand pat; I‘d  stay where we are and live with somewhat higher growth rates than I  ordinarily would like to see If that proves to be wrong and money  growth continues exceptionally strong--that is, above the ranges--then  I think we have to move the federal funds rate up But [for now] I  would stay essentially where we are   I would support Alternative B, but I do think  the arguments for a discount rate increase are good and I’d be  prepared to recommend that  "
1177,1979-10-06," Yes, Paul A quick and informal [survey] of  some people in our area confirms a bit what I think Frank [Morris] was  saying There’s increasing concern about the inventory situation and  the likelihood that the recession is going to be more severe than they  had thought This is on the part of retailers and of bankers who have  some feeling that the strength in business loans is inventory-based  and that it is going to collapse   Could I add one other point? I follow along  with Frank on this However, I think there is one [aspect of making a  change] that is a disadvantage I don’t think this can be a short-run  change in technique because it is going to require a certain amount of  time for it to work out I understand the point that you made about     10/6/79 -15-   meeting the special situation we have, but this is a basic change in  technique And we’ve learned before that it really does take time to  know whether la new technique] works or not There’s a credibility  problem if we launch this and stop and go with it So I really think  we are committed to this if we go [forward]   I‘m thinking partly in terms of the public  impact that this will have If the impression is conveyed that this  is something we are just trying, I really don’t think it will have the  impact on credibility that we need to have   CIiAIRMAN VOLCKER Maybe we lose some, but in this particular  situation I don’t think we lose the whole [impact] or anywhere near  that We may lose 10 to 20 percent of it   Let me comment on a point that has come up a couple of times  I don’t think we are talking about a program here just to support the  dollar I know [different] people place different emphases on that  The dollar is part of the total situation, but I think this is really  all one ball of wax at this point The psychology in the foreign  markets is the same as the psychology at home; it is reflected in the  metals markets It is the inflationary psychology or whatever So I  don’t think of this as a program specifically directed to the foreign  side If anything, it’s specifically directed toward the domestic  side, but it will have foreign repercussions One oE the interesting  questions--it’s very hard to express and I don’t know the answer--is  whether the new approach will carry a message of its own even in the  international markets I would be a little more optimistic [on that  score] than some of the comments I just heard There has been a great  deal of discussion about the money supply and the feeling that so much  of this psychology is related to the fact that the money supply is out  of control That’s the comment we hear all the time The virtue of a  new approach, if it has one, is that we are accepting--with all its  risks and dangers--more of a focus on the money supply I think that  is understandable at that kind of gross level   I have a list here [of people who have indicated a desire to  comment], so maybe I will [proceed] in an orderly way John   There is a question here of how the Reserve  Banks should report all this to their boards of directors I think  some of the sharper directors will raise questions about what the role  of the discount rate is and what their role is with respect to this  new mechanism We are going to need to consider this My guess would  be that we’d view this as a special program for a special period and  that we’d probably want to handle it more through the administration  of the window than to develop a whole new procedure to make the  discount rate a flexible one   Paul, I missed the aggregates figures that you  proposed Are they the same as you had before?   HOW many was it?  "
1199,1979-10-22," I think we have somewhat of a credibility  issue here A lot of people are expecting more from us than we  actually can [deliver], given a lot of the technicalities involved  Nevertheless, having launched on this course, I think it‘s important  that we try to accomplish the results with the reserves and aggregates  that we are aiming for So I certainly would use the full range for  the funds rate I would also be tolerant of seeing the rate exceed  the range for a substantial period and, if necessary, having as many  conference calls as we have to in order to plot the way as we go  "
1220,1979-11-20," Chuck Partee has given the precise  description that I was prepared to propose, though the route by which  we arrived at that might be a little different I start with the  comment that you made, Mr Chairman, about your sophisticated and  unsophisticated audiences, which I think is very much to the point  We have many non-economic factors that are going to be at work here  for some time That’s the real world and I think we have to recognize  that I believe the recession is going to be at least as severe as  the staff has projected and possibly worse than that And I think the     11/20/79 -34-   Fed is going to come under a great deal of pressure as we move through  the first half of next year I believe we are going to be in a good  deal of difficulty with our policy Given that I think right now we  should avoid making the recession worse than it's likely to be, I  think primarily we should [aim to1 meet the targets that we have  specified We do have a credibility situation that in my view takes  first priority I'm not sure ""B"" will assure that in the short run,  partly because of M2 On the other hand, I am concerned that ""B"" may  produce a decline in interest rates too soon ""C"" is more restrictive  than I would like to see so this leads me to somewhere between ""B"" and  ""C,"" which is where Chuck comes out I would leave the funds range  where it is and continue to assume the $1-1/2 billion of borrowing  "
1247,1980-01-08," I'd like to respond in three points One, we've been talking for three years or so now about our basic strategy being one of gradually reducing the [growth of the] aggregates I think your points about the business situation and inflationary expectations and the image are exactly right In view of that, it seems to me that our strategy should be one of gradually reducing the [growth of the] aggregates Rather than alternative one or two, I like the formulation on page 11 of the Bluebook, which has the four strategies And of those four, I like number four best because I think we probably are going to get a tax cut and should plan a gradual reduction [in the growth] of the aggregates in light of a likely tax cut  Strategy four is a progressive reduction in M1 growth from 6 percent to 5 percent to 4 percent in successive years, assuming a tax cut of $30 billion  I'm not arguing the numbers at all, Paul I'm arguing the basic philosophy of proceeding [with] a gradual reduction All right, that's the first point The second point is that I feel strongly that we should not announce that strategy and specifically that we should not announce numbers I think we have a credibility problem and I believe expectations hinge basically on policy performance and not what we say, because nobody will believe what we say until we perform So, I think we should have this as our philosophy but should not announce any specific numbers We can talk about this being our intent  Third, we should reserve flexibility for change in case we want to change our strategy as circumstances develop I was struck, for example, at the precision that's incorporated later in the Bluebook in the forecast of interest rates, assuming various alternatives and combinations and permutations That may be an interesting exercise but I think its accuracy is greatly in question What we should do is remain flexible enough so that we can change and depart from this strategy if and when circumstances require it But that should be the basic idea unless we see reason to change  -33-    1/8-9/80  Yes I didn't address the question of the range, but I think that's right  Well, I think alternative 2 is too sharp a reduction from where we are But around 5 percent is what we ought to have as a central tendency  Well, I would like to respond to Steve's comments about the path of money growth I think where we go on this depends on how smart we are  My conclusion from listening to the discussion before is that we're really not all that smart as to be able to do that And that forces me into the position that if we have as a long- range strategy a gradual reduction of money growth, we ought to figure out where we want to start and pretty well stick to that That puts me, since I came out yesterday at about 5 percent for 1980, with alternative B I don't mean hold to that inflexibly if unexpected things develop, but I just don't think we're able to do the kind of fine-tuning that is suggested by the Bluebook in terms of front loading or rear end loading or whatever I'd just put down 5 percent and stick to it until we decide we have to make some kind of a change  I don't want to prolong this either, but I have some confusion on a related point and that is the role of the discount rate I had been under the impression that the philosophy [at the Board] was that, given lagged reserve accounting, the differential between market and discount rates was not an effective factor in encouraging or reducing borrowing However, in the Bluebook there is a comment in paragraph 18 on page 17 about what will happen if the discount rate isn't changed under certain circumstances and the influence of that on borrowing Has there been further thought [at the Board] about that?  The practical aspect, as far as those of us at the Reserve Banks are concerned, is that we do have our Board meetings once every 14 days and they make recommendations on the [discount] rate With a fairly restrictive directive so far as the aggregates are concerned, there might be some question one way or the other as to what happens to this-- "
1299,1980-03-07," Steve, do you think that by now the February figure is pretty well  understood and discounted by the market?  Yes  I would go to 18 percent and leave the bottom where it is "
1316,1980-03-18," I have just an informational question Steve, some time ago there was discussion about having some papers on the function of the discount mechanism, the rate and so on We now have a new situation with the surcharge and also the likelihood that we'll be making loans to other institutions--in a couple of weeks, possibly In that connection, what are your plans on this background material?  Just a quick technical question It seems to me that April is rather critical to the decision we make today and I am trying to get a fix on your feeling about the probability of those  -18-    3/18/80  numbers Your estimates and the New York staff's estimates, I gather, are somewhat different on this  It's quite a bit stronger, isn't it? Is that the basis for the strong April in both cases?  And New York has them in?  Yes, there's a very big difference  Steve, could you say anything about your feeling of confidence in that?  I have to address myself to conditions before last Friday At that time businessmen in our area were generally feeling pretty good about current business, but I suspect that's changing My own guess is that we are going to have a recession of at least the magnitude of the Greenbook projections and perhaps deeper  -27-    3/18/80  In view of that, my inclination was to go with alternative B But having listened to Steve about the April bulge, I do have a concern about that, which tilts me toward ""C"" Perhaps there is some way of going with ""B"" and watching closely to see what happens and moving later on in the period or of striking a halfway point between ""B"" and ""C"" That's about where I would come out at the present time  I am interpreting this as the best estimate on the part of reasonable people of what's going to happen  Yes I am sure that is true And in ordinary conditions, I wouldn't care We could certainly tolerate these numbers But the point, which has already been made, is that the credibility of the System in that short period of time-- "
1339,1980-04-22," A question, I guess to Ted Truman In the summary of the Greenbook, the staff concluded with a paragraph about the outlook for the dollar, which as nearly as I can remember has said about the same thing for the last year or two, whereas the dollar has    4/22/80  had some ups and downs I wonder if this is because that is the best you can do or [Laughter]--  Just a couple of comments On the theological issue, I come out with a view that we did make a decision back in October and that it was a very fundamental decision and we ought to adhere to it on the down side as well as the up side In my scale of preferences, I'm going to worry more about a very sharp undershoot of the aggregates in the foreseeable months than about too sharp a decline in interest rates And on a more technical scale, if we're going to have a decline in rates, I'd prefer to see it begin and proceed rather smoothly than to try to hold rates up and then all of a sudden have a very sharp drop, say, in the second half of the year So, if it's going to happen, we ought to let it start to happen  Another approach would be to say ""somewhat more or less""  I think your proposition makes a lot of sense It's a good mini-max solution to the very uncertain conditions that we face If you add the idea that we would consult (a) if the rates seemed to be coming down faster than we'd like to see them or (b) if the aggregates were coming in quite low, which in my view would be the greater [probability], I think what you suggested is probably the best we can do at the present time Then we'll just [deal] with it day to day  The only question that remains in my mind is whether or not we want to say ""or somewhat less"" It would be helpful to me if Peter would give me some interpretation of how it would affect his actions any differently if ""somewhat less"" were in or not "
1360,1980-04-29," Paul, could I question Steve? This is Dave Eastburn Steve, do you have any guess about the aggregates for May?  These projections, Steve, were made with a knowledge of what was happening in April?  Paul, this is Dave Eastburn I'm having trouble seeing what the risk is of sticking with our path It seems to me that there's obviously a risk in appearing to panic On the other hand, there's a risk that we might have to back up But I think the long-term movement is so definitely in the downward direction that I can't see much risk either way So I'd stick with the plan that we formulated at the meeting "
1380,1980-05-06," Philadelphia would go with 10 percent, and I second John Balles' views [regarding a public statement by you]  Same for Philadelphia  Philadelphia votes yes "
1400,1980-05-20," I tend to be at least as pessimistic as the projections There's one other factor that could enter in and I wonder if you have explored it, Jim And that is the [potential] catastrophic aspects of this, with large numbers of bankruptcies both in the nonfinancial and financial side--in municipal finances and so on if they accumulate  Well, I would like to shift the argument back to what Chuck started with We really are dealing with probabilities here, and that's what makes it so very difficult There is a possibility that we have had a fundamental shift in the demand for money There is a possibility that we are in for something bigger, perhaps bigger even than the staff has projected It's very tempting to say Let's avoid that kind of decision and just deal with the immediate problem and face this issue later I don't think we can [wait] because there's too much at risk So we have to cast our lot on [one side or the other] And I cast my lot on the side that says the probability is that we will have a persistent shortfall in money growth My reason for this is historical experience A shortfall has tended to happen when we have had recessions and probably will happen even more in a recession of serious magnitude, which is the kind I believe we are going to have I think we should anticipate that and get back to the [money growth] path as soon as we can; that to me would require us to try to shoot for [a return to path by] September rather than wait until December I think Chuck is absolutely right that if the other [scenario] turns out to be the case and we find ourselves with rather large increases in the money stock, we can pull back from that But I believe the risk is more on the other side, and I would prefer to move more rapidly to get back to path "
1447,1980-07-09," I was interested in the estimates of uncertainties accompanying the forecast, which were based essentially on a number of simulations I wonder if you'd take a minute to put that into qualitative judgmental terms and let us know what you think the chances are on the up side and on the down side of the forecast  May I follow up and ask another related question, which is a simple one? How confident do you feel in your Greenbook projections and what side are the errors on?  Well, I'd like to [harken] back [to] what you said earlier and what Fred just said The thrust of your introductory comments was that [people] behave differently these days because of expectations than they would ordinarily  Well, I think it's very true In light of that, it seems to me that this exercise we go through twice a year goes beyond policymaking so far as the aggregates are concerned and goes to the public impact in terms of creditability and expectations I would prefer your statement to be fairly simple I'd say, first of all, that we are reaffirming the anti-inflation stand that we have been maintaining and, consistent with that, that we are going to maintain the targets we had established for 1980 I'd indicate the uncertainties involved in doing that We talked at great length here about the shifts and the uncertainties involved in the shifts; and if we are uncertain about them, [why] talk about that publicly at great length? It seems to me that would not enhance our credibility but would create a great deal of public confusion And I would not indulge in a lot of fine-tuning among the various averages That to me would even further compound that problem So for 1980 I would stick with what we have; I'd do any qualitative explanations necessary but leave the numbers where they are I would confine comments on 1981 to a qualitative statement that we intend to pursue our long-term policy of gradually reducing the rate of growth of the money supply without being specific about the numbers at this time  I think you're entirely right It's not easy On the other hand, if you surround your discussion of 1980 with a good deal of qualitative explanation about the uncertainties regarding the shifts in demand for money, and so forth--and extend that into 1981-- you will have provided the background for a good deal of waffling "
1473,1980-07-25," Paul, this is Dave Eastburn I think that's just fine; I think that's the way we should go  This is Eastburn I would support just 1/2  Paul, I assume that in this letter you reiterated ""in the long term""? "
1493,1980-08-12," If I remember right, Paul, after the change in procedure last fall there was to be a paper written by the staff on this whole question of the [funds] rate and the discount window  I think the legislation came along and preempted that to some extent  It's [further] complicated by the fact that we now have the thrifts in the situation, which involves Home Loan Bank rates and so on  One of the most interesting questions is what is going to happen to housing because that may be a clue to how fast the recovery will be I think the situation with respect to interest rates and the availability of money cuts two ways A lot of people out there are watching mortgage rates and are waiting to get into the market if they think the bottom has definitely been reached Therefore, if they see an upward movement in mortgage rates, that could induce some demand to become effective On the other hand, there must be a lot of other people who will be discouraged as mortgage rates go up Do you have any feeling about that, Jim?  Right before we adjourned, Ed was giving some parameters for M2 I said to him [during the coffee break] that M-1A is not much good to us anymore and M2 doesn't seem very good either, so we're reduced to M-1B, I think  It's the least worst, perhaps  I was just asking whether he had any guesses on that, particularly I'm looking for something in the Bluebook, but I can't put my finger on it, about the presumption that the recent changes in interest rates are going to narrow the gap How confident do you feel about that and what do you think the magnitude of that might be?  I think it is clear that we have a timing problem here It is compounded by the fact that we're in a cycle with no precedent and we don't really know how to time our action On the one hand, Nancy's earlier comment is right that in the discussion about the business outlook we really are basing our opinions on some fairly small evidence over a short period of time That would lead one to alternative A On the other hand, Henry's argument has a lot of [merit] in that we're dealing with an exceptionally difficult situation and we have the possibility of [substantial] growth in the aggregates ahead of us So perhaps we should take this opportunity to move earlier than we ordinarily would to meet that Between those two positions, I come out about in the middle I'd take ""A"" and shade it toward ""B"" There is a one point [difference in the growth rates] in the two alternatives, which is wider than we have quibbled about at times I don't think it's quibbling too much to [aim for] something in the middle That's what I'd do "
1532,1980-09-16," I have questions, Peter, about the discount rate First, has the rate level been a problem for you in the seasonal targets and so on? Second, what is the market sentiment about the discount rate and the changes in it?  Would a change be a substantial shock to the market?  Mr Chairman, I didn't comment in the go- around about the business outlook because I really don't know what is going to happen So it seems to me that what we need to ask ourselves is Where can we make the biggest mistake? To me the biggest mistake would be to underestimate the possible vigor of the recovery That's the mistake we have made so far and I think it would be a greater mistake to underestimate than to overestimate The other mistake is to be too liberal with monetary growth Given that kind of approach, I think alternative A is unacceptable Alternative B is just barely acceptable, as far as I'm concerned; I would prefer something less than that An alternative C of 4-1/4 percent for M-1B would provide more insurance for the year's growth; it would put growth for the year a little above the midpoint, which would give us greater assurance that if we miss, it would still be under the ceiling That, I think, would require us to set a higher range for the federal funds rate of 9 to 15 percent If we do that, we should feel free to use the range as necessary to accomplish those goals That would be my preferred solution Another less acceptable alternative would be a ""B-minus,"" somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" But I think we ought to go for ""C"" and watch in the next couple of months to see if these biases that I expressed are being borne out We do need to do something about the discount rate It may be too soon right now and [the current rate] may not complicate Peter's life very greatly, but we are in a new environment and I just don't know how the rate figures into the thinking of the banks [about] borrowing So we might as well start getting that in alignment and keep it there as much as we can So I think we need to get that up  Yes, I think so "
1582,1980-11-18," Could I ask Peter a question? Peter, would you elaborate just a little on the techniques of the Desk in view of  -20-    11/18/80  the uncertainties in these numbers? Are you operating pretty much as before or what?  The only comment I would like to make about the economy is that I think the Board staff's forecast is inevitably wrong in projecting a flat line beyond the first quarter, but we all realize that that reflects the uncertainty that we face beyond that The first-quarter projection may be right, although I must say I am impressed by how strong the economy has consistently been and how wrong we have consistently been about that strength What that does to me is to tend to shorten my sights and make me less concerned about what may be happening in 1981 and more concerned about looking to the short term And even though we can no longer achieve our targets for the year, I think we ought to stick pretty much with what we had So that brings me to ""B"" I would not narrow the funds range We have been criticized and will be criticized for erratic interest rates but we are equally criticized for erratic money growth And I think the limitations on the funds rate have had some effect in permitting money growth to exceed our targets So I would stick with the range that we already have, do what we can to get within the limits of the targets for this year, and start off as low as possible for 1981 I don't know what the borrowing figure ought to be I have written down a range of something like $1 to $1-1/2 billion; I think somewhere in that area is probably [appropriate] "
1605,1980-11-26," Paul, this is very different May I ask Steve a question? Are you revising the December [projections] for the aggregates?  Thank you  Paul, this is Dave Eastburn I would go along, but I am [unintelligible] My [guess] is we will find ourselves putting in a lot of reserves in if we don't I would certainly favor another [unintelligible] One thing that we are guessing is that the surcharge [unintelligible] It's not having the same impact as the surcharge [unintelligible]  We have in Philadelphia "
1624,1980-12-05," Paul, this is Dave Eastburn I think the more crucial part of the Desk's problem will be how rapidly [to respond] as the aggregates come in low, as I suspect they will I would be inclined to agree with what you said earlier, that we should respond fairly rapidly and promptly to low aggregates figures if and when they do develop  I think we ought to let the rates come down [if] the aggregates come in low Does that answer your question?  I guess what I was [saying], Tony, is that I would agree with Chuck in that I think we are in great danger of overkill here I believe the market is very sensitive to the level of interest rates, and to the extent that we can permit some easing when we see the way clear to do so, I think we ought do it as promptly as possible "
