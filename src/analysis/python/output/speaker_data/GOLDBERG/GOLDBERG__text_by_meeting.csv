7549,2004-06-29,GOLDBERG,"2  I will be referring to the separate package of exhibits that you   should also have in front of you  My portion of this briefing on US external adjustment   June 29-30, 2004 11 of 203          focuses on the exchange rate and trade exposure of US industries  Some scenarios for  closing the US trade deficit involve depreciations of the dollar exchange rate against  other currencies Yet such depreciations do not affect all US producers similarly  My  background material provides various industry-level details  In my remarks today, I  highlight four broad points  First, the most trade-oriented industries of the United States  are in the manufacturing sector and account for almost half of manufacturing  employment There are also some high-trade-oriented raw-materials industries  Second,  these trade-oriented industries are the ones expected to be stimulated most by dollar  depreciation  Moreover, the currency that the dollar depreciates against is important;  US industries experience greater stimulus when the dollar depreciates against the euro  or the yen, for example, than against the yuan  Third, for many industries, rates of  exchange rate pass-through into import prices have been relatively stable over past  decades  While there is evidence of reduced import-price responsiveness to exchange  rates in some commodities, such declines in pass-through may have been temporary   My fourth point is that a few high-trade-oriented industries in the United States may  account for the bulk of the import and export adjustments induced by dollar  depreciation      We begin by turning to the levels of international trade exposure of specific US   industries  We discuss three forms of trade exposure  (1) producer export orientation— the size of exports as a share of producer shipments; (2) the extent to which foreign  producers have penetrated US markets; and (3) industry use of imported inputs in the  production processes—the share of production costs attributable to imported  components and machines  We define high-trade-oriented industries as having export  orientation above 20 percent and import penetration above 20 percent These industries,  shown in exhibit 1, are concentrated in our manufacturing sector and include chemicals;  machinery excluding electrical; computers and electronics; electrical equipment;  transportation equipment; miscellaneous manufacturing, such as toys and jewelry; and  leather products, which is a small industry in the United States Taken together, these  industries account for 44 percent of US manufacturing jobs  Outside of manufacturing,  some raw materials sectors are also heavily trade oriented either in exports or imports   Moreover, if we broaden our criteria to allow a more narrow focus on import  penetration, we can also include apparel, primary metal manufacturing, and furniture  and fixtures  The dark blue bars in exhibit 1 show industry export shares, and the red  bars display import penetration of these high-trade-oriented industries; both bars suggest  producer revenue exposure to international trade  The yellow bars show the role of  imported components in industry costs  The use of imported inputs means that producer  costs rise when the dollar depreciates, as long as there is some pass-through of exchange  rate changes into the prices of these imported components  To the extent that the same  producers are exposed to the same currencies on the revenue and cost sides of their  balance sheets, producer profits are partially hedged against currency fluctuations  All  manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries have revenue exposure in excess of  their cost exposure to international trade  This leads to the expectation that a trade- weighted dollar depreciation would be stimulative, on average, for US industries       June 29-30, 2004 12 of 203          Exhibit 2 presents the countries that are the destinations for aggregate US exports,  as well as those that are the sources of our aggregate imports of goods  Canada and  Mexico together account for more than 30 percent of total US exports and imports   The euro area accounts for 15 percent  Our trade imbalance with China is suggested by  the fact that that country accounts for only 4 percent of US exports but 13 percent of  our imports  These shares of countries in overall US trade transactions are similar to  those used by the Federal Reserve Board in constructing the aggregate exchange rate  indexes for the United States  However, not all industries are exposed to the same trade  partner countries or, consequently, to the same bilateral exchange rate movements   Aggregate exchange rate indexes, therefore, will not reflect the changing value of the  dollar from the perspective of specific US industries       This point is made clear in exhibit 3, which shows the shares of the euro area, Japan,   and China in the exports and imports of each of the most trade-oriented US industries   As shown in the first column of the exhibit, the euro area is a key destination market for  our exports  The implication is that the euro–dollar exchange rate figures prominently in  the export competitiveness of, for example, chemical products, transportation  equipment, and miscellaneous manufacturing products  In contrast, China is a relatively  small destination market for US manufactured goods but is larger in some import  categories  The yuan–dollar exchange rate is significant mainly to the extent that it  changes the competitiveness of US producers relative to Chinese producers of goods  being sold in the United States and abroad       A policy-relevant issue here is whether a dollar depreciation against the yuan would   stimulate US industries  A stimulus would most likely occur in those industries where  Chinese producers compete head to head with US producers  I address this point in  exhibit 4, which presents the amount of US manufacturing employment in industries  with different degrees of import penetration by China  The top row of exhibit 4 reveals  that about 70 percent of US manufacturing jobs are in industries where “made in  China” goods account for a low share (less than 5 percent) of overall goods consumed  by US households  The bottom row shows that high levels of Chinese import  penetration are strongest in those US industries that account for very few US jobs  (only 2 percent of manufacturing) There are few industries where “made in China”  accounts for more than 20 percent of our consumption of particular goods  In the  middle rows of exhibit 4 are the industries with both import penetration by Chinese  producers and sizable US manufacturing employment  Industries such as furniture,  electronic components, photographic equipment, and computers and peripherals are  those that can potentially experience a switch in demand from Chinese goods to US  goods and are therefore the ones most likely to gain from a dollar depreciation against  the yuan       In evaluating industry exposure to dollar real exchange rate moves, let’s first   consider the progression of the dollar against five currencies since 2000  Exhibit 5, on  the next page, shows that the dollar had strengthened against the yen, the euro, and the  Canadian dollar through early 2002, before beginning its descent  Currently, the dollar  is close to its weakest level in four and a half years against the Canadian dollar and the   June 29-30, 2004 13 of 203          euro; it has had a more limited descent against the yen  By contrast, the dollar  strengthened overall against the peso and the yuan  We use these different paths of  exchange rates together with the weights of our trade partner countries in each industry  to derive industry-specific export-weighted or import-weighted exchange rates  Exhibit  6 shows the dollar depreciation experienced by high-trade-oriented US industries since  February 2002, separately presented from the perspectives of US exporters and US  import-competing producers  The recent dollar depreciation for high-trade-oriented  industries has ranged from 7 percent to a little over 18 percent for US exporters, as  shown in the first data column of exhibit 6  The corresponding depreciation for US  import-competing producers has ranged from about 4 percent to nearly 27 percent  A  key point here is that, compared with other high-trade-oriented industries, the industries  that have China and Korea and even Japan as large trading partners have experienced  relatively less depreciation and smaller changes in competitive conditions since  February 2002       As a final theme, in exhibit 7, I focus on exchange rate pass-through into US   import prices  This theme is central to knowing whether exchange rate changes can  induce enough demand-switching out of imports and exports to make a dent in our trade  balance  Pass-through is also important for understanding the potentially major  distributional consequences induced by exchange rates within the United States   Exhibit 7 provides estimated rates of the pass-through of exchange rate changes into  import prices for different bundles of imported commodities The estimates in the left  column are for regressions run using data spanning the late 1970s–early 1980s through  the second quarter of 2004  The right-hand column estimates are for a more recent  period, starting in 1990  The elasticities of import prices with respect to exchange rates  that are statistically significant are in bold print  The first two rows of exhibit 7 show  exchange rate pass-through into the prices of an aggregate bundle of United States  imports  The historical relationship indicates that foreign producers generally absorb a  high share of exchange rate changes in their profit margins in the short run (about 70  percent) and about half of exchange rate changes over the longer run (one year)  A rule  of thumb is that a 10 percent dollar depreciation raises US dollar import prices by 5  percent  The stability of this relationship between exchange rate movements and import  prices in the United States is actively debated, especially with regard to whether  exchange rate pass-through has declined recently  The comparison between the full data  sample estimates in the left column and the recent sample estimates in the right column  is at the heart of this debate     Exhibit 7 highlights three important points  (1) The US dollar prices of beverage,   tobacco, and mineral fuel imports are relatively insensitive to changes in exchange rates,  with food prices only marginally sensitive  (2) Exchange rate pass-through rates into the  import prices of food, chemical products, and some manufactured goods have been  stable over time  A 10 percent dollar depreciation increases import prices of these goods  by a cumulative 4 to 7 percent within a year  (3) Pass-through may have declined on  US imports of machinery and transportation equipment; the relationship estimated  using historical data consistently overpredicted import prices for this commodity in 2002  through mid-2003  This category of machinery and transportation equipment has a   June 29-30, 2004 14 of 203          heavy weight in the aggregate bundle of US imports, which explains why we estimate  lower pass-through since the 1990s on the overall bundle of US imports excluding  fuels  Overall, in my judgment, it is premature to assume systematic and persistent  declines in exchange rate pass-through into import prices  The recent decline in pass- through may have been temporary Import-price observations from late 2003 into early  2004 are back within the bounds of the longer-run historical relationships  We may see  foreign producers reaching a limit on the extent to which they let their profit margins  absorb the adverse exchange rate movements that have occurred  Therefore, more time  needs to pass before we conclude that exchange rate pass-through into import prices is  lower than what is implied by the rule-of-thumb estimate       I conclude by combining these themes in a way that is directly relevant to the   external adjustment process for the aggregate economy  Exhibit 8 shows the substantial  role that the high-trade-oriented industries play in overall US trade—accounting for  more than 60 percent of our total exports and imports  These are the industries on the  rightmost side and bottom of each pie chart  The significant pass-through of exchange  rate changes into the import prices of these industries provides the scope for expenditure  switching between domestic goods and imports  Such expenditure switching within the  United States is particularly feasible in those industries where we continue to have a  production and employment presence  In my opinion, these industries are likely to be  the ones that bear the brunt of trade adjustment in the scenarios for closing US external  imbalances  Moreover, since industrialized countries are the dominant markets for our  exports, adjustments to our international trade balance—and to US jobs—will be most  pronounced for changes in the dollar exchange rate against the euro and the yen rather  than, for example, the yuan  Since Chinese imports compete directly with a much  smaller portion of our products, dollar depreciation against the yuan would be less  effective in the pursuit of a sizable shrinkage of our trade imbalance  Continual gradual  declines in the dollar against the euro and the yen would lead to fewer US imports and  more US exports  Changes in our trade balance will appear to be driven by the export  adjustments  After cumulative large declines in the dollar, some US producers might  expand their market orientation to also focus on exporting instead of just US markets,  and this would then speed the overall adjustment of the trade balance  Although import  quantities are changing in the background, too, the amount of total expenditure on  imports will look relatively unchanged  Thank you for your attention and for the  opportunity to present these points      Let me start by mentioning the response of profits to exchange rate   changes  First, at the industry level, if we use an aggregate trade-weighted exchange rate to look   for the effects of exchange rates on profits of US industries, we don’t see anything that is   statistically significant  If we use industry-specific weights, then we do get a significant   relationship between exchange rate changes and the profitability of US firms   There is another effect of the dollar depreciation or appreciation on US corporate profits   that I didn’t mention—in addition to the hedging story, which comes through multinational   activities—and that is that, when the dollar moves, there is pretty much a one-to-one translation   effect that shows up on the profits of multinational activities  That means, for example, that   when the dollar depreciates, the foreign currency profits of these firms rise in value relative to   June 29-30, 2004 16 of 203          their US dollar profits  And that shows up as at least a temporary blip in the overall   profitability of these firms   I don’t have any direct evidence on hedging activity and the effect that has had on pass-  through and profitability, but some of the implications of exchange rates for profits are reduced   by the increasing role of imported components used in production, which one can think of as   another way that producers hedge foreign exchange rates    Right     Governor Gramlich, may I add that I agree with the outcomes of the   scenarios, but there is also a lot of redistribution across industries going on in the background   here  There’s a shift from capital goods sectors toward export-oriented sectors and the ones that   were competing with imports  I don’t know to what extent the costs associated with those types   of transitions are built in, but that could be an extra drag, at least for a while, that works itself   through the economy    What I’ve done is a bit more limited in that I’ve looked historically at   the effects of exchange rate movements on profitability and the net effects in terms of the first   two bars, which are the revenue exposures versus their cost exposures  And I’ve found that those   effects are a very significant issue for them, as is initially this point about the translation effects   on multinational profits    The other thing I’ve looked at, where there is industry-level detail, is the sensitivity of   exports and imports to exchange rate changes  Those are the two pieces  What we see in that   exercise is that, when the dollar depreciates, the exports of these types of industries respond   significantly, so revenues get a really big boost  On the import side, though, for these industries   it’s a different story  If you look at the overall US economy and at how much we are spending,   say, on imports of transportation goods from abroad, you find that the sensitivity of that to   exchange rates is pretty much zero  And the reason is that we end up having higher prices on   June 29-30, 2004 26 of 203          imported cars, for example, and importing fewer cars, so the balance of those effects won’t show   up in our import balances  So import sensitivity, the amount we spend on imports, is a different   story from the one conveyed by the production volume in these industries since the US   producers will still be expanding their own activities    Yes    Yes These numbers are, I believe, for 2002    Right    Well, if the dollar depreciation is part of the larger switch of investor   sentiment, for example, out of asset holdings in the United States, we’d have higher interest rates   and lower investment spending  In terms of the overall GDP effect, that is offset to a large   degree in the simulations by the expansion of production in export-oriented and import-  competing sectors  I don’t think the scenarios get into how costly the period of dislocation is—  involving the transfer of workers between industries or types of jobs or perhaps a temporary   period of capital reallocations  I think that is the context    We do have a disagreement on what we think the pass-through is    I’m guessing that, in the end, there won’t be as much disagreement about that going forward as it   might appear  Let me go through what the difference is  When I talk about pass-through of   exchange rates, I’m referring to the pass-through of exchange rate movements into import prices,   and I’m giving as a rule of thumb a pass-through of one-half  In the Board’s simulation model, I   think it’s about a third, or 30 percent    It’s about 25 percent in the Board’s simulation model  So we have a   different sensitivity of import prices to exchange rate changes, and that has a number of effects   in terms of what you see here in our materials  Looking at exhibit 5 in Karen’s and Joe’s   material, the disorderly adjustment scenarios, if the pass-through of exchange rate movements   into import prices were higher, there would be more import-price response and more core PCE   response  We’d probably have as well a larger relative price adjustment between imported and   domestic goods, and we would see more of a net export response, more expenditure switching   June 29-30, 2004 37 of 203          going on in the model  That’s how that change would manifest itself in that scenario; a higher   pass-through would give you more inflation and more of a net export response   So then the question is, Why do we have a disagreement?  Part of it reflects how we   estimate this, and part of it reflects how we view the current data relative to history  Is the recent   history most relevant?  Is the longer history most relevant?  What I see is that the pass-through   did decline; it seemed to be lower over the 1990s  But recent price observations, while on the   low side, are still within historical bounds  So which is it?  Do we have a permanently lower   relationship, or are we on the low side of something that historically has been high and low?  I   tend to go with the longer history in part because, after we’ve had a strong dollar period, foreign   producers have been able to be quite profitable and build up their margins  That also gives them   scope for accepting lower margins for a while, but that’s a finite process     One interpretation is that, in 2002 or early 2003, foreign producers were living off the fat   of a strong dollar period, and maybe that’s not a long-run relationship to be locked in  Also if   you think of the Asian countries, China’s prices haven’t been changing against the dollar because   their currency is pegged to the dollar, so China’s competitors might have been more constrained   in moving their prices  Whether or not that is something that can persist is debatable    May I just add one point?  I fully agree, but in addition to the   exchange rate policies in greater Asia, there’s the question of whether demand management there   can ultimately help push toward the benign outcome  If we get increased openness and thus   greater consumption of US goods—so that basically those markets become more of an export   destination for us than they have been—that can help facilitate the export expansion that would   produce a more satisfactory outcome  That said, Asia is still a pretty small share of overall world   spending and that effect isn’t going to be tremendous; but it could help on the margin     I think that’s certainly a possibility  When I think about what the   import-price response to an exchange rate change is going to be, I think of the producer who is   doing the exporting looking at his own costs and his margins over those costs  Based on that and   the markups in the industry and so forth, he then determines how much he has to change prices    So that part doesn’t change even if the company has facilities in the United States or has   diversified the locations of its production  There’s another part to your question about whether   production diversification across markets is in part induced by exchange rate volatility, and   people really differ in their view of the importance of that  I tend to think that diversification   occurs in part because firms want to offset some of the risk by having the ability to move   operations between markets  So I agree with that, but I don’t know how big that is relative to the   total amount of investment and the total amount of trade that goes on   "
