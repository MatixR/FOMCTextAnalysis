  I received the same advice that Kevin did  [Singing] “To dream the   impossible—”  [Laughter]       Obviously, from the remarks that we heard earlier today and yesterday,   there is an enormous amount of strength and resiliency in the economy  Clearly, the economy has   rebounded from a temporary slowdown in the fourth quarter  The specifics that I have heard from   each of the Districts confirm the broad Greenbook view that this is going to be a pretty strong   quarter  I particularly like the quotation from President Fisher that it will be “blowing and going”   during this quarter  A forecast of 3¾ percent real GDP growth for 2006 with perhaps a bit of   slowing in 2007 seems quite reasonable given the data that we have in hand  Consumption remains   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 91 of 167       solid, and despite some less-sanguine reports at the end of last week about some orders, business   investment still appears to be reasonably strong   Since there seems to be much agreement with the central tendency of the forecast, rather   than review my reasons for supporting it—and I support most of the reasons that people put   forward—what I want to do is focus on a few potential risk factors going forward  Not that I   necessarily think that these things are likely to happen, but as Dave Stockton mentioned yesterday,   there are a number of uncertainties in the forecast, which we need to focus on  First, with respect to   housing; second, with respect to energy and commodity prices; and, third, with respect to   expectations in the yield curve and the term premium issues that the Chairman asked us about   yesterday   We have been receiving some mixed signals with respect to the housing market, although   the components that tend to have the most information for assessing the future direction of the   market, permits and sales of new single-family homes, suggest some considerable cooling from the   very hot period in 2005  The evidence that I have from talking to property developers in the   Chicago area and a bit in DC seems to be consistent with this evaluation, particularly in things like   the condo market  We see a lot of slowing there, particularly in the Chicago area—at least from   what I have heard anecdotally  Not only are we faced with the forecaster’s typical dilemma of   trying to predict a trend break or a turning point, but we also have relatively few experiences in the   United States over the last few decades of a downturn in the housing market  So the key concern is   going to be the effect on wealth and on consumption and obviously also on the construction market   In the Greenbook, I believe the direct contribution of wealth to real PCE growth was   approximately 1 percent in 2005, and the forecast is about ¾ percent in 2006, with at least half of   each of these increments due to housing wealth  So, obviously, we have to be very sensitive to the   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 92 of 167       concerns there  In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, even some relatively   moderate downturns or slowdowns in the housing market seem to have been associated with some   fairly important GDP effects   President Stern yesterday made an important point of what’s driving what  Many of the   discussions about the housing market suggest that there will be some sort of exogenous shock that   somehow may send the housing market down, as opposed to the housing market’s being part of the   broader economy in which there are consumption demands for investment and in which houses are   an asset as part of a portfolio  It is important to put housing in that context  In the other countries   where we have seen downturns and GDP effects, it is hard to pull out what part was due to   housing’s lead as opposed to housing’s just being one of the factors affected by a general economic   downturn  So with those caveats in mind, and obviously we have to be careful about extrapolating   from other countries’ experiences, I do think we should be mindful of the potential risks that are   there   Second, energy and commodity prices  So far we have been very fortunate in seeing little, if   any, of the run-up in energy and commodity prices feeding through to core measures of inflation,   and from what I can tell in the discussions relating to the Greenbook, this has been a bit of a surprise   to the staff and a bit of a surprise to the Committee  Now, this may well be due to a confluence of   very fortunate factors that perhaps could be reversed in the near term, or it may be due to some   longer-run changes, which President Fisher discussed  We had some discussion of this yesterday    So, as you know, productivity growth and international competition could be important factors, but   at this point I do not feel that I understand enough whether this situation is just temporary and we   are lucky or whether it is part of an ongoing process  And so I think we just have to be mindful of   the potential risk there  And obviously with the uptick in forecasts for growth outside the United   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 93 of 167       States, which could be associated with an increase in demand for energy and raw materials, further   upward pressure could be put on those prices   Finally, inflation expectations in the yield curve and term premiums  Fortunately, generally   the market-based and survey-based measures of inflation seem to be fairly steady, reasonably well   contained  I share Kevin’s concern that some of these expectations being above 2, 2½, even in   some cases closer to 3 may be a bit of a challenge, but broadly the numbers that we have been   seeing around 2 seem to suggest that inflation expectations are well anchored  And it seems that   one of the great achievements of this body that I have now been very fortunate and very honored to   become part of is the reduction of inflation uncertainty and the reduction of inflation expectations    And these reductions, I think, help us at least in part to understand the very low term premiums that   we have been seeing in the United States   But we must also recognize that we have been seeing lower real and nominal rates and   generally lower term premiums around the world  In talking to market participants, I hear much   less of a fear of an inflation spike in many countries around the world—not that there was a fear of   an inflation spike in the United States—but I think a greater certainty about the direction and focus   of the FOMC and a greater trust is extremely important   This gets back to a point that President Lacker made yesterday about the incredibly   important role of expectations  What we do has to be seen not just in terms of the traditional   backward-looking role of thinking about how the higher cost of capital could affect choices that   people make, but also about our credibility in going forward  Choices that we make may have   opposite effects on interest rates than what we have seen in the past  Raising interest rates in the   short-term may have a damping effect rather than an increasing effect on longer rates   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 94 of 167       If you look to forecasts of economists outside this room and the System, you also see a fair   amount of optimism, suggesting growth in the future  So the lower real and nominal rates in the   longer-term markets do not seem to be due to concerns about significant slowing of the economy   but to differences in views about inflation uncertainty and the level of inflation going forward  So,   particularly since some of our measures—of core PCE, core CPI—are at or toward the upper end of   the range of where I would feel comfortable (and, I believe, from what I have heard, a number of   others around the table would feel comfortable), we have to be vigilant about that  Maintaining our   credibility and the good work that this Committee has done is something that I want not to become   dreaming the impossible dream but something that is the reality and that we can continue  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support the 25 basis point increase in   the federal funds rate target  Obviously the question that we are dealing with now is not just   optimal monetary policy but also optimal information disclosure and optimal communication   policy  There are a lot of moving parts right now, a lot of changes, and so for the moment, I would   probably favor being leaner rather than fuller in descriptions even if we decided to go forward in the   longer run with fuller descriptions, which I think is perfectly reasonable   As has been described, there are a lot of alternatives—not just the statement but also the   minutes  There are speeches, and speeches on communications could be given specifically  There   are also background sessions with key players in the journalism community and elsewhere  So I   think that something on the order of B or even a slimmed-down B would be most appropriate at the   moment  I would not lean toward going to something like A-5 yet  That may provide us with a   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 134 of 167       very good basis for thinking about what we might want to do next time  So I applaud Vincent and   others who helped to create alternative A, in some sense a way to get us thinking about where we   might be moving and some of the costs and benefits of doing that  But particularly given that I have   heard somewhat different views from Committee members about where they, given current data and   current Greenbook projections, would be likely to go, I do not think we want to signal something   too clear at the moment   Also, we have had some discussions about whether or not we can take back 25 basis points    I don’t really see the economy as being on such a knife edge that we will know that it’s exactly 5 or   exactly 4¾ or exactly 5¼  I think it is highly unlikely that we go to 5¼ and get information that we   know that we have gone exactly 25 basis points too much and have to have a retrenchment  It is   more likely that the economy would evolve and then we would think that things had really moved in   a different direction, and if we were to have to move down the line, it would be more than a 25 basis   point move  Historically that has been typical, although not always the case, and has been true both   in the United States and elsewhere  So we should not overemphasize that we will get it exactly right   and that we will know exactly where we will be  We have to be in a comfort zone not only on   inflation but also in terms of where our target rate is  It is useful to think in those kinds of terms   about where we will be going and also to realize that retrenchments are unlikely to be the sort that a   few months later we take back a little even if that’s what the market may be predicting  But I leave   that to others who may have much more experience in that; maybe my view is a little naïve     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  You will hear me singing a familiar   song from last time, although not exactly the same song, and unfortunately I did forget my tap shoes  The   May 10, 2006 68 of 120    song that I want to sing from last time is the continued strength and resilience of the economy plus concerns   about inflation expectations moving out of line   Consumption growth has been moderating a bit, but exactly as Governor Olson said, with the   continuation of some of the changes in the tax laws, real disposable income will still have a boost  We have   seen very strong global demand, particularly on the consumption side in many countries that have been   lagging in consumption  In addition, we are also seeing strong investment demand, both domestically and   internationally, and I think that is something that we have to take into account going forward   As for the key risks going forward, one, of course, is the housing market  There has been a lot of   discussion of that, and I do not think I have very much more to add  We have to see what the lagged effects   of interest rate changes are there, but that is something to be determined   Some puzzles that have persisted since last time concern the lack of pass-through of a number of   things  Of the heightened energy and commodity prices to core inflation, we have seen some uptick  But I   share Governor Kohn’s analysis, or his conclusions from the analysis, that there are some signs but that one   should not be overly wary because we have had a bit of downtick, then a bit of uptick  When we are talking   about monthly movements of 01 percent, a simple rounding error can make things seem suddenly much   higher or much lower  It could be a 50 percent difference from what we expect when we really are just   seeing a rounding error, although we do have to be very aware of this   Obviously, we have not seen pass-through of higher productivity gains to compensation  This   situation puzzles me quite a bit because, historically, by now we would be seeing more robustness of   compensation, not just real disposable income, but compensation  We have not seen that  Productivity   apparently continues to move fairly strongly  Looking forward, I am concerned about this area even though   the current data seem to suggest that the costs of labor are perfectly reasonable  Rather than looking just at   May 10, 2006 69 of 120    the current data but using a little theory to look forward suggests that this may be an area that could be   coming up in the future     Even if there are higher costs in the labor market, are they going to be pushed through to final   demand prices?  We have had a good discussion of the evidence on what has happened in the past  Will   you necessarily see the margins staying up or moving down, and will that cause the changes in underlying   cost to be passed forward?  Potentially it won’t, and potentially there could be large movements  But,   again, we are in somewhat uncharted territory  We do not have a lot of evidence here   Another set of puzzles concerns the yield curve term premiums, and we, of course, have already had   a lot of discussion about those and about the slight uptick in both the survey-based and market-based   measures of inflation expectations  Obviously, that is something that we need to be very, very concerned   about because the last thing that we want is to allow our actions in any way to be interpreted as a lack of   concern about inflation, which could lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations  That said, I certainly   do not see such unanchoring in the markets  Also, the yield curve, although it has certainly moved up from   being flat or even slightly negative, is still showing a difference between the two-year and the ten-year of   only 15-20 basis points, which is not very large  And the much flatter yield curves are a worldwide   phenomenon, driven by factors not just within the United States and not just about US expectations     I also very much agree with President Stern that we should not put too much emphasis on high-  frequency numbers  We have to think about the recent numbers in a more systematic way  What are we   likely to see going forward?  What are the risks going forward, given some theory, given some historical   experience?   Coming back to the theme that I sang about last time—about Fed credibility not being the   impossible dream, but a reality—I think we do have that reality, and it is certainly something we do not   want to give up  Just to tweak President Geithner a bit, I hope his comments should not be interpreted as   May 10, 2006 70 of 120    saying that we want to introduce uncertainty into the marketplace  The last thing that the FOMC should be   doing is introducing uncertainty  Certainly we do not want to be producing moral hazard and having   inappropriately low uncertainty when real risk factors may be out there  We certainly want to be very wary   of that; we do not want to contribute to that  But as Tim said, and I very much agree, we are in a very   uncertain time, and to suggest that we are uncertain about where the economy is going is valuable  But to   suggest that the market participants are not focusing enough on uncertainty, that there should be more   uncertainty, and that we should do something about it is perhaps not the way to go  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I agree with the 25 basis point move at this time  I think we have seen some   beginnings of evidence of heightened inflation risk relative to six weeks ago, and I think it is also very   important, as President Yellen mentioned, that looking back historically, we do not want to get too far out   ahead and then have some regrets  But we also have to be concerned about how our actions will be   interpreted by the market and to think about the longer-run expectations  We have to convey that we do   have some uncertainty about where the economy is going, and I think that is well reflected in our discussion   here and in alternative B   But it is extremely important to keep our powder dry  I really like the idea of saying that not only   will we be looking at the data as we normally do in our due diligence but also we are going to be looking at   things because there is uncertainty  We do not have an ideological view that we must make sure that every   last concern about inflation is stamped out, without concern about growth, or vice versa   May 10, 2006 95 of 120    Also, as I said last time, it is hard to know exactly where we need to go to be at the right level  At   best, we can be within 25 basis points of where we would hope things would be, but obviously, it is quite   literally a moving target since the underlying economy is moving  That said, I think it is very important to   emphasize in the statement what First Vice President Stone mentioned If you look at what we say in line 4,   we do specifically mention that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks,   which is not something that we had specifically singled out before and which I think helps offset the   concern about the phrase “inflation expectations remain contained”   Although we have discussed that inflation expectations have moved up somewhat, I think that to say   they are no longer contained is incorrect  We have seen a bit of tick-up of actual inflation and a bit of tick-  up of some, but not all, measures of inflation expectations  As Vince mentioned, the most recent numbers   coming from Blue Chip suggest that the professional forecasters are not saying that inflation expectations   are moving up  I am concerned that, if we took out that phrase, which we have had for a while, we would   be suggesting that we do think things are becoming unhinged and that might be a self-fulfilling prophecy   moving in exactly the wrong direction  So I think the balance that we have now heightens our emphasis on   inflation risk in number 4 but does not say that inflation expectations have moved too far beyond (and I do   not think they have moved too far beyond) where they were before or that they have become unhinged  I   like the balance that is there between the two   I also like keeping in the red phrase in the second part of line 4; but a small amendment to make it   perhaps a bit easier to swallow and to make it seem not repetitive with the statement in number 5 is that,   rather than saying “in any event,” we simply say, “The Committee thus will respond to changes in   economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives”  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I think as you said, Mr Chairman, putting in number 4 that we are singling out   one of the two objectives—addressing inflation—is going to be perceived as a hawkish move relative to   what we had before  Therefore, I do not think making the additional change is necessary because I think   that has largely been conveyed  Given the relatively small changes in inflation expectations, to even   acknowledge that there are small changes—although saying so is factually correct—goes further than is   necessary  But I share your concern about wanting to make sure that we are very clear that we are   concerned about inflation and inflation expectations     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the last meeting I believe Dave   Stockton, when he was describing the outlook, said that he was a bit schizophrenic about it    Given the comments of President Moskow, it is clear that he is no longer schizophrenic but that   one side has taken over—the dark side  [Laughter]   That does not seem to reflect exactly where   everyone is, but I think the issues that have been brought out in the Greenbook are extremely   important to consider  I, too, have knocked down my growth estimates a bit, although not quite   as much as the Greenbook; and I, too, as many people have said, share a concern that some of the   numbers coming in on both headline and core inflation are a bit higher than I had hoped,   although I think they are still not out of a manageable range    Obviously, payroll employment growth is a bit less robust than in the previous forecast    Since that forecast, we’ve had a little more cooling in housing and some softening of retail   demand  I take a slightly different view of the high tax receipts that have been pouring into the   Treasury because they are not only corporate tax receipts but also individual tax receipts  In   some sense that’s putting a bit of a drag on real disposable income because people seem to be   paying a little more in taxes and, at the same time, labor costs and pay have not been going up    So taxes are potentially a bit of a drag, and the Administration seems able to pursue a tighter   expenditure policy this year than it has in the past, so we won’t be getting as much of a boost on   the fiscal side as we have had    A number of bright spots have been mentioned here, particularly related to business fixed   investment, durable goods orders, and business confidence  But what are some of the key risks   June 28-29, 2006 86 of 177    that we have before us?  Obviously, housing has been discussed in great detail, and so I won’t go   through it in more detail  I noted, as Governor Bies did, the importance of cancellations in   suggesting a change in the way people are dealing with these markets  If cancellations go up   significantly, then a lot more housing stock that is searching for a buyer could be left on the   market  Anecdotally, I’ve heard the same kinds of things that President Guynn mentioned, that   the equivalent of the toaster is perhaps being given out  Such incentives are not showing up in   the reported housing price, but other adjustments are    I’m not quite as optimistic about world economic growth as the forecast is  I think a lot   of uncertainties exist there  We have seen and are seeing a lot of elections, particularly in   emerging markets  Mexico obviously has one coming up very soon, which could have a   significant effect on a very important trading partner of the United States  Also, as a number of   people have mentioned, we’re seeing a lot of policy tightening around the world  The obvious   question is whether the central banks outside the United States are behind the curve or ahead of   the curve  Well, wherever they are, they are moving along a curve, and they seem to be moving   more aggressively than they have in the past  I think the tightening is going to have more of an   effect than has been embedded in a number of the forecasts, not only here but also at the IMF    Another concern that I have relates to something that President Pianalto mentioned—a   disconnect between the numbers that we’re seeing on consumption and business optimism about   investment  My concern is about what’s going to be happening to demand for their products   down the line  It’s certainly disconcerting to hear that one of the largest private institutions in   the world—Wal-Mart—is missing its growth targets fairly significantly  They are a very   important part of retail sales  One could even say that they effectively know what retail sales are   before the numbers are reported because their sales are so highly correlated with overall retail   June 28-29, 2006 87 of 177    sales  So my concern is that we’re having the economy do the right sort of thing by moving   more toward business investment and a little away from consumption, but if we move too much   away from consumption, the demand won’t be there to make the investment pay off  We saw a   bit of this in the late 1990s as we moved much more in the investment direction, but the   investment turned out not to have the kinds of returns that people were expecting  Now we’re in   a very fortunate situation because, even if those returns decline dramatically, a lot of profitability   is out there, as Governor Warsh said  So profits could drop quite significantly, but we’re not   going to see a real problem in the corporate sector, as we might have in other circumstances  I   don’t want to overemphasize this concern, but to me it’s a bit of a puzzle, and I see it definitely   as a risk      Turning to the inflation outlook, people have mentioned both here and publicly a   cavalcade of concerns about the upticks in PCE and CPI core numbers, which have helped in   turn to reduce inflation expectations  Term premiums continue to remain low, and forward rates   continue to remain low  Often inflation seems to have a bit of momentum—it continues to move   up or stays elevated—even as the economy begins to slow a bit  We have to be careful in   deciphering what will continue to move up and what is just inflation that is lagging a bit as the   economy slows  We have seen a dramatic change in commodity prices since our last meeting    Basically, within a few days of the meeting on May 10, almost all the major commodities,   whether copper, gold, or whichever one you want, came to a peak  Since then, oil has come   down a little, although not all that much  I think it’s heartening for the inflation outlook going   forward that those elevated levels didn’t stay that elevated  Although those commodity prices   are much higher in 2006 than they had been previously, oil prices have not increased that much   during 2006   June 28-29, 2006 88 of 177     So what’s going to happen to core inflation going forward?  I think the excellent   presentation that we had, in particular the discussion of the attempts to see how well we are   modeling historical inflation and inflation going forward, shows that we have a long way to go   and that we don’t really understand those dynamics very well  I share Governor Kohn’s   intuition, for the reasons that he articulated, that core inflation going forward will soften a bit   more than the Greenbook projects  I’m not going to repeat those reasons; but as Governor Kohn   said, there’s a lot of uncertainty about them, and we don’t understand all that much    Ultimately, as a number of people have mentioned, it comes down a lot to the type of   statements that we make, the credibility that we have  That’s true not only here but around the   world, where we are seeing inflation rates and expected inflation rates come down quite a bit    That’s something that ultimately we control very directly  In today’s circumstances, when   inflation is not really out of control but is moving up a little, being very clear about what our   concerns are can have benefits in bringing down expectations and perhaps changing the inflation   dynamic  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support a 25 basis point move at   this meeting, and I share the objectives that many of the people around the table have  I think we   may have a bit of a disagreement on how to achieve this objective through the words in the   statement    In the first part of the rationale, our talking about the lagged effects of increases in   interest rates and energy prices and the cooling of the housing market is an important   acknowledgement of what we have been doing and implicitly gets to the point that President   Poole made about mild restraint because it is about the effects of our policy on what’s happening   now and what’s going to be happening going forward    I would prefer not to use the language about mild restraint  First, I agree with the point   that it’s hard to know exactly how much restraint we have  I think President Moskow made a   very good point by looking at the simulations that Vincent has given us to show that such   language, at least in some interpretations, would suggest that we’re not really having very much   restraint  Second, and very important from a communications standpoint, if we say this now,   then in the future we’re always going to have to characterize how much restraint we are having   in the market  So then we have “mild restraint,” then we have “modest,” and then we take off   the word in front  I think it gets us into a very bad dynamic  So I would prefer to leave that idea   implicit  It is important to have it in there, through the discussion of the lagged effects of our   policy  We could even say “lagged effects of current policy,” if we really wanted to emphasize   something like that  But I would prefer to go about it that way    With respect to some of the suggestions that President Lacker has made, I think it’s very   clear that I very much share his objectives and concerns about unanchoring expectations  In each   June 28-29, 2006 123 of 177    of the meetings at which I have appeared so far, I have talked about the importance of   maintaining credibility and know full well the great costs of trying to reestablish credibility once   it is lost  That said, we have to put the movements that we’ve seen in expectations over the past   six weeks in a broader context, and I don’t think they’ve moved all that much  I would prefer   them not to be moving up and down; I would prefer that we maintain very clear credibility; but I   don’t think that they’ve moved a lot or moved in a way that I consider sufficiently large to be   disturbing  So from that point of view, I would be averse to including the word “unwelcome”  I   consider the word “unwelcome” unwelcome in this statement [laughter] because I don’t think we   need to say that or convey it in that way here  We can convey it through a variety of other   means  But I share the broad objective    I’m a bit wary of trying to bring in some of the alternative C language into alternative B   because I’m concerned about the market’s focusing too much on specific measures when we start   talking about the medium-term decline in core inflation  There may, then, be an overreaction to   PCE numbers or CPI numbers that come out, and that would be a bit of my concern  Something   that I very much like in alternative B at the end of the assessment of risks is that we talk about   the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, which is very much   forward-looking and a bit more concrete, which I think is very valuable and helps to clarify our   objectives    Finally, something that Vice Chairman Geithner brought up—I think there’s a tension   between what some people want to achieve and the language that we’re going to use to achieve   it  I concur broadly with the comment that a number of people have made—that alternative B   will probably bring down the market’s odds regarding what we’re going to do in August from its   recently elevated levels  We’re going to be getting some important data  We’ll be getting two   June 28-29, 2006 124 of 177    employment reports, so we’ll get to see whether the lower numbers in employment are   temporary or not  After we see four or five months of data, we will be able to start pulling out   whether something is temporary or not  We have some other important numbers coming up, and   so I support basically keeping alternative B as it is  I think that is the best way to achieve the   objective of leaving our options open but not in any way unanchoring expectations     Thank you very much  As the comments indicate, this is probably the   most challenging time that we have had before us in my long history here at the FOMC  [Laughter]   The mix of continuing inflation pressures and decelerating growth are providing more concerns on   both fronts than I have heard around the table and than I myself have had since I’ve been here   First let’s think about some of the growth prospects  I broadly share the Vice Chairman’s   view that the fundamentals are in place for reasonable growth going forward  Certainly there are   some risks  But whether we are looking at survey-based measures, at orders and shipments, or at a   variety of different things, we don’t really see signs of very significant deceleration or contraction   We see more a moderation that would be either in line with the Greenbook or a bit lower than the   Greenbook     Certainly a key risk to growth that a lot of people have discussed is residential investment    If you look at where we are in residential investment, we’re back only to mid-2003; 2004 and 2005   were incredibly strong years  So being in 2003 is not that bad  If you look at the graph, residential   investment falls off rather precipitously to get us back to 2003 with great rapidity  The question I   have is whether it will flatten out or whether it will go down further  The Greenbook forecasts have   gradually been moving down and now reflect more downward pressure going forward  I think that   we’re not seeing the full effects on house prices reflected in the numbers because in the housing   market, for reasons I don’t think we fully understand, there tend to be queuing rather than just price   changes  So it may take a while for the price data to actually reflect the lower effective prices that   August 8, 2006 70 of 158                                people are seeing Obviously house prices will have a potentially important effect on the wealth   effect and on consumption down the line, which I think the Greenbook does a good job of putting   into place   Another challenge is elevated prices for energy and commodities  Energy prices,   particularly, may be taking a little bite out of people’s disposable income  On the other hand, we   have been seeing continued strong business fixed investment  A small concern I have is, if we   continue to hear about slowing consumption and reports from Wal-Mart and others that retailing is   really slowing, why are these businesses producing?  Are they investing to produce goods that   people will want to buy, or will we see in nine months or a year that maybe some misallocation of   resources has occurred and that things aren’t as strong as we had thought?  There’s no particular   sign of such misallocation of investment  It just seems that there is a bit of tension between the   discussions of continued strength of capital expenditures and the statements of business contacts   that they are going to continue to invest even though they see a slowing coming down the line  This   is a variation of what Governor Warsh was saying—it’s almost as though they are saying that some   other sector will have that slowing, not their sector   In some sense, we should take very cold comfort from the fact that the economy may be   slowing  We had quite a discussion about how there’s not much of an inflation–output tradeoff, but   at least in this period there are real questions of whether you do get much benefit in terms of lower   inflation from slower growth  There may be some benefit, but it seems to be attenuated compared   with the past  Obviously some of the recent numbers on inflation continue to be worrisome, but   fortunately both the survey measures and the market-based measures seem to be reasonably   contained looking forward  Survey measures, whether of the man in the street or of the professional   forecaster, seem to be quite flat  The TIPS rates for both the near-term forwards and the   August 8, 2006 71 of 158                                        longer-term forwards have not moved up much  Some of the near-term forwards have moved up a   bit, but that doesn’t seem surprising given the rise in energy prices that we have seen both from the   Middle East and from issues in Alaska   The real key is looking forward as to what is likely to occur  Are the things we’re seeing   now transitory factors or persistent factors? That’s a very, very difficult call  Reasonable   arguments have been made that a number of these factors, particularly with respect to shelter   services, are perhaps a bit more short-lived  Shelter services are about 19 percent of core PCE and   about 30 percent of core CPI, and obviously they have been leading the band up  As many people   have said, we have been seeing price increases in a lot of areas, but I don’t put quite as much stock   in that because many of the categories in both the PCE and the CPI are arbitrary  The issue is really   what the relative size and the relative importance are  Shelter services and owners’ equivalent rent,   which composes a vast majority of shelter services, are an important piece  I think that there’s a   reasonable chance that this factor is likely to be transitory, although it may last for several months   and possibly quarters  But that is the key question—whether these forces are likely to be transitory   or likely to be more persistent    Coming back to inflation expectations, that’s really where I see the markets both registering   their view of persistence and telling us something about whether they believe that we will keep   inflation well contained  At least so far, those expectations are suggesting that we will  It’s   extremely important that we maintain those expectations  It’s very costly to try to regain credibility   if credibility is lost I think the markets are willing to say, “Well, there may be some transitory   inflation, and we’re willing to wait and see whether to mark up our longer-term expectations”    Certainly once longer-term expectations are marked up, the situation becomes highly problematic   because it’s very difficult to rein in the changes in expectations, particularly in behavior  So   August 8, 2006 72 of 158                                      basically I think we need to keep a very, very watchful eye on where expectations are going  I’m   heartened that they haven’t moved too far despite, as many people have said, high core PCE prices   for a number of years and elevated levels in the most recent numbers  Thank you, Mr Chairman    As I said before, obviously this is an extremely difficult decision, and   I agree with many people around the table who have said that very respectable arguments could   be made on both sides  So I would say that, on net, there are some advantages to keeping policy   unchanged but communicating very, very strongly our wariness about inflation   I think there is value in pausing to see what is going to happen with growth  Around the   table, we certainly expressed different views about what is happening to growth  We know that   we’re likely to continue getting somewhat unfavorable numbers on inflation, but I think the   markets are well primed for that  We’ve gotten some numbers that have been worrisome or   unwelcome and not particularly favorable on inflation, but we haven’t seen inflation expectations   become unanchored  Also, we’ve been seeing that the markets have apparently been assuming   that we are not going to move now and that we’re not going to move in the future, if you look to   the fed funds futures markets; but that assumption hasn’t manifested itself in any increase in the   short-term or longer-term inflation prospects   That’s very heartening to me  If that weren’t the case, I would not feel comfortable in   moving toward supporting a pause because, as many of us have discussed, the expectational   context and credibility are very important  Credibility is an easy thing to lose and a difficult   thing to recapture, but I don’t think having a pause now would lead us to lose credibility  I think   also that it’s important that we see a pause as not being just until the next meeting but as possibly   going over multiple meetings because a lot of information, particularly with respect to inflation,   will come out over time  I expressed my view that we may be seeing some transitory effects on   inflation that are due primarily to shelter services  Within two or three meetings we’ll have a   better feeling for whether or not those effects are likely to be transitory, and I think keeping our   powder dry is very valuable   August 8, 2006 105 of 158                         We’ve been emphasizing not just that we are data dependent but that we are forecast   dependent What do the data say about what is likely to happen in the future?  Saying that we   are forecast dependent helps to underscore that, even though the current data or the recent   backward-looking data are not favorable, we are looking to the future to what the evolution of   inflation and growth is likely to be—exactly what the last line of alternative B emphasizes  I   think, one, it’s what we should be doing and, two, it’s important for people to see that  So I   would favor going with alternative B or having the language in alternative C  I’m not sure the   alternative C language adds all that much more, given the fairly strong statement that we have in   the assessment of risks, because I think that is likely to lead to a somewhat changed expected   feds funds futures curve—to leave some probability that we may move and that this is not a stop    Certainly, if our pausing is interpreted as a stop, we need to pursue a communication strategy to   convey that it is not a stop and that a pause does not mean just one meeting but possibly multiple   meetings as we are gathering more information, particularly about the transitory versus persistent   effects of inflation, and are keeping a very careful eye on the effect of both short-term and long-  run inflation expectations    I think it would be odd to take out the reference to housing, given   that we have mentioned it a number of times in the past  The rationale clearly says that it’s   “partly reflecting” and then gives a number of factors  It is not saying that those factors are the   only ones Also, I don’t interpret this language as being simply about what happened in the past;   “has moderated” is also talking about where we are—that growth is not as strong as it was  I see   August 8, 2006 112 of 158                                   that language as having a forward-looking aspect to it  I think it would be very odd to take   housing out, partly because it’s factually accurate, even if you take the historical view, and partly   because, given our discussions around the table, we are concerned about “gradual cooling”  It is   appropriate to leave the reference in    I’ll be very brief  I think a number of the points that Vice Chairman   Geithner made are excellent, in particular his emphasizing that we have to think about this as a   package but not as necessarily meaning that we must implement everything at once  We may want   to see how the pieces are working before we do that, but we do have to have the ultimate goals in   mind  We need to have the whole thing together before we can start moving forward because it   could be quite dangerous to change some aspects of communication policy but then realize that, if   we want to do something else different down the line, we’ll have to change them again  So I think   that approach is exactly the right one   Also because what we’re doing relates to any changes, we have to think about the dynamics    We see this now in the persistence of certain words in our statements  We use the word once, but   then do we use it again or do we not use it again?  Individual words take on an incredible amount of   importance  Now, one way to solve that problem is perhaps to put out more and more words so that   each one is diluted [Laughter]  An awful lot of private-sector resources were devoted to the   three-letter word “yet” that came out of one of the statements, when I believe that not a single   member of the FOMC even noticed it  I think that is problematic  I’m not quite sure of the best   way to solve that problem, but I think we have to be very sensitive to that   On the issue of the one versus the whole, the markets have a very strong perception of   coordination among us  The notion that the Governors are independent and that the Federal Reserve   Bank Presidents are independent is considered laughable  When people ask me about that, they say,   “Well, doesn’t he tell you what to do?”  I say, “No, no one tells anyone what to do”  Maybe you’d   like to, [laughter] but that’s not how it operates  Part of that notion is just a perception, and so   having people speak at the same time may not be much of a problem  But the perception is that it’s   a coordinated effort rather than a series of individuals who are expressing their views, and I think   August 8, 2006 145 of 158                                                 communicating the extent of our independence or the extent of our coordination is something that   would actually go a long way toward things  I was one of those academics that Don referred to as   putting up those tables and trying to figure out whether we were independent or not, sort of rating   us But that is not what we’re supposed to be doing, and I hope my comments will not be taken in   that context   One final remark is that we have to be modest about what we’re trying to do  Part of this   discussion is the way of conveying our uncertainty  I would close my class on money and banking,   and I’ll close my remarks here, by presenting a fantastic New Yorker cartoon It relates to the   former Chairman and shows someone praying, just before going to bed, about the former Chairman,   that he knows what he knows, he knows what he doesn’t know, and he knows the difference It’s   important for us to be able to try to convey to the markets that we know what we know, we know   what we don’t know, and we do know the difference    Thank you very much  Unfortunately, I think we find ourselves in an   uncomfortable position like that of six weeks ago, with a continuing mix of inflationary   pressures and decelerating economic growth at the same time  I think the fundamentals are in   place for a continued moderation of growth but not a contraction, much as the Greenbook   describes Obviously, housing is a risk that everyone has talked about  But the key, as many   people have also mentioned, is maintaining contained inflation expectations, and that comes   down to thinking about whether some of the factors that we’ve been seeing have been more   transitory or more persistent   Let me first talk about growth and go through the C plus I plus G plus net exports  I   would agree with the staff’s characterization that world economic growth is not quite as strong as   some others have put forward  I don’t think we’re going to be seeing an enormous export boom    Also, as briefly mentioned, I see very little on the government stimulus side  Tax revenues, as   Governor Warsh mentioned, were very high  Spending is being kept relatively tight  On   September 20, 2006 81 of 132            investment, we’re seeing some strength in capital spending  My concern is, if consumption goes   as low as the Greenbook suggests, what the return on this capital spending will be  Is it going   into the right areas?  I was a little concerned when President Poole mentioned that the air freight   company is expanding rapidly but the on-the-ground delivery company is not expanding at all    So are they going to have to invest in parachutes to get these in?  [Laughter]  But that is precisely   the concern that I have—that capital spending may not conform perfectly to what consumption   demand is going to be  We certainly saw this in the late 1990s and early 2000s  I’m just a bit   worried about that now, especially given the potential tension between slowing consumption and   robust investment growth   Now, regarding consumption—we’ve talked about the potential support from lower   energy prices and some positive wealth effect from stronger equity markets, but obviously   housing is one key here It’s a key partially in overall investment but also in the uncertainty that   it causes in consumers’ minds  Housing is one of the worst areas for data  It’s very difficult for   us to have any concept of what prices are doing because it’s not a market like any other  We do   have the Case-Schiller index, and we do have some better indexes that people are now betting   on, but they’re still very poor indicators of prices relative to the indicators we have in other   markets  We also know that there can be queues and that extras can be thrown in, so there’s a lot   of uncertainty with respect to where prices are going  That concerns me quite a bit because I   think we just don’t have a good handle on it Permits and starts have continued to come down   from where they were at our last meeting and are now at levels of the beginning of 2003 or even   starting to slip into 2002 If they flatten out there, the housing sector is still historically   reasonably good But there’s no indication that we’re necessarily at a turning point and that   things are going to flatten out There is the wealth effect, the direct effect on people’s   September 20, 2006 82 of 132                         consumption behavior of lower wealth going forward, and also the confidence effect  We don’t   have a perfect analogy with the previous times in which we’ve seen these housing downturns—   we have a different context in that the economy is broadly more robust—and so I think it’s less   likely that we’re going to see a major housing problem  But I think it is a real risk, and we have   to be sensitive to it   On the inflation outlook, we have to come back to transitory versus more-persistent   components, as many people have mentioned in the discussion  Obviously, people are heartened   that energy prices have come down, but I certainly would not put the same bet on the energy   markets that one trader did in a hedge fund that got into a little trouble recently because we know   that energy prices can move in ways we don’t expect  So I don’t want to take too much from   that I think it’s appropriate in the Greenbook to use the market’s expectations  What measure   do we have other than market expectations? If we did have a better measure, then we’d be   running one of those hedge funds However, there’s a lot of uncertainty around that measure  So   I certainly don’t want to bet on better inflation going forward just because we’ve suddenly seen a   15 percent decline in oil prices over the past six weeks  That said, it’s heartening that energy   prices are unlikely to lead to greater inflationary pressures going forward than those when we   paused six weeks ago   The rise in compensation is obviously troublesome—not if you are an employee   receiving the higher compensation, but from our point of view  However, a lot of tension is in   those data because we have the compensation numbers versus the ECI  There’s a big statistical   discrepancy between gross domestic income and gross domestic product  It’s possible that some   of the increase in compensation will be revised away, and we’ll see actually higher productivity   growth We just don’t know, and it may be a while before we see it  Also, as we discussed a lot   September 20, 2006 83 of 132                             last time but not this time, the continuing fairly wide margins that businesses are experiencing   may come under more pressure and may absorb some of the increases in labor compensation   How much is uncertain, but that may be one potential offset   As many people have said, we can’t become complacent  Inflation expectations have   behaved reasonably well since we paused at the last meeting, which is heartening in that the   markets believe that inflation is reasonably under control in the near to medium term and even in   the longer term  It’s hard to find evidence of increases in inflation expectations, but as many   people have said, that does not mean that we don’t have to worry  We have to worry a lot   because the key is keeping those expectations well contained  I think we’re in a situation in   which we can do that Slowing growth is not going to give us more of a benefit  The flatness of   the Phillips curve, which people have talked about, is what the data have been over the past ten   to fifteen years in the United States and most other countries  So even if there is a bit more   slowdown, we are not necessarily going to get the potential benefit in significantly lower   inflation pressures—maybe a little but not very much  So we still have to worry about the upside   on inflation, and that’s why maintaining our credibility is of utmost importance    It’s called the hot seat [Laughter]    From a prudent risk-management perspective, I think we made the   appropriate decision to pause at the previous meeting, and again from a risk-management   perspective, I think we should continue to pause at the moment  Certainly there are downside risks   to the outlook that we have talked about  The lagged effects of the interest rate increases are still not   in, and there is a lot of uncertainty with respect to the housing market   With respect to the way the markets reacted to our statement from last time, I am   somewhere between President Stern and the person formerly known as the Vice Chairman of the   FOMC, Governor Kohn  [Laughter]  I think that the markets reacted broadly reasonably in terms of   the level of expectations to what we had said, but I find it a bit hard to understand their apparent   thinking that there is little uncertainty about where we are going or where the economy is going  So   I am somewhere between those two  Certainly I have had people say, as many people around the   table have heard people say, “Where exactly is your comfort zone on inflation?  Is it moving up?”    But if you look at the surveys, you do not see that; and if you look at the TIPS spreads and other   places where people are putting their money where their mouth is, you’re not really seeing that  So   I am not quite sure how to weigh those reactions  Obviously I do not want inflation expectations to   become unhinged  That would be very, very costly, and certainly there is a nonlinearity in trying to   put the hinge back when the hinge has come off  But the situation we are in is very different from   that Even though I think that we need to convey to the markets our concerns about inflation risks, I   would not favor alternative B+ because it takes away some of our flexibility going forward and also   suggests more certainty about what we will do next  There was a lot of uncertainty around the table,   and our concern that the markets are thinking that we are too certain might push us in the other   direction   September 20, 2006 109 of 132                                                 However, I would like to put on the table a suggestion for a change  In alternative B,   section 3, we have added the phrase “on balance” in the first sentence  “Readings on core inflation   have been elevated on balance”  The innovation of the two words “on balance” is perfectly   reasonable because, as the Chairman said, the data on inflation since the last meeting have probably   been slightly on the lower side of expectations rather than on the higher side and many of the   three-month measures of inflation peaked earlier  But I am a bit concerned that, with just the small   amount of data that we have seen recently, by saying “on balance” we are making the qualification   that it is only on balance and that we are not so concerned about the elevated levels  I think this also   reflects some of the concerns of the people around the table  So I put out for discussion that we   consider deleting “on balance” because, from my prudent risk-management perspective, I think we   shouldn’t be making a particular commitment about that at the moment   I would object to the B+ language; I think it takes away some of our flexibility, which is not   a prudent thing to do at this time  On the point that was raised about the difference between the first   sentence and the subsequent sentence in the discussion of energy, I think the energy discussion   clearly relates to headline inflation and that there certainly is some effect of energy prices on   headline inflation I do not think it is inappropriate to acknowledge that at that place     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d actually like to start with a plea based   on something that President Fisher said  I’d like to be treated like a welder  Can I get a show-up   bonus?  [Laughter]     As everyone has said, there has been relatively little information to   change people’s outlook fundamentally  We have the same sort of tension that we’ve had   before—slowing growth but persistent inflation  Although we see some signs that inflation is   coming down, it is still persisting at a higher level than many people, including me, would like it   to be  Despite the slowing housing market, private domestic final purchases continue to be   reasonably robust  The low third-quarter numbers in the Greenbook are really due to some   volatile areas, some special factors  inventories reflecting the weakness in the auto sector, some   changes in the auto sector, and timing of defense purchases  Net exports also tend to be fairly   volatile     The suggestion is that maybe this low is just temporary, as the Greenbook has said  Also,   virtually everyone around the table has suggested that the labor markets are really quite robust    Exactly as Governor Warsh said, some of the recent numbers suggest that compensation is on the   October 24-25, 2006 67 of 203    rise, although the ECI is still not quite as robust as some of the other measures  Certainly we   could have a benign scenario in which the continuing high profit margins absorb some of these   higher labor costs without necessarily leading to higher price pressures down the line  But the   high equity markets may also be supporting high demand, or the recent increases in the equity   markets could be to some extent offsetting the decreasing wealth effects from the housing   market  Obviously, there could be a tension if the markets start to come down and profits aren’t   quite as robust as people have been projecting  We also may have other temporary factors that   seem to be boosting domestic final purchases—the decline in prices for oil, natural gas, and   gasoline  I hope that the lower prices will persist, but certainly the energy sector is extremely   volatile with prices moving around enormously; and as a number of people mentioned, there are   a lot of potential problems down the line that could lead to higher energy prices  One thing that   didn’t lead to higher energy prices this year was a very benign climate  We had unusually good   weather this year  Last year and the previous year, we had unusually bad weather  So I don’t   know whether a number of factors are just making us have a bit of luck right now and are   perhaps temporarily boosting demand   What does this mean for inflation?  As we always say, there are transitory factors, and   there are more likely to be permanent factors  We’ve talked about some measurement issues   with respect to owners’ equivalent rent—probably that’s something transitory  We’re certainly   not certain about that  As for energy shocks, we have very little evidence that there has been a   lot of feed-through from energy shocks to core inflation, and as a number of people mentioned, I   don’t think we can rely too much on the decline in energy to say, “Well, it didn’t get there on the   way up, but it will help us on the way down”  I don’t see a good basis for relying on that   asymmetry  There is the standard output gap story, but from discussions around the table and   October 24-25, 2006 68 of 203    certainly from the Greenbook, I think there is not an enormous output gap to rely on to bring   inflation down, even if one believed that that gap has an important effect—and there is vanishing   evidence that it has an important effect     Then there’s the role of expectations in the economic models—the multiple equilibriums   story  Just our markets’ belief that inflation will be relatively low going forward affects   price-setting behavior, which affects the willingness of consumers to pay more for goods and   services  That leaves us with a benign but very fragile scenario  As we know, with any so-called   multiple equilibriums situation, it’s not clear exactly what is driving expectations  Obviously,   part is their belief in the people around this table, which is something that is incredibly   important; it’s something that we really need to maintain, but something that we don’t   understand very well  In these five weeks, we haven’t had much change in the fundamentals, but   I am left just as uncomfortable about really understanding the inflation situation, the short-run   inflation dynamics, because we have an output gap approach, an energy shocks approach, an   expectations approach, and sort of a measurement approach with owners’ equivalent rent   I take a bit of each of these, and there has been a lot of discussion of the different ones   around the table; but I don’t think we have a good, overarching view of what is driving inflation,   what the key inflation factors are  For me, that’s one of the most worrisome things going   forward because I find it hard to put all of them into a consistent framework  It would be   valuable for us to think a great deal about that  Certainly, it may come up in the discussion of the   communication strategy, but it’s something that I’m trying to face more and have found it more   difficult to understand   We’re going to get an enormous amount of information  We have holiday retail sales   coming up, so we’re going to find out a lot about consumption  We have two employment   October 24-25, 2006 69 of 203    reports coming up  We have two rounds of ISM, preliminary revised GDP, ECI, and a lot of   information on the housing market  We’ll probably find out a lot more, because in the colder   areas the housing market tends to slow down naturally  The seasonal is very strong there  So we   should know from some of the data in December whether the numbers from permits, which   suggest that the housing market is continuing to go down, or the starts numbers, which seem to   be flattening out, show where we are likely to be at the beginning of next year  There’s a lot of   uncertainty with respect to both the economy and inflation  In particular, my inflation concerns   come from not having an overarching way of understanding whether the factors that we talk   about as temporary are really going to be temporary  Thank you     I support no change at this time  As many people have said, we’ve had   very little new information to change our views from the last meeting, and I think that the position   that we’re in is consistent with growth a tad under trend potential, whatever word we might want to   use  I share Rick’s caution about being too explicit about that because I think there’s a lot of   controversy about what that precisely means, and I don’t think we want to get into that in this   statement or at least not at this point  Also, we have seen some inflationary pressures come off    Inflation has been evolving a bit as I expected  I was talking about the temporary factors versus the   more-permanent factors  The key temporary factor seems to have been a temporary elevation in   owners’ equivalent rent and the way we put that into our core CPI and PCE; so some of it is a   measurement issue  Some of it is a transition in the housing market away from purchases toward   rental  That seems to have come off a bit, and so going forward, it does seem as though we’re   unlikely to have that continuing at elevated levels    My concern, as I mentioned yesterday, is that I don’t understand the path or the dynamics   going forward  Certainly we have some simulations in the Bluebook which are very, very sticky    October 24-25, 2006 114 of 203    Inflation seems to evolve very slowly, or very little seems to affect it  Part of that seems to be, if we   look at the data, that the energy price run-up appears not to have pushed much on inflation, so I   don’t think we can rely on the energy price decline to give us much benefit in terms of core  Recent   data on output gaps don’t seem to suggest that there’s much empirical evidence that a change in the   cyclical behavior of the economy is going to have an important effect on inflation  Expectations   certainly potentially have a very important effect, and I think we have seen a reduction in inflation   expectations and inflation compensation, both in survey measures and in TIPS spreads or other   market-based measures  But as I mentioned yesterday, that is a very fragile thing  The process is   something that I don’t fully understand  Obviously, our credibility is very important, and our   statements are very important  But it does seem as though the minutes and speeches have helped to   clarify what our position is  If you look at the evolution of the expected fed funds rates in Vince’s   exhibit 1, you see that not much change has been expected over quite a bit of time now and maybe   25 basis points is expected a year hence  That position is different from our position a few months   ago  I think it’s an appropriate position given our discussions  It leaves us a lot of flexibility to   respond either to surprisingly strong growth, to surprisingly strong inflation numbers, or to   surprisingly weak housing  So I think that market expectations are in a reasonably good position in   the near term  We do have to think about the longer-term issues that President Lacker has raised   and that may come up in our discussions of communications   Speaking of communications, in particular the statement—we’ve been talking a lot about   how the Committee is focused on data and the role of data and our forecasts  Because not much   data have come in and our views have not changed a lot, I think we should not be changing the   statement much  That is consistent with our view that we are really focusing on the data  In   particular, I don’t like speculating about a particular number, especially when that number is going   October 24-25, 2006 115 of 203    to be revealed in a few days, for three reasons  One is the potential embarrassment factor if we’ve   missed the number  The second is that, even if we have very high confidence that we have gotten   the number roughly right, getting it right only feeds the view that a lot of market participants have—  and I’m sure you’ve all heard this—that we know something the rest of the world doesn’t, that we   know these data before the rest of the world  I don’t—maybe some of you guys do [laughter]—at   least the staff has not revealed any of that to me  Third, what we’ve been trying to say is that we   look at a mosaic of data; we don’t look at any one piece, and to emphasize one piece is problematic    So that said, obviously the type of approach that Don was discussing is one that I would support    But I do think it is very important to make sure that we have a good understanding, in the context of   that statement, of what “moderate” would be interpreted as  Obviously it will be very important in   the minutes to make very clear what that is, and obviously with our blackout period, it will take us a   while before we can make explicit statements if there’s confusion in the market  So I do think we   need to think about the interpretation of “moderate”  However, I like the idea of conveying that the   economy is likely to be coming back, perhaps not at the robust pace that we’ve seen in the past but   at a reasonable or moderate pace   Given that energy prices and commodity prices have come down, we should be taking out   that energy prices and commodity prices are pushing up inflation or seem to be sustaining inflation   pressures  Also given that we have not seen much change in the data or have not made much   change in our approach, there’s really no reason to change the assessment-of-risk discussion,   particularly as the markets seem to be interpreting our assessments roughly where we think is   reasonable considering the risks going forward  If the markets were interpreting things as they had   been interpreting them a month or two ago, we may have wanted to change our statement, but I see   no reason to do that now   October 24-25, 2006 116 of 203      This is certainly something that I am very supportive of, but as I had   mentioned, I was concerned, as Governor Warsh and others were, about the interpretation  Would it   make sense to use the word “poised” rather than “likely,” or do you think that would be a mistake?     I don’t know why President Fisher pointed to me when he said that  I   do not endorse his approach  [Laughter]  Certainly, I think it’s appropriate—since we’re getting   very close to or maybe have passed our lunch, when we’ll talk about the 100th anniversary of the   Fed—that we are thinking about something that is really quite historic here, potentially a major   change in the way that policymaking is undertaken at the Federal Reserve  The memo that we   have is excellent  The discussion that we have had has been excellent  Even if it has been a bit   lengthy, these issues are important, and it takes time to make sure that our views are aired  After   all the views that have been aired, however, I can add little, so I’ll give just a very short   indication of some of my thoughts, keying off what a lot of others have said     The way that I think about the issue is that we have our dual mandate, and we should do   everything thinking about how best to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment   growth consistent with low and stable inflation  The question is, Does being more explicit about   what “price stability” means help us to get to our objective better?  I think in many   October 24-25, 2006 181 of 203    circumstances that it can  People have brought up issues about whether or not it could interfere   with that, and it’s very important that it not in any way be interpreted, either by the Committee   members or the outside world, as being inconsistent with our ability to achieve that dual   mandate   One concern that I brought up yesterday was that I don’t think we understand short-run or   intermediate-run inflation dynamics very well  I want to make sure that we don’t overpromise    When you look at the one example in the Bluebook simulations that gets inflation down to   1½ percent over quite a long period, you see that it would require us to move our policy rate up   100 to 125 basis points for the next year to two years  That strikes me as a very different   approach from what many people around the table would be willing to take, although perhaps if   we did have an explicit 1½ percent goal, people would be willing to do that  But it’s very, very   important to make sure that we understand whether we think that’s the right path  That is the   consideration that President Yellen brought up yesterday  There are a number of issues with   those simulations, such as the foreign exchange movements and other things, that may make us   uncomfortable with them  If we don’t understand the path very well, it is very dangerous for us   to be making even long-run commitments to something when we’re not quite sure how we can   get to it  We know that in the very long run we can get there  But if it’s so long that we’re not   achieving it in real time, that can actually undermine our credibility and make us appear less   transparent rather than more transparent  So I just want to make sure that we work very hard to   push our understanding of inflation dynamics and that we know how we can achieve the goal if   we enunciate such a goal  As I said, in many, perhaps most, circumstances enunciating such a   goal can be valuable, although taking a particular number at a particular horizon could be   problematic   October 24-25, 2006 182 of 203    To get the main benefits and give guidance to the markets, we would want the goal to be   a consensus decision rather than everyone’s having his or her own goal, which could result in   less transparency and less credibility  I think it could affect the way that we undertake policy  In   some sense, if it doesn’t, then what’s the point of doing it?  It has to have some effect; otherwise,   it won’t be credible to the markets, and then it’s simply not worth the candle  As I said, in that   context, we have to make sure that we understand inflation dynamics very well so that we can   explain to the world what the consequences of the goal would be for maximum employment   growth and the evolution of the economy  Thus my main concern is that we don’t know enough   about the short-run or intermediate-run inflation dynamics to feel comfortable with articulating a   goal  We could articulate a goal in a general way—as a range, say—and not be tied down to a   particular number that could be revised  That would be helpful; but in making all these   decisions, we have to be very mindful about understanding how we can achieve the goal     Last time several of us noted that there would be an avalanche of data   between the last meeting and this one [laughter]—two employment reports, two rounds of ISM,   GDP, ECI, compensation revisions, all of that  But it seems from the discussion here that we’ve   actually gotten very little new information, with one exception, and that relates to Dave   Stockton  We heard that not long ago he was on the psychiatrist’s couch dealing with a   schizophrenia issue of whether the economy is going up or going down  But now we know that   he is on his death bed  [Laughter]  I hope this does not bode ill for the economy going forward,   but I did want to note that one very important change, Mr Chairman   December 12, 2006 72 of 134          We’ve had the same discussion of a two-tiered economy, with housing and autos being   slower and the rest of the economy moving forward, and continuing concerns about the risk of   spillovers; but the central tendency seems to be that we’ll be moving ahead perhaps a little below   potential, with some reasonable chance of getting back to something closer to potential by the   end of next year  Continuing the discussions of labor market tightness and some concerns about   shortages in certain areas, I think that we certainly have seen some softness in construction, but   that’s an area for which we’ve probably underestimated employment growth and perhaps   employment falloff because, as I think many of us know, many of the subcontractors in   residential as well as nonresidential housing have a lot of undocumented workers, and they tend   to be undercounted both on the upside and on the downside  So there may be a little more   softness in the labor market than we’re seeing, at least in the construction sector; however, in the   higher-skilled sectors, we’re seeing continued tightness    Consumer spending continues to be strong  There has been just an amazing persistence   of consumer spending, no matter what has happened over the past five years  Whether the stock   market has crashed, whether the housing market has boomed, whether we’ve had September 11,   or whether we’ve had concerns about spillover effects, the consumer seems to have been very,   very persistent, and it seems as though that’s the case now  We’ve talked about challenges in the   energy markets, and we did see a little slowing  Energy prices were higher, and energy prices   are lower, but these aspects of the macroeconomy seem still to have little effect on consumer   spending    We continue to have concerns about some upside risks to inflation  So I’ll just mention   quickly a few issues and then talk about some international issues that Dino and Tim touched on   earlier  Regarding housing, we know we have terrible price data, but it seems as though there’s a   December 12, 2006 73 of 134         little more flexibility and nimbleness in the housing market than there was in the past  So the   past data on housing may not be too useful  Although we know we don’t get good data on   effective prices, we do seem to be seeing more evidence that people, rather than just holding   things on the market longer, are providing the marble bathroom, the Lexus, the Hyundai, the Kia,   the Yugo, or whatever they’re providing  In New Jersey, where I grew up, it would be a Yugo    [Laughter]  So I think there’s more flexibility on that side  Also, because of the way the housing   market has developed, a lot of residential construction is no longer at just the local level  The   large national builders are better diversified and, as has been discussed, have options on land,   and then, if they see the market turning down, they give up those options  So they have a much   greater ability to shift both down and up in production much more quickly  Prices, too, are a   little more flexible, which is one reason that we’ve seen a sharper correction in the housing   market  But that flexibility, with the recent data indicating that certain things may be flattening   out, may mean that, though the correction may have been sharper, it won’t necessarily persist—  that the correction has occurred in a shorter time, rather than being dragged out longer and   having more potential for negative spillover, confidence effects, and so forth    Well, what has changed?  As Governor Kohn mentioned, inventory accumulation is a bit   of concern  It seems to be ticking up  It always seems a bit odd when a positive effect on GDP   results from businesses being unable to sell the things that they’ve purchased  That doesn’t   strike me as necessarily a positive thing for a GDP report  We’ve gotten some more, probably   confusing, numbers on productivity  Is productivity slowing or not?  We are getting some data   that may be suggesting that it is, although I would agree with Dave and the staff that it’s much   too early to say  I think the evidence both anecdotally, as a number of people have mentioned,   and more broadly is that productivity is likely to continue to go forward  Another thing that   December 12, 2006 74 of 134         changed, as Dino and others discussed, was the yield curve  But this phenomenon is very much   an international one  Long rates have come down more—since the last meeting, they have fallen   a fair amount and not just in the United States  The three-month versus the ten-year in Europe   has fallen about 40 basis points, so the spread is about 7 basis points now  On average, since the   euro has been around, it has been about 40 to 50 basis points  In the United Kingdom, which   tends on average to have very flat yield curves, the inversion has steepened about 25 basis points   to 65 basis points  Japan is little changed, but Japan is sui generis  Emerging markets have also   seen this  In Mexico, for example, the ten-year versus the three-month has dropped about 60   basis points  Clearly, this is not just a US phenomenon, and I think it’s telling us not just about   US growth, unless you think that US growth is driving world growth and so it’s really all   about the United States  I think that’s a bit extreme, even though, as was mentioned, some   correlations suggest that when the United States goes down, there is a lagged effect and the rest   of the world tends to go down  But I think it’s suggesting that some other factor is occurring and   that we shouldn’t read too much into it  Also, interestingly, if you look at the real short and long   rates around the world—at least for the industrial countries—real rates tend to be about 1½ to   2½ percent, which is very much where we are  Thus there has been a convergence of real rates   around the world  So I would be wary of taking too much information from the bond market as   referring to something that’s specific to the United States rather than to some factors that are   common worldwide    Just quickly on inflation—we’ve talked about how energy prices have gone up and down   but core inflation hasn’t been affected that much  Labor market tightness doesn’t seem to have   had much of an effect  As for output gaps—if you like output gaps—when you look at the data,   it’s hard to find much evidence of an effect of output gaps on core inflation  Also, given the   December 12, 2006 75 of 134         discussion that we’ve had, it doesn’t seem that the gap will be too wide or, even if you believe it   will be wide, that you’d be getting much effect from it in the near term  We talked about some   temporary factors like owners’ equivalent rent that may have boosted measured inflation for a   while and is now coming down  I don’t think there will be much effect on inflation from the   dollar  The United States still is just not that open an economy  Even to the extent that it is   open, the pass-through of exchange rate changes to domestic prices is very slow and very   partial—typically, over a three-year to five-year period, barely 50 percent  The evidence   suggests that the pass-through is decreasing  Even if the dollar went down further, I don’t see   much of an effect there  That said, it’s hard to see exactly what forces are moving inflation in   one way or another right now  A reasonable scenario is that it could drift down slowly, but it’s   hard to point to clear evidence of where it’s going to go  To the extent that there is information   in the yield curve, the markets clearly do not expect inflation to take off, and it’s likely that   inflation will be moving lower or at least staying contained where it is  So we have much data   and relatively little information  I see risks on both the upside and the downside to growth and   have continuing concern about upside risks to inflation precisely because I don’t see an easy path   to lower core inflation going forward  I think that lower core inflation in the future is reasonable   but uncertain, particularly given that it’s hard to see a lot of systematic evidence of factors that   are occurring now that would be correlated with that result  Thanks      Given that the avalanche hasn’t really moved our assessment very   much, I certainly don’t see any reason to move interest rates now  I think it is important to   acknowledge in section 2 some of the slowing that we’ve seen  As we have discussed, there are two   ways to do that  One is to include the substantial cooling of housing  I think there’s consensus for   that—I haven’t heard anything said to the contrary—and I think it’s important that we do have that    Then the question is whether we want to go further and whether we can do that clearly, rather than   cause confusion  Obviously, the simple option is just to cut it all out—take the Minehan approach   and say “substantial” is sufficient  As Governor Warsh mentioned, we’ve been thinking about a   simplified version of alternative B that mentions just some “recent indicators”  Then we can get out   December 12, 2006 109 of 134         of the discussion of production, spending, and the specifics  But I do think that’s better than saying   “growth”  It’s also better to talk about some of the indicators rather than just the overall growth   number, which was in exhibit 4  So I think exhibit 5 is better that way  Then it’s a nuance whether   we want to include “somewhat subdued,” “slightly weaker,” or “mixed,” and whether we use   “were,” “have been,” or “are”  I’m not quite sure exactly where I stand on all of those, but I do   think that simplifying the language to some degree and just saying something about indicators   would be the way to go     Thank you very much  Well, the data have come in so far according   to plan, and you can thank Chairman Bernanke for doing that  I think he has some special   relations with the BEA and others  [Laughter]  Exactly as we had hoped they would and said   January 30-31, 2007 81 of 255    they would, the data show moderation in growth with a prospect for accelerating growth through   2007 and moderation in inflation—again, according to plan  I think my views are similar to   those that President Stern put forward  The economy has shown an enormous amount of   resilience      I want to talk about a few possible puzzles in the way the data have evolved and could   perhaps deviate from plan as we go forward  One puzzle is the great strength of the consumer    The consumer has been very, very strong for the past five years, and it seems that no matter what   has happened—whether a housing downturn, an equity-market downturn, or a September 11—  the consumer has come through rather strongly and continues to be strong  We certainly have   had a slowdown in the housing market, and maybe we’re waiting to see its effect on the   consumer, as Don Kohn mentioned  But it may just be that some special factors have come in;   for example, we have had very strong international economic growth, and perhaps that will   persist  When you talk to officials and business people outside the United States, whether in   emerging market economies, in the Gulf region, or in industrial economies, they are extremely   optimistic, much more so than I have ever before seen, and that may continue  Obviously, there   is a risk factor here  The recent strengthening in equity markets perhaps offsets some of the   reduction in the asset values of homes  Lower consumer energy prices, of course, have been an   offsetting factor, and labor market strength and increases in compensation have been very   important  But there’s an upside risk that we will continue to have very, very strong   consumption instead of having our error correction go back toward more saving    Second, with respect to investment, we have had orders above shipments for quite some   time, but we have had investment actually declining, or at least not growing as we would expect    Overall in this recovery we have had weaker investment growth, and we have had very high   January 30-31, 2007 82 of 255    profitability  That raises another puzzle for me  Why have we seen somewhat weak investment   over the long run and especially more recently, given that most measures of consumer   confidence and business confidence have been positive, equity markets seem to be positive,   spreads seem to be low, and so forth  Why are we not seeing more investment?  Investment may   turn around in the next quarter or so, and then we’ll be out of the woods  But I think the   conditions that we predict will lead to an investment turnaround have been there for quite some   time, and we haven’t seen the investment turnaround; and that is a puzzle to me    Third, with respect to inflation, obviously we are all pleased that the numbers have been   coming out with greater moderation  But I have a discomfort about exactly what is driving that   moderation  We have good short-term stories about how the slowdown in energy prices in the   second and third quarters and some other temporary factors with respect to owners’ equivalent   rent could be bringing down inflation  But when we consider a longer period and try to look at   the systematic data, we don’t see those kinds of relationships  Are we just in some sort of regime   shift?  Are those correlations not very good because we just haven’t had a lot of variation in the   data over the past ten to twenty years, and so those forces are actually there, but we just find it   very difficult to pull them out econometrically?  For me that is a puzzle, to be able to tell a short-  term story with each of these pieces, but when I go to the staff and ask, “Well, what is the   systematic evidence on it?” they say, “Well, it really isn’t there”  That is a bit disturbing for me   in trying to figure out where things are likely to go      Things have moved in a benign way  I don’t think there’s a strong expectation that they   would move in a nonbenign way  But I don’t have a lot of confidence that I understand why they   have moved as they have  So my concern is that various shocks or other factors could come in to   move them in a way that is not nearly so benign  Broadly, however, I share the views that most   January 30-31, 2007 83 of 255    people have expressed around the table that we have good growth prospects going forward and   so far reasonable moderation of inflation  But precisely because we have those good growth   prospects and because we may have had some temporary factors that have kept down inflation,   we have to be ever mindful of the upside risk to inflation      A two-hander on the now-disgraced proposal on section 4    [Laughter]  I think the way to raise it back is just take the phrase “the Committee judges that   inflation remains the predominant concern” and then move on to the sentence in alternative B   that starts with “the extent and timing of any additional firming”      If you want to keep it, I think that’s the way to bring it back to grace      It also has the virtue of minimizing the number of word changes and   just substituting a phrase from the minutes from last time, for those of you who think that’s the   best way to go      Thank you  I, too, support alternative B and maintaining the federal   funds rate at 525 percent  I agree with many of the arguments that were made before, and so I   won’t repeat them  I’ll go to the language  On section 2, I think it would be an overreaction or   appear to be an overreaction to the current data if we suddenly went from where we were to   “rebounding”  Governor Kohn suggested that “rebounding” has problematic implications for going   forward  That is particularly true if we think that at least 05 percentage point of the 35 percent will   be taken away in revisions  Alternative B very nicely encompasses that, even if we didn’t know that   the number would be a bit firmer than we expected  I also think that in section 3 it’s problematic to   use the words “in recent months but remain elevated” because in recent months core inflation hasn’t   been elevated; it looks as though the numbers have been fairly consistently below 2 and so fairly   consistently below where they had been six or twelve months ago on average  That wording gives a   misleading impression  In section 4, even though I had suggested that alternative, I did so really to   clarify the discussion because I thought some of the discussion was not focusing on the issue but on   some of the wording, though we had a very good discussion  I have been and remain in favor of not   January 30-31, 2007 120 of 255    changing the language, mainly because the markets seem to have learned to interpret it the way we   think would be appropriate  Exactly as Governor Kohn said, the market is reacting to the data in a   very sensible way, given our perspective on the likely evolution of the data  Since they seem to be   kind of getting the data and the perspective on what we’re likely to do right, it would seem to be an   inopportune time to change the language  Thank you very much     Thank you very much  The question that Presidents Poole, Minehan,   Fisher, and others asked—Why are we doing this?—is always the important one  You always   have to think about the objective and what you’re trying to achieve, so that question has to be   taken very seriously  As part of our general obligation to improve the monetary policy making   process, we are doing this as part of the broader evolution in improving transparency  We need   to be proactive  We don’t have to wait for someone to ask us to give them this or that  We   should be controlling that process, and we should always be thinking about ways to improve, and   this discussion is very, very useful in thinking about how to move forward  I want to repeat the   January 30-31, 2007 201 of 255    kudos to the staff for the excellent memos that they put forward, giving us both substantive   information about what others do and ways to think about any sorts of changes    I’ll go quickly through the questions  I think it’s very valuable to have different points of   view that are reflected in the forecast  Part of the value is that it is in the spirit of the Federal   Reserve Act  A forecast that is seen as purely centralized would to some extent be contrary to   the act and could raise some hackles  It is valuable to get those differences of views out there    Whether there should be common assumptions, I guess I differ a bit from where   everybody else is  I think it would be worthwhile to make some effort when we’re going through   the dry runs to see if there are areas of commonality because it would provide more information    As President Lacker said, the clearer, more centralized, and more consistent the forecast, the   more potentially informative it is and the more accountable we can be  So it might be   worthwhile at least to explore whether there are some aspects of commonality that wouldn’t   cause inconsistencies of models or other problems  I’m not sure that we could get there, but I   think it is worthwhile to spend some time on that  Part of the motivation for doing so is that we   already put out a central tendency forecast a couple of times a year  Although the market   respondents to that survey had said they want more of this, when I talk to reporters or to market   participants, they don’t really seem to pay much attention to it, or it seems to decay very, very   quickly  They may pay attention for a very short time, and that’s why it might be worthwhile to   see whether something a bit more consistent could be given out about it  Right now, except for a   very small window around the two times a year that we put it out, I don’t see much emphasis on   it      It’s valuable to have a more-rapid release of information  However, the last thing I   would want is to feel that we have to get it out faster and to have that feeling impeding our   January 30-31, 2007 202 of 255    decisionmaking process—either needing to put out the Greenbook earlier or constraining our   discussions because we had already put a line in the sand  I think it’s 42, and you think it’s 32;   my memo is out there, and my memo is better than your memo [laughter]—I think that would be   a mistake  Also, particularly since we are thinking of frequency, if we release information three   to four times a year, it is going to get stale  But trying to get it out a week sooner so that it’s out   there for three months and a week or four months and a week, rather than four months and two   weeks or three months and two weeks, isn’t that helpful  I don’t want to undermine the excellent   decisionmaking process that we have  So speed is valuable, but there is a cost to it, and I don’t   see the enormous benefit of getting it out a week or two sooner  As I said, three to four times a   year seems reasonable      I like the evolutionary approach of providing some narrative, because I think that’s one of   the key things in providing more transparency—it gives us greater ability to convey to the world   how we’re thinking about things  It also helps us because we would not be as constrained with   the very few words that we put out as a Committee  It would be nice, in principle, to be able to   use more words to convey our ideas rather than be so constrained  If we do put the information   out as a separate document, I think that it will get much more attention  That may be valuable,   but it also will get different reactions  Right now, it goes out as part of testimony that the   Chairman gives  I could certainly see requests for more-frequent testimony if we start putting   the information out more frequently  We have to think about that kind of feedback dynamic    When we report more information, what other demands might come?  I’m not sure that would be   the case, but I think the form and frequency with which we put it out may induce that kind of   response   January 30-31, 2007 203 of 255     With respect to the forecast horizon, I think the key will be whether we are more explicit   on some sort of target or goal, and then horizon should be related to that  I don’t want it to go   too far out  At the Council of Economic Advisers, I chaired the so-called troika process, in   which we would do the Administration forecast  Initially we had to do ten-year forecasts  What   information do we have today that will tell us anything about ten years down the line?  We   would always revert to the mean, and we would do that over a five-year period  Basically, we   didn’t feel that we really had any more information after two to three years  So I would be   reluctant to push the horizon beyond two to three years unless we wanted to tell people about   what we sort of thought trend rate was  That could be valuable but only to tell people about   trend, not to say that we really have any insight into what’s going to happen four to five years   from now  Generally our tendency will be to bring things back to trend  In terms of what to talk   about, real GDP, unemployment, and some measure of core inflation make a lot of sense  I’d be   very reluctant, certainly early on, to talk about interest rates or interest rate assumptions      Uncertainty is another thing  When we were working on the forecasts at the CEA, one of   the things that I and others had pushed for was trying to give some sense of the uncertainty when   we were making these forecasts  We actually got far enough to have some of our people talk   with people on Capitol Hill, and we had very strong negative pushback  They were saying,   “Well, if you’re not willing to stand by your number—we have asked you to make a forecast,   and you’re not standing by it if you’re giving us this range”  Also, people will pick out the high   end or the low end of the range for their particular purposes, and so you have to be very careful   about how you put that out  In principle, I really want to provide the uncertainty; I agree   completely with Governor Mishkin on that  But the form in which you provide it is very   important because we may think of it as uncertainty but others may think of it as either dodging   January 30-31, 2007 204 of 255    an obligation or making a particular commitment on the high side or the low side—this is as high   as you can go and this is as low as you can go—and see it as a bargaining type of thing  Being   an academic, I had never thought about it that way  But it is something that we should consider   in making sure that providing it is improving transparency and the effectiveness of monetary   policy  We don’t want to get into side debates about exact numbers—that would be exactly the   opposite of what we want to convey about uncertainty  Thank you      I haven’t received it  If you sent it by mail, it could take a while     Okay, great     I just wanted to mention with respect to foreclosures and wanted to   double-check my facts—a note had been sent out from the Board’s Consumer and Community   Affairs Division to your consumer and community affairs groups concerning your activities in   mortgage foreclosures, and Jeff Lacker fortunately has invited me to a conference two days from   now, at which I will be speaking  Unfortunately, I will be unable to be at the hearing at which   Sandy Braunstein will be appearing  Regardless of what you might think of me in this regard,   please be sure to get things in to help Sandy out  I think a lot of good activities are being done in all   March 20-21, 2007 49 of 196    the regional Federal Reserve Banks, and if we could just get a little information to her so that she   has a few examples to give, that would be very helpful  Then we will follow up in the longer run   because we hope to do a larger program here on some of these issues  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Just the opposite—Sandy could use examples showing that we’ve done   some outreach to help deal with some of the challenges of foreclosure  Are there educational efforts   or studies that have been done?     Thank you very much  I very much agree with President Stern’s   characterization that, although some of the incoming data are a bit weaker than we had been seeing,   we certainly shouldn’t overreact  Optimally, we should react to what the data tell us about the   future, and I’m not sure we’ve learned an enormous amount about the future over the past few   months  Actually Dave has kept a very steady hand on the forecast throttle because we have seen a   lot of data come in over the past six months, but they haven’t led to much change in the Greenbook   forecast, and I think that’s quite reasonable  Given that some of the numbers have come in slightly   weaker and given some of the market volatility, I think that uncertainty is a bit up; so the tails are   somewhat fatter, and I agree with the number of people who had said that   Quickly looking at GDP from the C + I + G + net exports context, I think net exports will be   reasonably robust as world growth, at least over the next few quarters, is going to be fairly strong    We also heard a lot of anecdotal support for that  On both the state and federal levels, government   spending is likely to continue at a pace that will certainly not reduce demand and may have the   potential to add to demand  But when it comes to consumption and investment, that’s where the   uncertainties are  I won’t restate the concerns that several of you have raised about the deepening   puzzle in investment  I mentioned this at the last meeting—that for many months we’ve been   seeing very good balance sheets, good employment numbers, good sentiment, good returns, and so   on and so forth, but no pickup in investment  Given that we’ve now gone at least six months   without seeing that pickup, I am concerned that, with the greater uncertainty that seems to be in the   March 20-21, 2007 66 of 196    markets, we may not see that pickup and that somehow our models may be missing something that   should be in there but that has not been there in the past   The other area of the greatest uncertainty is related to the subprime market  As you know   now, we and the other federal regulators put out for comment—actually right at the end of the week   of the increased concern about volatility in the subprime market—guidance with respect to   subprime mortgages, the so-called 2/28s and 3/27s  That is still out for comment  We’re very   mindful of some of the comments that have been raised here about whether that could   inappropriately reduce the supply of credit in this market, and in the notice of proposed rulemaking,   we have really emphasized questions about what the unintended consequences are  So we want to   make sure that we get information in on that  Some loans that were made may have been   inappropriate, but there may have been some that were completely appropriate  We want to make   sure that, when we put out the guidance, we don’t choke off the appropriate loans     The supervision and regulation staff has surveyed five active lenders in the subprime market   that represent about 30 percent of that market  We’ve gotten data so far from three of the five    From some of them it’s a bit difficult to get the data quickly because of a fair amount of   management turnover, but we are still working on it  But I think it’s a healthy thing that there are   some delays  What’s interesting is that one of the main concerns is refinancing  What will happen   to these guys because this market seems to be drying up  As we discussed at the beginning, it’s   really the variable-rate subprime market  The subprime market is roughly 13 percent of the total   mortgages outstanding  The variable-rate subprime is about 74 percent of total mortgages   outstanding, nearly two-thirds of the subprime market  The fixed-rate part has not had any uptick in   delinquencies  Because of the inversion of the yield curve, the people who may be facing increases   in their variable rates may be able to refinance into fixed-rate subprimes  Over ’06, the average   March 20-21, 2007 67 of 196    introductory adjustable-rate subprime mortgages were in the 7 percent to 9 percent area—depending   on the loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, and so forth—if income was stated  Right now, to   refinance into fixed rate, the range is about 7½ percent to 9½ percent  It’s fairly similar, so many of   these people may be able to move into this area   One thing that we want to know is what happens after people get these loans  What do they   do with them next?  In the survey, about 25 percent of the loans were retained by the individual   banks, and so we could follow through what happened to the borrowers when they refinanced; but   we see only 25 percent  Obviously this share could be heavily selective, but it still may be   somewhat interesting to know that about 40 percent of those on whom we have some information   actually moved into a prime product  About 34 percent went into a fixed subprime; and the rest,   about 25 percent, refinanced to another type of variable subprime  So a fair number of these are   able to move either into prime or into fixed subprime  Although this sample is obviously selective,   it says something about the likely effects going forward  The benefits, at least in the short run, of   the inverted yield curve are that many of these individuals will have a lot of opportunities to   refinance into a fixed product that will have payments similar to the ones that they’re paying now   rather than ones that would be much higher   That said, the situation suggests that the concerns about what will happen to the market may   not be as strong as some people have said  We still don’t know, as President Fisher said, a lot about   the alt-A market  That market almost by definition is low documentation or no documentation  The   FICO scores tend to be higher  From the survey, a lot of these people appear to be self-employed,   so it becomes more difficult to independently verify the income that they have  That’s a large part   of the market, but obviously potentially a very risky part of the market  Fortunately, it’s not an   enormous part of the market, and so it doesn’t seem to be a major challenge going forward    March 20-21, 2007 68 of 196    Certainly there are some potential challenges, but I think some of the data from the survey are   interesting   With respect to inflation pressures, I think very much like Dave (now that he’s a much more   balanced person than he was earlier in 2006), that we see neither intensifying nor abating   inflationary pressures  You know, some of the numbers more recently have not been as favorable as   they could be, but they are certainly by no means out of control  Expectations continue to appear   well anchored and well contained  We don’t know a lot about what’s driving short-term to   intermediate-term inflation dynamics  It’s hard to see lots of correlations with unemployment rates,   economic activity, resource utilization, energy prices, and other things  I have been hoping to see   and we have been seeing a gradual downtrend that seems to be flattening out to neither intensifying   nor abating, which leaves us with some concerns going forward about the upside potential to   inflation     Thank you very much  I, too, favor alternative B—keeping the federal   funds rate constant at this point  From the discussion yesterday, I gather that many of us still see in   some cases a substantial risk that inflation just won’t come down from where it is  Also, from the   discussion yesterday, I think that there is a bit more uncertainty—some fatter tails—and so   modifications to the statement that reflect that uncertainty are useful   Let me work from the bottom up and go from the risk assessment in section 4  I like the risk   assessment  The removal of the explicit reference to firming will certainly be interpreted by the   markets as opening the possibility of a cut down the line, which we hadn’t explicitly opened up   before  We do offset that a bit—I think Jeff Lacker was getting at this, although I think it is actually   somewhat positive rather than negative—by characterizing the Committee’s inflation concern as   “principal”  A slight softening from “predominant” makes sense to me because data have come in   since the Chairman enunciated that “P” word, the “predominant” word  [Laughter]  “Principal” is   appropriately reflective of the new information and the way people have talked about it and gives us   a bit more flexibility down the line because the tails are somewhat fatter, which reflects the   discussion  Also, I take Vince’s presentation about 2000-01 to heart, and so getting a little more   flexibility there may not be a bad idea at this time   On section 3, it’s important to acknowledge that the readings have been a little above what   most people are comfortable with, and so I think it makes sense to go with that language  In section   March 20-21, 2007 96 of 196    2, some things I like very much, and some things I don’t like  The phrases that the recent indicators   have been more mixed and that the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing are good ways to   characterize the discussion we had yesterday and accurate reflections of what’s going on in the   economy  I like the phrase “the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing,” and I certainly agree   that the economy “seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters”    Although in principle I would favor having a shorter section 2, just cutting it off there, we might   want to have at least a little something else  So I would say “supported by, among other things,   gains in income,” and leave the wording there  I’m actually quite strongly opposed to including   “still-favorable financial conditions” for some of the reasons that have been enunciated  That   phrase will look like our very weak attempt to say that we really, really do believe that the markets   are okay—that is, a weak attempt to talk up the markets  When we use that phrase, we’re thinking   about just the low bid-ask spreads and the capital that’s flowing into the markets  There’s a very   real chance that the phrase will be misinterpreted as focusing on the equity markets, which I don’t   think any of us intends it to mean  Also, Governor Warsh’s concern is an important one  How do   we get out of talking about the market?  What if the market goes down?  I don’t think it’s good for   us to be using language that we can’t explain our way out of  In a speech or in testimony we could   explain what we mean by “still-favorable financial market conditions”  But with the kind of   crimped “kabuki” language that we have in our statement, I think it would be much better to omit   the reference  Given that we have a very good phrase about the ongoing adjustment in the housing   sector in the first sentence, I’m not sure what we accomplish by taking away from it or giving more   color to what is a waning correction  Being neutral because of uncertainty about that market—that   its adjustment is just ongoing—is most appropriate  So I would favor either cutting things off after   March 20-21, 2007 97 of 196    “coming quarters” or putting in something like “supported by, among other things, gains in   income”  Thank you, Mr Chairman     As I said in my discussion, obviously I’m very concerned about a   reference to financial conditions, especially “still-favorable financial conditions”  But as I also said,   I think that it hangs out there a bit naked without some color around it  I would be fine with keeping   personal income gains and the gradually waning correction to the housing market  My preference   would be just something like “income gains, among other factors” to put something there  But that   may be so weak that it may be better to cut off  I’m sympathetic to having some color, but I think   the wrong color is the financial market condition     That would be excellent     Thank you  Since lunch is looming, I’ll try to be as brief as possible    The key to what I hope we will be trying to achieve is better credibility to make monetary policy   more effective and to fulfill our dual mandate better  I very much agree with President Poole’s   comments that it’s valuable to make sure that we have some insurance against mistakes  It actually   fits well into the risk-management framework that Governor Kohn had articulated  That’s what I   see as potentially valuable about this  I do think that there is value along the lines that President   March 20-21, 2007 168 of 196    Stern discussed in terms of internal and external accountability and articulation  But it has to be   seen in the context of a broader risk-management policy that helps us to fulfill the dual mandate    That’s why I would support moving in this direction, although I’m also one of the people who see   that it’s somewhat of a close call  One can make a good argument that there is value in the   insurance, but it is hard to quantify these things   With respect to the particular price index, supposedly people have more familiarity with   headline CPI than with core measures or with the PCE  I’m not sure in the real world that people   know much about the differences among the various inflation measures  We talk about headline   CPI  They look at the headlines about inflation, and I don’t think that the distinctions between core   and CPI and PCE are well known  But part of this is uncertainty on my part  I don’t understand the   exact nature of the expectations process or how expectations affect behavior  Ultimately what I   want to do is enhance our credibility so that we can make monetary policy more effective  I lean   toward core PCE because it seems to be a bit better correlated with the future paths of inflation,   although in the long run they’re all very highly correlated  Core PCE seems to be a bit better   behaved  With this credibility approach and also with what affects behavior and expectations, my   concern is that the more we deviate from our stated objective, either temporarily or for the long run,   the less that objective is taken seriously  The more times the Chairman has to go to the Congress   and say, “Well, you know, our objective is 2 but we have special circumstances here and this   transitory part there,” that seems to be at odds with getting to our objective of enhancing credibility    Now, I may be wrong  It may be that if people are really familiar with CPI, then that’s the thing to   focus on  I’m just not convinced of that because I think we know very little about people’s   expectations, the development process, and their behavior process  I think it’s more just general   credibility—that it’s clear the Fed has tried to ensure that inflation doesn’t stray out of a particular   March 20-21, 2007 169 of 196    range or away from a particular point  That’s the message, and that we achieve it  I think that’s the   best way for us to achieve the dual mandate   On the third question, whether a point or a range, my answer is “no”  I want something in   between, much the same as what President Stern articulated—perhaps something like no more than   2 percent but not much below 2 percent, something like what the European Central Bank does—  because it is better not to have a range for the reason that many people have said but it is also nice to   have a little flexibility  This specification doesn’t explicitly articulate the range, but it gives us   flexibility and keeps us away from the zero point  I don’t see a lot of welfare benefits with going   much below that, and I don’t see a lot of welfare benefits in moving dramatically from where we are   now, which is not the best situation but is by no means a terrible situation   With respect to the horizon, more flexibility is better  This fits in with the risk-management   approach  If push comes to shove, if I had to say a number, I’d say something like three years plus   or minus a year  But I think it would be better just to say over an intermediate term or a long run or   a business cycle or some other term that gives us flexibility to respond to shocks  I like President   Pianalto’s approach to set it and forget it  Unfortunately, in practice that will be difficult because of   turnover of the Committee  If a goal is changed each year or is not reaffirmed each year, the whole   enterprise is undermined  So we have to make sure that, if we do articulate a goal, we feel pretty   comfortable that members of the FOMC, at least into the foreseeable future, would be comfortable   with that goal; otherwise the whole purpose of having the goal is undermined  With respect to the   trial run for producing a forecast, I think that’s very valuable to do  I think we’ll learn a lot by   actually doing it to see what we feel comfortable or uncomfortable with regarding uncertainty    Thank you     Thank you very much  The last time we met, one theme was the greater   uncertainty, and Governor Kohn mentioned that he is feeling greater uncertainty now than he ever   had  I am not sure that greater uncertainty has been the tenor of the comments here today, but I   May 9, 2007 63 of 130    think it has been greater uncertainty with downside risk  So the key issue from last time that I think   is still with us is that we certainly saw evidence of the slowdown and, as President Stern mentioned,   that sometimes we have to acknowledge reality, and we did have much slower growth than many   people had been expecting in the two previous meetings  The Greenbook suggests that the   slowdown is unlikely to persist—and I broadly agree with that view, as do many people around the   table—but I want to review five key uncertainties that we talked about last time and to discuss how   they developed and where they are likely to go   The first uncertainty is investment, and of course, a lot of us have spoken about that  I   would rate the level of uncertainty as still elevated there  I am not going to use color coding to rate   that uncertainty, but I would say it is still elevated  We have recently gotten some more-solid   numbers, but those are just recent; and I think it is still more a glimmer of hope than something we   can bank on that we are going to get a turnaround in investment  That we have seen some better   numbers in ISM, durable goods, and so forth says that the direction is perhaps a little more positive   than we were thinking six weeks ago  But there is still a reasonable amount of uncertainty about   whether the pickup in business investment will help offset any slowdown in consumption to make   sure that we continue to grow in the 2 percent range going forward   The second uncertainty is productivity and potential output  Obviously that is still at an   elevated level  As far as I am concerned, it is one of the biggest challenges for us to think about in   the intermediate run  In particular, a downside scenario that concerns me is that, if we do not have a   pickup in investment, we are unlikely to see a sustained rise in productivity growth  If perhaps one   reason for the lower investment is that there are concerns about productivity growth or returns from   that investment, we could have a fairly negative scenario in which we get much lower potential   output  Offsetting that concern is that we are seeing some glimmers of hope on investment  With   May 9, 2007 64 of 130    respect to potential, I think it is appropriate that the Greenbook has raised participation rates a bit,   given that older people seem to be healthier than previous cohorts were and seem to be more willing   to work  However, I think the big question mark is, exactly as David said, that not until August will   we get a better feel for which way the data revision will go because the difference between the two   sides of the balance sheet is fairly big  Broadly, I share Gary Stern’s optimism that it is not a good   bet to bet against the US economy and against ultimately good productivity growth  But I have the   concern that I do not fully understand the slowness of the investment recovery and some of the   productivity slowdown  There is potentially a worrying downside scenario there   Third is the uncertainty about the housing market and subprime  Well, obviously,   uncertainty on subprime was highly elevated then, and it has come down quite a bit  We have seen   some tightening of lending standards, particularly at the lower end  The survey of senior loan   officers asked for a differentiation between subprime and prime lending standards  It showed a very   dramatic increase in subprime standards, which is exactly what we would expect in this kind of   market, certainly potentially reducing demand at least in the lower end of the housing market    About the housing market in and of itself, the uncertainty is still there  We still have a lot of   uncertainty about whether the numbers are telling us about weather or about the actual strength of   the market  As I think I have mentioned to a number of you before, we need to have, besides Dave,   a meteorologist on the staff to forecast the weather because every number we hear on the housing   market is not a number in which we can put any stock; it all has to do with heat or cold or rain or   snow or whatever other thing that Mother Nature may throw at us  So I still think there is a pretty   mixed picture there  As I said, we have seen very little evidence of spillovers from the subprime   market  The main concern, and this is a variation of what Governor Warsh said, is that something   we or the Congress might do might cut off this market  We have to be mindful of any actions that   May 9, 2007 65 of 130    we may be taking with respect to guidance, as well as of any actions that the Congress may be   taking, that could reduce this market more than otherwise   The yield curve is favorable for a lot of the variable-rate subprime borrowers to move into   fixed-rate products, with payment shock of perhaps no more than 50 basis points  The   delinquencies we have been seeing have not been due to resets or to payment shock  They have   been due primarily to the so-called juvenile delinquents—the early defaulters going bad  That   means that we do not know what is coming down the line because we have not really seen the   experience of the resets  Now, with the recently benign yield curve, that situation could reasonably   be worked out  The key is whether any equity is left  If no equity is left and the resets come, these   guys are likely to walk  If they have been doing risk layering—putting really no money down—and   the prices go down, that will be a problem  So I think that may be a bit of a slow burn  Coupled   with the broader misalignment that we are seeing now of a little increase in housing starts, which in   some ways we would see as a positive, is a sort of negative given that housing sales seem to be   declining so much  Thus there seems to be a disconnect between supply and demand, and I think   the Greenbook is now quite wisely saying that we will likely have a longer transition in the housing   market   A fourth area of uncertainty that we talked about last time was the financial markets—the   dramatic spike up in volatility  That volatility spike has come down, but we, being good   economists, can never be satisfied with either high volatility or low volatility  Low volatility is of   concern to us, and I very much share the concerns that Tim, Cathy, Kevin, and others have   mentioned  Not only in the United States, but also in the rest of the world, are some of those   spreads a bit narrower than they otherwise would be  In particular, there are concerns about banks   chasing private equity deals going covenant-free  In many of my discussions with private equity   May 9, 2007 66 of 130    folks, instead of saying, well, bring us on more capital, those contacts are the ones saying that the   banks are pushing them to take greater leverage than they otherwise would want  Now, if that isn’t   the fox guarding the henhouse, I do not know what is  You want the banks to be the disciplinary   force, and that they would potentially be taking on very large risks is a real concern   The fifth area of uncertainty was consumption  We have seen a bit of a step-down in   consumption growth, but there is still a lot of uncertainty, and I share the exact concerns that   Governor Kohn articulated; given that there are likely to be some wealth effects, even though we   have some offsetting effects in the stock market, I do not want to bet on those offsetting effects in   the stock market being there for the next three quarters  Housing wealth seems to be flattening, if   not coming down, with the Case-Shiller index on average for those ten markets down 3 to 5 percent    If people’s thinking about their consumption pattern is based on some increase in housing wealth,   the saving rate should at least gradually increase  At some point, that reality may be biting and   leading to some concern   On the inflation front, once again, we will have continuing uncertainty about what drives   short-term to intermediate-term inflation  As I mentioned last time, we get very, very mild effects   from the traditional things that we think that make a difference  Oil, energy, commodity prices, and   resource utilization don’t seem to have that much force, but in both the short and intermediate terms   I think they are leaning on the positive side rather than on the negative side  We still have the   owners’ equivalent rent issue that is coming in with the transition in the housing market and is still   to some extent temporarily pushing up our measured inflation rates  Inflation expectations continue   to seem to be quite well contained, and that, I think, is key because, given that these other forces do   not seem to be important in the short to intermediate run, inflation expectations are very important    May 9, 2007 67 of 130    So my bottom line is that, although I see some downside risks on growth, I think the Greenbook   scenario is a reasonable central tendency one, and I see some important upside risks on inflation     A meteorologist and a linguist     As everyone else has said, there haven’t been enough data to lead us   to change our view, and the policy should remain where it is  Alternative B is the right way to   go, and—I agree with Governor Kohn—it is the best way to meet our dual objectives  The   statement from last time bought us some flexibility, although at some cost—it left a bit of   confusion in the market, which we’ve clarified  It is important for us to maintain that flexibility,   and so in altering the statement we should think about that  In the first part of section 2, we do   have to acknowledge that growth slowed in the first part of this year  It is important to make that   change  But because we have made that change, the Chairman’s suggestion seems quite   reasonable to me—rather than saying “nevertheless,” just assert that “recent indicators suggest   May 9, 2007 98 of 130    that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters”  I think the   Chairman had suggested starting that sentence with “overall”  If people like the phrase “on   balance,” we can say “on balance recent indicators suggest that   ” [laughter] depending on   whether we choose to use the phrase “on balance” in the next sentence  On the next sentence,   I’m open about whether we use “on balance,” but I would, on balance, go for taking it out   because I don’t see the particular benefit at this point of adding in that qualification  In some   sense it takes away a bit of our flexibility rather than adding to it  I’m trying to think about the   most likely scenarios going forward, and it’s more likely that we might want to remove or alter   that phrase than keep it  So from our time-series perspective going forward, it might leave us a   little more flexibility not to put it in, but I don’t have a very strong view on that   As you can see from my comments, I think that we shouldn’t be changing things much    In principle, I’m sympathetic to Gary’s proposal, but this is not the right time to make that   change  There is a question about the interpretation of “high resource utilization”  If we take   our central tendency discussion, we’re going to see growth around 2 percent or so, clearly below   potential  That doesn’t suggest a high level of resource utilization  But given what the Chairman   mentioned about likely changes in employment growth, by the time we have our next meeting   we may be adding 01 or 02 percentage point to the unemployment rate, and so it would be 03   percentage point higher than we were quite recently, although it’s still broadly at a relatively low   level  The change would bring us back to a higher level than we’ve seen in quite a few months    We should just be mindful of that  I’m not suggesting that we take it out, but we will have to   think about how to change it because the high level of resource utilization is not going to be there   by traditional measures  But most of us think that there is still a lot of potential to sustain those   pressures, which may not just be the high level of resource utilization  Thank you   May 9, 2007 99 of 130      How will that be represented in the transcript?  [Laughter]     I just want to underscore this point  It’s not at all clear to me that   providing the median of the 70 percent confidence bands is going to be useful to the markets  I   think that we have to think about what will be useful to the markets  It is important to convey   some sense of the uncertainty—and I very much look forward to the memo that Rick asked for    But academics never think in terms of 70 percent confidence intervals; they think about 90 or 95   percent confidence intervals  I’m not sure who besides readers of the Bluebook and the   Greenbook think in 70 percent confidence intervals  So thinking about alternative ways to   May 9, 2007 110 of 130    convey something useful to the markets about our sense of uncertainty, without giving a false   sense of precision of 30 in 2008 and 34 in 2009, may be a better and more sensible way to go  I   think we look odd putting something like this out, and I’m not sure it would actually be helpful     In exhibit 9, the average initial rate on the stock of mortgages   that you are looking at for resetting over the next couple of years is about 7⅓ percent    What is roughly the current rate for subprime fixed-rate loans?     So they are facing a 2½ percent payment shock if they stick   with the mortgage  But if they were able to switch to a fixed-rate product, it is about   1½ percent     Thank you     Thank you very much  The last time we met, there seemed to   be a bit of increased uncertainty about a potential downdraft on economic growth, and now   some of that concern about that downturn seems to be no longer there  Some intermeeting   data have come in a little more on the upside, and obviously the markets have changed their   expectations and seem to agree with that  I think the strength in the labor market and in   consumption, although facing some challenges, is still at a reasonable level  It does seem   that we are getting some signs that investment is coming back   Recent durable goods numbers, which came out today, perhaps raise some questions   of that  We have had a couple of good months and now a bit more of a challenge  But   June 27-28, 2007 82 of 261    when you smooth through, I think, exactly as Governor Kohn suggested, that we’ll have   moderate growth going forward, a forecast that I think is consistent with the Greenbook   forecast  Strength in nonresidential construction, as we have heard around the table, has also   provided us with a bit more optimism for investment in general  But investment is   obviously closely tied to where productivity is going because, if we don’t have investment,   particularly in the high-tech areas rather than just in the construction sectors, it is going to be   hard to sustain high productivity growth  When we get the revised numbers on July 27 and   we also get advance GDP, we’re going to get a lot of information about that, and I think   there is still a lot of uncertainty as to exactly where productivity is going  So I will defer my   comments until the next meeting because we will have those numbers by then   Regarding consumption, we have been having the offsetting wealth effects of the   recently robust equity asset market and much less robust housing asset market, continuing   strength in the labor market, and as the Greenbook points out, increasing disposable income   because we’re having incomes grow faster than productivity growth, at least right now    That suggests that we might maintain a reasonable support for consumption growth, but   again, as Governor Kohn said, there are potentially some challenges here   But now I want to discuss the big challenge that everyone keeps talking about,   which is the housing market  It has become obvious that the transition is going to be quite a   long one and potentially a painful one, perhaps more in individual pockets and for individual   families than for the macroeconomy  It will not just disappear after the third quarter of the   year or even the fourth quarter of the year  I would think in four different ways about how   housing can have a broader effect on the economy   June 27-28, 2007 83 of 261    First is obviously the direct effect on prices  The Case-Shiller ten-city index   suggests that the prices will fall about 3 percent over the next year  Now, that’s roughly   where the market was just before the issues in subprime arose at the end of February, and it   is actually better than it was last fall  So the markets don’t think that there will be an   enormous challenge with respect to prices, at least in these ten markets  But as President   Poole mentioned, sometimes the prices even in these improved indexes, like the Case-  Shiller index, may lag what’s going on and may not accurately reflect the underlying actual   values that people can realize  So there still may be more challenges even though the index   suggests that house prices are down only 3 percent  It is also interesting to look at the delta,   the change in the index  We haven’t really seen much from that, which I think is heartening,   but it is still something that we have to watch out for   Second are the indirect effects, the wealth effects  As I mentioned, there have been   offsetting wealth effects from the equity markets and the housing market  More broadly,   there can be confidence effects on spending and on saving behavior  So far we haven’t seen   a lot of evidence of that  As Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned, there have been anecdotal   reports of challenges in other areas of consumer credit, although so far no real systematic   data suggest that  Even if there is a little movement up, in almost all the typical indexes we   use, many of which were mentioned in the briefing, we are at lows or are much lower than   usual historically  So even with the small movement up, there are not necessarily enormous   challenges; but these effects also have to be watched   A third very important potential effect of this long transition is a response by us or   by lawmakers that could make the transition even longer and more difficult  As a number of   you know—and all of you have been facing pressure on some of these things—we will be   June 27-28, 2007 84 of 261    putting out the subprime adjustable-rate mortgage guidance that we put out for comment just   at the end of February  Our timing couldn’t have been better for getting that out—we did it   just as the problems were becoming more of an issue publicly  I hope the guidance will be   out by the end of this week  We are proposing guidance that subprime adjustable-rate   mortgages have underwriting at the fully indexed rate  I do not think that’s going to be   much of a shock to the markets  The markets have largely moved there already  This was   true from some early statements by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae  Also, some of the major   players who were not underwriting at the fully indexed rate are simply not there anymore—  they are bankrupt—and some of the other players who were not doing it have changed their   standards  As we know from the survey of senior loan officers, standards have been rising    That is not to say that it won’t have some effect, but relative to where the market has already   moved, the effect is not going to be significant     The other major guidance is for giving a prepayment penalty grace period of sixty   days so that people will have at least sixty days before the reset to refinance their mortgage    It’s unclear from the studies we have done at the Board and from looking around how much   of an effect that will have on the initial rate or the so-called teaser rate  It seems that   changing their ability to do that from zero to thirty to sixty days is unlikely to have an   enormous effect on the teaser rate, but that is something that is uncertain  There are some   states that already outlaw prepayment penalties or have restrictions on them  There is not a   lot of evidence suggesting that it is more difficult to get financing in those states  Again,   these guidelines are untested, but I don’t think they will have an enormous effect on the   market, but they are obviously something to watch   June 27-28, 2007 85 of 261    As you well know, we have put out an interagency letter suggesting that servicers   and lenders work very closely with distressed borrowers to try to work things out and keep   people in their homes  Doing so is in the interest of the people in the homes; it is virtually   always in the fiduciary interest of the loan servicer and of the lender  I think we have been   making progress on accounting issues that have been making it difficult for some servicers   to do this, and we are working very closely with the SEC and with FASB on some of these   things  We may be making progress in giving comfort to the servicers who want to do some   restructurings that would help keep people in their houses and would ultimately be better for   the individuals and for the owners of the securities  We have also had the HOEPA hearings   here in which we talked about the potential for rule writing in several areas, such as   requiring escrow for taxes and insurance, some regulation or restriction of prepayment   penalties, and various other things  That would be down the line, but again, we are thinking   that this is unlikely to have a major effect relative to where the markets have already moved   Fourth and finally, there has been a lot of interest in the effect of subprimes in the   housing market not only on the mortgage market but also more generally on the financial   markets, as Governor Warsh and Vice Chairman Geithner pointed out  Fortunately it seems   that liquidity is largely being maintained in the mortgage origination market  There are still   fairly robust amounts of subprime and alt-A originations occurring  They obviously are   going to be declining over time because there are fewer being made; but they were at an   unusually high level in 2006, and so it’s a natural part of the transition process that they   would go down  There has been a very significant increase in spreads, as has been   mentioned by the previous speakers, and there’s much more tiering of risk  It is not just that   the Bs are all the same; it is where they originate  The markets are looking through the   June 27-28, 2007 86 of 261    packages to see what’s in them, which is very, very valuable  Increased volatility and higher   pricing in these markets and the higher long-term interest rate will be a bit more of a   challenge for people doing refinancing, although we’re now down to about 508 for the ten-  year, off 20 to 25 basis points from the high of the other week, and so it may not be quite as   much of a challenge  But there is also a legal risk in this market because, if some problems   become larger, there could be concern about what the new instrument really means and what   you have actually purchased  If legal risk is there, the markets will start to run away from   these things  Then you may have some severe liquidity problems  I do not think that we see   those challenges yet, but it is one indirect effect on the financial market of some of these   issues   Just quickly on inflation—most people have said that we’ve seen some moderation    It is a little too soon to declare victory  As we said in the initial briefing, when we drill   down into the components and look at owners’ equivalent rent, we may get some nasty   surprises going forward  Some numbers have gone down, but owners’ equivalent rent may   come back up a bit  So I don’t think we can say that the temporary elevation in that area has   passed and that we can move on  I think some challenges are still there  Fortunately,   expectations still seem reasonably well contained  But I think that there may be some   challenges going forward as the economy continues to grow at least at a moderate pace, and   some of the temporary factors are not necessarily completely behind us  We still have to   look for potential price pressures going forward  Thank you     Core PCE     So, on your estimate, what we will be seeing tomorrow when   we get the details on prices will be in line with what you have been expecting?  There   was nothing here to make you change your view of that?   MRWILCOX  We don’t know the details of what we will get tomorrow, but   there is nothing here to condition our expectation any differently from what we had   before     Thank you very much  As I mentioned yesterday, I think we   have seen some very welcome signs of moderation, but it is certainly too early to declare   a victory  That is certainly very clear in the Greenbook, as many of you emphasized  I   also agree with Governor Kohn that we are in a reasonably good spot with moderate   growth likely going forward and inflation and inflation expectations reasonably   contained  It is reasonable to think that they may be going down, but there’s a lot of   uncertainty, and most of the uncertainty is to the upside  It is sensible to acknowledge   reality, and we should take out the word “elevated” so that we are not seen as inflation   nutters  We should acknowledge that some of the numbers have come down but be   careful about saying that we are done, we are happy, or we are satisfied   As I mentioned yesterday, an upturn in owners’ equivalent rent could be coming    There could be some uncertainty about pass-through to core of the higher energy prices   that we have been seeing  There is continued strong world demand, and there could be   some lagged pass-through effects of the previous declines in the dollar  I see all those as   risks to the upside, and so I think it’s important to convey that we are still concerned   about those things  That said, I am very supportive of where we are with alternative B, in   terms of both the policy and the message that is coming from it     The type of amendment that Governor Kohn mentioned is one that I very much   support for a number of reasons  One, as he mentioned, it is more forward looking  I   June 27-28, 2007 116 of 261    think it is much better to talk about a sustained moderation in inflation pressures rather   than inflation, because that gets us out of explaining specifically what we mean by   “inflation”  It’s a little bit more general  If we had a clear goal, it would be beneficial    Given that we don’t have a clear goal, I think talking about pressures is good  It also has   the value of being forward looking  Two, the amendment fits with President Stern’s   notion that we should try to keep as much in parallel with the previous statement  So   mentioning moderation in inflation pressures—I’m not sure I wrote down properly   whether Governor Kohn suggested in the final sentence of section 3 “the potential to   sustain those pressures,” taking it back parallel to what we had before, or whether he said   “sustain inflation”  So I would certainly agree with “those pressures”  Three, putting in   “pressures” gets us out of the potential for getting stuck  Here we are saying “sustained   moderation in inflation has yet to be convincingly demonstrated”  Well, if we take that   out at some point, then we will be admitting that it has been convincingly demonstrated,   or at least markets might interpret us as saying that  I think that gets us into a bit more of   a box than I would like, and so talking about inflation pressures avoids the market’s   taking an implication that if we remove that at some point we have said, “Okay  It is   convincingly demonstrated when for six months it is below X or below Y”  I think since   we haven’t articulated a goal yet, we don’t want to get into that box, but I do think that   would be one of the values of articulating a goal  Thank you     Tim, I’m sorry, I heard my name but I didn’t hear what you   said about me  [Laughter]     There is a tense question  The first half of the year isn’t over     Okay     Thanks  I also want to say that I am very supportive of what   the Chairman and the Vice Chairman said  I really think this threads the needle for   getting, as Vice Chairman Geithner said, the right balance  We get to provide more   information with greater clarity and greater accountability, and I think it will also lead to   greater credibility without being perceived as inflexible or challenging the dual mandate    Some of the questions and concerns that I raised in my interventions earlier indicated that   I was supportive of an inflation goal, but I said it was a close call  For me, this is not a   close call  It really addresses a lot of the potential concerns that I had  I also think it’s   extremely good in putting us on the proper evolutionary path  As you well know,   everything at the Fed moves at a pace that is likely to be measured [laughter], and so this   should operate on that same pace  It allows us to understand how the new numbers will   be perceived  As a number of people said, it is very hard to move back, but this gives us   some experimentation and a clear movement forward  It allows us to think about   appropriate risk management, as the Vice Chairman said, at least at this stage,   June 27-28, 2007 173 of 261    particularly given that not everyone is on board with a particular number  Even if   everyone were on board with a particular number, I think a more difficult thing would be   that, if you are away from that number, what the right path is to get to it  I actually think   that is the most difficult thing to get consensus on  This gives us a little more flexibility   on that without making any particular commitments  It provides some credibility without   raising something that could potentially be more problematic  Also, it allows us to   harden this if we so choose  If we’re finding that we’re not getting the credibility   benefits that we might hope from this, we can go forward     On the specifics, I think there is consensus on many of the things that have been   said, so I won’t go through the individual pieces  Just let me mention a couple of things    Actually, along the lines of what the Chairman said about focusing on PCE and the   endogenous response that there will be more focus on it  I think that is, to some extent,   correct  I also think that there may be some issues on existing contracts, and so it is an   important point to think about   The point that President Lacker raised is also an important one to think about    How are these different numbers going to be perceived?  Obviously, we are focusing a lot   on the particular number for inflation, but we are putting these other numbers out in the   same format in the same way  This raises questions about growth goals, employment   goals, the NAIRU, and Phillips curve tradeoffs, about which we certainly—or at least I   certainly—wouldn’t feel comfortable in making commitments  That actually leads me to   desire to put out just a third-year forecast rather than a three-to-five-year forecast, at least   at this point because I think it reduces the chance of misperception and allows for greater   flexibility of how we want to characterize it  It allows us to go forward and characterize   June 27-28, 2007 174 of 261    it more as a goal, if we so choose and there isn’t confusion  But if we say three to five   years, it is hard to step away from that being a particular goal  I am not saying that we   don’t want to do that down the line  But at this stage I think I’d feel a bit more   comfortable in sticking with the pace that is likely to be measured and just adding a year   on that   Again, on this endogenous response, if we do this quarterly, we are likely to   generate a request for quarterly testimony from the Chairman, and that response becomes   more and more likely the more independent we make this document  I’m not saying that   anything is wrong with that, but I think we should just be aware of it  The Chairman   should be aware of what he is getting himself into [laughter] and make sure that he feels   comfortable with that, although I don’t see any problem with it  I just think that it is   important to think about  With respect to the question about whether or not it should be   anonymous, I think it is valuable to have the projections out there but to have them be   anonymous  The main reason for anonymity is, as you well know, that a reporter will   ask, “Don’t you think that President X is completely wrong?”  Talk about red meat in   front of a tiger  That is exactly what people like to look for  They like to look for   dissent  Although there could be some benefits, I see attribution as mostly a downside—  trying to generate dissent among people, which I think is not particularly productive   I do broadly like the idea of expediting the minutes  Getting information to the   market sooner and when it is fresher is more valuable  But I am sensitive to concerns   about the downside risks of people being unable to weigh in and of excess burden on the   staff  So we have to get that balance right  But all other things being equal, I prefer   sooner rather than later  Making sure that we are available to give feedback or can get   June 27-28, 2007 175 of 261    minutes securely in a more expedited process is a relatively small price for the nineteen   of us to pay to provide fresher information to the public  With that, I would also say that   we shouldn’t revise our projections beyond the day of the meeting because the minutes   should be about the meeting  They shouldn’t step on or confuse things, and expediting   them makes that kind of revision even more sensible  So I am very much on board with   this type of proposal  Thanks     Thanks  Much as Gary Stern has said, as an academic I was   never particularly enamored of the statement  But actually having seen how it evolves, how   it is built—usually when you see the way the sausage is made, that upsets your stomach, but   it has actually been the opposite  [Laughter]  Maybe I have been eating the sausage for too   long now  I don’t know  [Laughter]  I’ve been taken in by it  But I think, as Governor   Kohn has said, it has evolved in a way that many of the elements that I was more critical of   a few years ago are not there now  I think it operates in a perfectly reasonable way   Some people have mentioned how the statement could change if we speed up the   minutes  We’re never going to speed up the minutes beyond say a week  Even if we were   to get it to a week, which I don’t think is feasible, the statement can’t change all that much    We have to convey the information that’s in the statement  I don’t think we can say, “Well,   June 27-28, 2007 212 of 261    gee, because next week we’re going to say something, we can just cut it down to two   sentences or three sentences”  As long as there’s a week in between, and I can’t imagine   there being any less than a week in between, the statement is going to have the kind of   information that it has in it, which I think has evolved in a perfectly reasonable way   On governance, since the process is working, I don’t really see the need to change it    There’s a possibility that down the line that concurring opinions could be put out so that   people agree to whatever the monetary policy movement is but, like the Supreme Court,   write their own statement  Since the process seems to be working well without leaving that   possibility for coming in, I don’t see that it’s necessary to make the change, although I’m   open on that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you very much  I was looking back at my notes of the past   few meetings and noted that the position we are in is a bit like that in the May meeting, at least   the way in which people are characterizing things—that economic fundamentals still suggest   moderate growth for the intermediate term but that uncertainty has gone up dramatically  Then,   in the June meeting, we said that uncertainty went down, and now we’re saying that uncertainty   has gone up again  So we seem to have a little volatility just like the markets do, but obviously,   we are responding to what the markets are doing  Clearly, there are key downside risks  The   risk that I’ve mentioned many times before that concerns me and that we now have more data on   is productivity and potential growth  With the revisions since ’03, the compounded growth rate   of productivity is down to 14 percent from 18 percent  The revision is fairly significant over   this period  I am not ready to go quite as far as the Greenbook has gone in marking down   August 7, 2007 74 of 136    potential, but I do think that it is a real possibility, and it is very closely linked to my concerns   about investment, which obviously the financial market volatility has affected     Orders and shipments of durable goods have been a bit choppy, and we haven’t seen the   kind of rise that we would expect, given the balance sheets and given all the other sorts of   strength that we would otherwise see in the economy  Nonresidential investment has been   strong, and there is still some strength in mining and drilling, but I have a lot of concerns outside   that area  As a number of people have mentioned, there is little change in the actual cost of   capital, even though spreads have risen, because the Treasuries have gone down  But with more   uncertainty and more volatility, as Governor Warsh and others have mentioned, undoubtedly that   is going to weigh heavily in the board room  It is going to weigh heavily on capital expenditure   plans  So all other things being equal, businesses are likely to be a bit more cautious going   forward  But that caution with respect to investment and the slowing of the investment recovery   make it harder to be optimistic about a rebound in productivity growth  So that’s something that   I watch very closely because I think it is a very, very important effect   On the consumption-saving balance, certainly we still have very robust labor markets—  average growth of 120,000 private-sector jobs per month this year, which is a step down from   last year but still a robust level  We have a transition from a sort of cushion of the strong equity   market offsetting the negative wealth effect in the housing market  Now, if they become more   correlated—and, in particular, more correlated and both go down—that obviously would raise   some concerns about slowing consumption growth and increasing saving  So I think that is   something to be very mindful of    With respect to housing and financial markets, in the senior loan officer survey with   respect to mortgages, when you drill down into it, both in April and in July more than 50 percent   August 7, 2007 75 of 136    of the senior loan officers reported that they are tightening credit standards for subprime, and   about 15 percent are for prime  That is fairly significant  The depository institutions are pulling   back, and we have certainly heard reports that some of the large institutions are no longer   offering 2/28s or 3/27s  There has also been a tightening outside the depository institutions  The   reason for part of the tightening is that some of the mortgage providers are simply no longer   there  We have had dozens of smaller providers of credit go out of business, and the ones that   are still there are obviously changing their underwriting standards  As President Rosengren   mentioned, we are seeing some questions about the originate-to-distribute model  We are also   seeing volatility on the financial market side  But part of that volatility, as a number of people   have expressed, is about concerns about what is going into those securities in the originate-to-  distribute model  That may raise some questions in the long run about how much we’re going to   see this market come back  I share Governor Warsh’s concerns, not only from the point of view   of the financial markets but also regarding the structure of mortgage markets—that we may be   seeing a little less of that kind of structure than we have seen in the past  So that, combined with   the tightening of standards more broadly, may make financing more difficult to get  This, of   course, is occurring in many parts of the country—not all parts but many parts—where housing   inventories are very high and in some cases are still rising  Obviously, that puts a lot more   pressure on the housing market, and I think the drag from the housing market, as many of you   said, is likely to continue   Fortunately, the financial market volatility is coming at a time of relative strength in   corporate balance sheets  Debt-to-asset ratios have been declining, and liquid assets as a   percentage of total assets have been high  That provides much more of a cushion, much more   insurance  As President Poole mentioned, the banking system is in a dramatically different state   August 7, 2007 76 of 136    from when we had challenges before in the housing market or major challenges in financial   markets  The major banks have very high, relative to historical trends, capital-to-asset ratios in   excess of the required minimums  They have been very, very profitable  If you look at the   largest banks—and I was just looking at some that were most involved in the leveraged-loan   market—they each have tier 1 capital on the order of $80 billion to $90 billion  The earnings for   each over the last year are $25 billion to $35 billion  There is also a lot of discussion of the   amount of highly leveraged loans in the pipeline—on the order of $300 billion  But unless they   have to take losses on that $300 billion, which is not going to happen, they have very thick   capital cushions and very high earnings  So at least for the foreseeable future, this will just be   more a challenge to their earnings than a challenge to capital   That is extremely important because the banking system can provide a critical automatic   stabilizing mechanism, as it did in 1998, when there are liquidity challenges  In 1998 we had the   Asian crisis that spread to Latin America, then the Russian crisis, and LTCM  There were some   parallels to what we are seeing now  Risk spreads were rising very dramatically after a period of   near-record low levels, and we saw the yields on Treasuries go down quite a bit because that’s   where people were going  But what was happening in the system was that people were pulling   money out of various funds and instruments and putting it into the banking system  So the banks   do act as liquidity providers and liquidity insurers, and I think we’re starting to see a bit of that   now with people pulling out of some of these instruments and so more is flowing into the banks    It’s a little early to tell  We haven’t gotten enough data on that  But anecdotal reports are   consistent with exactly what happened in 1998  As people need an alternative to commercial   paper or other short-term sources of credit, it can be very helpful that the banking system will   have more liquid resources to do that, and obviously it’s a strong capital environment  Also, as   August 7, 2007 77 of 136    Governor Warsh mentioned, there are more large private pools of capital to step in to bid for the   LTCMs, if such things happen  When we look back to LTCM, only one offer was on the table—  from Warren Buffett—and there were a lot of questions about how serious that offer would be    Now a number of players have the wherewithal to be the equivalent of that in this market, which   has the potential to be quite helpful  There are obviously more potential downside risks, but a lot   of stability exists in the banking system to deal with some of these risks and, given the strength   of the balance sheets, should be helpful in the short or the intermediate run   With respect to inflation, as many people have mentioned, a number of risks are still   skewed to the upside, with robust global growth, potential pass-through, some previous high   energy prices, and a lower dollar  So I still think that there is much more of a potential upside   skew to inflation than a downside skew  Basically, I would start taking my first steps, but just   very first steps, a little more toward a balance of risk because of the greater downside to growth    Although there are still upside risks to inflation, as Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned, overall   we might want to think of moving a little more toward a greater balance of risk but still with a   predominant concern for inflation     Thank you very much  I also support keeping the fed funds rate   unchanged, and I very much agree with the way that Governor Kohn was thinking about what we’re   trying to achieve  So let me just describe why I think that alternative B as is largely achieves that    The key to my thinking about the decision on changing the statement is, first, whether something   has materially changed so that the markets will realize that, when we change the statement, we do so   because something has actually happened and, second, whether it gives us the flexibility going   forward to make another change if new information comes in  So, for example, in paragraph 2,   acknowledging the volatility and talking about credit conditions, about the housing market, and then   about the offsetting factors of employment, growth in income, and global demand—all those things   are relevant  The new things—the financial markets and credit conditions—have been there a bit   but are now more important than they were before  So we’re acknowledging things that actually   August 7, 2007 102 of 136    have happened in the intermeeting period  I also like that it gives a bit more color about what’s   going on and how we’re thinking about things, and each piece is one that we can easily leave, add   to, or take back, and that is very valuable  So I like the formulation of paragraph 2 because it both   acknowledges new information that has come in and does so not in a way that suggests fear or   excess concern but just sort of acknowledges various factors, particularly the financial conditions in   the context of others on the upside  The balance is, I think, very nice   On paragraph 3, I agree with President Plosser that it is not clear to me that we had new   information so that we would want to change the characterization  I see nothing wrong with the   characterization that we have there  I am not as concerned as President Plosser is that it makes more   of a value judgment  But my question is just why we have made the change  I am happy with   either way, but using my criterion that if no information is new why change, I am not quite sure why   we changed it  I think it is fine either way     On paragraph 4, I think it is very important to take a step toward balance without going all   the way toward balance because it is much too early to tell, as many people have said  Putting the   downside risks there makes a lot of sense because of the tradition of the structure  Again, I don’t   see any reason to change the overall formulation or the overall structure at this point, particularly   when the markets are jittery  I don’t think we should be going about a sort of structural change in   the statement  Even if ultimately we might want to think about it, I do not think this would be the   time to do it  Also, I like that it is very easy to put on and take off, so that if growth does come back   up, we can easily remove the language  If growth goes down, we can move toward balance of risk   very easily there if we want to, and as Governor Warsh said, if we drop “predominant,” we cannot   get that back  I feel that we are not at a stage—or at least from the discussion around the table and   from where I am—where we should do that  Also, I think you would have a very strong reaction in   August 7, 2007 103 of 136    the markets  If the markets saw that we both acknowledged the downside risk and took out   “predominant” or even just took out the word “predominant,” that would indicate a much stronger   risk and be a much stronger signal that we are going to move more quickly  I do think that this   statement as is will lead to a slight increase in expectations of a cut a little earlier, but that’s   perfectly acceptable because I can’t see any better way to get the balance right  Thank you     Yes, in principle I think that is a good way to characterize what’s going   on  But going back to the criteria that I was using, in many cases the risk premiums have simply   moved close to historical levels from record lows  So if they stay at historical averages over time,   that’s not necessarily something that’s wrong or problematic  It may be very difficult to take that   phrase away if risk premiums stay where they are in at least some of the markets  I don’t think   that’s necessarily a bad thing, and I’ve heard a number of people around the table suggest that  In   certain markets, they have been above historical averages, but in many markets they have simply   moved to the historical average, and I am just a bit concerned about being able to take that away   August 7, 2007 112 of 136      No  All of the remarks I was going to make have been made     Yes, I certainly want to endorse the proposals and the approach going   forward, and I also agree with Governor Kohn and with President Stern  Perhaps one amendment to   the statement could be adding “going forward” to the end of the first sentence  So the beginning   would read, “Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and   increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward  In these   circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a   moderate pace,” the risks have increased  I think it nicely captures that, and it really focuses on the   forward-looking nature of what we’re trying to do  It emphasizes what we’ve always talked about   in our statements, and I think it fits very nicely with the structure of the statement itself   I agree that we are in an uncertain area where we don’t know whether or not this will be   effective, but also we have uncertainty about the evolution of the housing market and about the   evaluation of securities that are related to the housing market  Certainly it is helpful to provide   some liquidity backstop to make it worthwhile for people to do the due diligence to make the   investment, to try to find out what the securities are worth, because they think it’s more likely that   someone is going to be there to trade with  I’m not sure that this will be the definitive way to   August 16, 2007 29 of 37    achieve that goal, but I think it’s a worthwhile step to take  So I very much endorse this series of   steps going forward     Thank you very much  Obviously, I agree with virtually everyone   around the table that some of the downside risks have increased, and it’s important to think about   them in terms not just of the overall average but of tail risks  As Vice Chairman Geithner   pointed out, one of the responsibilities we have overall is for thinking about macroeconomic and   financial stability, and so we have to take into account those tail risks  Even if they may not   change the mean or the median forecast that much, it is important that we think about those   downside scenarios  Obviously, the chance of those has increased  Now, whether that is likely   is something we will continue to discuss  Some of those channels through which this could be   happening are from the real sector in housing, concerns about information in subprime markets   leading to broader problems in the markets  I’d like to characterize the markets as being brittle    That is, they are in a state such that a little pressure here or a little pressure there has the potential   to cause some cracks  Many markets are functioning, but some are not functioning very well,   and there is always the potential for something else to come along the line, even just a small   amount of pressure  We saw that what really initiated things right after our FOMC meeting was   BNP Paribas’s announcement  That gets back to something that Karen Johnson said earlier in   one of these things  It was hard to know that it was coming, and it would have been hard to   know that it would have the kind of effect that it seemed to have of leading to a revaluation of   September 18, 2007 83 of 188                                                                                                          September 18, 2007 84 of 188  risks not just in the subprime sector but much more broadly  So I think we have to be very   mindful of the brittleness of these markets   I do think that the numbers that have come in, looking in the rearview mirror, are pretty   strong  Looking forward, there is more uncertainty, as Dave and others have mentioned  We   obviously have the housing market problems, and we have the challenges in the labor markets   To throw something in from an anecdotal survey, although it’s a fairly systematic survey—at   Duke they surveyed 600 CFOs of major corporations, and they asked a series of extra questions    The survey was done in August, and so it was filled out by the end of August  We don’t know   exactly when they filled these out, but they had to be in by the end of August  Asked about the   financial market turmoil, three-quarters of the CFOs said that it had no direct effect on them, but   only 40 percent said that they were taking no action because of the financial market turmoil A   third of them said that they were going to be reducing capital spending, and 15 percent said that   they were going to be reducing hiring  This is not just of the one-quarter who said that there   would be direct impact but of everyone, three-quarters of whom said that there would be no   direct impact But they said that they were reducing capital spending plans and hiring plans  So   this uncertainty could have real effects from these channels that we haven’t yet seen Also, for   what it’s worth, though I guess it’s more relevant for the next round, one of the questions was,   “Would you be helped by a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate?”  A resounding   45 percent said no  Less than one-third said that it would be more than a moderate help to them,   but that’s something we’ll get to in a bit   One thing that I want to do—it has been important in my thinking and was also raised by   a few people—is look at the parallels and differences with 1998 because that is the closest   episode that I can think of in which many of the same liquidity issues came up  a dramatic     widening of the on-the-run, off-the-run Treasury spread, actually, much larger in 1998 than we   have seen recently; a plunge in short-term yields; and a very strong desire for short-term   Treasury paper—exactly as we have seen in both cases, although greater volatility in that short-  term market today than in 1998 and higher volatility with respect to the equity markets today   than in 1998  Spreads also moved up—term spreads, swap spreads, and CP spreads went up   quite dramatically, although in certain types of CP spreads a little bit less back then than today    An interesting thing I noted in going back and looking at the old memos, which were created I   think by some of the people who are in the room now, was that one thing that brought the CP   market back in 1998-99 was not an innovation but the dramatically greater use of something that   had only just started to be used—asset-backed commercial paper—providing collateral that   helped people to feel confident that they could buy this commercial paper and something would   be there  So it is sort of ironic to see that the challenge today was the innovation that, to some   extent, saved the CP market back then  We are seeing the same kind of swelling of bank balance   sheets today that we were back then—an enormous amount of liquidity coming into the banking   system  In terms of the macro shocks, there are some parallels and differences  We came into   the summer of ’98 with an economy that was growing reasonably strongly, exactly the time of   those productivity shocks that weren’t fully understood  Some people had the intuition that those   productivity shocks were going to be strong, but they were stronger than the Greenbook and, I   think, any of the private-sector economists had anticipated  There was also an important   international shock, which we don’t have now, and there was also a very strong policy response,   which helped provide liquidity in the emerging markets  Interestingly, there was a policy cut of   75 basis points in a fairly short period of time  We will get to that in the second round   September 18, 2007 85 of 188    But something that I think is different is that the source of the uncertainty, at least so far   as market participants were concerned, was really focused very much on (1) the international   markets and (2) LTCM  The interventions in the international markets through the IMF, the   World Bank, and others were helping to respond to some of those  There was the working out in   September, actually before any of the FOMC rate cuts occurred, to try to settle the LTCM issue    But being able to focus on the source of the uncertainty as the market participants perceived it   back then was very important  I think we have a much greater challenge today because the   source of uncertainty is really a change in the whole model of how these markets are operating    In the old days, we used to know where the risks were; unfortunately, we knew that they were all   on the bank balance sheets  With the originate-to-distribute model and securitization, we have   been able to move to a different model in which the risks are much more dispersed  Not all of   them are on the bank balance sheets, although some of them are certainly going to be coming   onto the bank balance sheets, so the banks never fully get out of this  But it leads to potential   pockets of uncertainty, and that is exactly what has come up  People don’t have as much   information as they thought they had  They were relying on traditional rating agencies and on   other sources that were perfectly fine for traditional credits but more of a challenge for the newer   credits  So I have sometimes said to market participants who talk about this, “Well, you know,   you were too trusting of those ratings, and I think now you’ve learned that Ronald Reagan was   right  ‘Trust, but verify’”  Thus there’s a lot more that is being spent on trying to verify what   the value of credits is in these markets  You can see that as being somewhat inefficient because   now everybody has to do that individually rather than just rely on a centralized credit-rating   agency, but obviously there are questions about the effectiveness of that credit-rating agency    That is one reason that I see a slow recovery in some of these markets—market participants   September 18, 2007 86 of 188    realize that they didn’t have the information they thought they had  They are now going to have   to invest much more in getting that information  I think one thing that has been important in the   actions we have undertaken is to provide liquidity and support so that people should feel it is   worthwhile to make the investment, to do the due diligence, and to try to understand that they   need to verify the ratings or other things that are out there   The banking system, as has been mentioned, is in a good state, but I don’t want to   overstate that because there are challenges in bringing things onto the bank balance sheets  As   was mentioned, a lot of capital is above the regulatory minimums, but there is a reason that   banks hold capital above their regulatory minimums  They are concerned about ratings    Regardless of what people may say about rating agencies these days, they are still sensitive to   that  Banks are worried about making sure that they are perceived as having sufficient capital   and sufficient liquidity  So one shouldn’t just say, “Well, you can use up all that capital”  With   the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, we have tried to add up the maximum   amount of SIV conduits; the ABCP that could come onto the books, which is potentially in the   hundreds of billions of dollars; and the amount of leveraged-loan commitments, which is about   $280 billion to $300 billion just for the four or five major banks alone  That still doesn’t bring   you to say capital falls below “well capitalized,” but that is not where their banks want to be  So   I do think that the banks would react if these things started coming onto their books  In addition,   we did some investigations with the OCC through the Shared National Credit Program  We   pulled records on about 900 credits at the major institutions to try to see what the underwriting   standards were  We found—or I should say that the examiners found—that about 23 percent of   those were considered to have weak underwriting standards  Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean   that there are going to be problems or losses, but it was much higher than had been expected    September 18, 2007 87 of 188    About 28 percent of those were on US banks and 26 percent on foreign banking organizations,   but almost half of them were on nonbank organizations  I don’t want to overemphasize the   challenges to the banks, but there still may be these pockets of weaknesses out there that we are   not sure about   What that brings me to, in thinking of where we are, is that we have gotten into a very   good situation from a risk-management point of view  By holding the line and being very   credible on inflation, we have seen core numbers decline over the past three to six months and in   a fairly consistent way, exactly as Jeff Lacker said  Even as the markets have dramatically   reevaluated where they think policy is going to go in the short and intermediate terms, we have   seen very little change in market expectations of inflation  That gives us a lot more potential to   be able to move forward  Also, from a risk-management and insurance perspective, what if the   economy does take off?  What if it is 1998-99?  I have some numbers that the staff provided to   me  In the November 1998 FOMC meeting, which was the last time they raised interest rates,   real GDP was forecasted at 33 percent for ’98, and it turned out to be 45  They were predicting   16 percent growth for ’99; it actually turned out to be 47  But the key from my perspective is   what happened to inflation, because one way of thinking about it is, What is the steepness of the   Phillips curve?  There may be other explanations for this  The Greenbook forecast for the   November FOMC meeting was 24 percent for core CPI inflation in ’98, and the Greenbook was   spot on  That’s what it was in ’98  The Greenbook was forecasting 22 for ’99  It turned out to   be 2 percent  It was actually lower than it had been and than was forecasted  So even with a 75   basis point increase, even with very little effect on the macroeconomy, it turned out that there   was not much of a tradeoff, not much of a loss in buying that insurance  That heartens me as we   go into the next round to think about the policy choices  Thank you   September 18, 2007 88 of 188       Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I mentioned before, from a risk-  management perspective I think it’s very sensible to make a 50 basis point cut  We have an   environment in which the economy has been growing modestly  Some of the numbers that we’ve   seen recently—the lower numbers in the labor market in the revisions from the previous months as   well as from August—presumably had nothing to do with the August financial turmoil or I think it’s   highly unlikely that the August numbers had anything to do with it  The housing market was   turning down  So even though we have been growing a little more strongly, we’re really coming in   facing headwinds in some important markets  As the Chairman mentioned, the interaction between   September 18, 2007 116 of 188    those two leads to a potential for downside risk, particularly in light of the financial market turmoil   that we’ve been seeing  I think it’s important to be aware of that and to take that into account in   undertaking our monetary policy actions   Also, as I’ve mentioned before and as others have mentioned, even given the dramatic   changes that we’ve seen in the past month in market expectations about what we are going to do, we   have not seen an uptick in inflation expectations in terms either of surveys or of the markets, which   heartens me that a 50 basis point action is unlikely to have a large negative effect on expectations   about the future path of inflation, particularly, I think, given the language in alternative B   I don’t see this at all as being reactive  One thing that I’m extremely pleased to see is that   the FOMC did not have an intermeeting cut  I think that would have been seen as reactive    Remember back in 1998  The LTCM situation was worked out in late September  There was the   meeting with the 25 basis point cut, and then there was the concern with another 25 basis point cut   that came after that, and then the following meeting they did it  There was an intermeeting move    That seemed much more reactive  I think our approach has been very level-headed, and that is one   thing that has allowed the expected inflation rates to stay stable even as they expect us to cut the   policy rate  So I’m very much heartened by that  Then with respect to what Charlie and others have   brought up about reversals, that’s very important  Exactly as President Evans said—pardon me for   reverting to your civilian name—[laughter] certainly what happened was that, by June, the FOMC   decided to reverse and then in the next three meetings reversed the 75 basis points  The FOMC   went up to 6½ percent, and only about six or seven months later dramatically reversed that  Many   people ex post have said moving up that much was ill-advised  Even before September 11, the   FOMC had dropped interest rates approximately 400 basis points in a very short time, suggesting a   September 18, 2007 117 of 188    very rapid reversal  So I’m not sure that it was necessary to go up to those heights to forestall   inflation pressure   So in this circumstance, I’m very supportive of alternative B  I think it will be read well by   the markets that we’re aware of what’s going on  We haven’t overreacted  We haven’t been   reactive  We’ve waited until our meeting, and we’ve left our options open in alternative B, honestly   admitting that we are uncertain about what is going forward and leaving open the possibility of   future actions  Taking a stronger action now has the potential to help unlodge the logjam in the   markets, and we may have to take fewer actions in the future     Two things, one related to that  On the first page, you said that you   consolidate all the foreign banking organizations  So in the United States they would just   operate as one, even though they may have different subsidiaries, and they will be treated as one   organization, even if formally they have multiple organizations in the United States     Second, in terms of the timing of the auction itself, are there any   challenges because of some of the delays here?  This seems like a somewhat slower process than   September 18, 2007 134 of 188    some other auctions that are run—the bids are submitted on Monday, and the notification isn’t   until Wednesday     So you have the flexibility, if you get used to it, to be able to do it   almost in real time       Quickly, as a follow-up to that—if you are successful in getting rid of   the stigma problem, then does the discount window effectively disappear?     But there might be pressure for it to disappear because this certainly   would be more desirable than the discount window  It’s cheaper, and there’s no stigma     Deposit insurance, I’ll remind you, in 1933 was temporary       Okay  Well done     Again, I’ll echo praise for just the incredible work that the staffs have   done—a very clever way to address some specific problems that we’re facing  One is the stigma   problem, and two, as I mentioned earlier, is the source of the uncertainty  We don’t really have the   tool to get at that directly; we can get at it only very indirectly  With the 1998 situation, there was   another way to get at that  Some people thought it was a good way; some people thought it was a   bad way  We won’t debate that, but the market perception was that a particular institution was at   the heart of a lot of the uncertainty, and if you could resolve that, you could reduce that uncertainty   significantly  Also the interventions by the IMF and other organizations dealt with some of the   international uncertainties  With the traditional tools that we have, we’re somewhat hampered in   trying to get at that, so I think this is a very clever way to try to do so  But really my comments   echo what President Rosengren has said  When we start to move from doing overnight to doing   term funding, we may need to rethink what kind of collateral we have  Obviously, we’re now using   80 percent of collateral rather than 100 percent of collateral  That’s certainly a step in the right   direction   We need to think about whether we need “well capitalized and well managed”  That creates   some challenges in trying to differentiate this from the overnight lending facility, and as Mr   Alvarez said, it raises some issues with respect to singling out institutions that make one hurdle but   don’t make the other hurdle  But we need to think about it very carefully because the potential   challenge both from an optics point of view and a substantive point of view is that, in the short run,   we want to help out institutions in certain ways by providing funding but we don’t want to be   helping out those that have not taken appropriate actions    September 18, 2007 149 of 188    In extreme circumstances like those we have now, as the Chairman said, one could certainly   say that we’re out of equilibrium on pricing a lot of the assets, pricing the collateral, pricing the   value, or pricing issuances by certain institutions, and so it is extremely important that this be short   term and that those kinds of considerations be brought to the fore and thought through very   carefully and have the potential to be altered over time if we don’t feel we’re having sufficient   haircuts  If we do feel that certain institutions may transit from one rating to another within twenty-  eight days, we need to be prepared to think about how to respond because it raises questions for a   least-cost resolution of institutions that may be going down  But I do think this is an extremely   creative approach to try to get at something that we otherwise didn’t have easy tools to get at  It   may create a longer-term issue of an expectation that this kind of thing will come out again or that   there will be another type of clever innovation that will deal with the next market problem so that   people don’t have to worry about those market problems  But that’s a very difficult tradeoff to   make  I can support this as addressing the short-term problem, and I think we can largely deal with   some of those longer-term issues if we do stick to our guns and make it temporary and if we clearly   articulate what we’re trying to get at     Thank you very much  I very much agree with Dave’s   characterization of the Greenbook as a modal forecast, and I think it is an excellent and perfectly   reasonable modal forecast  As almost all of us have said, the data are coming in a little stronger    October 30-31, 2007 63 of 162    We will have a fair amount of momentum going into the fourth quarter  We will have a   significant drag from housing in ’08  The financial markets outside of housing have generally   had fairly significant improvement, although a lot of brittleness remains  A very clear example   of that is how the markets seemed to flatten out in the past week or so and certain markets   backed up a bit, and thus the risk spreads are widening  It is also interesting to note that, when   the first earnings reports that were fairly negative were coming out, there was a positive market   reaction because it was sort of a relief that they were owning up to the challenges  Now that   more information is coming out, some of which is more negative than had been expected, the   market’s reactions have been more negative, and some of the risk spreads have been widening    That suggests that a lot of concern is still out there, and a lot of people are waiting for the other   shoe to drop  I will note that I am sure that other shoe will have been manufactured in   Richmond  [Laughter]   Since this was a modal forecast, I want to think about a downside scenario, one on which   I put a reasonable amount of probability mass and one that I think we should seriously consider    A number of people have talked about bank balance sheets  Generally, there has been less   concern about them than before  One of the big issues that we had focused on earlier was   leveraged lending  That seems to be working itself out reasonably well without much incident    There is obviously a lower new flow on, but the new flow does have covenants, et cetera  So   that seems to be working out reasonably  ABCP, SIVs, conduits—there is still uncertainty about   how much may come onto the balance sheets, although there is a lot more comfort with the   extent of the call on the capital that is there, but there is still uncertainty as to how much might   be called  You know, the SIVs seem to be working themselves down  They are shrinking   through orderly asset sales  But, of course, what are they doing?  They are selling the best assets   October 30-31, 2007 64 of 162    first, so the potential challenges are still left behind  For the banks, the conforming mortgages   are easy to get off the balance sheets  There seems to be a debate about whether banks are   choosing not to get nonconforming ones off the balance sheet or whether they can’t get them off   the balance sheet  Many organizations that have a lot of capital seem to be just originating these   wholly on the balance sheet and waiting for better pricing, as we have heard reports from other   institutions saying that they are ready, willing, and able to buy at a good price and the supply just   isn’t there   Nonetheless, there is still much more carefulness in the underwriting of those loans    Obviously, the jumbo mortgages, the nonconforming mortgages, are more important than they   used to be because housing prices have run up so much around the country  $417,000 doesn’t   buy you as much house anymore, even in parts of the country that don’t have or traditionally   have not had particularly high housing prices  That raises a concern about a squeeze through the   mortgage markets  So I see that the consequence of the financial turbulence is primarily   highlighting issues in the mortgage markets, as a number of people have said  Also, as I think   the Greenbook and Bluebook pointed out, it is not a problem for highly rated or even just   moderately well rated corporations to get funding  That is not a challenge right now  It seems   mainly to be coming through the housing market   So I see a potential for a slow-burn scenario coming and for the housing market to slowly   play itself out because we are going to have continuing negative shocks  More than 400,000   resets are going to be coming every quarter, starting with this quarter, through 2008  As a   number of people have noted, we have much higher credit standards than before  Many of the   people who were supplying subprime loans no longer exist, and those who are supplying them   are supplying them at much, much higher standards  We will be proposing and putting out new   October 30-31, 2007 65 of 162    rules  The Congress is considering new rules  This is all casting a pall over people who might   potentially be supplying credit into some of these markets  The delinquencies and foreclosures   are clearly going to continue rising at least for a few quarters, probably—as analysis by some   people at the Board suggests—peaking in mid-2008  But there is still a lot of uncertainty with   respect to that  So it is going to continue to put more and more challenges in this market     All of these things coming together could put a lot more pressure on housing prices  I   think we have been seeing some significant declines in housing construction, but I see a potential   for a reasonable likelihood of a much larger negative house-price effect than what the Greenbook   has  As a shred of evidence for that, the incredibly illiquid Case-Shiller index that is traded on   the Mercantile Exchange, if you look forward, for a number of markets they have a cumulative   decline of 20 percent over a couple of years  Now, the number of players may be no more than   the number of fingers that I have, but still it is a piece of data suggesting that it could be lower    The anecdotal reports are that real housing prices are much lower than the indexes are indicating    Certainly, in the new market, they are throwing in a lot of extras, add-ons, et cetera, and the   inventory may actually be larger because the anecdotal reports are that a lot of people are taking   their houses off the market, so they are not formally included in the enormous inventories that   are out there but may well be potentially there for supply   So what does this suggest going forward?  Well, from a risk-management perspective, we   ought to be thinking about buying insurance against this downside scenario  What is the cost of   insurance?  Inflation and inflation expectations  As most people have mentioned, we have seen   some gradual slowing and expectations are still being contained but, as Governor Kohn pointed   out, there is a bit of an uptick in the CPI, which is definitely worrisome  But what is the risk?    Well, let us think about the upside risk  I go back to 1998, when the FOMC cut 75 basis points    October 30-31, 2007 66 of 162    Growth was 45 percent in 1998 and 47 percent in 1999  As I mentioned last time, we saw very   little increase in inflation—actually a decline in core inflation  I looked at the core PCE in   addition to the core CPI that I reported last time, and that was effectively flat at 14, 16 percent   in ’98 and ’99 and then 16 percent again in 2000  The potential benefit of buying a little   insurance now is that, given that a lot of these challenges may be peaking in mid-2008, it may   have some effect down the line  It provides perhaps a bit more insurance against some of the   negative shocks that we may be hearing about  If those other shoes do drop over the next few   months, then we have a lower downside risk for broader financial turbulence  Also, by mid-  2008, if the scenario that I am describing or the other negative scenarios that people have   described, aren’t materializing, we can take back some of these moves  Thank you     Thank you  As I discussed yesterday, I take very much a risk-  management approach  But I also like the way that President Evans characterized that risk-  management approach as your having to think about the costs and the benefits and very much focus   on the potential costs  So in thinking about the best way to go, I think about if we do or don’t move,   then what are the downside risks to each?  We’ve seen, as many people have said, a lot of progress   in the financial markets  We have also seen a little backing up of some of that progress and a   flattening out over the past couple of weeks  In particular, the one set of markets that we haven’t   seen as much progress in as certainly I would like is housing-related markets  That is for me the   most direct channel between financial turmoil and the real economy     As I described yesterday, my tail risk scenario is sort of a slow-burn scenario  It is not one   in which this financial turmoil will get out of control and we will have an incredible mess so we   need to cut interest rates to prevent it  I think that was more the concern and focus in our previous   meeting  We have seen improvement, although I don’t think we’ve seen normalization, particularly   October 30-31, 2007 120 of 162    in the housing markets  Given that we’ve had some but not full normalization and then given that   we have resets coming and the tightening of credit standards, the elimination of a lot of subprime   lending, the rules that we are going to put out, and the rules that the Congress is considering,   regardless of how carefully we craft them or whether or not the Congress makes progress, the effect   on the housing market will undoubtedly be somewhat chilling  So I see a potential slow-burn   scenario in which it is valuable to be buying some insurance against that as early as possible  These   problems may be peaking toward the middle of next year, because that’s when they have the most   potential to have a negative effect on housing prices, which, as others have described, could have   this sort of simultaneity issue or vicious cycle aspect that could lead things to go down     Given that we have those conditions and we have that potential going forward, it seems   worthwhile to buy that insurance now  What is the cost of doing that?  Of course, it is in terms of   inflation and inflation expectations  As the markets have changed their expectations about what   we’re likely to do at this meeting and even as they have dramatically changed their path of future   policy moves, there’s very little evidence that inflation expectations, at least up to the five-year   horizon, have moved up significantly  There is a question of how to interpret that longer-term   change in inflation expectations; I take it very seriously, and I think we have to try to understand it   better  But I don’t think that there’s an enormous cost in terms of moving now versus six to nine   months from now to buy more insurance against what I see as a challenge from the recent financial   market turbulence  I think there is also a concern, which President Poole raised, that if we have a   fairly large surprise to the markets, it could reduce or even reverse some of the progress that has   been made in some of the markets, potentially forcing us to move more than we would like at the   next meeting   October 30-31, 2007 121 of 162    So that said, I think it is very important and very valuable that we make a move now  As   other have said, it is a close call because we have to worry about the cost with respect to inflation    One way to contain that cost, as a number of people have said, is to clarify the path going forward,   to show that what we’re doing now is responding not to current data but to the forecast about the   data  Obviously when the markets were expecting GDP at 31 and it comes in at 39, we’re not   saying that we’re reacting to current market data by making a cut  But we are thinking about the   potential future effect and then trying to give some guidance through a balance of risk statement    I’m open to a modification of that statement to try to convey that we think we don’t necessarily   need to do more with respect to the challenges that are coming now but we’re going to continue to   remain vigilant and look at things like the housing market and other markets that have potential to   have negative ramifications for the whole economy  Thanks       I just wanted a clarification  In the explanation, will we say that the   projections are based on what we have done?  For example, today, given that we are having a   policy move and I am not sure that everyone around the table had anticipated that move today in   their path, will we be articulating that these are not the numbers that we came into the meeting   with, but these are the numbers that we think after the policy action has been taken?     Thank you     Thank you very much  I, too, support the swap and the TAF    Earlier, my position would have been closer to Eric Rosengren’s as I had also supported a   discount rate cut; but I’ve changed my mind on that for a number of reasons  Many market   participants have told me that, well, if it’s only just a little bit narrower, given market conditions,   they would be willing to use it  But I think what we have now seen, as President Lacker and   others have mentioned, is that these spreads have widened quite significantly, and so it doesn’t   December 6, 2007 40 of 51    seem that cutting 25 basis points is going to avoid the stigma  People would start to come to the   window now if it were only a 25 basis point opportunity cost  It has become much higher than   that, and so I think that’s not going to really work  If we cut it to zero, then I think the   operational concerns, the lack of predictability, and the difficulties that we would create for the   New York Desk just make that option not effective  So that’s why I think the TAF is beneficial   and does have some chance to overcome some of the stigma issues     Actually, I think very much along the lines of and very much agree with what the Vice   Chairman and Bill Dudley said  First, I do think that history does matter a bit here  So because   it is a new facility without the same baggage of the discount window, it has a chance, by no   means a certainty but a chance, to overcome that stigma  As the Vice Chairman emphasized,   greater anonymity is another thing; many market participants have told me that this is a problem   with the current discount window  I think there would be greater anonymity here, and so a   combination of its being a new facility and having less finger-pointing going on would make it   more possible to overcome the stigma  Also, distinct from this and perhaps even more   important, it’s really a way to expand our tool set  One thing with which many of us have been   frustrated is that we have realized that the lender-of-last-resort function has been not functioning   as well as it could—not just because of stigma but also because of things that are going on in the   market that are beyond the traditional depository institutions and beyond the traditional securities   that we typically deal with—and those blunt instruments of discount lending or even term RPs   are not the most effective tools to get at that  This may be a more effective way to get at that—in   some sense a more elegant, more refined tool to get at some of the particular liquidity problems   that we’re seeing   December 6, 2007 41 of 51    But of course, there are some potential costs  The point that President Stern raised about   liquidity versus capital really weighed very heavily on me when I was first thinking about this    But as I’ve seen the way the markets have developed; and as I have worked very closely with the   supervision and regulation staff, my concerns are that it’s exactly these liquidity problems that   will turn into capital insolvency problems  It is precisely because of the strong price pressures   that we’re seeing that marks are having to be taken, and that’s constraining balance sheets  Also   real fire sales may occur that might be avoided or at least made a bit more orderly with   something like the TAF     Second, there’s the moral hazard problem that a number of people have mentioned about   providing funds to the weakest institutions, but that in some sense is what the discount window   has always done  It lends freely at a penalty rate  Well, who’s going to choose it at a penalty   rate?  Not the institutions that are strong and can go elsewhere  So I’m not quite sure that this   really has any worse problems of that kind relative to our regular discount window operations  I   think the term structure change can be helpful in these kinds of market situations  I agree that   the historical example of Operation Twist suggests that it may not be that effective  These are   unusual circumstances, and there’s some potential that, in these circumstances of very low   liquidity in certain markets, it could have some beneficial effect   Finally, one of the costs that I was concerned about was a reputational hit  What if we   hold an auction and no one shows up?  Well, I think what the Chairman spoke about—that we   could simply do term repos if we don’t get many takers at the auction—helps get rid of some of   that reputational risk  Then if it doesn’t work, we can just sort of move this aside  Also, I think   it helps to protect a little against, well, we’re doing something now because it’s sort of hair-  raisingly scary out there and so we have to do something new  It says that it’s part of what we   December 6, 2007 42 of 51    can do with term funding but it’s also something a bit different that gets at some of the particular   liquidity issues that we have today  So looking at the costs and benefits, I think it’s definitely   worthwhile to go with the TAF, particularly in the context of improving international   cooperation  Thanks     Thank you  At the last meeting I expected a somewhat rougher patch,   particularly in housing, than the last Greenbook scenario—a sort of slow-burn scenario, or   something that Dave made reference to  But over just the past three weeks or so, the heat of that fire   has become a lot greater than I had expected in terms of the burn that I’m seeing in the financial   markets as well as in the real markets, particularly with respect to consumption, as many people   have mentioned, and then more broadly just the reclosing of markets that had opened up  I   described some of the markets and the turmoil, saying that things were in sort of a brittle   circumstance  Unfortunately, I think in certain parts we’re starting to see some cracks show   I want to focus on thinking about banks’ balance sheets and how that addresses some of the   issues that we’ve talked about  For commercial and industrial lending, as many people said, there   still seems to be reasonable robustness in the investment-grade corporate sector  Those guys   haven’t yet seen a lot of pressures in terms of increased cost of funding—not a reduced cost of   funding but also not an increased cost of funding—just a slight increase in terms; but it’s no   problem for them to deal with those kinds of terms  They have the markets open to them both for   long-term debt issuance and for intermediate-term debt issuance  They have bank funding that is   available  Most of the banks, the large banks as well as smaller banks, are suggesting that, although   they may be tightening standards somewhat, there is still a reasonable amount of credit demand and   that most boards and executives are saying “continue to make those loans”  Firms’ balance sheets   are still quite strong  Firms have built up a lot of cash or liquid assets on their balance sheets over   the past few years of profitability, so that part hasn’t seen that much of a challenge  Some of the   December 11, 2007 78 of 138    increases that we’ve seen and measured on the books of banks in terms of their C&I portfolios are   the taking on board of some leveraged loans on which they had made commitments a number of   months ago; those commitments are now being drawn down, and so they’re increasing their   portfolios  So some of the increase in C&I lending is really just commitments that have come in   earlier  The leveraged-lending market, which had opened up for syndication, has quite affirmatively   closed once again  That’s clearly a negative development   With respect to SIVs, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, it seems that many of the   banks are going it alone without waiting for the M-LEC  Virtually all major banks have announced   programs for bringing asset-backed commercial paper or SIVs onto their balance sheets  So this is   still orderly, but it’s beginning to show some stress on the balance sheets with the leveraged lending   and all of the SIVs coming on board, and this underscores the importance that a number of people   mentioned about capital-raising efforts and ensuring that capital will be available, not just above the   regulatory minimums but enough to make the market certifiers, the rating agencies, and others   continue to feel comfortable   A number of people have also mentioned that the flattening, and in some cases the   downturn, in commercial real estate and the tightening of terms are of particular concern at the   midsized and smaller banks  As you know, we had issued some guidelines a little more than a year   ago on commercial real estate concentration and concerns about that because we had looked back to   what happened during the savings and loan crisis and saw that we were starting to get banks into the   same levels of concentration that we had seen back then that were associated with troubles    Although we had a lot of negative pushback at that time, I think that was not an unreasonable thing   to do, but there are still a lot of challenges at those institutions   December 11, 2007 79 of 138    Consumer lending is probably the area in which I’ve seen the greatest change, and it has   raised my concerns the most  I’ll hold off on mortgages for a moment  First, I talked with a very   large provider of credit cards and other consumer products, HELOCs, mortgages, et cetera, who   said that, since the report that I received just before the last FOMC meeting, when things were   reasonably stable, they had seen significant deterioration  As some people have said, even though it   has gone up sharply, the numbers are still reasonable, but it’s the delta that concerns me, the very   sharp deterioration that they’re seeing  They’re seeing this nationwide  The sharpest deterioration   is, as a number of people have said, in the areas that have seen the greatest housing-price stress—  California, Nevada, and Florida—but it’s not limited to those  I won’t go through all the details of   what they told me on delinquency rates on different types of products, but nationwide they are   seeing doubling, tripling, or quadrupling in those areas, and this is over a period of just six to eight   weeks  So that’s really quite significant and concerns me in combination with some of the lower   numbers that we’re seeing with respect to consumption   Also, one of the phrases that they use is that they’re now seeing “contagion in their book”    So it’s not just in one particular area but through a series of consumer products, and it’s not just for   subprime borrowers  They noted that one-third of the charge-offs had a credit score of over 700 at   the origination of the mortgage  So it’s far beyond just the subprime area  Obviously, as a number   of people have said, the mortgage markets have really not reopened  There had been some hope   around the last meeting that the jumbo market would reopen  We’re seeing no evidence of that    The subprime market is not really open  The ABX indexes and other indexes are suggesting that   markets are anticipating extremely high loss rates, even beyond what Bill was suggesting with the   15 percent loss  Now, I don’t know whether those are reflecting just loss rates or whether other   issues with respect to a lack of liquidity in the markets, or hedging that is going on, but still it’s a   December 11, 2007 80 of 138    concern  As I mentioned last time, the Case-Shiller S&P index, although extremely thinly traded   when you go out a year or two, is still suggesting potentially a 20 percent decline on average in the   ten cities that they look at  So nothing has improved there, and given the tightness in the markets,   given that we know that there will be more resets coming, given the continuing pressures, there’s   probably going to be a lot more downside potential for housing prices, and that, of course, could   again feed into lower consumer spending  So that’s the concern on the real side   The concern on the financial side is that, obviously, all these things put a lot of pressure on   bank balance sheets  Gathering capital is very important, but basically what we’re seeing is a very,   very slow revival of the markets, and I agree with many of the others who have said that it’s going   to take a while  A lot more information, model building, and hiring of people who can analyze   these things will be needed  Something that was disheartening to me is that the Mortgage Bankers   Association said that they hope by early next year to be able to provide sufficient information to the   market so that people can really assess on a loan-by-loan basis what’s in their CDOs, and that’s a   real concern  The information is simply not out there  So it’s not just confidence or concerns    People are now looking carefully and saying, “I just don’t have the information to be able to make   an assessment”  That’s, of course, on top of the macroeconomic risk and uncertainty about housing   prices in general  So I do think it’s going to take a while for these markets to revive  As the Vice   Chairman—actually both Vice Chairmen—and others mentioned, if you look into the forward   markets for the OIS spread and other things, this is going to persist  This is not just an end-of-the-  year problem   People are looking to the banks for re-intermediation and for taking a lot of things on the   balance sheets  That’s going to continue to put a lot of pressure on the capital that they have, and I   think there will be continuing uncertainty for both US institutions and international institutions that   December 11, 2007 81 of 138    things have to keep coming on their books and they won’t be able to get other things off their books    So that is a real challenge going forward   Just a moment on inflation  I certainly am heartened, as many other people have said, that   as expectations about our policy moves have changed, we haven’t seen a significant uptick in   inflation expectations, although by some survey measures we have seen some upticks  But real   inflationary pressures are out there, and each incremental step we take with respect to policy easing   potentially has higher and higher costs with respect to inflation  There are no free lunches here, but   we do have to be mindful of the downside risk, particularly with respect to the banking and the   financial system  Thank you     I believe David and his fellows can provide you with some pills   [Laughter]     Thank you very much  I think we have two fronts on which we have   to work—both the macro risks, in particular the housing risks and the liquidity issues, and their   interaction, as a lot of people have discussed  So I favor a 25 basis point reduction with the other   actions that we will be taking with respect to liquidity—the TAF and the swap  I think it is very   important, at least in my thinking, to see them as a package, to try to work on both margins,   because many people have raised concerns about the liquidity issues perhaps spilling over into   being real economy issues—so liquidity issues turning into capital issues that can turn into credit   constriction issues  With respect to the macro risks, most people around the table have said that   those are real and that we need to work on those  Then, of course, there is an interaction between   the two  Part of the reason for the difficulty of reviving the price discovery process is   uncertainty about what is going to happen in some markets, particularly housing markets  So   providing a little more insurance there is valuable  But there is also a concern that, even   independent of that, there could be liquidity problems that cause difficulties, so working on these   two fronts is certainly very valuable  We will, then, have cut the federal funds rate 100 basis   points and will have taken some steps, both with the reduction of the difference between the fed   funds rate and the discount rate and these new actions, to try to provide more liquidity     December 11, 2007 114 of 138    With respect to the statement, I think the statement as it is in alternative B is probably the   most effective  It is important for us to express the uncertainty with respect to the balance of   risks rather than try to describe the balance of risks  I don’t really see what would be added by   talking about particular downside risks when we can simply say that there is uncertainty  I agree   with Governor Warsh that the markets would interpret this as that there may be more to come   and that we will mindful and watching what is going on  Particularly in the context of the new   liquidity actions that we will be taking, it is better to say that we are uncertain than to say that we   are uncertain with downside risks and then take these other actions  It is more appropriate for us   to convey that the combination of actions leaves us uncertain because that, rather than   uncertainty with downside risks, may help unlock some of these markets  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you very much  I, too, as everyone around the table has said,   think that there is significant heightening of the downside risks over the last few weeks  As I   mentioned at the last FOMC meeting, in talking with a contact at a large credit card company, I   saw a very sharp deterioration in consumer behavior  I subsequently spoke with another credit   card company that focuses more on the higher-end consumers and found exactly the same issues   there of slowing payments—even taking into account the seasonals—more delinquencies, et   cetera  So it wasn’t just a middle market phenomenon; it was also happening on the higher end    The quick change between October and December–January, unfortunately, seems to be   consistent—or is potentially consistent—with the regime-shift model that we have been talking   about  Also, the sharp rise in the unemployment rate could be consistent with that  I just   returned from Europe, where concern is growing and there are some especially sharp changes    Spain is seeing some very sharp changes in their housing sector as well as in consumption, and   consumption is going down in the United Kingdom  From discussions there, I also had the   feeling that they are going to be relatively slow to react to the challenges  So I think we will be   January 9, 2008 41 of 60    getting less support than we have been getting from exports  Also, given that a lot of rate resets   are coming, we know that there are going to be more delinquencies and foreclosures  That is   kind of baked into the cake  So we know that there are going to be more challenges in the   financial system, regardless of everything else, over the next nine months  It does make a lot of   sense to think about taking out some insurance against those kinds of risks     I very much agree with the Chairman’s characterization of the challenges that we will   have in the banking and financial system because I think it is not a traditional credit crunch,   when there is a sharp contraction, because so much has been brought onto financial institutions’   balance sheets  Not only has a lot been brought on but also there is a really dramatically reduced   ability to get things off the balance sheets  Basically, over the last five years or so, the reason   that financial institutions could provide so much intermediation and so much support is that   things didn’t stay on the balance sheets  Now, because there is an impaired ability to get things   off the balance sheets, it requires much more capital to support the same amount of funding that   had occurred in the past  Just to try to keep funding at the same old levels is going to require   dramatically more capital  They will get more capital, but they are not going to get dramatically   more, so that will mean that it will be more and more difficult for them to support funding of   operations going forward  So it is very important to think about taking out insurance now   With respect to inflation, as a number of people have mentioned, there are some   disturbing readings recently  But something that is heartening, and for me is really the most   important thing, is that I don’t see much evidence so far of a significant change in expectations,   because that is really where the long-term costs of our policy moves come in  If there is a   temporary slight movement up in inflation, if inflation expectations don’t become unanchored,   then the cost is relatively low, particularly given the very large downside cost of a regime-shift to   January 9, 2008 42 of 60    a recessionary scenario  Although I am certainly supportive of a fairly bold move at this point, I   do think it would be better to wait a few weeks  I think we achieve some of that by clarifying   where we stand through our public discussions  But as a number of people have said, I really   think we have done a very good job, despite a lot of pressure with respect to our reaction   functions, in how we react to data, forecasts, and such  I think we would lose some of that if we   were to move today  That doesn’t mean that we should never move, but I do think it would be a   bit of a loss because people could misinterpret what we’ve been doing and, exactly as Governor   Kohn said, set up a bad dynamic  After our FOMC meeting at the end of this month, however,   we actually have an enormous amount of data that come out because GDP comes out just as   we’re finishing up our meeting  Then the details come out after that  We get another GDP   report  We’re going to get two employment reports  So I certainly, in some sense, want to keep   my powder dry with the possibility of an intermeeting move in the future, but I think that’s a   time when we’re going to be getting a lot more data about which we may want to say it’s the   time to move  It would be better from our broader communications policy standpoint to say that   there have been enough data showing that we really do need to make a move  Thanks     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I think it is very clear that the   numbers have weakened significantly from where we were before  In some sense, the pieces are   January 21, 2008 24 of 32    starting to fall in the puzzle, and we were uncertain before—we are still uncertain—but there is a   lot more evidence of significant downside risks  So things, unfortunately, have been clarified on   that side  We have also gotten some data that are not particularly welcome on inflation, which   suggests that there are still some challenges there, both in headline and in core  At the last   meeting, a lot of us focused a lot on the potential for a regime switch  We haven’t really talked   about that much here, but I think this evidence suggests that there is much higher probability of a   fairly rapid shift from a growth state to a recession state  That is being reflected in the financial   market, so it is just a different way of saying similar things that the Chairman, Governor Kohn,   and others of you have said   I think Bill would also say that the credit default swap spreads on a number of the   financial institutions have been going up, even as some of the liquidity issues have been coming   down  There are very strong concerns about significant losses coming down the line—concerns   not only about the monolines but also, as the Chairman said, about losses just because of the   problems in the consumer sector—increasing delinquencies in a variety of areas, not just in   subprime mortgages  That is going to put a lot of stress on bank balance sheets  Even though   the banks have been nimble in bringing in a lot of capital, they have also had astonishingly large   losses  If they continue to have these losses going forward, they just will not be able to churn out   the funding that is necessary to keep an economy growing certainly at anything that is close to   potential, probably nothing that is close to a positive rate of growth   So it seems that it is sensible to buy some insurance and buy it through taking a bold,   decisive action now  The question, of course, is whether we do that now or whether we do that   in nine days  People have talked about the tradeoff that we have between the value of acting   now and averting the possibility of very negative outcomes over the next nine days and some   January 21, 2008 25 of 32    concern about developing a bad expectations dynamic and problems of people thinking that we   are responding to the equity markets in and of themselves, not what the equity markets are   signaling about the real economy  But I think things are different now than they were earlier in   the month, when I was not very supportive of moving at that time  First, we now have more data   in a variety of areas, and we have the concerns about the monolines  We have a more   substantive basis on which to move, so it doesn’t look as though we are responding to just one   particular thing; the pieces are there together  Second, there is a much clearer foundation from   the Chairman’s testimony and speech, in which he made it very clear that we would be thinking   about and seriously contemplating bold action  So now there is a foundation for this  This is not   just coming out of the blue or coming out of some rumors in the market  I think that is a very   different situation from the one we had before  Third, I think it is actually beneficial that we   have the meeting coming up in nine days  That gives us an opportunity to refine the message   fairly quickly if we feel we need to and to take further actions if we need to  So I come out, on   balance, thinking that the risks are too high not to act now  I acknowledge some of those   downside risks, but I see that there are very strong benefits to acting now   But I do hear some of the concerns that people have raised, and I had some of these   concerns also, particularly with respect to inflation  I might suggest that in the last paragraph in   the proposed FOMC statement, which I am fine with, perhaps a way of showing a little more   concern about some of the inflation issues is in the second half of that sentence, where you say   “but it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully,” to say instead “but it will be   necessary to continue to monitor those inflation developments carefully”  That might buy us a   little there because the statement is a fairly large move away from what we have said before    This phrase is about the only one that we have repeated from before, and I think strengthening   January 21, 2008 26 of 32    that phrase may be beneficial  But I am supportive of the statement as is  Perhaps it could be   improved with a little strengthening there to address some of the concerns, but I am very much   supportive of the overall 75 basis point move now  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Second     This is a bad dynamic       January 29–30, 2008 84 of 249      Thank you very much  Well, if that’s the optimistic scenario, I think we   had all better pray  But I think it’s a relatively balanced scenario that accurately reflects the risks   that are there  The Greenbook has done a very good job of trying to thread the needle, and I think   making a close call for contraction but not actually calling it seems to be very reasonable  The   kinds of insurance discussions in both the Greenbook and the Bluebook and that we’ve had   preliminarily here make a lot of sense  Our models have never been successful at assessing turning   points, and that is true whether they are the typical linear models, nonlinear models, probit models,   Markov switching models, or other things like that  We sort of know once we’ve switched, but it’s   hard to get that transition  As many people have suggested, there are an awful lot of indicators that   would go into those kinds of models that would flash for contraction being likely  I think that is   correct, but that makes it very difficult for us to assess what will happen  So I think—as well   reflected in the projections—a lot of downside risk is there   I do share some of the optimism about improvements that we’ve seen in the financial   markets, but I had that feeling in October and November, and it is hard for me to really understand   exactly what drove the subsequent deterioration  Certainly there were some issues around year-end,   but it seems that more issues than just the year-end were driving the fairly significant reversal of   improvement that occurred during October through mid-November and the fairly sudden backing   up  So I’m concerned that, since I don’t really understand what happened there, I don’t want to take   too much comfort from what has happened so far  But I also don’t want to dismiss what has   happened so far because it’s certainly conceivable that things will move in a more linear way   forward for improvement   One issue that I raised both at the last FOMC and in our various conference calls related to   some discussions I’ve had with the major credit card companies, which in some sense have a very   January 29–30, 2008 90 of 249    good feeling for real-time consumption  I’ve talked with two major credit card companies, and they   both had very negative views of what had happened in the very sharp transition consistent with a   switch into a contractionary state from the discussions before the October FOMC versus before the   December FOMC  But in the most recent discussions, basically it flattened out  It’s certainly not   recovering, but it is not a continuing downward trend, which at least in my view provides a great   deal of comfort because I was very concerned about the nonlinear break to a very low consumption   state, and I think there’s less evidence of that  I won’t go through the specifics of what they said,   but basically we’re still seeing challenges and increases in personal bankruptcies, slower repayment   rates, more people slipping from 30 days overdue to 60 days overdue, et cetera, et cetera  But it’s   not as dramatic a change, and it’s sort of within the range that they have been anticipating given the   data from December  Also as someone mentioned, and I have forgotten who, these numbers are   still at relatively low levels  Now, the change is in a very bad direction and certainly could move   very quickly, and we’ve seen that in other recession scenarios  But fortunately it seems, at least   from this anecdotal evidence, that it isn’t a significant change to the downside, and it’s possible that   it could just be re-flattening out  My concern is still that sort of “slow burn” scenario that I’ve   talked about and that Nellie and others have fleshed out on the pressures on banks’ balance sheets  I   liked Nellie’s very politically correct phrase “unplanned asset expansions”  That’s a very nice way   of putting like “oh, my goodness, something is suddenly on the balance sheet that we didn’t   expect”—SIVs, asset-backed commercial paper, and so forth  I think people are still waiting for the   other shoe to drop, and the other shoe certainly could drop  There may be things that we haven’t   fully anticipated, but we know that there are still leveraged loans that they can’t get off their books,   a pipeline that’s still coming on  We know that many banks are still making mortgage loans and   January 29–30, 2008 91 of 249    cannot get those off their books—at least the jumbo ones  It’s conceivable that raising the limits at   Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae may help in the short run even if there may be costs in the longer run     A number of other things could suddenly come on the balance sheets  The example of what   happened at SocGen is just another uncertainty that could be out there  So even at a major financial   institution that was generally quite well respected, something like this could happen  A lot of finger   pointing and a lot of uncertainty can come from that, and that’s broadly reflected in the CDS   spreads  About the point that Bill Dudley made in conversation with President Rosengren about   being careful to say, well, CDS spreads are lower in Europe and that suggests there’s less risk in   Europe—you have to take into account the reaction function by the governments, by the regulators,   in terms of recapitalization, as Governor Warsh made reference to  There are very real challenges,   but overall we have seen these CDS spreads go up quite a bit  So I think that concern about the   negative dynamic scenario that people talked about is real, and that’s why it is very important to be   thinking about buying insurance   With respect to inflation, certainly some of the numbers have been worrisome  It is clear   that inflation uncertainty is up  We can disagree as to exactly what that means either about   credibility or whether it is just uncertainty or whether it’s upside or downside scenarios, but I think   it is up and that is something we should be concerned about  We should carefully craft our message   to take that into account because uncertainty can lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations, and   that is something that we certainly don’t want to see  I don’t see evidence of unanchoring yet, but I   do see a potential first step in that direction, which does concern me  The simple fact that a memo   had to be written about what was going on with respect to some of these sharp movements suggests   that it’s not clear  Although the memo was excellent, I think there are elements in it that suggest we   don’t fully understand and we need to be very careful about that  Thank you   January 29–30, 2008 92 of 249      Thank you very much  I also support alternative B  I think by any   measure 125 basis points of easing within a month is a lot and perhaps it is a nearly unprecedented   January 29–30, 2008 144 of 249    level of insurance that this Committee has purchased in such a short period of time  But I think it   makes sense to have done it in these circumstances because we have the risk of a substantial   tightening of credit and financial market conditions  There are still lots of shoes that may be left to   drop and, in Nellie Liang’s great phrase yesterday, “unplanned asset expansions can occur”  Just   today we heard that UBS increased by $4 billion the report of their expected losses from what they   reported last month, and that is not their final report  They’re not going to come out with the final   numbers for another month, and so it’s certainly conceivable that more could be there  The SocGen   situation is obviously another thing that is potentially unsettling, and so I think it’s very important to   be buying some insurance, particularly when the slow-burn scenario that I’ve talked about for a long   time is the one that I see as the most likely  There is not going to be just some immediate credit   crunch or some immediate problem of impairment of capital at an institution  But just given the   increase in the cost of raising capital, given the difficulty of getting things off the books, given that   other things have to come on, or given just that the old securitization machines that at a given level   of capital sustained a very high level of activity, which can’t be done now because you can’t get the   things off the books, the machine can’t churn at the same rate that it did even with the same amount   of capital  Then with all these other challenges, we have to be wary of that  So the fragility is still   there  As we talked about before, we had some dramatic improvements in October, through early   November of last year, and suddenly they reversed, and I just don’t feel comfortable that I   understand where those went   That said, however, I think the very recent data that we have gotten provide just a glimmer   of hope  I mean, we’ve had relatively low claims numbers  The ADP number was relatively low    I’m not sure how much information content is in that, but with the claims number it makes a not-  implausible case that there wouldn’t be a dramatic negative number in the employment report and   January 29–30, 2008 145 of 249    potentially it could be on the positive side  I don’t think GDP is quite so miraculous, as we heard   the very humble Dave Stockton tell us that they nailed it  But also look at some of the places in   which there was some weakness now that may come up next quarter  Over the next couple of   quarters probably we’re going to see a payback in government spending, whether it’s through direct   stimulus or through more expenditures on the military  The advance durable goods number, which   no one really mentioned, was on the positive side  I don’t want to put too much weight on that, but   it suggests that there are at least some mixed signals going forward  So I think that means that we   need to leave our options open  We need to worry about those downside risks, but we shouldn’t   dismiss the possibility that the forecast that Dave and the team have put out not only has nailed it for   this quarter but also has not done such a bad job for the quarters going forward     That means we have to think a lot about what we want to say in the statement  How do we   get that balance right?  Clearly, it’s important that we take out the word “appreciable,” and the   markets will see that  The concern that President Fisher raised is a real one  If we continue to talk   about “appreciable risks” after 125 basis points of cutting in a month, I think that would be   unsettling to market participants  But I think the markets are expecting us to take that back    Actually if I could just for a moment get clarification from President Yellen  My understanding was   that what she suggested about the change to the fourth paragraph and the assessment of risk was to   change only the last sentence back to the December 11 statement     Which is different from what President Plosser proposed     Yes, I would agree that I would not want to see that sentence changed    I’m open to the possibility of simply changing the last sentence to go back to December 11  Now,   that clearly would be taken by the market as a signal that we were moving back   Another proposal that has been put on the table is to add something about inflation concerns   or acknowledgement of the inflation situation in the rationale, starting off with something like   “although inflation pressures remain”  I’d probably end up coming down with President Stern on   that—at this point, I’m not sure we gain that much by saying that  That is something we may need   and want to say the next time that we undertake a policy action  I’m not sure it’s necessary to do so   now, although if there were a strong desire to say something like “although inflation pressures   remain,” I would not be opposed to that  But I do think it might be reasonable to at least consider   moving back to the December 11 formulation for the last sentence of paragraph 4, but that’s   certainly a step back  I don’t think that closes off options for us going forward, but I’m certainly   open to those concerns because I don’t want to close those options off   Finally, on the broader issue of communications, particularly with respect to reversals,   something that worries me is that there has been a lot of discussion about Japan  After they would   provide more liquidity or a rate cut, they would say, “Well, we really didn’t want to do that, and   we’re going to take this back as soon as we can”  So they kept providing more and more liquidity,   and it had less and less effect  It was the classic pushing on a string  I think that shows the very   important role of expectations  So at this point, given that I think we want to leave our options   open, I don’t think we want to be emphasizing that  It’s extremely healthy for us to be discussing   that internally, but until we see how things play out, I’m not sure it’s wise to do that because we   could really undermine the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions  That is the last thing we   want to do because that might force us to go down further than we would otherwise like and cause   January 29–30, 2008 147 of 249    more volatility in the markets, more uncertainty with more potential for unanchoring expectations    Thank you, Mr Chairman     A few different points  One, on the conflict of interest issue, with   respect to traditional corporate credits, it seems that credit rating agencies do pretty darn well and   certainly have done very well before this  So it’s clear that it’s not just fundamental to the model   that it can’t work  I think it’s clear enough to remind people of that and that people trusted those   ratings throughout all the turbulence during the summertime  But that said, it gets back to some of   the other points that have been raised  What was special about these particular areas that led to a   breakdown?  The question is, Well, why did they have bad models?  If they were able to develop   good models for these other things, in principle they are capable of developing good models, but   they seem to have developed poor models here  Now, that could be succumbing to a conflict of   interest, or it could be something specific in this area   I am reminded that another area in which they are perceived to have done a very poor job   was in sovereign ratings back a couple of decades ago  I don’t know whether it’s worthwhile to   drill down into the characteristics of where this model seems to be successful and doesn’t seem to   be subject to significant conflicts of interest or where it does, whether it relates to particular   information issues  Also, one thought that I had with respect to these structured products—and you   should tell me whether this is true or not—is that most times when a corporation comes to get a   rating they’ve decided to issue a particular security—that is, if GM comes, their CFO has decided to   issue ten-year debt  If you come to a credit rating agency, however, the credit rating agency can   say, “Well, why don’t you issue six securities rather than one?  If we chop it up in these different   ways, I can make more revenues off that, so I have more of an incentive to work with you on this”       Yes, it might just be interesting to drill down and see where the   successes are and where they haven’t been successful and whether it has something to do with the   model     Right, but just thinking about those differences, I think sometimes the   rating agencies may be excessively maligned  They actually do provide something that’s very   useful, and we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water  But also on that, there is a   severe lack of competition among rating agencies, and we’ve tried to address that through some   legislation, which doesn’t seem to have been very successful at addressing that issue  This is getting   back to Governor Mishkin’s point and some other points about why competition doesn’t get us to a   better solution  It seems that part of it is a regulatory structure that strongly discourages   competition  Did you think about addressing that issue?   January 29–30, 2008 179 of 249      For sure, although I think we tried something like that with the   Sarbanes-Oxley issues of independent research—because this in some sense is a parallel to   independent research—and even required funding of that, and that doesn’t really seem to have taken   off  So it seems as though the model, even with its flaws, is the only one that seems to be   sustainable  But drilling down more into where those flaws are, in some sense we’re seeing a   privatization—I’m not quite sure what the right word is—with some of the very sophisticated   investors effectively building their own internal credit rating agencies  That’s what hedge funds do,   and so you’re getting in some sense a loss of the public rating—a kind of free rider problem or   whatever is the right way to characterize it  In some sense there may be a loss because you’re   January 29–30, 2008 180 of 249    getting this to be just purely private, but maybe that’s a gain because those are the only guys who   should be in this game  It certainly makes it difficult to sustain the credit rating agency or industry     Thanks  I, too, support this facility, but I share with Governor Kohn   some of the struggles over it  Are we crossing certain lines?  Are we going a bit further than we   might feel comfortable doing?  Those questions are very serious ones, and the questions that have   been raised about the program are quite valid  But given the conditions in the market and, at least as   far as I’m concerned, the clear connection between solvency issues and liquidity issues and the fact   that the only way we have to get indirectly at the solvency issues is through these liquidity provision   mechanisms, I think that we should go forward with something like this   It is crossing a line in terms of counterparty risk understanding and control  That’s   something that I’m certainly concerned about  We have pretty good relations with the SEC, but it’s   always different to be having good relations with the supervisor as opposed to actually being the   supervisor or having the experience of supervising those institutions  So I think that is an important   issue  There are concerns about the interpretation of what we are doing that could lead to moral   hazard concerns  There are also concerns that this may be just another step along a path that we   haven’t really defined well  That is very important, and I very much agree—actually, I have   forgotten who made these comments earlier—that we really need to think about the full path of   where we’re going because we did the TAF and that seemed to have a good effect initially but it   doesn’t seem to be having quite the same effect as we had hoped   I don’t really understand why some of the risk spreads have blown out again in the last week   or two  That doesn’t mean that we need to study it to death and that we can act only after we   understand the origins of it  But I think we need to have a bigger-picture view to see what is going   to go next and how to respond going forward to people who say, “Well, you’ve tried five different   little things, and none has really worked, or they work as temporary palliatives”  So I think we   really need to understand the origins of this better to better understand how we can respond  We   March 10, 2008 31 of 39    may have to respond very boldly in ways that we haven’t done before, but trying to get that big   picture of that direction could be helpful to the markets  We may not actually have to take some of   those steps if they see that we could go there, but we would understand better what we will be   needing to do down the line   I’m hopeful that this could stop some of the problems, but I fear that it may be like the TAF   initially  We’ll do something that gets us in a good place for a short time, but then some of the bad   dynamic between liquidity and solvency can come back, and we’ll be back at a similar place in the   not-too-distant future  I am supportive of this, but I do think we have to think about the bigger   picture  Thank you     We sure know how to take the punch bowl away from this party    [Laughter]     Thanks  I’ve talked many times before about the slow burn from the   financial markets that is spreading out elsewhere  Unfortunately, I think the fire is a bit hotter than I   had expected in my earlier discussions, and it comes particularly through capital pressures in the   financial institutions  What we’re seeing now is the simultaneity of stress in the housing market and   stress in the financial markets, and they will be cured together  I think they are joined at the hip    Whether we have tools to address those directly is something we continue to discuss, but I think it is   this direct connection that potentially leads to the negative feedback loop that we have discussed   quite a bit  For housing, of course, there are the direct negative wealth effects but also the lingering   uncertainty of what’s going to happen, as many people have mentioned  Part of this comes from   just a change in behavior  People are acting very differently during this housing cycle from in the   past, so it is very difficult to predict the evolution of foreclosures even given a particular   macroeconomic outcome  There’s still the uncertainty of the macroeconomic outcome, but people   are going delinquent much earlier—they are going delinquent on their houses before they go   delinquent on their credit cards—and so it is really a different model of consumer behavior, which   makes valuing the securities particularly problematic  This is, of course, in addition to uncharted   territory in terms of real and nominal price declines  We’ll see exactly how people will respond to   these things  Obviously the markets are closed, and the banks have to keep these on their books,   with higher cost and more difficulty financing  Some of the changes that came in with the stimulus   package to raise the conforming limits for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have done little to bring   March 18, 2008 65 of 127    down the spreads because they have significantly increased the cost of the guarantees given this new   environment  It’s not unreasonable to do that, but the potential benefit from the changes is lower   than we might otherwise have hoped for   This is all having consequences for credit cards  Even though at first it was the mortgages,   now we’re starting to see a significant uptick in delinquencies on credit cards and spending, and a   number of people—President Rosengren, President Yellen, and First Vice President Sapenaro—  have mentioned some of these things  I just want to report a bit from my conversations with some   of the major credit card companies, which have kind of a window into real-time consumer spending    They are seeing a continuing flattening but not a falloff of growth  There’s no collapse but certainly   a continued downtrend, as I’ve been reporting over the past few months—a continuing slowing of   payments and a continuing increase in delinquencies  Their so-called roll rates of people moving   from 30 days behind to 60 days behind to 90 days behind continue to go up  They are still going up,   although not significantly  They are concerned about that, but it is not spiking up  They are mainly   concerned about when the roll rate gets into 90 to 180 days  They’re not getting their money back    Personal bankruptcies are going up  The cure rates are much lower, and the recovery rates are much   lower  So there seems to be a group of people who are getting into extreme financial difficulty  All   the series that I’ve quoted are general averages  The contacts said that in areas of particular housing   stress basically all of the numbers are three times as high  It is significantly more stressful there,   showing a very clear link between stress in the housing market and these other stresses   Have they been responding?  Well, because of very strong pressures that may be coming   directly from us and certainly from Capitol Hill, the credit card companies don’t respond by   changing interest rates  They respond by reducing the amount of credit available, and that’s exactly   what they’ve been doing  So they’ve been cutting credit lines of a lot of people  Also, as I think   March 18, 2008 66 of 127    President Yellen or a number of people mentioned, they’re also cutting back on the HELOCs   because they have been concerned that people are taking money out when no equity is there, and so   they really want to pull back on that  These overall tightening credit conditions are reflecting the   continued stress on the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions more generally; as you see   with the Bear Stearns example, it’s not just the depository institutions but a broader set of   institutions that are creating pressures both on the asset side and on the funding side  We have had a   lot of the SIVs and a lot of the other assets coming on board  Unplanned asset expansions may   continue, particularly if the economy does go down  What now seem to be very good credits in the   leveraged lending market may no longer be good credits  So the anecdotal evidence that you’ve   been mentioning around the table could turn into further unplanned asset expansions if these things   start to go south   Consumer write-offs, obviously, are another thing that is putting on funding pressure  Also   as I think President Evans mentioned, interestingly there have been few actual losses that have   occurred on many of these securities in terms of the inability to make the payments, although the   losses in the value in the markets have been quite spectacular in some cases  Some of this has to do   with the broad evaluation uncertainty  Some of it has to do with liquidity  I think this is where we   have the direct link between liquidity and macro stability because the uncertainties in part are   coming from the macro uncertainty about how housing markets will evolve  Obviously I have said   this before  There are other factors that come in, but that’s a big one   So doing something to provide some insurance against that or to help provide comfort that   these markets can come back is important because there’s a very close link between liquidity issues   that we have been seeing, the unwillingness to finance, and the capital issues that have been coming   from an incompleteness of markets  The markets just aren’t there for people to be trading in  They   March 18, 2008 67 of 127    are valuing things off an index  The index can’t be arbitraged against the underlying markets   because the underlying markets aren’t there  So the index is doing something else  It’s the only   somewhat liquid market that’s providing some hedging  It’s driving that down, and people don’t   want to buy the underlying security because they’ll have to take the mark against this index rather   than the true value  If they have to take the mark against something that they think is going to be   pushed down artificially, they’re not going to buy the security in the first place  These kinds of   continuing stress make me feel a little less optimistic about the bounce-back in ’09 that’s in the   Greenbook, although I don’t think it’s ruled out   Just turning quickly to inflation, we have a bit of a paradox in what has gone on recently as   everyone has said—significantly slowing growth over the past four to five months but no evidence   of slowing in the pressure on commodity, energy, and agriculture prices  That’s despite some   slowing elsewhere in the world and expectations of slower growth  The PPI numbers that came out   today raised some concerns that some of the good parts of the CPI will not be flowing through to   PCE  Also, over the last year or two, when we’ve had the unemployment rate below 5 percent or   4¾ percent, whatever your favorite number is, where there would be pressure on wages, we haven’t   seen much pressure on wages  So I’m not sure that, if the unemployment rate goes significantly   above 5 percent, we’ll see much on the other side that will take pressure off wages to bring things   down  So I do remain concerned there  But I think there’s a final risk that, if commodity, energy,   and agriculture prices do significantly move down, it could have a major effect on some of the   emerging markets and some of our other trading partners  So there’s a bit of a paradox here that, if   there are some potential benefits of the slowdown to reduce these prices, that could actually also   reduce export demand, which—as a number of people pointed out—is very important in the forecast   for keeping this a shallow recession  So I remain concerned on both the growth front and the   March 18, 2008 68 of 127    inflation front, but I do think that macro stability is probably the primary thing that we need to be   thinking about right now  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you  Obviously, as I said before, we are in a very uncertain   situation with respect to inflation  We have slowing economic growth, but we have also had   very elevated prices  We had a very low unemployment rate and a very low rate of wage   inflation, so we have to worry a little about whether we will get the benefits of lower resource   utilization in terms of lower inflation  But when we look back historically at previous   slowdowns, as President Stern mentioned about 1990-91 and as we have discussed about   1998-99, when we didn’t actually have a formal slowdown, the Committee cut rates, and we   didn’t have a burst of inflation  Obviously, after the slowdown in 2001, the main challenge was   concern about inflation getting too low rather than getting too high at that point  If we look over   the past few cycles—and I think markets are aware of those—we see that you can have cuts in   the federal funds rate that don’t lead to inflation getting out of control, both when the economy is   growing strongly and when the economy is quite weak  So although I do think that the situation   is uncertain, I don’t think that the markets would read a cut of 75 basis points today as a lack of   commitment to inflation control  I think there is a lot of historical evidence that suggests that it   is not necessarily inconsistent with that in any way   The slight uptick that we have seen in some but not all of the surveys doesn’t suggest that   our inflation credibility has been lost  I think it is very difficult to read what the markets are   saying because just look at the volatility over the past few days  Are those TIPS spreads really   telling us about dramatic changes in the market’s views of our credibility regarding what we are   going to do in fighting inflation?  I don’t find that credible  There are a lot of other things that   are going on that make it very difficult for us to read something out of that     So I support alternative A  My thinking is actually very much along the lines of   President Stern’s—that we need to take out at least a little insurance going forward  The   March 18, 2008 103 of 127    statement in alternative A does a very good job of talking about some of the concerns about   inflation  With respect to whether or not we include the explanation of why we expect inflation   to come down in coming quarters, one of the things that changed in this version relative to the   earlier ones is that there is no explicit mention of inflation expectations, which I think is right   because there is such uncertainty about how to measure those  That the uncertainty about the   inflation outlook has increased is the thing that we can read from what the markets are telling us    The assessment of risk in paragraph 4, where it mentions not only the policy actions but also the   measures to foster the liquidity, is valuable so that people see that these are complementary tools   and that we understand how they can work together  The mention of price stability at the end   and how that differs from our statement from last time is a good way to signal that  But I really   don’t see evidence yet that we have lost credibility  If we look back historically at when we’ve   done rate-cutting in either financially stressed times or actual economic downturns, at least over   the past twenty-five years, it has not turned into inflationary challenges, and I don’t see any   evidence that the markets think otherwise  So I support alternative A, as is  Thank you     Is “slightly” better than “somewhat”?     What is wrong with “slightly”?      Thank you very much  As I have talked about many times before, I   see what is happening as a continuing slow burn after the fires really heated up for a little while   back in March  Things have cooled off again  But exactly as Governor Kohn said, we now seem   to be comforted at levels that caused us extreme distress last fall and in January  So I think it is   important to put it into that context  There certainly has been improvement, but it is a little early   to declare victory—not that anyone has, but I think we just have to be very mindful of that   Some of the discussion reminds me a little of the discussions that we had at the end of   October, when we thought that things were improving and then they deteriorated in a way that   had us very concerned  But my central tendency scenario has always been not for a financial   cataclysm, although that is certainly a real downside risk, but for a sort of slow burn that is just   going to continue to weigh heavily on consumption  I think it is negative feedback between   housing and finance, but not necessarily a broader cataclysm  I very much agree with President   Evans that the chance of a significant nonlinear break to the downside is not gone but lower than   it has been  But the tightening credit conditions are going to make it very difficult for the   markets to repair and recover as rapidly as perhaps they do in the Greenbook   On housing, we know there are direct and indirect effects  We have all the signs that the   contraction is continuing  Even after housing starts have fallen more than 60 percent, we are still   seeing them in near free fall  But that hasn’t helped to alleviate the inventories of unsold homes,   which remain at extremely elevated levels—although not moving up dramatically  Part of the   concern is that some of the sales may be due to forced sales related to foreclosures because we   know that foreclosures are up quite a bit  So we have to be a bit cautious there  Almost all the   measures suggest that expectations of future housing prices are lower, which is causing people to   be very cautious about buying  The anecdotal evidence that I have is that walk-throughs are fine   April 29–30, 2008 81 of 266    but that actually closing the deal is much more difficult, both because of difficulty in finding   credit and because people are unwilling to make a commitment now  They think that prices may   be 10 percent lower in 6, 9, or 12 months  For many people, this is the largest investment that   they will make, and trying to explain to a loved one that they just lost 10 percent of their nest egg   is not an easy thing to do  So people are being more cautious  We also see some of this in the   ABX measures that Bill put forward  Those numbers have come off their extreme lows, but they   are still much lower than they were before  It is hard to believe that the actual default and   delinquency performance will be as bad as those measures are suggesting, but they are still   suggesting that things are going to be pretty tough, and so we still need to be very wary there   We are still seeing a difference in consumer behavior—people being willing to walk   away from their houses before they walk away from their credit cards or from their cars  That is   suggesting that people are just operating somewhat differently from the way they did before    The jumbo spreads are still extremely wide, as the charts showed  We may be getting some   offset from the new FHA programs and from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, but I am still not   optimistic that much of this can come in before the end of the year  That suggests that we have   tightness on that part  We also have tightness in the credit card market, exactly as Governor   Warsh said  The credit card companies I have spoken to see continuing deterioration  We didn’t   see any sort of nonlinear changes but just a continuing downward trend of real challenges and   increasing roll rates of people going 30, 60, 90, and more days delinquent  Spending is up a bit,   but they usually say that’s mostly because of increases for gasoline and groceries due to the high   commodity prices  Also, as President Yellen mentioned, there is more tightening in the HELOC   market  More challenges are there, so the banks are pulling back, and more people are getting   into trouble   April 29–30, 2008 82 of 266    I have an anecdote from one of the large companies  A number of large investment-grade   firms have drawn down significant parts of their revolvers, not because they actually needed   them but because they thought that they better do it now before they are pulled back  Even these   large institutions seem to be hoarding liquidity, much as the banks are doing  I think the banks   are doing that because we still see CDS spreads that are very high even though they are lower   than their peaks  The LIBOR–OIS spread that a number of people have mentioned still is high   and is continuing to increase  That is the most troubling for me—that we are moving back to the   extreme highs we saw when we had the end-of-the-year problem  But then we had an   explanation for its going away  Now we don’t have an end-of-the-year problem, so   unfortunately, it is difficult for me to understand what is going to make this go away  I think we   can provide more liquidity through some of our various facilities, but I am not sure that that, in   and of itself, will be the cure     We have seen more capital come in and help out some of the institutions  But a lot of   fragility is still there, as President Pianalto well knows  The issues with respect to National City   were liquidity issues, not necessarily short-term concerns about solvency, although I think there   are longer-term concerns about solvency  Liquidity and solvency issues are ultimately related,   but there is a real concern that many of the money market mutual funds that hold between   $3 trillion and $4 trillion will just walk away  We saw this with Bear Stearns  We can see this   with other institutions  I think that it’s fragility that accounts for some of these very high levels    We used to worry primarily about deposit runs, but deposit runs are extremely slow  Deposit   runs are leisurely strolls compared with what could happen in these liquidity markets  So I do   think that issues are there precisely because still more challenges are coming with commercial   real estate construction, as a number of other people have mentioned  There will still be a lot of   April 29–30, 2008 83 of 266    provisioning that will have to come up, putting more pressure on the balance sheets and making   it more difficult for people to borrow  I also very much agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that   the rest of the world is a little behind us and that the boost that we are getting right now from   exports isn’t going to persist   Turning to inflation, as I think a number of people have mentioned, we haven’t seen a lot   of pressure on the labor side  As labor markets soften, it is unlikely that we are going to see   more pressure there  So that seems to be a positive  But we do see these very elevated   commodity price levels, which don’t seem to have fed through to core  But exactly as Governor   Kohn said, it is a bit of a puzzle how they continue to increase, and that certainly puts some risks   ahead of us  It is a particularly difficult time to get a good reading on inflation expectations   because there have been lots of changes in liquidity issues and in other particular factors  Some   of the survey-based measures are up, but they tend to be very closely related to gasoline prices,   and we know that those are at extremely high levels  So I think it is extremely difficult for us   now to make a solid determination about where inflation expectations are  Certainly that raises a   caution because we don’t want to have inflation expectations become unmoored  But I think it is   more difficult for us to identify right now exactly how they are evolving, and obviously, this will   be important for us in our decisions tomorrow  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many speakers before me have said, this   is a pretty close call, and reasonable cases can be made for both alternative B and alternative C  If   you look at financial market conditions, you can see your favorite indicator and say whether things   have eased or not eased  One indicator that I look at when thinking about the transmission of   monetary policy is the LIBOR–OIS spread, which has gone up very significantly  A lot of short-  term borrowing is priced off of that  If we wanted just to keep policy where it was six weeks ago,   we would actually have to cut more—not that I’m suggesting that we should  But if you use that   spread as the relevant indicator, it would suggest that, if one were to keep the same stance, or   potentially the same stance, of monetary policy, you’d have to cut a lot  It doesn’t seem as though   our liquidity facilities have been effective on this particular dimension  We had been hopeful that   they would be, but they don’t seem to be  Even with some of the things that we voted on yesterday,   we’re still going to see very elevated spreads in some of these markets, still making borrowing costs   relatively high and so disrupting the traditional monetary transmission mechanism  So that’s where   I would argue for alternative B   Another argument for alternative B is the potentially protracted slowdown  I agree very   much with President Stern  As I’ve talked about a lot before, this sort of slow burn is related to the   housing market  The repair and recovery of those markets is going to take a long time  The spreads   are still quite elevated in a number of these markets  So providing more cushion against the   downside risk there for those markets and then thinking about how that risk affects the potential for   April 29–30, 2008 128 of 266    broader downside risks, in which the housing market seems to be a potential trigger point for   negative nonlinear dynamics, again suggests that moving down 25 basis points now is prudent   The key, of course, that people have been talking about is inflation pressures going   forward—inflation expectations  Here a case can be made on either side with some cogency  One   challenge we have right now is that we have a lot of differences in the way to read inflation   expectations  Looking at the five-year-ahead versus the five-to-ten-year-ahead, we’ve seen them   spread apart quite a bit and now start to come back together, with the next five years starting to   move up but the five-to-ten-year-ahead moving down  We have a number of other measures of   expectations, some of which have moved up quite significantly but maybe primarily because of   some relative price movements rather than underlying inflation trends   One thing that is comforting for me on the alternative B side is that during the last year to 18   months, when we have had very low—below 5 percent—unemployment rates, we have seen very   little evidence of high wage pressure  I find it unlikely that it is going to increase as the   unemployment rate goes above 5 percent, and I think, as many people around the table do, that   unemployment may sustain itself above 5 percent for quite some time  We also haven’t seen some   of the real shocks to energy and commodity prices feed through to core  Now, that still could be   coming  But we’ve seen very elevated prices in these areas for quite some time—six to nine   months—and the most recent readings from the PCE index suggest that they haven’t fed through    Maybe that is still to come, and I think to be worried about that is reasonable  It is also reasonable   to be worried about implications for the dollar if we were to go for alternative B rather than   alternative C     But the language in alternative B can provide some comfort to the markets that we are   unlikely to be pushing much further, given what we see and what we expect, but that we are open to   April 29–30, 2008 129 of 266    that possibility  We certainly have a very long time between this meeting and the next meeting    We’re going to be getting two employment reports, GDP, and a lot of other information, so we may   need to revisit some of these issues  But at this point I would come down for alternative B with the   language that we have  I think it gives us the appropriate flexibility, and I don’t see sufficient   evidence of an unhinging of inflation expectations or actual inflationary pressures, at least with   respect to core, to say that we need to take a pause now  Thank you, Mr Chairman     But he has never seen a canary  [Laughter]     Yes  In a lot of the discussion you just take as given the stigma   associated with the primary credit facility, and you were just discussing that related to the   publication of information about the facility  Is that something that could also be on the table?  That   seems to be potentially an instrument for which we might have to consider how much information   to provide or about making it less or more attractive, which then would affect which options are   more or less attractive  Is there some reason not to do that?   April 29–30, 2008 172 of 266      For sure, but just thinking about whether there are other things that we   could do related to stigma might be worthwhile in this context     Thanks  Great work, great presentation  It is impressive to get   through fifty-two pages in less than fifty-two minutes, and so I applaud you on that  Basically I   agree with a lot of the stuff that has been said before  The trick may be thinking a bit creatively   about stigma issues, if there is any way to deal with those  I am not quite sure what you are   suggesting putting out in a white paper for comment—options 2, 5, and possibly 4?  Or were you   thinking of putting all five out?     Doing three of them seems perfectly reasonable  Thank you     Thanks a lot  Well, as I’ve mentioned many times before, I have   thought about this as sort of a long, slow burn scenario; and as we well know, the embers are still   smoldering  It seems to be less of a risk that they could re-ignite, causing a major conflagration; but   there is still some chance of re-ignition, and I think there’s still a fair amount of heat  Consistent   with that, my central tendency view is probably closer to the Greenbook’s “delayed credit recovery”   alternative scenario than to the main Greenbook forecast  In looking at the alternative scenario,   there’s not much of a real effect on growth, but that response is due to a lower fed funds path    June 24–25, 2008 82 of 253    Given the discussions that we’ve had, I think it may be very difficult to pursue something like that   in this environment, particularly given higher uncertainty about inflation and inflation expectations,    even if, as a number of people have mentioned, inflation expectations haven’t moved up that much   or you pick your favorite measure and some have moved up more than others  Given that it’s likely   that we had some transitory factors keeping core and headline inflation down a little lower than they   otherwise might have been and they probably are going to go up, I think that dealing with the   “delayed credit recovery” alternative scenario in the way that’s discussed in the Greenbook makes   our policy choices particularly difficult   So let me focus briefly on why I think the delayed credit recovery or slow burn scenario is a   reasonable central tendency one  I think it relates largely to our continuing challenges on banks’   balance sheets, liquidity, and capital  Banks are facing very high short-term financing costs  Those   LIBOR–OIS spreads are still at extremely elevated levels compared with what they’re used to in   funding themselves, and this is true whether they are commercial banks or investment banks  The   forwards suggest that this ain’t going away anytime soon  So one thing that this does is simply to   cut into profitability and the ability to earn your way out of the challenges  An easy way to do it—  of just allowing the machine to go forward—is going to produce less than it otherwise would  A lot   of institutions rely on the Federal Home Loan Banks, but those are largely tapped out as another   source of financing  We know that the monoline issue has sort of come back, and the challenges   there are great  It is undoubtedly going to be leading to a lot more write-downs over the next couple   of quarters  On the other hand, as President Lockhart, Governor Warsh, and some others have   mentioned, there have been a few areas that seem to have opened up  The leveraged-loan market   seems to have opened up a bit  People seem to be getting those leveraged loans off their books—  and not even at effectively subsidized financing rates  They were proud of getting these off their   June 24–25, 2008 83 of 253    books before, but they were doing it by basically just making another loan, which effectively   doesn’t get them off the books  Now it seems as though they are legitimately able to move this, and   obviously that book is not growing  That book is shrinking   Of course, one of the biggest challenges is in housing, and I see the shocks of some of the   resets from the nontraditional mortgages continuing through ’09  We’re seeing very significant   increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, not only in the subprime space but also in the adjustable   rate space generally—that’s both subprime and prime, although the levels for prime are dramatically   lower  The increases are quite significant for prime ARMs, and that starts to raise some challenges   for the institutions that didn’t do subprime but may still have a reasonable amount of prime ARMs   on their books  HELOCs have been mentioned and the inability to securitize anything that’s   nonconforming  We’ve seen very little benefit yet from the changes that allow Freddie Mac and   Fannie Mae to raise those limits  Also, as many of you know, from my visits around the country to   your Districts, I see that conditions in different areas are dramatically different, but in general a lot   of markets remain in very difficult circumstances  One of the largest mortgage lenders in the   country said that, over the last couple of months, their average FICO score on what they’ve been   originating outside the conforming market has been 800  That’s astonishingly high—so that gets   back to President Yellen’s comment about even with FICO scores in the stratosphere—and they   claim that’s an average FICO score, and they have been pulling back on the HELOCs et cetera   On rising delinquency rates for credit cards, I didn’t hear quite as bleak a view as Governor   Warsh described  I wouldn’t want to say a positive view  They seemed to say that it is where they   would have expected it to be in this part of a cycle with increasing delinquencies  One thing that   they were seeing was a little increase in payments, and so that may be one of the consequences of   the stimulus check coming—that people are using it to pay down some of their credit card debt  But   June 24–25, 2008 84 of 253    a big challenge that they have been seeing is the so-called roll rates—that once someone begins to   go delinquent, they tend to roll right to full loss rather than getting some recovery  It suggests that,   when people get into trouble, they are in fairly deep trouble  All of this means that the demand for   capital is going to be very high going forward at these institutions as provisioning has to go up  You   know, we’ve tapped sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, and a lot of others  As   Governor Warsh said, tapping other sources, encouraging perhaps private equity to come in, is   something that’s important  But how long are these guys willing to invest when over the past nine   months every single investment has seen a reduction rather than an increase in value?  I’m   borrowing a prop from President Fisher—we have been going around and saying, “Raise capital    You’re worth it”  [Laughter]  I hope the investment banks are going around to their shareholders   and saying that also  So far there’s not a lot of evidence that they have been  I think in the long run   they will, but we have to worry about that    This slow burn scenario is even more problematic in the context of what Vice Chairman   Geithner mentioned about some slowing of foreign demand that I think may be coming and in the   context of a fair amount of increases in interest rates that may be coming in a lot of these countries    You’re going to be seeing some credit tightening globally, as I think a number of people have   mentioned  It is more likely, unless there’s a major shock, to be more on the tightening side going   forward  This makes it more difficult to deal with some of the issues in the “higher inflation   expectations” alternative scenario that was in the Greenbook because, when you have this financial   fragility, it’s harder perhaps to raise interest rates as quickly or as much as you would like because   of the concerns about what might happen in the financial markets   On inflation, I think much like President Stern and a number of others—it depends on which   particular series you look at  It is hard to say that things have really become unmoored, but I think   June 24–25, 2008 85 of 253    there’s a lot more uncertainty in the minds of both the public and the market participants about   where inflation may go  That’s particularly problematic when you have the likely increase in the   actual numbers coming that the Greenbook is forecasting for the next quarter or so; and in that   context, dealing with some of the challenges is more difficult  But we’ll talk about that more   tomorrow   On the projections, I think it is important that we continue to increase transparency over   time  We structured what we did last time to make it part of a process, and I think it makes sense to   periodically revisit whether we want to continue on that road  I very much prefer a gradualist   approach, in principle, to add year 5 or so—as the Chairman said—but I think there’s a bit of a   problem in doing that because too much meaning may be attributed to it  It may be too difficult to   avoid saying, “Well, we’re just doing a target”  If we add year 4 and year 5, even though there’s not   a lot of information content in year 4, I think it helps to reduce the kind of shock value of seeing that   fifth year out there  Now, that’s potentially a negative because, in some sense, we want to provide   more information that way  But given the fragile conditions, as Vice Chairman Geithner   mentioned, I don’t think that we want to generate a debate on inflation targets, employment targets,   and other things like that particularly right now  So maybe having a gradualist approach, by which   we just extend things to year 4 and year 5, which is seen as a natural outgrowth, wouldn’t be as   much of a shock  Not that I think it would be shocking, but I think it might raise as many concerns   and as much of a debate and distract us from the key issues that we have before us  Thank you     It’s directly on this point  It seems that in the situation we’re in, with   very elevated spreads in LIBOR, there are almost no contracts in the real markets that are related   directly to fed funds  It’s usually through three-month LIBOR, and we know that the spread is now   roughly 70 or 75 basis points higher than it used to be  It used to be about 10 basis points, and now   it’s around 80  For me that’s one rough proxy in how I think about this—that the way in which our   actions are being translated into market prices is somewhat different from the way it was when the   spreads were lower     Thank you very much  Obviously, as we have all discussed, we are   facing enormous challenges from the continuing strength in prices and price changes in energy   and raw materials  Now, some of those are relative price changes that we don’t have the tools to   address directly  Recently, we have seen wheat come down as Australia has been able to replant,   and it seems that things are going to come back  Corn has gone up, as we heard from a number   of people around the table, because of the challenges there  We don’t have the tools to address   that directly, but obviously, when so many of these commodity prices and energy prices are   going up, that leads to concerns about where both headline inflation and core inflation are going    So we definitely do have to be very mindful of that   I think the type of approach that we are taking in alternative B is a reasonable one  Given   the challenges that we are facing right now with the fragility in the financial markets—the   continuing smoldering of those embers, with still chances that they could reignite and cause us a   great deal of difficulty—it seems sensible to me to be roughly where we are now in terms of   policy but to be signaling that we understand that challenges are coming from various sources   that could lead to inflation pressures and that we need to be ready to offset those   June 24–25, 2008 127 of 253    In terms of how accommodative monetary policy is, I think actually it would be   worthwhile—and maybe at the end of this I might pose a question to Brian—to look at LIBOR–  OIS spreads and how much they typically go up during recessionary periods  I know that other   risk spreads typically go up, but my understanding is that those typically don’t go up as much    Since so many contracts are based off the one-month and three-month LIBOR, that 75 basis   points suggests that at least now we might want to take that into account in thinking about where   monetary policy stands relative to other times when we would have had a funds rate at roughly   this level   In terms of the language, I share Governor Warsh’s view on the use or lack of use of the   word “considerable”  I think President Stern’s suggestion—this is always a very dangerous and   difficult game—would actually push the markets further than they are because I agree that   broadly the path that they are seeing in the future is a reasonable one for them to see  This   language would roughly keep it there  Taking out the acknowledgement of downside risks to   growth remaining would make me concerned because (1) I certainly see those as still being there   and (2) I think that would push the markets further to think that this is a signal that next time we   are going to do it, and I don’t think we are quite there yet  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you very much  I agree with a lot of what Governor Warsh   said and a lot of what has been said before  Let me just take a slightly different tack answering   the question that Governor Kohn raised  Why are we here?  Part of that is, because of the Glass-  Steagall Act, we have this unusual structure in the United States  Other central banks can   provide credit much more easily to a wide variety of institutions  We have a legacy that created   this separation, which isn’t as strong in most other countries  In continental Europe, for   example, you just don’t really see this  Then, we have built a regulatory regime that helped to   promote that  Remember, the discussions have been about markets and the challenges in the   markets  Well, I think our regulatory regime, not just in the United States but throughout the   world, helped promote the disintermediation to promote greater reliance on the markets  In   certain ways this is a very good thing, but it creates exactly the kinds of problems and challenges   that we are facing now   I think we need to be mindful of that and take that into account when we are thinking   about what to do next in dealing with these issues  Thinking about market resiliency and market   infrastructure is crucial, but we also have to be mindful that, if we try to get things to migrate to   the exchanges, to clearinghouses, et cetera, it is great for us as regulators, and it is also useful   because the information is much more centralized  But it also could create market dynamics, as   June 24–25, 2008 187 of 253    President Evans said, that could lead to trying to get around that  Then the risky stuff goes OTC    The risky stuff is in new institutions that we haven’t thought of yet  President Yellen mentioned   some other institutions  We can mention hedge funds and money market mutual funds, but in   five years there may be institutions that we haven’t even thought about  No matter what   structure we set up, there would be ways to try to get around it  So we need to think about a   regulatory regime that gets the costs and benefits right to make the different relevant institutions   not bridle too much at being part of it and so to rethink the financial holding company structure    If the investment banks had found the financial holding company structure an amenable one,   then we wouldn’t be here either because we would have solved the Glass-Steagall legacy   problem  But we haven’t quite done that   So actually exactly as Governor Warsh was saying—and believe it or not, we didn’t   coordinate beforehand—I think that we should think about how to revise our general regulatory   structure to get more institutions under this umbrella, not have them find it scary, upsetting, or   disturbing but to see that we are doing it in a reasonable cost–benefit way  I can see just in all   the issues that we have been facing regarding some capital relief in particular circumstances—  so-called 2380 relief on particular types of transactions, issues of what’s included in the   definition of a leverage ratio  I think it gives us an opportunity to rethink why so many   institutions find it onerous and are so lacking in desire to be part of this regime  Obviously, there   is some regulatory competition—President Rosengren, I think, brought that up—so we need to   think of that as a whole  This is part of the homework assignment that the Congress needs to   think about—setting up a reasonable FDICIA-like regime for a broader set of institutions that   would choose to come and be regulated by the Fed   June 24–25, 2008 188 of 253    We have been talking about where the bright lines are  But if we okay someone to be a   financial holding company, then they become part of our regime in the existing structure  So the   lines aren’t completely carefully drawn  It really is sort of a cost–benefit analysis if someone   chooses to apply  So we need to think about that carefully and about the costs and benefits of   getting people in because the long-term dynamics will be that people always try to get away from   regulation unless they see that there is some sufficient benefit  Being very mindful of that, both   from the institution context and the broader context of the markets, is very important  Thank   you     Oh, and I apologize—I fully support going ahead with extending the   facility past the year-end  I would make sure that it’s a bit more than just immediately past year-  end and go some time into February so there are no questions about year-end     I just want to underscore the points that President Yellen made   because extending the term or even just having the term with the TAF really creates a bit more of   a burden for us to think about not just primary versus secondary credit but effectively three   modes  One is sort of a superprimary credit, where you can borrow at term and now term of 84   days rather than 28 days  This issue came up not only in the San Francisco District but also, as   Sandy Pianalto well knows, in the Cleveland District  Then there are the overnight primary   credit and the secondary credit  We have to think about how we will apply this in a consistent   way throughout the System  Also, although in principle we can pull back exactly as you   described, as Janet argued, that can be very dangerous to do  Also, if we do that, sometimes it   may have to be revealed publicly on a form 8-K  If there is a significant change in an   July 24, 2008 27 of 50    institution’s liquidity situation and if an institution is in a difficult circumstance, the institution   has often made reports publicly about how much liquidity it has  If there is a significant change   in our willingness to provide institutions with credit, they may have to report that, and that could   be a precipitating event, which puts us in a difficult situation   So I think we just need to think very carefully about the criteria that we will use for   eligibility for long-term borrowing versus overnight borrowing and primary versus secondary   borrowing and then not kid ourselves that we may have more options than we think to pull back   because it may be very, very difficult to pull back  Obviously, we also have pressure from the   FDIC and other regulators not to be the precipitating event      Thank you very much  I am supportive of these initiatives; and with   respect to the options, I do think it is very important for us to be thinking about the perceptions of   how we are using our balance sheet  Whether or not the reality is there about how much we can   expand and deal with, there are a lot of questions and concerns  I think a better focus does make   sense  Options were used successfully with respect to Y2K, so there is a precedent for them    They’re not as unusual as some of the other ones, or at least not as new as some of the others  Just   being careful about the way we will articulate how we are using our balance sheet and trying to   respond practically to questions about the balance sheet stresses make sense   On the extension of the TAF, we have had some very important and valuable discussions  I   had ongoing discussions with President Yellen and certainly President Pianalto, both facing very   difficult decisions that highlight some of the issues with the longer-term funding  As I said, one   thing that I think will be necessary for us going forward, particularly in extending the TAF, is to   think about whether this is adding something  I do support the extension, although I agree with   Governor Kohn that it makes sense to think about both the 28-day and the 84-day terms  Private   market participants deal with a lot of complexities—one-month, three-month, and six-month   LIBOR, and I think they may be able to deal with this  I think it may add something to have both   the 28-day and 84-day terms; but there may be operational issues, and I defer to the Desk on that   I think it raises questions about consistency in thinking about how to deal with now really a   third level of comfort that we would need to have in providing credit to institutions  It’s not just   secondary versus primary but also primary overnight versus primary term  To that end, I think the   proposal that President Rosengren mentioned is important—that we really do need to be thinking   about the relationship between these liquidity facilities and our supervisory judgments  To that end   I have already asked Brian Madigan and Roger Cole to canvass the heads of supervision and   July 24, 2008 39 of 50    regulation to get a feeling for, and to get a list of institutions, where at least at this stage there may   be some differences in our view as an umbrella supervisor from the view of the primary regulator as   to the challenges that the institutions are facing  Then either I will or we will have a process by   which we will ask each regulator, institution by institution, why there may be differences in   assessments and try to understand them  We will also put those regulators on notice that we may be   taking a different view and that we, as the lender of last resort, can go in and do our own   assessments  We take into account what they provide us, but we are not in any way obligated to   follow their particular ratings in making our decisions  If we feel that an institution has more   difficulty, we do not have to provide credit to that institution     Similarly, I have talked with some of the presidents about being proactive in thinking about   collateral rather than at the last minute, as was described with respect to IndyMac, having to think   about what the value is of the collateral that is provided  We should be doing that proactively, both   because we need to know that from our lending point of view and because we can provide that   information to the institutions so that they can better manage their liquidity, decide where they wish   to pledge their collateral, and understand how they are going to go forward  Also, the other   regulators will know more in advance what type of lending may be available   I do think that we can manage this and that there is potentially some value to extending the   term of the TAF  But it raises a number of challenges  Working with President Geithner and   President Hoenig on some of these issues, in some sense I have already taken some actions on what   President Rosengren has suggested, and I am very happy to hear any other actions that we may need   to be taking  I think that we need to be taking those independently of the particular issues here  We   can deal with these issues because, of course, it will be up to the individual Reserve Banks to judge   July 24, 2008 40 of 50    whether they want to make the term lending available  If there is concern about that, the Reserve   Bank will ultimately make that judgment if it does not wish to provide that credit  Thank you     But we sent him out of the country  [Laughter]     Thank you very much  We have now had the first anniversary of all   the financial turmoil, and how have the markets celebrated?  Well, we have had Freddie and   Fannie go down and need one of the largest bailouts  We have had IndyMac go down—the   second largest bank failure in US history and perhaps the most costly bank failure in US   history  I am talking just in nominal terms; I haven’t actually done the real adjustments  Also,   we’ve seen a variety of widening risk spreads  At the last meeting I went on with my standard   metaphor of the slow burn and said that things could reignite, and I think we certainly have seen   a few things reignite  I very much agree with Governor Warsh with respect to Freddie Mac and   Fannie Mae that, although legislation has been passed, the devil will be in the implementation   August 5, 2008 84 of 145    details  Simply because the Treasury has the capacity to do something, it is not quite clear what   it will do or be able to do or how the markets will respond to that  Obviously, Freddie and   Fannie have been really the only game in town for mortgage securitization  The jumbo markets   have not been working  The subprime market is not there right now  So until and unless we can   be assured that they will operate properly, they still have a lot of potential for more flames   coming out     There are also a number of other reasons that I am still concerned about financial markets   being very far from normal  One, reference was made to a study that we have done here at the   Board that Nellie Liang is taking the lead on  New York has also done a study; I think they used   very different methods but came out with similar numbers  The studies say that large losses are   still to come and that total losses associated with the challenges that we have been seeing will be   on the order of $900 billion  US and European financial institutions have taken about   $400 billion of write-downs  Not all of those losses will be on financial institutions’ balance   sheets, but there certainly are potentially more losses to come—not only in mortgages, in   leveraged loans, and in commercial real estate but also in the consumer parts of the portfolio and   potentially other parts of the portfolio  A fragility is there, which has to be taken into account   when we look at capital ratios  If you simply look at reported capital ratios, they are off their   peaks of a few years ago  However, if you were to do a more-thorough mark-to-market on a lot   of different pieces of the portfolio or if you did have to liquidate—even assuming it wasn’t a   broad fire sale but just one institution that had to liquidate now and it had no further   consequences for anyone else’s expectations, which I don’t think is accurate—you would see   those capital ratios be in fact much, much thinner than they appear in an accounting sense   August 5, 2008 85 of 145    A number of people talked about the OIS spreads and said that things seem to be at   50 basis points rather than at 10 basis points  Well, that is true not only in the US dollar but   also in the euro and in sterling  If you look to the forward market, that number is increasing  It   is not staying the same  It is going up quite a bit, to about 75 basis points over a year period for   the dollar to 130 to 150 basis points in sterling and in euro  That suggests a lot more challenges   to come  So even if 50 is the new 10, it is still a major challenge going forward  That puts a lot   of pressure on banks to generate earnings to make up for the write-downs and other challenges    In the old days, when you could finance yourself at 10 basis points, the institutions were   undertaking a lot of activities that would allow them to generate a lot of revenue, even if they   kept taking hits in certain parts of their portfolio  But when funding is at 5 times that, or 10   times that, or 15 times that, a lot of activities that once were profitable are not profitable  The   margins are much lower, and their ability to earn their way out of this is much, much more of a   challenge  I think that is going to be even truer for the European institutions  That is actually   one area in which I see it as more likely that an important shoe might drop, not just in the United   States but in a major European institution  European institutions haven’t been as active in raising   capital, and there are more constraints on their ability to raise capital, given the way rights issues   work  I think that greater challenges are going to come in the European economies and that the   ECB faces greater challenges in dealing with the increasing inflation threat that they have there   and worldwide, while being able to provide some policy accommodation     Third, securitization markets have certainly not recovered  We have talked about that    The infrastructure investment that will be needed for these to come back in terms of data,   contract certainty, et cetera is going to take a long, long time  It is not clear exactly how long,   but it is clear that recovery will not be right around the corner  That means continuing pressure   August 5, 2008 86 of 145    on banks’ balance sheets independent of all the other capital issues  If they just want to continue   on, they have to keep a lot of things on their balance sheets  One bright light, just in case you see   nothing positive, is that we were able to put off some very significant changes in accounting—  FAS 140 and FIN 46(R)  They were on a very fast track to make changes that could have   brought literally trillions of dollars of assets back onto balance sheets and would have made it   extremely difficult for securitization markets to work  That has been significantly delayed, and I   think they will take a more balanced and measured approach  Not only has that been put off, but   also the institutions will have more time to deal with it  But this pressure is real  The Senior   Loan Officer Opinion Survey couldn’t be more crystal clear on the challenges that are there and   that are likely to continue to be there  Why is that?  Well, as a number of people have   mentioned, it is because of challenges on the HELOC portfolios and on the option ARM   portfolios and uncertainty about a lot of other pieces of the portfolios  So given my views, I am   really glad that the Greenbook baseline has taken on board much more of what was previously a   “delayed recovery” alternative simulation scenario, much in line with what President Stern   mentioned     But I continue to see that the situation is quite brittle and that small pressures potentially   can lead to large and rapid responses  The “severe financial stress” alternative simulation in the   Greenbook is certainly not my central tendency one, but I think that we can’t dismiss it too easily   because there still could be another—what I have now taken to calling, since I chair the   supervision and regulation committee—flare-up with one of my problem children  Many of you   know the problems in your Districts, but there are a lot of problems, unfortunately, in all the   Districts and around the world  I hope no one will ever hear about the problems that my children   are having, but sometimes they do come out  As Governor Warsh said, one way to try to deal   August 5, 2008 87 of 145    with those is through capital  It is becoming increasingly difficult to do that  In the old days the   accounting rules were such that you could take over an institution through so-called pooling   accounting methods, so you would not face an immediate write-down of everything to current   market values  One challenge we have with the institutions that are likely to be failing over time   is that these accounting standards are no longer available, so it is very, very difficult to use the   kinds of methods that have been used in the past by the FDIC and other regulators to avoid the   IndyMac type of problems  It is quite possible that we will be seeing more people queuing up,   and more people pulling money out of accounts, even though they are insured accounts  There   has certainly not been a generalized drain from the banking system  There has been a recent   shuffling, as President Lacker said  But it also makes a lot of institutions much, much more   vulnerable than they have been in the past   If you look at the “severe financial stress” scenario in the Greenbook, what is interesting   about it is that it is relatively benign  For something that is severe stress, the macroeconomic   outcomes in terms of GDP and unemployment aren’t that severe because of the policy   response—taking the federal funds rate down to ¾ percent  I don’t think we can possibly do that   in the current environment  It is not that I think that inflation expectations have become   unanchored or are not contained, but I do think that our policy responses are contained precisely   because we can’t quite go there  If you look at the “inflationary spiral” scenario, it says that by   2009 the fed funds rate would have to go up to 3½ percent  I don’t think we are in that or   anywhere close to that  But if we had to respond as the Greenbook said to bring the fed funds   rate down below 1 percent, I think we would get close to that, and we would be in a very, very   difficult position    August 5, 2008 88 of 145    We have to be very careful about inflation expectations  I think we have mixed evidence   on inflation expectations and inflation, although I am heartened that things do not seem to have   become unanchored  Some of both the market-based measures and the survey-based measures   have come down a bit, although I think, as Governor Kohn said, that the situation is much more   fragile  I don’t want to take on board too much comfort from the change in commodity prices   because we have seen temporary movements up and we have seen temporary movements down    It is heartening, but I think we have to still be very, very careful on this issue  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you  I support no change, alternative B  As I mentioned before,   I don’t want to put the commodity price decreases and energy price decreases in the bank and say   we don’t have any problems going forward  But we also can’t ignore them, and I think that does   take off a bit of the pressure  It also manifests itself in some of the survey numbers and some of the   market-based numbers in terms of expectations  So I think it allows a little more time, as someone   said earlier, to be patient, to make the determination, given that I still think there are some very real   downside risks, as I’ve mentioned   I think this type of statement will be largely consistent with market expectations, although I   do think, and Brian can correct me, that this is one of the first times that we have made a very clear   statement such as “inflation has been high”  I think that’s a bit of a change from where we have   been  That’s a much stronger acknowledgement of the inflation situation, which I think is   appropriate to be acknowledging  But I do think that it may send a relatively strong signal to the   market, and it makes me feel more comfortable about no change today with the statement because it   shows a lot of concern about the level of inflation in actually characterizing it as high  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Should we have Brian’s presentation?     Thank you very much  Since the last meeting, there have obviously   been a number of flare-ups in the fires that have been burning in the financial markets—the GSEs   and then certainly what’s come this past weekend and what’s likely to come over this week and into   the future  A number of people have mentioned things ranging from AIG to pressures on money   market funds to some large financial institutions  There are some very large regional banks and a   very large thrift that will be facing a lot of challenges as the uncertainties in the markets continue  I   won’t repeat what Governor Kohn said about the continuing pressures on the bank balance sheets  I   think it is important to take into account that those pressures will be there going forward not only on   US institutions but also increasingly on international institutions  No one has mentioned UBS yet,   but that’s another institution about which there’s a lot of concern, and if you look at CDS quotes   there, they are skyrocketing also  Much as Governor Warsh said, I think that people are worried   about what the next shoe to drop will be and whom we have to challenge  Whom do we have to get   more information about to make us feel comfortable?  If that suddenly becomes everyone, then of   course the markets don’t function   I just want to focus quickly on consumption and consumer credit markets and then on   inflation, and then I’ll conclude  We have made some references to how consumers have acted in   the past and whether they will continue to act this way  In some sense the consumer has been on a   marathon since the early 2000s, facing an incredible amount of shocks—a lot of contraction in   2001, significant declines in stock market wealth, September 11, corporate governance scandals,   sustained job losses, and low real income growth  Nonetheless, the consumer continued to   consume  But now the consumer seems to be flagging  We have perhaps a very modest effect of   the stimulus, which obviously can lead to negative payback for the rest of the year—so a drag going   forward as well as drags from housing and stock market wealth, continuing job losses, rising   September 16, 2008 64 of 108    unemployment, and pressures on income  Although many of these shocks were similar to ones that   happened earlier in the decade, it seems that consumers do not have the same resilience now that   they did at one point  It’s not surprising that, after having run this marathon, they’re going to be a   bit tired   Part of it could also be the credit conditions that are putting much more pressure on them    Just to give you an anecdotal report, but it’s from one of the largest providers of consumer credit in   the economy  After stabilization basically through our FOMC meeting in August, we’ve seen some   significant deterioration in delinquencies and in the performance of those who get into   delinquencies—they roll right to full chargeoff much more rapidly  So we have seen not exactly a   qualitative change but a significant deterioration  Also, the ability to securitize credit cards has   changed dramatically  After our having opened the window and the markets having opened up in   the second quarter, they basically haven’t been able to do anything in the third quarter, and that’s   before this weekend  Obviously that’s not going to be helping them   Of course, there are some offsetting factors that can help the consumer  The very significant   decline in mortgage rates has led to quite a response, according to this very large provider of   consumer credit in the United States  The number of applications for mortgages, particularly for   refis, has doubled over the last couple of weeks  So people do respond to prices, and that can help   to ease some of their income burdens  Obviously, the reduction in energy prices and many food   prices is helpful on that   But of course, what has been good news for US consumers may not be good news for   international consumers  As a lot of people have mentioned, the rest of the world is seeing a very   significant slowdown  I think the elevated commodity prices had helped to mask a lot of the   underlying fiscal and structural problems in these economies, actually much like rising housing   September 16, 2008 65 of 108    prices in the United States had masked the problems in underwriting standards and what was going   on in the mortgage market  So I think there are going to be significant challenges in a lot of   countries around the world  The boost that we had earlier this year from the international sector is   something we can’t rely on   On inflation, we’re heartened by some of the lower energy prices  But I want to relate one   anecdote  In a meeting at the OECD, the CEO of one of the largest private oil producers in the   world was asked what reference price he used because obviously he has to make tens of billions of   dollars of decisions on investment and so they thought here’s someone who would really have a   good notion of what the price of oil would be going forward  Without hesitation the person   responded, “$100, plus or minus $50”  [Laughter]  That kind of uncertainty from someone who is   really in the markets and making those kinds of decisions shows us that we have a reasonable   degree of uncertainty in inflation pressures going forward  That said, I think the Greenbook forecast   is where I would be also, although we’re at uncomfortably elevated levels now  There are a lot of   reasons to believe that, although they may be even a bit more elevated in the coming quarter, there   are likely forces to bring things back down  This is particularly credible in the context of both   survey-based and market-based expectations being quite contained, the market-based expectations   being at the low of the year or even over the last couple of years   So this brings me to support alternative B for no change today  On the statement, I do   believe that some greater recognition of the stress would be valuable  I think it would be valuable to   have something in the first sentence of paragraph 2 that focuses on the strains—perhaps just a single   sentence about the strains—and then we can put the other pieces on consumption and housing into   the next sentence  It is important in the final paragraph to leave our options open if we do see   significant negative feedback effects so that we can make a move that wouldn’t be a shock to the   September 16, 2008 66 of 108    markets but it also wouldn’t be something that the markets could bank on  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     But I do think it is the delta, so it is the change  By including   “closely,” I think the markets are going to look very closely at that change, and they are going to   think that we are clearly trying to convey something with that  I just think we have to make sure   that we feel comfortable in doing so  Certainly some people have suggested that they would be   happy to move 50 basis points if they saw the markets moving, but I do think that that one   particular word will get a lot of attention  Not that it should, but I think it is going to be focused   on  Just as at one point we used the word “yet,” and that got an enormous amount of attention    And this has two syllables  [Laughter]     Thank you very much  With the intermeeting move that we had back in   January—10 months ago, which now of course seems like 10 years ago—we spoke a lot about the   possibility of a regime shift—that there’s a growth state and a contraction state and there could be a   nonlinear movement between the two  Unfortunately, over the past few weeks we’ve seen some   evidence of that nonlinear shift, both in the real economy and in financial markets  In particular,   we’re seeing that globally—we are seeing a very, very sharp change internationally in growth   prospects, and that’s being reflected in the financial markets  One reason that we’re seeing some of   October 7, 2008 27 of 30    the problems in the financial markets, as mentioned by a number of participants, is the concern   about insufficient capital  Well, one reason for the concerns about insufficient capital and the   heightening of those concerns is what losses are going to be faced  Obviously the real economy has   to do with how the housing market is going to evolve, which has to do with wealth, which has to do   with unemployment, and I think that’s part of what’s feeding what’s going on  That’s why I think a   significant move now, especially coordinated internationally, could be helpful in trying to reduce   some of that macroeconomic tail risk  We are seeing reasonable evidence that we’re shifting into a   contraction regime, if you will, rather than a growth regime  I think we were fighting hard against   that with our earlier rate cuts and with our liquidity facilities  I think we were able to hold that shift   at bay for a while  But now we have some evidence that we’ve moved into this other regime, and I   think that is partly what is feeding the problems in the financial markets  That’s why it’s extremely   important that we make this move and make it in a coordinated, international way     As others have also mentioned, we’re starting to come close to running out of ammunition    So if we are going to take a shot, we had better make it as powerful as possible  Doing it in an   internationally coordinated way is to make it as powerful as possible  So I very much support the   actions     I, too, favor the facility  I think it’s very important that we are tranching   this and using somewhat different ways of providing the money to these countries than we have   with other countries because, as President Bullard and others mentioned, if we’re not careful, this   could be used for purposes with which we are not comfortable  It could be used for supporting a   currency, and I don’t think we’d be particularly comfortable with that  Obviously, we have to be   realistic  Money is fungible  They have very large reserves  They could be using the reserves for   these other purposes and using the swaps for purposes that we find acceptable  But I think, given   the circumstances, it makes sense to be coming up with something that’s complementary to the IMF   facility and make sure that the IMF facility and our facility together are sufficient to deal with the   pressures in this environment  I would be satisfied to delegate the authority to the subcommittee     Thank you  Well, the autumnal bonfires have really sort of heated up   since the last FOMC meeting  I think we have evidence in the United States and now worldwide of   what emerging market literature calls “sudden stops”—a sudden stopping of the flow of capital, the   so-called flow of hot money, into Latin America or other countries and the devastating impact that   could have when suddenly credit is no longer available  I’ve been talking about the slow burn of the   problems in the credit markets, but I think we saw that move up to a different level globally over the   past six weeks  This is the concern that we had earlier in the year about a regime shift  We seem to   have moved from a growth regime to a sliding-by-with-some-growth regime and now to a   contractionary one and the nonlinear effects that we had been concerned about   As we always say, it’s particularly difficult to predict where the economy is going to go    But there’s evidence of why it’s so difficult because almost any measure of volatility is up   dramatically  That’s true on the financial market side, on the real side, as well as just in movements   of consumer confidence  So I think that we can say with some confidence that it is particularly   October 28–29, 2008 104 of 206    difficult to predict which way things are going to go  As many people have said before, a few   spreads have come down, but given the extent of our actions and those of other governments around   the world—central banks, fiscal authorities, et cetera—it is surprising that there has been so little   effect   Now, maybe it’s just because so much is going on that there’s a fair amount of confusion   and uncertainty about what the programs mean, how they will actually be implemented, and to   whom they will be applied  I think that’s perhaps part of the reason for some of the spreads not   coming down with respect to interbank borrowing—there is a lack of clarity about exactly how the   FDIC program will operate and exactly how the TARP will operate  We’ll hear more about that in   a bit, but I think it’s going to take time for people to feel confident about how that will work  Also,   I think there is real uncertainty because after thirty days some banks may not get the guarantees or   may have the guarantees pulled back  I think there is also a lot of uncertainty about who will get   TARP funding and who is qualified for TARP funding  As information comes out about people not   being qualified or markets being concerned that individual institutions are not going to be qualified,   that could put on a lot of pressure  Unfortunately, that’s going to be coming in addition to the end-  of-the-year pressures  So I see a number of looming risks, particularly in the financial services   sector, as we fully implement and clarify some of the programs that I think on balance can be   helpful but that can actually cause some uncertainty at individual institutions  Others have also   mentioned broader challenges in the emerging markets and the insurance companies and certainly   we have the hedge fund redemptions that are looming  I’m very concerned about trying to get over   the end of the year with so many different pieces putting additional pressure on  Even some of the   pieces that we thought would be helpful potentially have a lot of downside risk to them   October 28–29, 2008 105 of 206    But even if we get through this—and the government guarantee programs, the special   liquidity facilities, and the negative real rates that we have and potentially may make even more   negative would provide some support—the fundamental uncertainty is not going to be resolved until   we see what is going to work in the financial sector, what’s going to be the successful business   model, and what are going to be the new sets of activities that can be undertaken  Will certain   funding markets come back and at what spread once you take away all these special programs?    Until that is worked out, I don’t see how the markets can figure out who will survive and who   won’t, who is going to be there in three months and who isn’t  I think that the programs are very   valuable in providing a time out—a time for people to reassess  But until there’s greater clarity in   those financing markets going forward, I don’t think the markets will actually be able to recover    That why the alternative simulation that puts things off a bit more seems quite sensible to me   Some specifics on consumption  As I often do, I talked with some of the largest providers   of consumer credit in the United States  They are reporting, exactly as Governor Kohn said, that   consumption or spending growth was decelerating through the summer, but it did seem to get much   more rapid in September and October  One of the large companies actually reported significant   contraction on the consumer side of spending  On the small business side, it was still positive but   down from double-digit growth in the second quarter to basically flat  They also looked across   income categories  This is not a phenomenon of just the people at one or the other end of the   spectrum  It seemed to be across the board for what they looked at  All of them have reported, just   as the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey did, a significant reduction of credit lines  So even if   we’re not seeing credit in and of itself having contracted yet, the ability to get credit down the line is   going to be much, much more difficult  Also the funding markets for the credit card companies   October 28–29, 2008 106 of 206    have effectively closed  They may reopen  Things may come back, but I think it’s going to take   time for that to happen, and they were certainly not optimistic about that   As virtually everyone has mentioned, inflationary pressures for a variety of reasons are   much lower, and I think that fits into what the Vice Chairman said about thinking about the costs of   moving now and perhaps moving “too quickly”  There seem to be lower costs now in being a bit   more aggressive than, let’s say, six months ago because much less inflationary pressure seems to be   out there  I think a prudent risk-management point of view would certainly take into account those   costs and benefits  We need to use our monetary policy tools as effectively as we can and then   work with the other tools that a number of others have mentioned to try to get the markets to be   more comfortable with where things will go and then be able to lend to each other—to have the   unlocking of the credit markets without government guarantees, without negative interest rates, and   without extraordinary liquidity facilities  Thank you     Let the transcript reflect that  [Laughter]     Thank you very much  Well, I’ve not been able to convince myself not   to agree with President Evans  As everyone has said, we have this very significant global shift that   has stepped down real activity and financial activity  The inflation environment has changed   dramatically from a number of months ago with the change in commodity prices, the change in the   value of the dollar, and the change in not just US but also global resource utilization  I think we’ve   seen just an enormous change there  Also, when you look at the expected federal funds rate path—  we have to be careful in looking at anything in the markets these days because of liquidity, risk   premiums, or term premiums that we’re not quite sure about—the markets are expecting significant   cuts from us  They are not expecting any immediate or near-term significant increases in inflation,   and I think all of the indications are that it will be going down   In a cost–benefit analysis, the costs seem relatively low in terms of the potential for inflation   of doing this  Now, we have to think about it in terms of benefits, and a number of people have   touched on the transmission mechanism  I do think that there are forces that mute the extent to   which a 50 basis point cut translates into 50 basis points or lower on costs, but I don’t think they   completely offset it  It still has the effect of reducing the cost of liquidity, reducing many people’s   borrowing costs  I think it still does have an effect even if there’s an offsetting risk spread and even   October 28–29, 2008 142 of 206    if there’s an offsetting bank action that affects that  So in terms of costs and benefits, at this time it   seems that the costs are relatively low or muted, and the benefits are positive and potentially high   In particular, as I mentioned before, I’m concerned about the confluence of forces that may   make things very difficult around the end of the year  If you look at a lot of these LIBOR or   forward markets, they’re not coming down either in the United States or around the world  We   have a lot of uncertainties with hedge funds, with the potential for other institutions getting into   trouble, and with just the implementation of our policies—in particular, as I mentioned, the way the   FDIC guarantee program and the TARP program work may end up singling out institutions and   bringing them down more quickly than otherwise  So I think it makes sense in terms of cost–benefit   analysis, even more so given the tail risk around the end of the year, to act now  We have another   opportunity to act in December and obviously an opportunity to act at any point if we do see a   dramatic change  We are getting near as much as we can do, but I don’t see the costs of acting more   aggressively and more quickly here outweighing the benefits  So I support alternative A with the   language as drafted  Thank you     I thank you very much  I will make it 16 out of 16 on the excellent   work of the staff, but I think also something that comes through from that is that we have to have a   great deal of humility given the situation that we’re in  We can use analogies from Japan  We can   use analogies from other parts of history or from Sweden, but there are a lot of parts that are unique,   and a lot of what we’re doing is, as I think President Bullard said, outside where some of the data   have been in the past  So we do have to come at this with a little humility  Actually, the Japanese   experience weighs very heavily on me because that’s perhaps one that I know well and in which I   see perhaps the closest analogies  One of the facts that President Bullard mentioned is extremely   important and weighs heavily on me—they have had their target rate at less than 1 percent for   almost a decade and a half  But something that President Bullard didn’t focus on is how little   growth they have had in that period  We are moving into an era of very low interest rates, and we   want to revive growth and think about how we can do that, and that gets to the overall objective  I   think we also want to avoid the problems that Japan has had because it would probably not be a   good idea to be in a regime in which we feel forced to have the fed funds rate at less than 1 percent   for a decade and a half   Clearly, there are theoretical, empirical, and practical reasons for moving rapidly  The   Japanese example is very clear on that  Practically, we are largely already there  Also, I simply   can’t imagine that over the next 6 or even 12 weeks we’re going to get data that would make us   think that we shouldn’t be moving interest rates down or that we aren’t in a state of the economy in   December 15–16, 2008 92 of 284    which we have to do something fairly aggressively  We already see some disruptions in the markets   because of the low effective rates  We have to be mindful of these consequences and monitor them   closely   As has been mentioned a couple of times, we have the comparison of the markets in which   we’ve intervened that seem to be working a bit better and the markets in which we didn’t intervene   that aren’t working as well  Although I actually do agree with that interpretation, we have to be a   bit careful about that in going forward because there could be some unintended consequences, such   as in commercial paper  A1/P1 interventions can help that market out, but they could have some   unintended consequences for A2/P2  Just because the other markets are not improving as these are,   we have to be careful about drawing conclusions that it must mean that we need to intervene in   market Y and market Z and A, B, C down the line  That’s not to say that I think that what we’ve   done so far has not been helpful  I do believe that it has been, but I think we just have to be very,   very careful about those unintended consequences   Communication strategy, as so many people have said, is crucial because we’re stepping   into a new world  We basically have a lot of explaining to do, and one of the key things to explain   is that we have not gotten to the end of our tether, that there’s still a lot more that we can do, even   though a lot of the world thinks that, once we have “given up” on interest rates or gotten down to   our lower bound, we can’t be that effective  We have to be very effective in arguing that, no, that’s   not the case  In the discussion, a number of people mentioned that trying to provide a framework   for understanding this is really, really crucial  Explaining that we may need to keep interest rates at   a low level for a while based on the conditions in the economy is important, but that doesn’t mean   that low interest rates are not helping economic recovery  We should be expressing concerns that   December 15–16, 2008 93 of 284    inflation could fall below the level that we consider consistent with our dual mandate  I think that’s   something that is also very important to talk about—methods that we could use to attack that   I think this does in the broad sense raise the value of an inflation target  But I would be very   concerned, as I think President Stern and some others mentioned, at this point about getting into that   debate because, even if we did go to the Congress and a few members of the Congress said that’s   okay, that still would be a very big debate and I think a distraction from exactly where we want to   go  But we need to think about that over the long run, particularly if we start to see the inflation rate   going down or if we see that we’re not being effective at fighting expectations of deflation  But I   think for the moment that it would be too much of a burden on our communications and would   perhaps cause too much confusion in the market  They have gotten all of these new facilities    We’re stepping into a new world potentially depending on our decision tomorrow  If we also then   introduce an inflation target at this time, it may just be a lot to digest  But I think it is a discussion   that we need to continue to have   In terms of the specifics of the actions that we need to take moving forward, once again, I   think the lessons of Japan are important  We want to focus a little more on the asset side than on the   liability side  The Chairman characterized things in a very effective way to argue that we’re not   doing precisely the same thing and that we potentially can be more effective  I think it’s not just   about some particular reserves level  The example that President Rosengren gave is one that weighs   on me  We need to be nimble in responding to different problems  We may have new facilities    We may purchase more or fewer securities  Being constrained by or picking out a particular   number for reserves doesn’t seem to be the most effective way to build our credibility that we will   fight these problems  Although there is a long history in the Fed of looking at things like the   monetary base, nonborrowed reserves, and such, I think there are good reasons that we moved away   December 15–16, 2008 94 of 284    from them  Of course, I’m from the University of Chicago, and so Milton Friedman is spinning   right now, [laughter] but money demand has not proved to be a very stable function over time,   particularly now  The money multiplier has certainly been anything but stable, making it more   difficult for us to focus credibly on a particular reserves level to see what the ramifications are for   the rest of the economy  That is not to say that we shouldn’t have an eye on those issues  But given   the uncertainties, I would be reluctant to focus on that  I think a focus on the asset side is much   more effective     Ultimately in all the programs and actions that we undertake, we have to think about the exit   strategy, as a number of people have mentioned  I think that’s very important for us both with   longer-run expectations and in just making sure that, as we do intervene, we minimize the amount   of distortion  In some sense we are purposefully distorting what the market is doing now, but in   some sense we think of the market as being distorted from where it normally would operate  So we   have to be at peace with that  We need to do that  But we also want to make sure that as much as   possible we try to restore that functioning  Making clear that we do these things with reluctance and   do want to get out of them to restore the normal market functioning will again be a very important   part of our communication strategy to make this all work  Thanks     Thanks  President Lockhart’s forecast about what members would   say about the forecasts I think has turned out to be right, and I certainly don’t want to disappoint    [Laughter]  So I agree with what others have said, and I think most everything has been said   about the intensification of the recessionary flames around the world  What I will do is just   quickly look at it from the perspective of part of the banks’ balance sheets and the things that   may not be left on those balance sheets, to just underscore how I think this is going to be   protracted for the financial services sector for a while   On the consumer side, as many people have mentioned, the very sharp step down in   employment, the very large job losses, the increases in the unemployment rate, and the decreases   in wealth have been leading to very significant increases in consumer delinquencies and very   high roll rates—that is, people who become delinquent rolling directly into charge-off  This is   happening not only on the credit card side and on a lot of different parts of the consumer side but   also in mortgages, for which we are seeing exactly the same kind of thing  Although the most   recent numbers that came out from the Mortgage Bankers Association suggested some   December 15–16, 2008 152 of 284    stabilization in foreclosure starts, that actually had more to do with the laws in various states   slowing down that process rather than any real change in the underlying economics  Of course,   we still have a lot of option ARM types of resets that will be coming through in 2009  So a lot of   pressure is there, and as was mentioned, housing prices are still going down   We haven’t yet seen as much of an actual downturn in commercial real estate, but   undoubtedly that will occur as fewer people are shopping in shopping malls and as a lot of other   commercial real estate projects don’t have the payoffs that people expect  Also, an enormous   amount of refinancing is going to be necessary during the next few months, and having to pay an   additional 600 or 800 basis points really changes the economics of a lot of these projects, if they   can even get the refinancing at an additional 600 to 800 basis points  For leveraged loans,   another piece of the balance sheet, as people have said, there is very little activity going on in   takeovers  The only positive there is that the failure of certain deals has taken some of the   pressure off certain banks’ balance sheets   On the commercial and industrial side, as we have noted, the investment-grade market for   debt issuance seems to have maintained itself, but that is really one of the few markets that is   there  If any challenges come in there, it could be very, very difficult for firms to finance   investment  We certainly have seen the spreads going up recently, even if the volume has come   back a bit  But as we have seen in the non-investment-grade part, the spreads have blown out,   and the financing is not there  That tends to be a little more of what many banks have on their   balance sheets, and so I think that is representative of the challenges that the banks are going to   have  That suggests that we have a lot of challenges in banking and financial institutions’   balance sheets to come that have nothing to do with any particular level of assets or accounting   December 15–16, 2008 153 of 284    issues but just real economic factors that are going to be affecting the balance sheets  So the   credit headwinds are going to be very, very strong for a number of quarters going forward   The points that President Rosengren made are extremely important ones  We have to   think about, as we move to the zero lower bound, how that is going to affect behavior of   financial institutions  Certainly, the staff memos were good on addressing some issues, but I   think that other things that have been mentioned, like imposing minimums or floors on interest   rates on loans, we have not carefully analyzed or really understand well  There may be a variety   of other responses that we don’t understand well that we really do need to get a better handle on,   both to see how the effects of traditional monetary policy change—the transmission   mechanism—and to think about the nontraditional aspects of monetary policy that we would be   undertaking by using our balance sheet  So where can we use it most effectively?  If the   financial institutions are changing their behavior, we need to be cognizant of that and think about   where we need to try to unfreeze markets if we are going to be using our balance sheet in that   way, and I think it is very important that we do so   I will underscore also what other people have said about the great importance of clearly   articulating what we are doing  It is not that we have given up and that the Fed is impotent but   that, through changes in our balance sheet, we can be quite potent in particular markets and in   general  That then brings us to whether we can be too potent and raise inflation concerns    Exactly as President Stern said, we should be so lucky to have that as our problem  We do need   to make sure that we maintain credibility and show that we feel that we can and do act to offset   concerns about deflation  It is very difficult to tell what the price-level evolution is likely to be   over the next year, but I do think that there is a real concern about that, and we have to take that   very, very seriously going forward  I think we would, obviously, be able to get out of these   December 15–16, 2008 154 of 284    different programs, and we need to think about getting out of them at some point  But right now   the key is getting into the programs, using the nontraditional approaches, to make sure that we   offset a deflationary psychology that could develop  Thank you      Every other day?     Thank you very much  Obviously you have a bleak outlook  It’s very   important to act quickly and decisively, and I think it’s clear from the discussion that our choice is   between A and B  But as a number of people have mentioned, the economic substance is probably   December 15–16, 2008 200 of 284    nearly identical in alternatives A and B  Our exposition of it, though, can make a very big   difference   There are an enormous number of moving parts, and there is a lot to digest  We potentially   have here, as I count them, seven new things that people have brought up  That’s just an enormous   amount to deal with, and I think some of them we want to delay  The inflation target is very   important, but it brings up issues here, and I’m not sure that we want to talk about something like   that now  So let me just quickly run through these   We have to think about the dynamic of what we are going to say next time  What is this   committing us to talk about?  First, the rate cut is one very big issue—75 versus 50 basis points    Although some market participants think it will be 75, I think that will still be news, but I think it’s   very important for us to move there  Second, just moving to a range is something new; I think that   is something that is actually quite newsworthy in and of itself  Going to no target at all is extremely   newsworthy, maybe too newsworthy to include with all these other things  I think of this and the   discussions that we’ve had as setting up an extremely valuable template for how we should be   thinking about the statement and what we need to be explaining today as well as over the next few   meetings  So I would actually say that, given all of the moving parts and all of the changes, talking   about a range either “between” or “of” zero to ¼ percent would make a lot of sense  I don’t think   we’re introducing any more ambiguity  I think we’re introducing a bit of ambiguity especially for   people who are not that well informed by saying that we don’t have a target anymore  What   President Yellen said was that it could easily be misinterpreted as “gosh, we don’t really have   control over these things anymore anyway”  I don’t think any of us believes that, and I think there’s   more of a chance of that misinterpretation, which I don’t want us to have, if we do that today with   all the other changes than if we waited a little  I still think the range is a pretty big shift    December 15–16, 2008 201 of 284    Expressing concerns about inflation being less than the level fostering economic growth—  again, I think that’s something that I would prefer to wait on  I like President Stern’s edit about   talking about the appreciable diminution of inflationary pressures, but I would wait on putting in the   phrase about whether the level is too low to be consistent with fostering economic growth  I   mentioned the inflation target  I think we should wait on that  We’re introducing conditionality,   which I think is valuable to do, and I think the phrase there is fine  We’re talking about old and new   programs as well as balance sheet issues  As a number of people have mentioned, we have already   talked about standing ready to expand the purchases of agency securities as conditions warrant  So   that’s forward leaning already  If we are committed to doing the Treasury securities fairly soon, I   think we should just go along with that and feel comfortable with that  But we do have to think a bit   about the precedent of making concrete new policies that we’ve generally talked about in this   statement  Is it something that we want to do going forward?  Does this commit us to doing that?  I   don’t think so, but I think we should just think about that   Then I think it’s very important that we talk about the use of the balance sheet  I agree with   Governor Warsh that to be bold you don’t say “continue to”  But we are talking about some   existing programs, so in some sense we are continuing  I’m not quite sure exactly where we want to   go on this, but I just wanted to raise that ambiguity  On the balance sheet, though, I go back to the   Chairman’s remarks from yesterday  It is important to think about the composition of the balance   sheet, not just the size in and of itself—Governor Kohn also made reference to this—so I would be   very wary of focusing on the size here  I think that just talking about ways to use the balance sheet   is the appropriate way to go now  If we have more experience and understand better how the size   might evolve over time, how the different programs we have might fluctuate, I’d feel more   comfortable with that  If we talk about the size or commitment to growth of that size or expecting it   December 15–16, 2008 202 of 284    to be large, just as a number of people said, it could suddenly shrink, and we don’t want people to   think that we’re changing monetary policy because of that  Some of these things would just be   changing over time  Thank you     So the last sentence will have “continue to” or not?     I just want to underscore that, because that was my concern in moving   toward B rather than A because I certainly agree that the economic substance is the same  But I do   think there’s much more of an opportunity for misinterpretation by the market, and for us to say that   we don’t have control of the fed funds rate is the main concern that I have with A  I think B is very   clear  The idea of talking about a range, including zero, is something that at least as far as I know   the Fed has never done before, and I think that’s an enormous shift  That will be seen as a real shift    But to go to A would have ambiguity and would be very difficult to explain to people who are not   real aficionados that we’re not saying, “Gosh, we really don’t have the opportunity to fix the federal   funds rate anymore  That piece is broken”
