7057,2002-06-25," No, really there’s a pair of equations—one for price inflation and one   for wage inflation—that are estimated together  We’re assuming in the process of estimating   these two equations that expectations are formed in a manner consistent with a view of how   monetary policy operates to move the federal funds rate  Built into that estimation is a view that                 June 25-26, 2002 28 of 179  monetary policy was conducted in a different manner in the 1960s and the 1970s then it has been   more recently    Well, the specific way that we characterize monetary policy is in the   form of a “Taylor rule” equation—a dynamic form of the Taylor rule that has a lagged interest   rate in it We’re using different coefficients in this Taylor rule to characterize the two different   views   We are imposing it on the model, but we are taking our coefficient   estimates from studies that other people have done based on analyzing the data  We are not   doing our own independent estimates   To be clear, we’re imposing coefficients only as they relate to the   conduct of monetary policy But we do estimate the other coefficients—for example, the beta   and gamma that are explicitly shown in the exhibit   Well, we have more than one lag on inflation, but if we summed up   the individual coefficients on all the lags, beta would be about 65, I think     Yes, though the answer to that does depend upon how inflation   expectations are formed   Well, we’re actually generating proxies ourselves from a small VAR   model, one of the elements of which is an equation for the federal funds rate in the form of a   Taylor rule type of equation that I described earlier  So we’re not using survey data   In the process of estimating the wage-price structure in the FRB/US   model, we are actually generating our own proxies for expected inflation  And those proxies are   the forecasts that would be generated by a small VAR model of the economy, assuming that   embedded in that small VAR model is a particular view of how monetary policy is formed   The federal funds rate, the gap between the unemployment rate and   the natural rate, and the rate of consumer price inflation     Well, one could ask whether that model is stable, and certainly—    One could say that the interest rate equation in it is not stable,   reflecting the shift in policy, and we do take account of that  And that’s really the only test we   would apply One could actually look closer at it    One comment I might have on that is that the weight we give to   monetary policy in the experience of the last five years is associated with our notion that policy   changes the sensitivity of inflation to the gap between unemployment and the natural rate  For   monetary policy to receive a bigger weight in our analysis there would have to have been a   bigger gap between actual unemployment and what we estimate is the natural rate for policy’s   quantitative effect to be dramatically larger than we estimated  So that’s a more or less   mechanical explanation of why in our way of thinking we can’t give policy too much more   weight But obviously we have a variety of uncertainties here, so we wouldn’t rule out a   different parsing   May I add one more point to the answer to your question?  There’s no   sense that there is any payback from the benefits of productivity that has to be met at some point    So while we’re saying that the productivity story has played out, we have reached this lower rate   of inflation In our view, there’s no reason for inflation to have to move up in the future because   workers haven’t gotten their full response to it  So we’ve settled in at a new—   Well, one answer is that the model we’re using to provide these   quantitative estimates makes use of the labor share as one of the explanatory variables that enters   into the dynamics of inflation—price inflation and wage inflation  But the view of this model is   that the labor share goes up and down over a period of time but it’s ultimately going to   equilibrate at some constant  Viewed over the broad span of the last thirty or forty years, the   labor share tends not to have a trend in it  I guess our view would be that, measured relative to   trend productivity, the labor share is pretty close to its historical average at the moment  When   productivity took off, the labor share was depressed for a while, but it has been rebounding as   compensation has caught up  Does that answer your question?
