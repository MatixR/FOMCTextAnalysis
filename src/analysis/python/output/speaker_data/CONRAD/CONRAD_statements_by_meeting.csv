5165,1994-08-16," Thank you The pace of business expansion in the Seventh District, I think, is a bit more subdued than earlier this year, but we feel that considerable momentum remains when the supply shortage in the auto sector is taken into account In looking at the auto picture, the July seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales was about 137 million units That was down from May and June, but it was considerably above June 1993--by about 7 percent That continued to reflect the strength in light truck sales and also, I think, benefited from a boost in imports We agree with the assessment that the weak sales are largely due to supply shortages and not to a decline in overall demand When we talk to the auto companies, their build plans will likely only stabilize the supply situation Third-quarter production, which was planned at 27 million units, actually is beginning to seem a little out of reach based on what we see in terms of start-up delays We think that, reasonably, production could be about 50 to 100 thousand units below that estimate If sales do approach the 15 million unit annual rate, which analysts are forecasting, inventories will probably remain below the 55 days that exists now and could be more in line with a 40-day supply for some of the more popular models On the price front as far as autos are concerned, the announced price increases from the Big Three are in the 1-1/2 to 3 percent range; that is about $250 to $500 per vehicle But if you look at a weighted-average price with respect to the more popular models, 3 percent seems to be at the low end of the range and it may be a 3 to 4 percent range If you look at that in combination with the reduction in incentives, which have been reduced by as much as 40 percent, price pressures have most assuredly increased in the motor vehicles area  Not all segments appear to be as strong as autos Reports from District retailers suggest that little has changed from the second quarter when growth slowed somewhat In talking to our largest retailer, they looked at second-quarter sales as a small setback, but they expect what they saw as a boring, slow, middle-of-the-road upward trend to continue We don't sense any concern about retail inventories at this point in time, but as has been mentioned by  -19-    8/16/94  others, intense competition continues to hold down price increases in this sector On the manufacturing front, steel shipments have slowed a little, and that mostly seems to be coming out of some of the plants in Michigan In Chicago and northern Indiana production and shipments are holding up well Shipments of major home appliances, which have been strong, are expected to post only a modest year-over-year gain for the second half, and that would represent a small decline from first-half shipments on a seasonally adjusted basis Heavy truck production, after operating flat out for the last two years, is expected to decline by a modest amount in the third and fourth quarters There are some slots or openings for truck production that could be accommodated in that quarter, although overall utilization of the stock continues to be high and rates paid by shippers continue to increase The housing sector is pretty much as others have reported We have seen a small uptick in multifamily construction In the labor markets, unemployment rates around the District continued to trend downward during the second quarter and remain below the national average A major temporary help firm reported paying higher wages to attract better qualified workers Another firm suggested the same result, but also indicated that, because of competition, they were unable to pass on higher wages to their customers On the ag side, District crop estimates for corn and soybeans confirm the prospects for a large harvest this fall Corn yields are likely to be the second highest ever and soybeans will probably set a new record This prospect has weighed heavily on corn and soybean prices  As for the national outlook, our GDP forecast is a bit stronger than the Board staff has suggested Employment remains strong There appears to be little slack, and we view the risk as tilted to the up side as far as the national economic picture is concerned Thank you   We would support the recommendation, Mr Chairman "
