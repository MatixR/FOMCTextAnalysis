  The data on foreign economic activity that  have come in since your March meeting have run high relative to our  prior expectations  We have passed through much of this surprise to the  level of foreign output in our projection for the first half of 2000 but  have not seen as much reason to alter the pace of its subsequent  expansion     Despite the brighter prospects for the level of activity abroad, the   dollar appreciated 3-1/2 percent relative to the major currencies over the  intermeeting period  Evidently the upside surprises to activity in the  United States outstripped those abroad, and interest rates rose more here   Even after taking account of this widening of the interest-rate advantage  to US obligations, though, we have been hard pressed to explain much  of the strength of the dollar, especially relative to the euro  True, our  economic activity continues to expand more rapidly than that in the euro  area, and the cacophony of official responses to euro weakness raises  doubts that necessary structural reforms will be forthcoming     Be that as it may, with the strong external impetus stemming from   the weak euro and growing momentum to domestic spending, the euro  area should expand about 3-1/2 percent this year and next  Underlying  this forecast is the belief that the European Central Bank is very likely to  tighten in short order and eventually to raise its policy rate a total of      1-1/4 percentage points by the end of 2001  A downside risk to our  outlook for spending, however, is that European officials’ concerns  about the value of the euro in the near term will extend beyond the  essentially symbolic act of sterilized intervention, should that happen, to  a firming monetary policy sooner and by more than we have assumed   Of course, that is a risk that could be made more palpable depending on  the action you take today     We are concerned as well that Japanese officials will fail to deliver   the policy stance appropriate to ensure sustained economic expansion  sufficient to work down the considerable stockpile of unused resources   There is little doubt that near-term readings on the pace of spending in  Japan will be on the high side, even abstracting from problems with      20  measurement  As the news of this favorable first-half performance  comes out, the Bank of Japan is likely to pick short rates off their zero  floor, but only by a small amount   In our view, this near-term strength  in the economy is a temporary spurt--not much more than a bounce-back  from the sharp contraction in the second half of last year  Going  forward, households will still be burdened by doubts about job security  that will make them reluctant consumers, the lagged effects of the earlier  appreciation of the yen will cut into net exports, and fiscal policy is  scheduled to shrink its stimulus  As a result, Japanese real GDP growth  is forecast to settle at below 1 percent over the last six quarters of the  forecast period     Because the expansion of activity among our other trading partners   seems more assured, when we add it all up our forecast calls for output  growth in the foreign economies of 4-1/2 percent this year and 4 percent  next year  Of course, this outlook is shaped importantly by the past and  projected path of the exchange rate  With respect to flows, the exchange  rate acts to tilt global spending toward those regions where capacity  pressures are less binding  Thus, today’s strong dollar helps to direct  some US spending toward foreign markets, making our own substantial  pressures on resources a bit less intense  Over time, though, that same  level of the exchange rate contributes to a substantial--and deepening-- current account deficit and an increasing reliance on foreign investors’  willingness to hold increasing amounts of claims on the United States     We have not been able to convince ourselves that those foreign   investors will continue voluntarily to hold ever-larger stocks of debt at  the current level of exchange rates indefinitely  And so, we’ve written  down a path in which the dollar’s value falls over the forecast period   The sense that returns on dollar assets will look less attractive over time  to foreign investors also helps to explain the rise in longer-term yields  on dollar-denominated assets in Mike’s outlook  As any forecaster is  wont to do, we have projected a path for the dollar’s decline that is  relatively smooth  In part, that represents our equivocation on when that  process of adjustment will start  But when it does, it may not be so  orderly or well contained  Of perhaps most relevance for your policy  consideration, the decline in the dollar implies that the foreign sector  will no longer be a force helping to absorb robust domestic spending and  to restrain domestic inflation  Rather, less of any excess domestic  demand will be satisfied from foreign capacity, and import prices--and  likely tradable prices more generally--will be adding to domestic  inflation     The components of the revision to our outlook have offsetting   implications for net exports and the current account going forward  The  stronger level of foreign activity raises the world’s demand for goods      21  and services overall, to the benefit of US exports  However, because  the dollar begins our projected path of gliding down from a higher  altitude, relative prices over the forecast period work to favor imports  and discourage exports more than previously  The net of these forces is  incorporated arithmetically in the staff forecast as a shrinking negative  contribution of net exports to GDP growth this year and next that is  roughly similar to that in the March Greenbook  We also anticipate the  current account deficit to deepen to $525 billion by the fourth quarter of  2001  This deficit represents about 5 percent of nominal GDP and is  $20 billion more than in our March forecast  To the extent that you  agree with the staff assessment that the implied accumulation of US  obligations abroad will strain foreign investors’ patience, the likelihood  of the dollar depreciation we’ve projected--and the risk attendant to that  outlook--would seem just a bit more considerable       The models of optimal international portfolio diversification   would suggest that there is a long way to run because they conclude that there is a significant   home bias  That is, households in a domestic country hold far too much of their wealth in   their own currency and not enough international assets  So, from that perspective, both they   and we should be accumulating more international assets relatively  As a rough   approximation the answer you get is that the assets a country’s residents should hold ought to   be something on the order of their share of world GDP      Sure  I was talking about an environment in which there was an   equality of risk-adjusted returns worldwide  In that case the international portfolio   diversification of households would move toward--      Right  It would move toward those shares  But the fact is that   households hold fewer foreign assets than our models think they should  However, countering   that is a long historical property that they don't hold those assets, and we are testing the ranges   of reserve shares     Now to answer the factual part of your question, we don't have international flow of   funds accounts that would give us information about the levels of foreign assets and their   distributions across countries  We can get it from the perspective of the United States; in fact      28  there is a new survey coming out on that  But I can't answer your question for the Belgian   dentist or the Dutch broker     I think a significant fraction of the higher growth for 1999 and   2000 is cyclical because by our estimate there are output gaps to be worked down in many of   the industrial countries  And the fact that foreign growth in 2001 moderates in our forecast   really suggests that we couldn't find the new economy effects working as successfully abroad   as has been the case in the United States  Right now there are some tentative pieces in the   puzzle that suggest that productivity growth has probably picked up in Canada  And we have   raised our estimate of potential output growth for that country  Rising productivity is also the   case in some of the smaller European countries, particularly those that use information   technology rather heavily  However, those are the smaller countries and their contribution to   total foreign output is relatively modest  It won't be until we see something in the major   industrial countries that we are going to see foreign economic growth above the top line of our   forecast  And it's in the major industrial countries where the structural problems seem most   severe  Whether those problems will actually be a drag on activity, say, in Japan, or just   impede the progress necessary toward taking full advantage of the new economy, is hard to   say     And one reason we've been looking for it harder in the last   couple of months is that, in fact, equity prices have risen so much in many parts of Europe       34  And the better performance of IT-sector equities relative to the major indexes also has some   precedent in the US data     That was one of the small countries in Europe that I had in   mind  There is an OECD study that looks at a few of the peripheral countries and argues that   the trend in output per hour has picked up in them       Right now it is relatively modest  I don't have the numbers in   front of me, but I think it is on the order of 1/2 percentage point     What’s involved is the distinction between the level and the   growth of consumption  There will no longer be an impetus from wealth adding to or   boosting consumption growth, although the earlier wealth effect will still be supporting the   level of consumption  So just from the fact that the stock market levels out, we no longer get   that kick in consumption     The outlook for foreign economies in the Greenbook   should seem familiar  After all, it shares key properties with the past few  projections prepared for the Committee this year     For one, the staff anticipates that economic growth in most major   industrial economies and in the developing world will be solid over the next  two years, albeit somewhat slower than the rapid pace recorded in the first  half of 2000  This step-down in the rate of GDP growth owes both to the  aging of the expansion as pent-up demands are increasingly satisfied and to  monetary policy firming around the world as resource utilization rises  In  Europe, 1/2 percentage point of policy tightening by the European Central  Bank within the next year will work to offset the stimulus to net exports  emanating from the earlier depreciation of the euro, holding growth to around             16     3-1/4 percent over the forecast period  In the developing countries, output  ultimately settles at around a 5 percent pace     For another, Japan once again is an outlier  Our readings of incoming   data lead us to believe Japanese real GDP will be virtually flat in the second  half of 2000  The recently announced fiscal package merely keeps the level  of the deficit about unchanged, implying no net impetus to growth from  fiscal policy  With huge ongoing fiscal deficits and rapidly mounting debt,  policymakers in Japan will be looking for any opportunity to begin to scale  back government spending and raise taxes  Indeed, the mounting challenge  to the current prime minister appears to hinge importantly on calls to scale  back public works spending, which is increasingly seen in Japan as  ineffective  Meanwhile, households appear reluctant to spend  In that  environment, we see the Japanese economy as treading water for the next  couple years, expanding 1 percent and 1-1/2 percent in 2001 and 2002,  respectively  We think that slight pickup in growth, by the way, will provide  the Bank of Japan enough rationale to tighten policy by a small amount  toward the end of the forecast period     Taking our cue from oil futures markets, we again expect oil prices to   decline going forward, essentially reversing almost one-half of the run-up  witnessed since the end of 1998  Those futures prices align with our  assessment of fundamentals  We anticipate that current pressures will lift as  lean inventories are restocked in the near term and global capacity expands to  fill the increases in demand associated with steady world economic growth in  the intermediate run  Those lean inventories, of course, imply that there is  currently less of a cushion to absorb unexpected fluctuations in supply or  demand, placing a wide uncertainty band around our point forecast,  particularly in the near term      And, we are sticking with our outlook that the dollar will depreciate   going forward  The specific assumption in the November Greenbook is that  the broad real foreign exchange value of the dollar will shed about 2-3/4  percent next year and the year after  Again, this owes to our view that the  step-down in economic growth and profitability in the United States and  accumulating current account deficits will tax foreign investors’ willingness  to continue to add US obligations to their portfolios on net       While the basic structure of our projection does not differ much from   those in the past few Greenbooks, we tried to convey a sense of a changed  tone, in that the risks to the foreign outlook now seem better balanced  As  you recall, for much of this year we’ve been in the position of catching up to  surprisingly good incoming readings in most foreign economies  And our  projections for economic growth have accordingly edged higher meeting             17     after meeting  This time, backward-looking readings on activity have  unfolded in the past six weeks about as we had expected  And forward- looking indicators of spending in Europe and Japan, including surveys of  household and business confidence, have been a bit softer on balance,  leading us to notch lower our second-half projection of real GDP growth       In addition, the funding difficulties in Argentina over the past few   weeks serve as a reminder that old-style financial crises remain possible in a  new world economy, further underscoring the notion of downside risks   With a fiscal deficit of around 2 percent of GDP and external debt amounting  to about 50 percent of GDP, Argentina is overly reliant on the confidence of  foreign investors  While officials there have done much to extend debt  maturities and line up contingent funds, rolling over the bulge in debt  maturing in the next two years looks to be a close-run thing  The news out of  Buenos Aires and Washington over the weekend--including the promise of  government efforts to trim the social security system and rein in the civil  service compensation and provincial spending in return for funds from the  IMF and the multilateral development banks--was generally favorable   However, reports of late suggest that it may be difficult to get the provincial  governors on board a reform bandwagon  Our working assumption remains,  as in the Greenbook, that Argentina will squeak through these funding  problems and keep its currency-board arrangements intact  In any case, I  would note that the alternative simulations in Part I of the Greenbook suggest  that as long as any crisis is mostly contained to Latin American debt markets,  the effects on the United States are quite limited     And recent movements in the dollar might indicate the return of two-  sided risks about the economy in the foreign exchange market  While it is  true, once again, that the foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the  major currency index rose over the intermeeting period on net, in the past  couple of weeks it has moved lower on balance  The inflection point came  on October 27, with the release of a third-quarter US GDP figure that was  weaker than expected  This market reaction to slower US growth is an  example of the mechanism that we expect will sap the dollar’s strength going  forward  Increasingly, as investors come to realize that US growth has  stepped down, in effect trimming the tail on any “new-economy” premiums  expected in US returns, foreign obligations will look increasingly better   The resulting dollar depreciation--which we’ve smoothed through over the  forecast period for lack of any precise notion of when investor sentiment will  change--implies that the foreign sector will no longer be a force helping  restrain domestic inflation  It also implies that foreign industrial economies  will have to rely increasingly on the momentum of their own domestic  markets to sustain economic growth as the stimulus from strong US external  demands wanes                18        When we think about trying to do those sorts of things, we also   have the problem of what to assume about other asset market prices  If we adopt the path from   the futures market curve, then what do we assume for stock prices or what should we do for the   exchange value of the dollar?     But we don’t have as clear a road map for, say, the exchange value   of the dollar or equity prices as we do in the money market futures curve     Perhaps the hardest challenge confronting the  staff as we sorted through the incoming data over the intermeeting  period to prepare a forecast for the global economy was to avoid falling  into a self-reinforcing spiral of pessimism  As the forecasting process  unfolded, we marked down the outlook for economic growth abroad in  part because of weaker prospects at home  But this translated into the  expectation of both lower US net exports and a weaker global market  for technological products, trimming the projection for US GDP and  creating obvious implications for overseas activity  This iterative  process converged at a significantly weakened projection for foreign  economic growth relative to what you saw eight weeks ago  Still, we  think forces are in place that will foster a revival in growth, albeit a  little more delayed and to a somewhat slower pace than thought at the  time of the June meeting         As for the near-term outlook, real GDP in the foreign industrial  countries is expected to expand at just over a 1 percent annual rate in  the second half of 2001, about 1/2 percentage point slower than  forecasted in June We have also penciled in only modest expansion in  the developing economies of Asia and Latin America over the  remainder of the year that puts the level of their output at the end of this  year 1-1/4 percent, on average, below our projection in the last  Greenbook Three factors mostly account for our more pessimistic take  on the pace of global economic activity this year   First, incoming data on spending, production, and employment  have almost invariably disappointed  Output contracted in Germany  and Italy in the second quarter, and more forward-looking indicators of  household confidence and business purchasing intentions do not bode  well for growth going forward in the euro area  While domestic  spending in Canada has held up well thus far, employment is beginning  to sag And Japan appears to have slipped into another recession  Real  GDP is also declining in the developing countries of Asia that direct  much of their exports to the global electronics market and in those  countries in Latin America with trade tightly linked to the United  States Meanwhile, the prices of many internationally traded     8/21/01 9   commodities have continued to tumble, which is probably a sign of  falling contemporaneous demand         That leads naturally to the second source of downward revision to  foreign growth--the marking lower of the near-term US outlook   We’ve pulled down our projection of activity abroad both because  some of the adverse effect of more slowly growing demand in the  United States falls on foreign markets and because an important drag on  our own economy--reduced demands for capital attendant to the re- evaluation of the prospects for the tech sector--is also playing out in  many other countries   Third, it has become painfully clear that the financial crisis in  Argentina has already extracted a heavy economic toll there  Output is  contracting, unemployment is rising, and prices are declining   Meanwhile, risk spreads remain elevated and deposits in the banking  sector are running off rapidly Indeed, the most obvious vote of “no  confidence” in the current situation is what Dino already related--that  an estimated $4 billion of US currency was shipped to Argentina last  month Perhaps it evidences our lack of imagination, but we find it  hard to picture how the government of Argentina can extricate itself  from this situation in a manner that stanches output losses anytime  soon And without economic growth, its poor fiscal position stemming  from its high debt burden will only look more unsustainable than it  does today, and the threat of spillovers to Argentina’s neighbors will be  that much more palpable    After the forecast was put to bed, we received data on US  international trade for June that would not lead us to alter the top-line  number we wrote down in the Greenbook but that did serve to  underscore our sense of ongoing weakness in global economic activity   The US trade deficit on goods and services, at $29-1/2 billion, was  about what we were expecting and close to the number the BEA  assumed in constructing its preliminary estimate of second-quarter  GDP What surprised us, however, was that this deficit was arrived at  by shrinking the values of both exports and imports  Particularly of  note was the fact that the dollar value of capital goods crossing our  borders in either direction was smaller in June than in May, extending  the trend of the past few months   While I’ve emphasized the downward revision of foreign  economic growth in the near term, perhaps the most important feature  of the outlook is unchanged We still believe that economic growth  abroad will pick up next year to a rate not very much below that of its  potential This growth revival may be a bit more attenuated than in the  prior few Greenbooks, but it still relies on the same four forces     8/21/01 10   First and foremost, as David has already described, the expansion  of US economic activity is expected to step up in 2002  We think that  will be associated with a large positive swing in the growth of US real  imports that will benefit activity in our trading partners  Moreover,  given that the US growth pickup includes a turnaround in investment,  greater demands for capital here will brighten the outlook for the tech  sector worldwide   Second, while data on inventories abroad are spotty and unreliable,  we believe that part of the dynamics of the slowing of the past few  quarters in many foreign countries has included a production  adjustment in response to some stockbuilding that developed as demand  weakened unexpectedly  As inventories stop falling next year, that  drag on real GDP growth will be lifted   Third, monetary policy in many industrial countries has already  weighed in to support aggregate demand going forward We think that  most of those central banks will continue to ease and that some other  central banks will join in  In the case of the Bank of Japan, however, it  remains to be seen whether an elevated provision of liquidity, which  was announced last week, will bolster spending given that the policy  rate is already at its zero floor  The issues are more conventional when  it comes to Europe  In common with the net judgment of participants  pricing money market futures, we believe that the European Central  Bank will ease 50 basis points by year-end, as their task is made easier  by declines in headline inflation induced by falling energy prices   Fourth, with regard to energy more generally, the price of West  Texas intermediate oil has fallen about $4 per barrel over the past three  quarters, and our forecast, following oil futures markets, holds that  another $3 per barrel price drop is in store by year-end 2002  We  anticipate that this price decline has been and will be shifting income to  those residents of the global economy who are more likely to spend it,  bolstering consumption in many countries   Although we’re relatively confident about the existence of these  forces helping to shape a rebound in spending in 2002, their magnitude,  timing, and whether other sources of restraint will more than offset  their impetus are far from certain  Two prominent risks emanate from  global financial markets   For one, we assumed in our projection that the real foreign  exchange value of the dollar would follow a track tilted slightly  downward But the fact is that the dollar’s value fell more in the past  week than the decline stretched out over the next six quarters in our     8/21/01 11   projection This recent downdraft might be the first sign of a risk factor  that we’ve fretted about for some time--that foreign investors’ appetite  for adding to their holdings of US obligations will wane  But the  foreign exchange market has given us false signals before, so we have  treated this latest stepdown as evidence of greater odds on a downside  risk rather than as a reason to pull down our baseline forecast  To get a  sense of how events may unfold should that risk materialize, we  included an alternative simulation in the Greenbook in which the  dollar’s broad real value drops nearly one-quarter by early next year   From a US perspective, the resulting ratcheting higher of foreign  relative to domestic prices encourages exports and pulls down imports  to add about 3/4 percentage point to GDP growth in the first half of  next year and twice that amount in the second half  The impetus to  inflation is even more striking, with core inflation running 1-1/2  percentage points faster by the end of next year  The chief risk to the  global economy is that this relative price change off-loads some of our  ongoing weakness to our trading partners  With the nominal interest  rate already at zero in Japan and the fiscal deficit a source of concern,  Japanese policymakers may be poorly positioned to counter such  imported weakness and, unless the stronger euro emboldens the ECB,  European policymakers may not be willing to do so   As another risk, our Latin American outlook assumes that the  fallout from problems in Argentina will be relatively contained to that  nation’s immediate trading partners and other Latin countries reliant on  international capital markets  That assumption was based on the logic  that global investors have seen this coming and that the IMF’s stand-by  arrangement with Brazil will ring-fence that country  But part of  Argentine officials’ bargaining strategy of late has apparently been to  elevate expectations in the market of the size of a package in order to  put pressure on the international financial institutions  If either less  new money is forthcoming than those encouraged expectations or what  comes fails to cover Argentina’s subsequent reserve losses, then the  scope and severity of contagion may be more than we’ve built into the  Greenbook I don’t have a simulation to point to mainly because it  didn’t seem like a productive use of our large-scale macro models, as it  would be highly nonlinear and especially dependent on market  sentiment  That concludes our presentation, Mr Chairman      The market is just not functioning particularly well, Mr   Chairman  We can get some readings on swap rates  Swap contracts were traded in   London yesterday Those spreads widened out considerably yesterday and they’ve   narrowed today On net they are higher I don’t think we’re going to have reliable   readings on corporate rates for a while    Yes, Don was talking about the steepening of the term   structure The declines at the short end are in the neighborhood of 1/2 percentage point   and the long end is down only a couple basis points  Those are on-the-run Treasury   issues, which are pretty much the only securities that are being traded  So, I really   couldn’t tell you what the underlying term structure is     Actually, I think a large part of the reason central bank   liquidity contracted comes through in Dino’s inset at the top of page 6, namely that   intermediation wasn’t functioning when four out of the five federal funds brokers were   out of service As the fed funds market became operational and those with insufficient   positions could get their reserves from those with excess reserves, there wasn’t a need for   us to blow up our balance sheet to replace the unavailable intermediation  So I   interpreted the reduction in nonborrowed reserves and the decline in the Desk’s open   market operations as evidence of a return of the federal funds market to more normal   functioning    I’d like to add just one other point  In establishing a   reference point, President Jordan, you might want to go back one or two weeks from   September 5th Reserves are very erratic on a week-to-week basis and it looks as if from   a weekly standpoint your base point is a little low relative to the previous two or three   weeks     Historically, Mr Chairman, the Treasury has been concerned that an   environment in which investors are not sure they actually will receive the security they purchased   may turn off some investors  As Dino pointed out, during the time the fails were occurring some   foreign central banks were not making their securities available in the market because they were on   the receiving end of fails too They’d lend the securities out but weren’t getting them back  So they     11/6/01 7   decided not to participate in the market because they in particular like the orderly receipt of their   securities I think the Treasury’s argument is that if fails continue for a protracted period, then at the   margin at least some investors will pare back their participation in the Treasury market    Mr Chairman, if you wanted to appear more neutral, the verb   “detracts” may also seem negative    So if instead it said “is likely to slow the advance in measured   productivity” I think that would pretty much go in the direction of neutrality     Mr Chairman, they are highly correlated because they are functionally   related The prepayment speed is a function of the level of mortgage yields, and given the close   relationship--   Right And if you look at a short period where there hasn’t been much   change in the underlying pool of mortgages, that function is going to show up as much closer  If you   stretch this back over time, where there is a bigger diversity in the outstanding pools of mortgages,   then the correlation will be changing  So I think you’re right If you take a snapshot, a relatively short   window, they are going to be highly correlated because basically you are looking at prepayment speed   for a given set of mortgages that all have similar coupons      Exactly It’s a crucial element given the net extent of the distribution of   mortgages In a relatively short period of time, the distribution of mortgages isn’t changing so you        12/11/01 8    really see the function Over time, as the distribution of mortgages changes--as some age and as   prepayments occur--then you’re going to see a weaker relationship  So when Dino and his colleagues   go back and examine this, they’ll see a shifting relationship  In any short window, though, you’ll see a   relatively close one    Just an observation, President Minehan  It is certainly true that if you   look at implied volatilities on bond contracts, either the 10-year or the long-term Treasury securities,   they are very much elevated  They are in a range we haven’t seen since 1993; in some way it’s similar   to the observed volatility that Dino showed in his presentation  But the implied volatilities have come   off in the stock market, so it isn’t obvious--    It isn’t obvious that the equity markets are more uncertain now than they   were for most of this year  And in the Greenbook financial projection David didn’t respond   completely to the run-up in long-term yields over this intermeeting period in the same way he didn’t   respond completely to the remarkable and inexplicable decline in the previous intermeeting period that   was associated with changes in Treasury debt management  So if I were to add to your and Dino’s list   of market-specific events that have affected the amplitude of the swings in yields, I think I would also   have to include the discontinuation of the 30-year bond    So some of the run-up we’ve gotten in this period reflects some rollback   of what we saw last year    All the macro simulations you will care about will be at the shortest a   quarterly frequency; and probably you’ll really only want to think about it in terms of year-by-year   effects A lot of these market mechanisms, including the changes in the duration of mortgage-backed   securities, affect the amplitude of interest rates in a relatively short period  But I’m not willing to say   that the level of the long-end of the yield curve is noticeably higher because of these mechanisms   relative to a year ago--    There are two aspects to what you said  The first is, yes, the model   represents an average behavior over the historical period that was estimated  That by itself smoothes     12/11/01 73    the reaction of households and businesses to changes in financial market prices  It smoothes the   reaction in financial market prices to changes in behavior  Putting all that smooth behavior into the   model would, as your intuition suggests, allow short-term interest rates to move a lot in order to   stabilize the results But the second aspect is the word “deterministic”  This really is a perfect   foresight path It assumes that you know the whole future path of the outlook and you know what the   coefficients are precisely If you just had uncertainty about the coefficients in the model, and   depending on which coefficients they were, you might attenuate; you might not react as strongly to   that news So it is possible to construct an optimal path in the presence of uncertainty about both the   model and the shocks that, depending on the objective function, potentially will have the property of   moving the funds rate in the outlook period by less  The shorthand way of capturing that without   working out the very hard problem of specifying the uncertainty about the coefficients and the shocks   in the model is to say, well, find the solution under perfect foresight but put a penalty on movements   in interest rates    Equal distaste    Just to underscore what Don said in terms of the robustness of   alternatives, it really depends on the duration of the other alternatives  Some of the types of shocks in   the Greenbook alternatives, which are relatively temporary, don’t perturb this path all that much  But   one can imagine other types of shocks, including different assumptions about productivity growth, that   could displace the path by much more because you are choosing an entire path  And here comes our   part of the presumption of putting this in the Bluebook  We had to make an assumption about the   Committee’s long-term inflation goal  These simulations were constructed using the assumption that   it was 1 percent But if you move that a bit, it will have marked consequences    One, for instance, is the Money Market Services survey  In last Friday’s   survey, twenty out of twenty respondents said the balance of risks would be tilted toward weakness    For the January meeting it was three out of twenty who thought it would go back to the neutral  By   the time you get to their expectations for the March meeting, it is half toward weakness and half   toward neutral     Actually, Mr Chairman, it’s a pretty easy calculation because foreign   and domestic holdings seem to be growing at just about the same rate      As we estimated it, the growth rates were similar  Looking at   currency shipments in January, overseas and domestic holdings were both growing at 12 percent    In February it was about 8½ percent for overseas and 13 percent for domestic    That’s in part how we get the numbers  It’s one way of estimating   this number; we look at that and the data we get from currency shippers   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that Carol Low distributed during the coffee break   The resilience of household spending, the signs of stirring of investment, and the  significant slowing of the inventory run-off that have become evident in the past  seven weeks would seem to reinforce the judgment that the Committee’s easing cycle  has drawn to a close The better news has cumulated to produce a 1 percentage point  upward revision to the staff’s forecast of real GDP growth this year and has been  associated with sizable increases in market yields all along the maturity structure,  presumably speaking to similar substantial changes in investor expectations  While  there have been favorable developments of late, for real GDP growth to persist  around or a bit above that of its potential will require household spending to continue  to be well maintained—despite the saving rate being quite low—and investment to  gather momentum, despite the fact that a recovery in profits has not yet been  established  Market participants seem confident that policy will be entering a  tightening phase, but no one expects the Committee to begin it today  That is  probably because those analysts appreciate that even a quick snapback in spending  will take some time to whittle away prevailing resource slack, and as a consequence,  inflation should remain low for some time  This would give you the opportunity to  await convincing evidence on the underlying support to the expansion of final  demand before you need to act to preserve low inflation     These considerations would seem to imply that the answer to the question, “When  should the Committee begin removing the unusual degree of accommodation put in  place last year?” is “Not today”  Rather, the more pertinent question would seem to  be how to assess the balance of risks if the funds rate were held at 1¾  On a surface  reading of market prices, it might appear that the pronounced upward slope of federal  funds futures rates implies that market participants assess the risks to be so tilted  toward inflation that you will need to begin tightening very soon  I’ll offer an  alternative interpretation that suggests that the structure of market rates may not be  inconsistent with holding the funds rate at its current level for a time  I will then use  that framework to consider a key strategic issue you face that, in turn, bears  importantly on today’s policy choice   The string of surprisingly strong data on spending and production released over  the intermeeting period prompted the 10 to 55 basis point upward revision to market  expectations of the federal funds rate shown in the upper left panel of your first  exhibit As a result and as plotted in the right panel, market prices now embed an   2 Materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                      March 19, 2002 Page 78 of 117  anticipation that the funds rate will rise to 5¼ percent in mid-2004  There are three  notable features of this configuration of rates that I list in the middle left panel  First,  federal funds futures rates move significantly above 1¾ percent in a couple of  months, apparently signaling the belief that policy will begin tightening on the heels  of the end of the easing episode What is puzzling about this should be evident in the  bottom panel, where I’ve split the path of the funds rate over the past two decades  into the obvious easing and tightening episodes  As shown in the panel at the middle  right, pauses since 1989 after a sequence of policy actions were lengthy  Second,  money market futures rates climb almost continually over the next couple of years,  implying that policy tightening will be extended  But as the middle right panel also  shows, phases of policy tightening since 1989 have usually lasted under one year   And third, these expectations of imminent firming are difficult to square with the  published forecasts of most market economists, who fail to foresee the sort of  pressures on resources that would require action soon   There is an alternative explanation that fits these observations on policy  expectations quite well and that also may help to resolve these seeming anomalies  In  a regime-switching model, we can view market participants as expecting the nominal  funds rate to return to a more sustainable level rapidly once the tightening process  starts but hedging their bets as to when that tightening will begin  The top panel of  your next exhibit gives a formalization of this notion  In particular, I assume that  market participants expect the Committee either to keep the funds rate at its current  level or to begin tightening Once a tightening phase is begun, everyone expects that  the funds rate will be steadily, but fairly rapidly, moved up to some sustainable level  with no reversals or pauses Lastly, if the funds rate has continued to be held constant  in any given month, market participants assign a constant probability of switching  over to a tightening phase in the next month     This model can be fit each day to the expected path of the funds rate derived from  futures markets  The upper right panel shows the evolution of estimates from this  model of the market’s assessment of the probability that the Committee will begin to  tighten next month Although the current reading of an 11 percent chance of  tightening beginning next month might seem small, these probabilities must be  cumulated when making forecasts several months ahead  As plotted in the middle left  panel, according to current market prices there is a one-in-two chance that the funds  rate will be rising six months from now  The right panel suggests how aggressive that  rise may be expected to be  Estimates derived from yesterday’s closing futures rates  suggest that market participants believe that once you begin to tighten, you will move  the funds rate up about as fast as you moved it down—within one year—or about at  the norm of the prior decade  However, presumably because inflation has fallen in  the interim, you’re viewed as likely to return the funds rate to a level of only 5¼  percent, lower than its level when easing started in January 2001   To be sure, you are deciding on the appropriate stance of policy to adopt today,  and what happens over time depends on developments that are inherently  unpredictable, so you may view this interpretation as unlikely in practice                     March 19, 2002 Page 79 of 117  Nonetheless, thinking in terms of the path of interest rates over the next several years  highlights a key strategic question you face  What inflation rate would you prefer to  prevail after interest rates and output have been realigned to more-sustainable levels?   To get some sense of the possibilities, my colleagues in R&S who maintain the  FRB/US model ran simulations, described in the bottom panel, that extend the  forecast until 2007, preserving the key features of the Greenbook outlook  Here is  our opportunity to dig deeply into the salt mines that Dave mentioned earlier  The  simulations used the version of the model in which workers and investors form their  expectations based on past observations of important macroeconomic variables   These scenarios envision the consequences of moving the real funds rate to its long- run equilibrium level of 3½ percent relatively smoothly in one year, along the lines of  the regime-shifting model  The simulations differed according to when you are  assumed to start tightening—next quarter, one year, or two years later  If deferring  policy action for another year or more seems like a long time, I’d note that the  cumulative probabilities derived from the regime-switching model imply the  expectation of about a one-in-five chance that you will not have started tightening by  the second quarter of 2003  That said, very little probability weight appears now  placed in the markets on the possibility that you would hold the funds rate at  1¾ percent for more than two years   These simulations, shown in your last exhibit, put numbers on the obvious  The  longer the Committee waits to tighten, the more unemployment will be worked down  at the expense of an ultimate step-up of inflation  What these simulations show is  how sizable those differences can be Were policy to begin moving the nominal  funds rate up next quarter—shown by the black line in the upper left panel—the  drifting higher of the unemployment rate to 6¼ percent by year-end 2003 in the  middle panel would open enough slack to induce core PCE inflation (the bottom  panel) to settle at around ¾ percent  Delaying that process by one year (the blue  lines) or by two years (the red lines) would forestall that rise in unemployment at the  cost of about 07 and 13 percentage points of higher inflation, respectively, down the  road   The ¾ percent rate of core PCE inflation achieved under the immediate tightening  scenario would be as close to a working definition of price stability as the US  economy has achieved in five decades  If, despite the associated ¾ percentage point  temporary rise in the unemployment rate, the Committee desired that outcome, it  presumably would communicate to the public that its near-term assessment of risks  was tilted toward inflation  After all, were your longer-run inflation goal to be  ¾ percent, the prevailing inflation rate of 1½ percent would seem to pose a greater  source of discomfort currently than the margin of unused resources  But you also  might find some appeal in moving toward risks tilted toward inflation if you were  worried that the economy could snap back more quickly than in these simulations, so  that holding inflation around its current level, let alone reducing it, was in doubt  before too long—that is, in the foreseeable future  The apparent turnaround in the  prospects for investment, favorable news on productivity, and recently legislated  business tax incentives represent a real shock that may warrant a real response in                        March 19, 2002 Page 80 of 117  short order In that regard, I’d note that some estimates of the equilibrium real rate  reported in the Bluebook rose as much as ½ percentage point over the intermeeting  period    It is also possible that the Committee might not see much benefit in defining  price stability as the very low outcome for measured inflation in the immediate- tightening scenario  There were times late last year when the prospects for the  economy were sufficiently gloomy that the zero bound to nominal interest rates  loomed large  Keeping a bit of an inflation cushion might help to reduce those  anxieties in the future in case aggregate demand weakened to the point where a  negative real short-term interest rate was called for  If you’re comfortable with the  prevailing inflation rate and think the Greenbook assessment of the underlying forces  shaping economic performance is about right, then either the staff projection or the  scenario I dubbed “intermediate tightening” would offer an outlook in the near term  with perhaps only small net deviations from your dual objectives of maximum  sustainable growth and price stability  Moreover, the odds on additional adverse  shocks, which darkened the outlook just a few months ago, might seem to be  considerably reduced If so, the risks might be seen as balanced  True, with the real  funds rate close to zero, the Committee will ultimately have to tighten  But  “ultimately” might be beyond the horizon at which you deem the foreseeable future to  end   The case for retaining the balance of risks toward economic weakness could  possibly be made based on the delayed tightening scenario  Were your inflation goal  really to be that much higher than recent readings, you’d presumably prefer to make  some inroads into current resource slack and might see the possibility of additional  easing as not too unlikely But allowing that much slippage in underlying inflation  seems too much at odds with what you have said and how you have acted in the past   Rather, retention of the tilt toward weakness would more appropriately be  underpinned on some combination of two beliefs  First, these simulations, as well as  the Greenbook forecast, might be viewed as being premised on too pessimistic a view  of the economy’s ability to use its resources without engendering inflation—a point  Governor Bies and President Minehan have made  If that were the case, you could  make those inroads into labor market slack seen in the delayed tightening scenario  without the worrying drift-up of inflation—indeed, if you didn’t, inflation might get  uncomfortably low Second, you might be concerned as to whether the expansion of  final demand will be well maintained, especially if market participants get ahead of  themselves in anticipating tightening if anything but the retention of risks unbalanced  to weakness were announced  Essentially, you might have viewed the risks as  balanced at the market prices that held in, say, late February, but the rise since then—  and the potential rise were you to change the tilt—might seem to you as tipping the  scales toward weakness    I think part of the answer, President Parry, is that it is beyond the   ability of our model to differentiate between the FOMC’s starting to tighten a quarter or a half   year from now and four quarters from now  Given the artificiality of the exercise I’ve done, it   may very well be the case that one would expect a much different configuration of market prices   as each month went by and the Committee did not act  So that is clearly a risk here  I think the   important point to get out of that true blue line is that it isn’t obvious that policy action is   imminent—that some element of delay is possible, and I’ve put it in these terms to help frame   the balance of risk decision    I would point to the regime-switching model, which I think speaks to   two things that you’ve said First, it isn’t necessarily the case that market participants have a   sharply delineated expectation of when you will start tightening So I think it isn’t obvious—and   I probably should have included this in my answer to President Parry—that failing to tighten   after a meeting or two will necessarily prompt a backlash in the market  If the market has a   15 percent probability that you will act, then it has an 85 percent probability that you will not act     The second part of the regime-switching model is the notion that the Committee can dip a   toe in the water and the markets will view it as purely that  I think part of the attractiveness of a   model like this can be seen in the experience of the tightening episode in 1994  The Chairman   went up to the Congress and told the world that interest rates would be rising  Many Committee   members shared that assessment of the economic outlook  Fed funds futures sloped sharply   upward But as soon as the Committee started tightening in 1994, those futures rates moved up    Essentially, the way I would view it is that the probabilities in the market that the Committee   would act were relatively high but that the act itself sent them all to 1  The markets envisioned   you embarking on a relatively rapid tightening phase and re-priced accordingly  So there is a   risk associated with taking some action and thinking that the rest will be deferred  In my view   the one opportunity in that regard, which some market commentators have noted, relates to the   wide recognition that at least a portion of your easing actions involved in some sense taking out   an insurance policy Canceling that insurance policy isn’t necessarily a commitment to   completely realign rates            March 19, 2002 Page 83 of 117   I think a message in the alternative NAIRU simulation that Dave put   in Part 1 of the Greenbook was that, if you believe the NAIRU is lower than the staff estimate,     March 19, 2002 Page 84 of 117  you could associate yourself with the red line in the middle panel and get an outcome like the   blue line in the lower panel or better  It’s just a question of what your assessment of the NAIRU   is    I would say that my confidence in the model is such that I   contemplated not putting numbers along that axis but just sending the message that it was now,   later, or even later     In terms of the facts, the ten-year swap over the ten-year AAA in the   latest observation is a differential of about minus 50 basis points    At the time of the last meeting it was minus 30, so it has widened by   20 basis points    Okay The other point to make, just in terms of intermeeting   developments, is that we haven’t focused as much on the AAA rate because it has been   somewhat distorted by the problems of GE    Okay We can do that                May 7, 2002 8 of 81   And that assumed dollar depreciation beyond the Greenbook forecast   horizon is really capturing the tension that Karen noted in her assumption that the dollar remains   flat There are conflicting tensions, of course, with the most notable one being that if we didn’t   have that assumed dollar depreciation, the current account deficit would continue to head south             May 7, 2002 65 of 81  There would be an accumulation of US debt abroad, and that would pose problems, particularly   when considering very long term simulations of our model    That is something we could easily incorporate in future Bluebooks,   subject to our ability to solve the model when the current account deficit begins to grind even   lower    I can talk about it; I’m not sure I’ll necessarily be wise!  I would note   that we see a substantial uptick in the upper bound to the equilibrium funds rate around the end   of 1997, the beginning of 1998  That corresponds with the introduction of the TIPS-based   measure because that’s when we had a fully articulated term structure  The observation you’re   making could be translated into a different puzzle, and that is why the real rates that come out of   the indexed debt market are so high or the corresponding inflation compensation measures we   get are so low It’s one of the reasons we do spend some time talking about liquidity in the         May 7, 2002 66 of 81  market  But to an important extent, it is a puzzle  There is a term premium that we can't   identify There’s a liquidity risk premium and an inflation risk premium  All those things might   be entering the calculation of, say, inflation compensation  That shouldn’t necessarily be   distorting—except the liquidity premium—our estimate of the equilibrium  But the main reason   we track it is that it’s the only market-based measure we have  And perhaps it gives us pause in   overinterpreting our model      Especially when there are significant changes in energy prices, which   could have a bigger effect on the indexed debt real rate    Yes, the fact is that the further-ahead futures rates from the eurodollar   term structure are much higher than we would have in the Greenbook forecast and would imply   real rates in the neighborhood—if you believe our inflation forecast—as high as these indexed   readings         May 7, 2002 67 of 81    You are right; Bob’s memo highlighted that it was unemployment   relative to the natural rate    No, actually we ran the same one    However, going forward in the forecast, Okun’s law relates the two,   so it doesn’t make a difference     June 25-26, 2002 112 of 179   Unemployment relative to the natural rate    No, the Bluebook simulation is exactly the same as the one Bob   presented    The penalty is our dirty little secret    It isn’t obvious why in a perfect foresight simulation we would   necessarily impose that the Committee cared about gradualism in setting rates    We do it for a couple of reasons  One is the characterization of   uncertainty Second, the model has a property that it gives us a small contemporaneous effect of   monetary policy  That is, if you change the funds rate this quarter, it will actually influence        June 25-26, 2002 113 of 179  output in this quarter That doesn’t seem credible  So gradualism has the effect of taking that   out Whether that is small, medium, or large, it was chosen so that we would get the historical   funds rate volatility    Right    We were using the same simulations  Now, Bob’s memo was written   a week before the Greenbook was finalized So, it must reflect either a change between the times   the two exercises were done or a different rounding convention    In fact, I think we did something similar to that with a different range    This analysis is basically a work in progress  I would say that we were influenced by the   reaction to the January 3, 2001, action, which was certainly not in the 5 basis points or less cell        June 25-26, 2002 114 of 179   We have ongoing research that involves looking at the different   measures of expectations  And it does turn out, whether you use the federal funds futures, the   Eurodollar, or a term structure that you can tweak these numbers a little bit     Mr Chairman, one way to look at it would be the credit defaults swap   spread for GE Capital—this is for five-year protection against default—which is 75 basis points   versus 290 for GMAC and 455 for Ford Motor Credit  It did rise, however, about 15 basis points   over the intermeeting period  But in comparison, the Ford Motor Credit spread rose 265 basis   points over that period    Mr Chairman, one other aspect that was talked about at that time was   the financial strength of the parent There were a number of stories about GM particularly and   the unfunded pension liabilities associated with the declines in equity prices  So it’s also   possible that that could have affected investor sentiment toward those companies, independently   of what they sell            August 13, 2002 9 of 92   Also, Governor Bies, July was the first month in which commercial   paper outstanding increased this year One important reason was that there have been large   inflows to money market mutual funds and the fund managers had to invest those dollars   somewhere  So probably on the margin that made commercial paper a little more attractive    Yes, July was the first monthly increase in nonfinancial commercial   paper this year    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Talk about the dog days of  summer Over the intermeeting period, share prices rode a roller coaster that left  equity investors 7¾ percent less wealthy, key emerging financial markets flared,  rumors of funding difficulties at several large intermediaries surfaced, and incoming  indicators suggested that employment and spending growth had softened  It is  beyond my ability to explain why financial markets were so volatile over the  intermeeting period  However, I believe that three threads of the complete story bear  upon your policy deliberations today   First, as David related at the beginning and virtually every other speaker around  the table reinforced, the economic news, especially of recent vintage, proved  disappointing But, second, those economic data were more of a surprise to market  participants than they were to us  At the time of your first meeting in 2002, market  forecasts of aggregate demand and its implicit balance with aggregate supply were  such that the federal funds rate was expected to be 2 percent by now and to move up  to 4½ percent by the end of next year In the time since, the structure of expected  policy rates up to the end of next year has shifted down as much as 2¼ percentage  points One question is whether, in the process of adjusting their outsized forecasts of  economic activity and the attendant policy response, market participants have  undershot the mark as much as they overshot it in January   What was a surprise to us—and to virtually all other observers—was the  amplitude of the swings in financial markets  On six out of ten days during the  intermeeting period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved more than 100 points   At their nadir, broad share indexes were 20 percent below their June 25 levels but  now have rolled back almost two-thirds of those losses in a couple of weeks  This  leads to my third observation  To some extent, market dynamics feed upon  themselves  One mechanism in that process is the unfortunate tendency for large  swings in prices to expose weaknesses on some balance sheets  In the 1994-95  episode of a substantial runup in long-term yields, a few mortgage-backed hedge  funds and a county treasury of note were found to have feet of clay  In 1998, the  losses came from a hedge fund that was even more noteworthy  This time around, a  less receptive capital market showed that some firms in the energy trading and  telecom industries were not much more than Potemkin villages, hiding hollowed  balance sheets behind the glitz History suggests that there is a natural cycle of recoil,  recrimination, regulatory response with a lag, and relapse over the long run  With                        August 13, 2002 67 of 92  investors apparently still in the recoiling stage, the staff projects in the Greenbook  considerably lower equity wealth over the next year and a half than in the last  forecast   The disappointing economic data, the loss in equity wealth, and a tightening of  credit markets imply that the expansion has lost some traction in the second half of  this year But as these effects on the level of demand dissipate, the economy should  recover to a growth rate just a bit above that of potential output  As a result, the staff  is forecasting that more resources go unused for some time but that the extra slack  helps to hold inflation around its current level   Compared with the forecast in the June Greenbook, these outcomes are likely to  be less appealing to you in furthering the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate  But you  might still elect to keep the federal funds rate at 1¾ percent even if you thought the  staff outlook was the most likely to materialize  In particular, your perception of the  lags of monetary policy may be such that action at this meeting would not materially  influence economic growth over the balance of this year  That is, today’s setting of  the policy rate would mostly shape economic performance in 2003 and beyond  And  while there is a weaker demand component to the staff’s revision to next year’s  outlook, a significant portion reflects a reassessment of the growth of aggregate  supply that you might view as outside the scope of your influence   Moreover, you might have reason to believe spending will revive more forcefully  than in the staff forecast  Households have proven remarkably resilient over the past  two years and may do so again, a notion supported by continued strong auto sales   With a real federal funds rate close to zero, policy has provided forward thrust to the  real estate sector and has facilitated the ongoing extraction of owners’ equity,  evidenced in part by another wave of refinancing that seems not yet to have crested   The hesitancy of firms to hire and to invest may be due, in part, to elevated  uncertainty in financial markets  But if the deadline for executives to certify their  corporate reports passes without any major fireworks, perhaps that sense of  uncertainty will ebb and the advance of employment and capital spending will regain  vigor Indeed, the nearness of that date when uncertainty might be considerably  reduced may further recommend a policy of watchful waiting to the Committee for its  meeting today   The case for policy ease at this meeting would seem to rest on the sense either that  the staff’s outlook has it about right but the slow pace at which slack is whittled down  is unacceptable, given inflation holding steady, or that there are significant prospects  that outcomes could lean toward weaker aggregate demand and lower inflation than  in the Greenbook As to the former, the perfect foresight simulations reported in the  Bluebook accept the staff’s assessment of near-term developments and the FRB/US  model’s specification of behavior with complete conviction  Within that framework,  policymakers desirous of smoothing employment and output gaps would ease policy  soon—even if the inflation goal were as low as 1 percent  In that exercise, a little  more than ¼ percentage point ease would trim a few tenths off the unemployment                              August 13, 2002 68 of 92  rate while still putting inflation on a course that drifts lower  An inflation goal of  1½ percent could accommodate more-substantial easing now while moving the  unemployment rate down to 4¾ percent in the transition to its long-run equilibrium   These exercises, of course, convey a false precision about our understanding of the  workings of the economy or your ability to use policy to shape outcomes  But the  general message is also conveyed by the decline in most measures of the equilibrium  real federal funds rate reported in the Bluebook   Also arguing for easing policy at this meeting, the Committee might believe that  the staff was too tentative in reassessing the forces determining inflation  The sense  of heightened uncertainty, lessened earnings prospects, and withdrawal from risk- taking evident in the substantial declines in equity prices could also surface as  unusual restraint on the spending decisions of households and businesses in coming  quarters As Karen noted, the ongoing travails of key emerging markets also have the  potential for reducing demands for US goods  And the revisions to the path of  productivity now seem to accord a greater role to a reduced natural rate of  unemployment in explaining the good performance of inflation  If the natural rate of  unemployment is, in fact, south of the staff’s new estimate of 5 percent, even more  disinflation may be in store than along the Greenbook baseline  Such further  disinflation would erode the inflation cushion the Committee has to put real interest  rates sufficiently into negative territory at some later date if events warrant   As gauged by money market futures rates, the federal funds rate is now expected  to drop below 1½ percent later this year  Thus, viewed from financial markets, the  question is not if the Committee will ease but when  And the answer from those  markets apparently is not now but soon, in that recent surveys indicate that the modal  outcome for this meeting is that you’ll keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent  So as long  as you do not disabuse market participants of your willingness to ease policy if the  situation warrants in coming months, the economy will benefit from the expectation  of imminent ease—that is, from lower capital market yields  If events over the  coming intermeeting period call for an easing move, the Committee can confirm  those policy expectations at the next meeting—or sometime sooner if necessary—to  preserve prevailing financial conditions  If the current run of subdued economic  reports gives way to a pattern more consistent with sustainable economic expansion  and markets settle down, investors will roll back that putative easing in coming weeks  of their own accord   From this perspective, if you keep the federal funds rate unchanged, your decision  on the balance of risks depends on whether you share the assessment of risks apparent  in the markets  The retention of balanced risks to the Committee’s dual objectives  would work to send the message that it believes that market participants had swung  too much from their over-optimistic mood of the spring  Recent surveys and the  configuration of futures rates is consistent with significant probability weight massed  on a more accommodative message, so short- and long-term rates would back up  some if that proved not to be the case  If so, equity prices would soften                       August 13, 2002 69 of 92  If the Committee’s assessment is that the tail of adverse outcomes has fattened  sufficiently, switching to a balance of risks weighted toward economic weakness  would both more accurately convey that sense and likely encourage asset markets to  continue to support economic growth  Short- and long-term interest rates would  probably edge lower, and a bounce-up in equity prices would probably be in store   While there is a risk that market participants would interpret the switch to unbalanced  risks as evidence of the Committee’s doubts about economic growth going forward,  that could be mitigated by emphasizing in the press release that the economy is  expected to continue to expand    Well, the Taylor rule is supposed to be in part descriptive of policy   decisions That is, the parameters were fit to explain a good part of the 1990s  So in that sense   the Taylor rule is consistent with what the Committee has done in the past  The important piece   of information that the Taylor rule doesn’t have but the perfect foresight simulations do have is   the intercept—that is, r*  This particular picture has a real interest rate of 2½ percent  Well, if   you turn to chart 5 in the Bluebook, you see that just about all the model-based estimates of the   equilibrium funds rate are below that  So it wouldn’t take much shifting down of that intercept   in the Taylor rule to make them consistent    Mr Chairman, I just wanted to point out that August 14 is the   deadline for corporations’ SEC filings and today, August 13, is the deadline for your filings   regarding special topics for the January 2003 meeting    My goal would be to distribute a memo to the Committee on Monday   that lists the results of your returns  So there’s still a little time to come in under the wire     By our estimates, Mr Chairman, the foreign holdings of US   currency have fallen rather sharply over the last couple of months  Just for background, in 2000   and 2001 foreign holdings were growing at a clip of about 9 percent  Our estimates are that in   July their growth was around 8½ percent, and then it slowed to 4 percent in August and actually   has contracted in September thus far    In terms of the direction, it’s a variety of regions     Domestic currency growth is around 4 percent    The uncomfortable one is that domestic currency is   contemporaneously correlated with spending    The domestic component of currency is correlated with   contemporaneous spending  The correlation is not particularly high though    I hesitate to give you a number, but we certainly will     Actually, Mr Chairman, in terms of a staff model of currency the r   squared is around ½, and it’s highly correlated with nominal PCE with a significant t statistic   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to start with an  observation about the market reaction to the announcement after your August  meeting, using the materials that were just distributed  At that meeting, some  members stated a preference to retain an assessment of balanced risks as to your dual  objectives on the concern that market participants would read a shift toward economic  weakness as signaling an intention to ease imminently  In the event, as shown in the  upper left panel of your first exhibit, our estimate of the path of the federal funds rate  expected by investors shifted up a tad in the near term immediately after the release  of the decision Apparently, market participants interpreted the decision as evidence  of a reluctance to ease soon  But this apparent reluctance, the switch in the risk  assessment, and the associated words, against a backdrop of declining equity prices,  seemed to suggest a downward revision to the economic outlook consistent with the  federal funds rate being 20 basis points lower over the next two years than previously  anticipated   Most market yields—such as the ten-year Treasury yield in the middle left panel   —trended lower in subsequent weeks This movement is hard to square with    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                    September 24, 2002 75 of 115  economic data releases, which were mostly mixed  One way to quantify this is to  compare what happened with what would have happened had markets reacted to the  surprise component of those releases as they had on average over the prior ten years   I’ve marked the major data releases by vertical lines in the panel, measured their  element of surprise as the actual value less the expectation as surveyed by Money  Market Services on the preceding Friday, and estimated the average response with a  regression using the experience over the prior ten years  As noted in the middle right  panel, the estimated contribution of macroeconomic data to the change in the ten-year  Treasury yield over the past six weeks nets to about zero   That is pretty much how the staff reacted to the data, in that the outlook presented  in the most recent Greenbook does not differ materially from what you saw in  August One possibility explaining the 50 basis point drop in the ten-year Treasury  yield is that other events intruded, including warnings on earnings that further  deflated equity values, elevated concerns about another war in the Gulf that prompted  a bit of a flight to safety, and heightened mortgage-related hedging flows that Dino  mentioned  Another possibility, though, is that your policy choice at the August  meeting, amplified by subsequent public statements, sensitized market participants to  the potential for slower growth in spending and production going forward than  previously expected   While the near-term economic outlook was about unchanged over the  intermeeting period, you also received information in the Greenbook about the  anticipated performance of the economy over a longer period  In that first look at  2004, the unemployment rate ends that year about where it is right now—  ¾ percentage point above where the staff presently puts the natural rate of  unemployment  In the interim, the unemployment rate is projected to rise a bit from  its current level, a prospect that you might find likely given the stubbornly high level  of initial claims for unemployment insurance  As a result, the Greenbook poses the  possibility of the unemployment rate averaging close to 6 percent over the next  2¼ years   The “policymaker perfect foresight” simulations reported in the Bluebook and  repeated as your next exhibit offer potential paths for the funds rate that make more- substantial inroads into resource slack than in the Greenbook  To be specific, these  simulations take the staff outlook and the FRB/US model as assured representations  of how the world will evolve over the next five years and assume that policymakers  care equally about deviations of unemployment from its natural rate and core inflation  from an assumed target  Even with a penalty placed on changing the funds rate, the  perfect foresight policymaker embarks quickly on a path that sends the real funds rate  deeply negative by the end of this year—whether the inflation goal is 1 or 1½ percent   Much as in these simulations, you might view easing policy ¼ or ½ percentage point  at this meeting as taking the opportunity provided by the ongoing favorable inflation  environment to ensure more-solid growth of aggregate demand with an eye toward  making more progress in fostering employment gains                     September 24, 2002 76 of 115  Policy ease at this time could find additional favor for two key reasons  In  particular, the Committee may harbor concerns about the sustainability of the  economic expansion  In the staff forecast, household spending is expected to flag  sometime soon as the allure of buying still more cars and SUVs fades as incentives  become less generous  Real activity continues to expand despite this rough patch  because firms are anticipated to pick up their spending on capital goods and to rebuild  their inventory stocks In an environment of heightened risk aversion, businesses  may not be quite that willing to step into the breach  Moreover, economic growth has  cooled in many of our key trading partners, and you may have doubts about whether  policymakers abroad will have the willingness or ability to offset this weakness if it  should intensify   Policy ease might also be warranted if the Committee found the Greenbook too  pessimistic on an important aspect of economic performance  The staff has explained  the good output-per-hour performance of the past few quarters as actual productivity  drifting further above an unchanged trend of structural productivity  If, as noted in an  alternative simulation in the Greenbook, the staff has been too cautious on that score  and the trend line has in fact rotated up, core PCE inflation may be headed south of  1 percent by year-end 2004, potentially below the range many of you would define as  price stability This might be particularly worrying if you take the decline in some  measures of longer-term inflation expectations over the intermeeting period as  evidence that markets have put more weight on that possibility as well   Although simulations such as the ones on this exhibit might be taken to support a  move of either ¼ or ½ percentage point at this meeting, there is obviously a lot more  that has to enter your deliberations than the mechanical application of a model  In  particular, market participants will read what you do and say closely for signals on  your assessment of economic prospects  In the current situation, it may well be the  case that the stimulative effect of lowering interest rates would be offset some if that  action were accompanied by the retention of a statement that the risks remained tilted  toward economic weakness  If so, this might incline the Committee—if it thought  easing were appropriate—toward a larger move rather than a smaller one to allow it  to assert more credibly that the risks were balanced  An unfortunate aspect of this  sort of interaction between the decision on the funds rate and on the balance-of-risks  assessment is that it may make modest policy adjustments more difficult to  accomplish at this stage in the policy cycle  One potential way to ensure that the  policy process remains flexible is to consider the possibility of an intermeeting move  should incoming information indicate that spending was losing momentum or  geopolitical events turn adverse   But your outlook may be such that policy ease of any magnitude would be judged  to be inappropriate at this time  Making the case for keeping the funds rate at  1¾ percent at this meeting can be accomplished by listing what was wrong or omitted  in my discussion of the policymaker perfect foresight simulation—and some of you  may believe that is a long list indeed  But whatever its length, the list has two                    September 24, 2002 77 of 115  subheadings  inadequacies of the process itself and problems with its maintained  assumptions   As to the former, the process of calculating an optimal path for the funds rate  using the FRB/US model may lend itself to recommending excessive fine-tuning of  the economy for two fundamental reasons  For one, the model has the property that  US monetary policy has a small, but discernible, near-term effect on spending while  inflation depends on a long cumulation of output gaps  This offers policymakers the  opportunity to vary short-term interest rates at a high frequency to shape the near- term dynamics of spending without giving up much on inflation in the longer term   You may assess the ability of policy to affect aggregate demand over the current and  next couple of quarters to be much smaller than the point estimates in these numbers   For another, these model simulations are done under complete certainty, suggesting a  degree of confidence in the channels of policy that you are unlikely to share  In the  current circumstances, the Committee may be particularly unsure as to how financial  markets will react to any policy surprise  In the presence of this kind of uncertainty  about the policy multiplier, the Committee might want to shade its desired policy  setting toward that which will not surprise markets  With investors counting on  policy staying on hold, this would counsel inaction at this meeting   But the Committee may also favor keeping policy on hold because its outlook  differs from that conditioning the simulations I’ve been discussing  As shown in your  final exhibit, the real federal funds rate already lies below zero, and the gap from  most estimates of its equilibrium value remains substantial  While survey measures  of consumer confidence have moved lower, households have been avid buyers of big- ticket items, perhaps suggesting their spirits are undimmed  Additionally, the  Committee might be concerned that any additional policy impetus would flow  through a relatively narrow channel, feeding the recent rapid rise in home prices and  further encouraging households to stretch their balance sheets  While this might  support topline GDP for a time, it might also create imbalances that will pose  problems down the road  This, of course, is not a new tension in policymaking  By  definition, interest-rate-sensitive sectors bear the brunt of adjustments in interest  rates   With the outlook about unchanged, holding the funds rate at 1¾ percent would  seem to be consistent with retaining the balance-of-risk assessment tilted toward  economic weakness, especially considering what appears to be low odds of a pickup  in inflation in the foreseeable future  While it is true that two dates that caused  concern ex ante—the August 14 recertification deadline and the September 11  anniversary—proved uneventful ex post, enough in the world remains uncertain to  justify that judgment  Indeed, markets remain skittish, the potential for military  action in Iraq seems significant, and the threat of terrorist attack at home was raised to  “high” since you last met           September 24, 2002 78 of 115   The direction of the policy they would prefer    2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the materials  that were distributed to you during the coffee break  As has been true at the past few  Committee meetings and as shown in the top right-hand panel of your first exhibit,  market participants expect the federal funds rate to turn a bit lower before moving up  in the summer of next year The nadir of the expected path of the federal funds rate is  now a touch lower than in August and September (the left-hand and middle panels),  although the funds rate ultimately rises to a level that is about the same as was  anticipated six weeks ago  The current situation is unlike that in advance of those  previous meetings in another respect, as seen in the middle panels, by the evolution of  an estimate of the probability of a ¼ percentage point move as derived from the front- month money market futures contract  At last night’s close, financial market prices  were consistent with a high probability of action today   Indeed, as seen in the first two columns of the table at the bottom of the exhibit in  the summary of the Money Market Services Survey of policy expectations released  on Friday, twenty-five of the thirty-six respondents expect policy easing, with fifteen  anticipating a cut of 25 basis points and ten looking for a 50 basis point move   Apparently regardless of the rate action, market participants expect you to retain an  assessment of risks balanced toward economic weakness  Moving further ahead, the  majority of respondents expect the funds rate to be at least as low as 1¼ percent in  late January, with the balance of risks still pointing toward economic weakness   Thus, the case for holding the funds rate at 1¾ percent today must recognize that,  as President Broaddus noted, some market disappointment would attend the  announcement of that decision  But you might be willing to accept that reaction  As  shown in your next exhibit, your aggressive policy actions in 2001 moved the real  federal funds rate, the dark line in the upper panel, from around 4¾ percent at the  beginning of the year, to about zero by year-end, where it has been held since   Although estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, represented by the  swath of blue in the figure, have also moved down, you’ve kept the real rate below  the lower bound of that range The red line amid the blue plots one particular  estimate, the FRB/US model’s view of the real short rate ultimately consistent with  sending aggregate demand to the level of potential output  The spread of the actual  real rate below this estimated equilibrium concept has been sizable for some time   Indeed, the bottom panel cumulates the effect of that wedge on the quarterly growth  of real GDP (at an annual rate), taking into account the model’s assessment of the  lags in monetary policy  According to those estimates, monetary policy stimulus  began to kick in only by the middle of last year, as policy easing was initially only  offsetting the cumulative effect of the real rate running above its equilibrium value  for much of the second half of the 1990s  The staff model would suggest that policy  easing thus far has been adding about 1¾ percentage points to real GDP growth this  year Given the lags in policy, the Committee’s prior actions will continue to impart  sizable, albeit waning, impetus over the forecast period   2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                        November 6, 2002 76 of 122  You may not be troubled by the assessment that the stimulus to growth of your  previous actions will erode if you also believe that the forces currently restraining  spending, including the lagged effect of earlier declines in equity wealth, credit  stringency both in markets and at banks, and the enervating effects of elevated  uncertainty on household and business confidence, will be lifting relatively quickly   In those circumstances, the current degree of policy accommodation would facilitate a  return of the growth of aggregate demand to that of potential output in short order   But that is not the staff forecast, in which events turn a bit gloomier before that  rebound in growth materializes   A mechanical way of responding to that near-term soft patch is offered in the  Bluebook in the policymaker perfect foresight simulations, repeated as your next  exhibit In this exercise, the FRB/US model with the extended Greenbook  assumptions is taken to be a complete, unerring description of the US economy  As  shown in the two upper panels, these simulations entail easing aggressively over the  next half year—and then tightening almost as quickly—to work down the resource  slack evident in the unemployment rate plotted in the middle panel  By these  calculations, policy ease would be called for even if your implicit inflation target was  1 percent (the red lines), let alone the 1½ percent goal depicted by the green lines   Indeed, in this framework, policy ease is necessary to prevent inflation from edging  below 1 percent, which might otherwise make the conventional estimate of the mean  bias in the PCE inflation rate of 2 percent loom particularly large  Given the concerns  expressed at recent meetings of the potential problems posed, should future adverse  shocks necessitate putting the real federal funds rate deeply into negative territory, the  Committee might have a preference for more of an inflation cushion than that   If you were inclined to do so, the extent to which you might ease probably  interacts with how you would assess the balance of risks at that new stance of policy,  the subject of your final exhibit At the top of the exhibit, I’ve listed how the  Committee described its disclosure policy when it was introduced in January 2000   As noted in the first bullet, the Committee has promised that its statement will  express its “sense of risks to the attainment of its long-run goals of stable prices and  sustainable economic growth”  However, as in the second bullet, that attainment is  assessed over the “foreseeable future,” admittedly an elastic concept about a  “relevant” period that may depend on economic conditions   A complication that several members have noted at the past few meetings is that  the balance of risks assessment has the potential to influence investors’ confidence in  the economic outlook as well as their expectations of policy  If so, you might be  concerned that a policy action deemed insufficiently stimulative to balance the risks  might be undercut by an adverse reaction to the policy statement  This interaction of  words and action makes it difficult to build the case for easing 25 basis points in that,  if you shared the staff’s assessment that economic momentum had flagged, such a  move would not likely put the perceived risks back into balance  It would only be if  you viewed the outlook as having deteriorated a bit—but not as much as in the                             November 6, 2002 77 of 122  Greenbook—that you might see 25 basis points of “insurance” as fostering a better  balance to the risks   Given the staff’s assessment of the economy, you might see a 50 basis point move  as a closer call on balancing the risks By way of example, the lower left panels give  the FRB/US model’s prediction of what would happen to real GDP growth, the  unemployment rate, and core PCE inflation were you to lower the funds rate 50 basis  points at this meeting and hold it at that level thereafter  This is the “lower funds  rate” alternative of the Greenbook, where the blue bars give the alternative results and  the red line depicts the baseline outcomes  As indicated in the box at the right, even  after ½ point of ease, the Committee might indicate that the risks were still tilted  toward weakness because in the near term—that is, before any effects of action today  would plausibly leave an imprint on the economy—resource slack builds  Moreover,  the uncertainty surrounding the forecast might seem to weigh particularly heavily on  the downside   However, as noted at the lower right, the Committee might put particular weight  on the observation that, after policy action, aggregate demand is expected to expand  considerably faster than aggregate supply in the second half of 2003 and in 2004, an  outcome that might be seen to offset the prospect of declining core inflation if the  “foreseeable future” stretches sufficiently far     It is also possible that the Committee might view action today as better balancing  the odds of its own future action, despite whether it saw the macroeconomic  consequences of an adverse outcome for spending as worse than would attend a  positive surprise  That is, easing today might make it a coin toss as to whether the  next move was up or down  Such an interpretation of the risk assessment, though,  might not be seen as progress in your disclosure policy  Three years ago, the  Committee abandoned the old “tilt” in the directive because it had become too rigidly  interpreted in markets as a signal on the next policy action  That completes my  prepared remarks    As I stated, there are two roles for the balance of risks statement  One   is as an indication on the course of the economy, and the other is an indication of the likely   prospects for policy over the foreseeable future To the extent that markets focus on the latter   and see the risks tilted toward weakness as raising the odds of action in December, then a cut of   25 basis points at this meeting with an unbalanced risk statement is going to get them to price in   significant odds of an additional 25 fairly shortly     From a macro standpoint, if the funds rate is 50 basis points lower by   December 10, it’s not going to make a whole lot of difference if it got there in one step or in two    But there is the first role for the balance of risks statement that I mentioned as well, which a few   members have emphasized over the last couple of meetings, and that is, What will it do to   business and investor confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee lowered rates but still   sees the risks tilted toward economic weakness?  You have to balance the two off      Well, it might be more efficient to have this discussion over lunch      That will be an FOMC discussion, however    We don’t close the meeting   [Brief recess]    Let me conclude the staff portion of these remarks by  explaining what Dino and I hope to get from the Committee this afternoon  Basically,  we’d like your advice on what portions of five different items you want us to continue  to work on and what time frame, if you do want us to work on them, you think would  be reasonable  Specifically, we’re asking whether you want additional study on  (1) purchasing outright mortgage-backed securities underwritten by Ginnie Mae;  (2) acquiring foreign sovereign securities as collateral for temporary dollar  transactions; (3) developing an auction credit facility to complement Desk operations;  and (4) using an auction credit facility to substitute for Desk operations in an  emergency    The fifth item concerns the publication of the materials that the staff presented to  the Committee in January 2001  As you recall, at that time there was a desire to get  those materials into the public domain to inform both the academic and the  investment communities about the options the Committee was looking at  In  addition, it seemed desirable to have those in academia and the markets think harder  about the issues the System should consider in determining what to put on the books  of the System Open Market Account So the fifth item we’re asking for is approval to  publish this staff study in the upcoming intermeeting period once final edits are  completed  We’re not seeking a vote, as this study is not an official document of the  Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve Board, or Federal Reserve  Banks We intend to include a foreword to the document that will make that explicit   The foreword will also include an explanation that the study is a historical document  that represents what we understood in January 2001 and has not been updated  That  needs to be said in part because of—and the Committee hasn’t discussed them—some  procedural changes that have evolved since then, including importantly the adoption  of the Lombard facility  If you have any particular advice about what else should be  in that foreword, we’d appreciate having it  In summary, those are the issues on  which Dino and I would like to get your views today      Right We can include that in the foreword and also in the first   footnote to the ACF discussion in the study itself    We have more than sufficient direction, Mr Chairman  [Laughter]    I would suggest that Dino and I go back and look at the transcript of   this discussion [laughter] and solve that problem  One thing that’s clear is that Dino will be   studying the options associated with acquiring Ginnie Maes and then we’ll get back to the   Committee to—     From what I heard, and I hope Dino agrees, the Committee has taken   off the table accepting foreign sovereign debt as collateral at this time; and has also taken off the   table a contingency ACF The first order of priority, in terms of staff study, is acquiring Ginnie   Maes outright in the portfolio And you’re deferring to our judgment the issue of when resources   are available for further study of an ACF  The sequence may very well be that we will come   back to the Committee with a document about Ginnie Maes and ask at that time what you would   like to hear about an ACF     As you noted, President Poole, M3 has been growing very rapidly    It’s on track for something like a 19½ percent rate of growth in November That is accounted for   mostly by the growth in money funds, which probably expanded at a rate of about 80 percent last   month That in turn is a direct result of the policy easing and the historical accounting in money   funds They pay the average return on their assets  When short-term market rates fell with the                  December 10, 2002 18 of 87  ½ point policy easing at the beginning of the month, investors rushed in to extract some of those   capital gains We think that pretty much has played out    A lot of them would involve some substitution from RPs in particular    But we think that, on net, there is some attraction from other sources of funds into M3    Not in particular, no       Actually, Brian Madigan will give the monetary policy briefing    I think one could also say that the mechanical application of the   policy made under a perfect foresight rule suggests perhaps more confidence in the exact         December 10, 2002 72 of 87  structure of FRB/US than anybody around the table actually has  In particular, one property it   has is the ability for monetary policy to have an almost contemporaneous effect—a one-quarter   effect—on real activity Therefore, it does lend itself to a policy involving sharp changes in the   funds rate That’s why we have to put in a penalty for smoothing the funds rate  So I think the   staff is in the position of not knowing your objective function nor knowing the median structure   of the US economy that would together form  the optimal policy path  The interest rate   assumption just tries to smooth through some of those problems    I just wanted to note that by our next scheduled meeting, the Federal   Reserve System will have in place a new discount window facility  As the Lombard facility has   been thirty years in the making, I wanted to remind the Presidents that the Reserve Banks should   indicate to Jennifer Johnson by this Friday how they intend to set the initial penalty rate  We do   want this to get started the right way            December 10, 2002 77 of 87   January 28 and 29      You can ask a question whenever you want to, Mr Chairman  But   our intention was to take questions at the end of the presentations     Yes, that is certainly the case  That is why we thought we’d run them   all together, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, you may recall the paper that Christine and David   Romer presented at the most recent Jackson Hole conference, in which they characterized the   process as one of learning, forgetting, and then relearning  The thing that is most unstable about   the Taylor rules, as Glenn mentioned, is the inflation target  It’s very hard to explain the setting   of interest rates in the 1990s and today if we use estimates from the 1970s or the first part of the   1980s because the background inflation rate was just so much higher in those earlier years  A   distinction that’s also important to make is whether one is estimating the rule on the data as we   know it now or the real-time data  That can make a difference  It’s a factor in how stark the   differences are among decade-long estimates of the Taylor rule, for instance         Governor Gramlich, before you leave the topic with the sense that the   distinction between the people sitting on the two sides of the table is that stark, Brian has done   some work estimating policy rules in which he allows a serially correlated error in addition to the   lagged dependent variable  I would ask him to comment on what happens then     The other point, Governor Bernanke, is that in the cottage industry of   estimating event-study regressions—which might be another place we could look to see how far   a given monetary policy surprise gets transmitted through the term structure of interest rates—we   get the same sort of results we get in the time series test of term structure expectations  That is,   the predictable effects of policy on interest rates die off pretty quickly  In other words, it’s the   front end of the forward curve that is usually influenced by a policy surprise; and at the longer   end, the forward rates go down      Let me make just one point, President Broaddus, which goes back to   how this conversation started a while ago  The Chairman asked Brian what the R² was in this   exhibit on changes, and the answer was 04  There is plenty of unexplained variation  It’s going   to take a while before market participants decide that the rule has changed just because there are   January 28-29, 2003 53 of 195    a couple of runs in which a policy action is unexpected  In part it also depends on how   policymakers explain what they do in the manner that Governor Ferguson and President Poole   talked about  If it can be described as a change in r* credibly linked to events, then it’s not   obvious that a change in the direction of policy is a policy reversal in the underlying sense     As you know, Governor Ferguson, and as Dino noted, these spreads   move around a good deal  We’re struck by the fact that they’ve come down of late, but they’ve   January 28-29, 2003 67 of 195    come down from an unusually high peak  The high-yield spreads bottomed out, as Dino said, in   the neighborhood of 240 basis points at a time when we think risk aversion was unusually low   and investors were too willing to take on risk—at the end of 1997  Subsequently they rose about   800 basis points and in recent months have come off a couple hundred basis points, as you see   here     In fact, if you want an even more evocative comparison than that, the   last time the spreads were there before then was in 1990       The other form of substitution that firms used at that time, Governor   Bies, was to run down liquid assets  In the flow of funds accounts we see a big decline in liquid   assets     We’ve found over the last couple of years that inflation compensation   inferred from the indexed debt is very sensitive to oil prices—a little oversensitive  So we can   explain part of that by the run-up in oil prices     4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that are being handed out  One of the more difficult aspects of putting together the  materials supporting your policy discussion was reconciling the divergent movements  of key financial asset prices over the intermeeting period  The first exhibit reviews  those tensions, not because I’m fishing for sympathy but because it bears on today’s  deliberations  The financial developments I am most confident in explaining are  plotted in the top portion of the exhibit  As evidenced by the most recent path of the  expected federal funds rate inferred from futures quotes (the black line), market  participants do not expect a policy change to be announced this afternoon  Mixed  economic data, a pall cast by gloomy corporate earnings guidance, and concerns  about a conflict with Iraq led investors to push back the anticipated start of policy  firming until year-end  Surveys suggest that, as noted in the middle row in the table  at the right, market participants are mostly of the view that you will assess the risks to  your goals as still balanced  The sense that policy will be on hold for longer than  previously expected pulled Treasury yields lower, with most of the decline, as shown  in the middle left panel, attributable to lower forward rates at the front end of the  yield curve  In addition to a downward revision to the near-term outlook associated                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   January 28-29, 2003 143 of 195    with worries about global tensions, Treasury yields may have benefited from flight- to-quality demands, in that other indicators of skittishness, such as gold and oil prices,  rose as well (the middle portion of the chart)  Such relative shifts might help to  explain why major equity indexes, at the far right, shed 3 to 5 percent over the  intermeeting period, with those losses mounting in recent days       The chief puzzle is that corporate bond risk spreads have narrowed considerably,   particularly for the riskiest credits (the black line in the bottom left panel)  Even so,  as President Minehan noted yesterday, a longer perspective shows that spreads remain  on the high side of the experience of the past dozen years  Moreover, to an important  extent compositional effects matter, shown in the inset by the fact that excluding the  telecom and energy sectors spreads have narrowed by far less  This increase in the  relative price of risky debt instruments, even as investors otherwise moved to safety  and liquidity, may be evidence that an unusual and overdone pessimism about default  and recovery rates on corporate debt, inflamed by revelations of corporate  wrongdoing, is in the process of unwinding  Associated improvements in the  liquidity of the markets where those securities trade have probably also whetted  investors’ risk appetites     With markets more receptive to corporate debt, firms should be able to fund new   capital projects—when they shake their reluctance to spend  That hesitancy appears  to be due to elevated worries about the world situation, but implicit in the  configuration of market prices must be the average expectation that these tensions  will abate starting sometime soon  If not, it is hard to understand why futures market  quotes have oil prices moving lower and the Committee beginning to tighten, albeit  not by much, by year-end  This is one of the observations made in the box in the  Bluebook on geopolitical tensions and monetary policy  Namely, your outlook, to the  extent that it anticipates some reversion nearer to normalcy in interest rate spreads, oil  prices, and business hiring and spending decisions, implicitly must incorporate at a  least a partial unwinding of global tensions  Moreover, you’ve adjusted policy  already to offset at least some of the restraint imposed on spending by those tensions  in the interim—by lowering the federal funds rate to 1¼ percent     I’d like to repeat two more observations from the Bluebook but recast them in   light of yesterday’s discussion  For one, restraint on spending, as households and  businesses view deferring purchases as a more attractive option at a time of elevated  volatility, would seem to be an adverse additive shock to aggregate demand  All of  our modeling efforts thus far advise that you should take your best guess as to the net  restraining effect on aggregate demand of such influences and try to offset them  For  another, though, some aspects of geopolitical tensions would seem—by making  investors more skittish and potentially complicating market dynamics—to make the  consequences for financial prices of your actions more unpredictable  If so, this  multiplier uncertainty would suggest that you should scale back the size of any  desired action in light of the wide range of potential outcomes      January 28-29, 2003 144 of 195    Committee members might be less optimistic than is implicit in markets about the  timing and the extent to which restraints on spending associated with geopolitical  tensions will lift  That would provide a reason to doubt the staff projection that the  economy will transit from about-unchanged real GDP last quarter to growth above  that of potential by the second half of this year  Such a position might incline you to  ease policy at this meeting  To be sure, it would come as a complete surprise to  market participants, but that very surprise would imply a more forceful transmission  of that policy impetus to the financial markets  The case for easing does not solely  rely on doubting the staff forecast     The policymaker perfect foresight simulations—shown on your next page, which   duplicates chart 4 from the Bluebook—take the staff assessment of the economy  completely on board, including both the structure of the FRB/US model and  projections of the forces impinging on the economy in the extended Greenbook  baseline  As President Parry already noted, the simulations suggest that there is some  scope to work down unused resources a bit faster in the near term by easing policy,  with virtually no risk to the attainment of what you may view to be a reasonable  inflation goal  Indeed, even a long-run target for core PCE inflation of 1 percent  would allow some scope for modest additional policy stimulus according to the  simulation  You might find that argument particularly persuasive if you saw inflation  of 1 percent at the low end of the range that you’d consider a working definition of  price stability        As the Committee devoted a considerable portion of yesterday discussing policy   gradualism, it is worth noting some of the limitations involved in this optimal  planning exercise, beyond the obvious one that FRB/US is only a rough  approximation of reality  In particular, in this simulation the reaction of economic  agents to your policy action is estimated from history—that is, the exercise uses the  version of the model with expectations following a vector autoregression  While the  funds rate is assumed to be as smooth as observed in the past, it is also varied more  aggressively in response to perceived resource slack than observed in the past  This  systematic difference between the way that investors mechanically anticipate how  you will conduct policy and how you actually do it may give a false impression of the  extent to which policy easing influences the economy—a point President Santomero  raised yesterday  The bottom line is that, among other problems with this exercise,  you might not get as tidy a financial market response as in the figure  Speaking  outside the model, this raises the issue of how market participants will react should  they read the action and the accompanying words as an implicit acknowledgment on  your part that economic prospects are darker than previously thought     Even given a strong desire to make more inroads in reducing resource slack, you   might not think it is within your ability to do much about the unemployment rate  edging up to 6¼ percent in the near term, given the lags in monetary policy and the  uncertainty attendant to how markets would react  Indeed, the staff has revised up  considerably its projection of economic growth in the second half of 2003 and all of  2004, the window in which your action today would mostly be felt  Moreover, the   January 28-29, 2003 145 of 195    Committee might believe sufficient monetary stimulus is in the pipeline to push  growth even beyond that pace as the forces currently impairing business confidence  abate and additional fiscal stimulus kicks in You might be influenced in that  judgment by the fact—as shown in your next exhibit, which repeats chart 3 from the  Bluebook—that the real federal funds rate has run considerably below its equilibrium  value over the past year     The outlook in the Greenbook and in the central tendency of your own projections   retains the contrast that has marked the previous few meetings  Decidedly subpar  economic performance is seen as giving way to a robust expansion in just a few  quarters  This suggests two ways of assessing the balance of risks surrounding your  current policy setting  First, are you satisfied with the temporal dimension of the  economic outcomes that your policy is projected to help foster?  That is, does your  distaste of the slow performance in the near term about balance your concern that the  expansion may pick up too much steam later this year and next?  This is the balance  that Governor Kohn was weighing in his remarks  Second, within the period of time  when you think the bulk of any action today would be felt, does the risk of some  further slippage in inflation—perhaps into an undesirable region—about match the  chance of growth running significantly faster than that of potential output?      As I’ve noted, market participants mostly believe that you will assess the risks to   your dual objectives to be about balanced, probably because they believe you are  answering the second question and balancing potential outcomes at some point in the  foreseeable future  For most forecasts, economic performance at that later date looks  a little more robust than seen previously, which would support retaining the  assessment that the risks are balanced  The minority of participants who are calling  for a switch back to risks unbalanced toward economic weakness probably think that  you’re answering the first question and comparing economic performance in the near  term with that in the longer term  They see the “soft spot” as a little softer and the  rebound to above-trend growth as a bit further removed in time  If the path were  graded solely by the measure of resource slack, you might judge that they had a case   Even though the staff has revised up its projection of the future growth of aggregate  demand, slack persists at a higher level for a while because aggregate supply also has  been revised up  Inclining you against changing the risk assessment, however, would  be a concern that the announcement of that shift would impair confidence and make  the outcomes you fear a little more likely        The other obvious factor, Mr Chairman, would be earnings growth    A willingness to run your book with a little less insurance might also be associated with efforts   to expand the overall size of the balance sheet and to increase earnings  In fact, Fannie’s   earnings growth has been faster than Freddie’s      The other point I’d make, Governor Bernanke, is that in the indexed   debt market in the United States, as the Chairman noted, the ten-year yield is down more than   1½ points over that same year  So we can’t rule out the possibility that what we’re seeing is a   shifting lower of world real interest rates   2  Mr Chairman, Carol will be distributing some materials  that I’ll be referring to  With events moving quickly, I thought it best to start with  the snapshot in exhibit 1 of market participants’ current thinking about the decision  you will announce this afternoon  As shown in the top panel, at ten o’clock this  morning the April federal funds rate futures contract traded 9 basis points below the  current 1¼ percent intended level, consistent with a one-in-three chance of a  quarter-point easing  Survey responses collected Friday (the middle left panel)  indicate that the majority of investors believe that you will depict the balance of  risks as tilted toward economic weakness, a shift in sentiment (the middle right  panel) that followed the release of a surprising contraction in payroll employment   You might not want to bank too much on these readings, though, in that  expectations have been changeable of late and are now quite diffuse, as shown in  the bottom panel in the implied probability distribution of where the funds rate will  be in six months  Note both that the left tail of this probability distribution is  bunched at quite low levels of the funds rate and that one-fifth of the mass rests  above the current intended rate     Among the market participants who are counting on policy easing, recent   readings on the labor market—both the February employment report and the high  level of initial claims—seem to weigh importantly in their thinking  Moreover,  with equity wealth once again lower and consumers appearing less confident, the  expansion of aggregate demand seems to be on a slower track than we had  anticipated earlier  The declines in estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds  rate, plotted in your next exhibit, summarize that downward reassessment of  spending relative to potential output  Indeed, by these measures, maintaining the  current stance of policy would imply some tightening of the real funds rate gap  relative to what you viewed as appropriate with your easing on November 6  Note  also that this assessment is not just a characteristic of the staff’s outlook and  empirical models (the shaded region), in that the reading of the equilibrium rate  derived from the indexed debt market (the thin line) also turned down  With  inflation also inching lower in the projection, the Committee might view the cost of  another 25 or 50 basis point easing as small given the stability of long-run inflation  expectations (the bottom panel) relative to the benefits of some stimulus to  aggregate demand     For all the focus on weakness in hiring and in confidence over the intermeeting   period, other data have been mixed and on net have led the staff to increase the  level of real GDP in this quarter and the next compared with the baseline presented  in January  Indeed, as shown in exhibit 3, two- and ten-year Treasury yields                                                    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)      March 18, 2003 69 of 101    actually rose in the half-hour windows surrounding the key data releases  represented by bars in the top left panel  That is, as the tally at the right indicates,  the reaction to macroeconomic news cannot account for the net movement in rates  since January 29     The sharp and sudden movement in asset prices at times over the past few   weeks on rumors of war may reveal the extent to which the current configuration of  financial market quotes is only loosely tethered to economic fundamentals  It  seems that uncertainties about war and the economy are leading spenders and  investors to defer commitments, but we have no way of parsing the relative  importance of those two sources of doubt  Market prices, though, appear consistent  with the overall amount of uncertainty abating over time  If not, it is hard to  understand why, as shown in the two middle panels, risk spreads on corporate  bonds narrowed over the intermeeting period—as Governor Bies mentioned—or  why options on swap forward rates and oil prices imply that volatilities are expected  to move lower, as shown in the bottom panels     Given this prevailing uncertainty and skittishness in the marketplace, the   Committee might be especially unsure as to how investors would react to policy  ease at this juncture  Going back to the transcripts from the onset of the Gulf War  in 1991, more than a few members doubted the efficacy of monetary policy action  in spurring spending when global events were in the driver’s seat  As the  discussion about policy gradualism at the last meeting underscored, such  uncertainties about the policy multiplier, all else being equal, would probably  incline you to attenuate action, perhaps to the point of keeping policy on hold at this  meeting  With conflict in Iraq seemingly at hand, this is one of the few times it  could be said that some aspects of uncertainty will lift with the passage of time— although to what degree and how soon are not obvious at this point      Deferring action might also be seen as having the advantage of allowing the   Committee to calibrate its action more precisely as additional information about  geopolitical developments emerges  Indeed, the Committee might want to be able  to use a significant portion of the current 125 basis points of room above the zero  bound in a timely fashion if events turn sufficiently adverse  While research  generally counsels that the presence of the zero bound makes acting preemptively  superior to arguments about “keeping your powder dry,” that body of work  measures time in quarters  With war seeming about to begin, you may be  measuring time in days or weeks, and it is difficult to imagine that a short delay  would leave a discernible imprint on economic activity  But the Committee might  view those darker possibilities as quite remote  Rather, the Committee may be  reading the substantial rally in financial markets when coalition troops commenced  the Gulf War in 1991 as the more likely outcome  If it is mainly worries about the  world that are making households and businesses hesitant to spend, then the  successful prosecution of war against Iraq should resolve some of their doubts and  provide important stimulus to spending  That said, the current situation may not be  nearly as neat as in 1991 in that concerns about geopolitical tensions might not be   March 18, 2003 70 of 101    punctured by decisive military victory, given questions about the formation of a  new government in Iraq, the prospect for terrorist actions, and adverse  developments in other trouble spots  If that seems farfetched, I’d remind you that  we are once again at code “orange,” indicating heightened risks at home       Your last exhibit, besides providing a rationale for keeping policy on hold,   addresses the issue of the balance of risks assessment  If the Committee believes  that the cloud of war worries will soon dissipate to reveal an economy that is  fundamentally sound, then it should indicate so by retaining its risk assessment as  balanced with respect to both of its goals (the top left panel)  The Committee might  also opt for a balanced risk assessment if it feared that a change would convey more  conviction to market participants about the outlook than it actually had  If instead,  more weight were given to the downbeat economic data of late and the forecast that  inflation would move lower still from its already low level, the Committee might  favor a risk assessment weighted toward economic weakness (the top right panel)   According to the survey evidence, this outcome best matches investor expectations,  suggesting that it should be preferred if the goal is not to test the market’s resilience  to surprise  Still, such a shift might be read by the broader public as suggesting that  the near-term outlook was weaker than feared, a message that might be problematic  in a nation on a war footing  In fact, the public’s focus has shifted to a different  stage, and in light of the unusual uncertainties, what the Committee does and says  today is unlikely to be extrapolated too far into the future       The broader problem the Committee faces is whether it can usefully   characterize the balance of risks in an environment of such diffuse uncertainty   This is territory that Frank Knight trod eighty-seven years ago  As he noted then  and as is repeated in the middle panel, “we can only appeal to the law of large  numbers to distribute the losses and make them calculable    in so far as they  repeat themselves”  Moreover, Knight considered circumstances when prospects  were sufficiently diffuse that, as he wrote, “The conception of an objectively  measurable probability or chance is simply inapplicable”  It may be that the current  situation has transited from a sense of known possibilities with assigned  probabilities—that is, risk—to Knightian uncertainty  If so, Knight’s advice to the  Committee is that “the fundamental uncertainties of economic life are the errors in  predicting the future and in making present adjustments to fit future conditions”  If  the possibilities are that uncertain, the Committee could, as outlined in the bottom  panel, defer announcing an assessment of the risks under the rationale that it is  better to be unspecific than specifically wrong  Such a course would probably  require a promise of heightened surveillance to the public and a willingness among  yourselves to convene a conference call before the next meeting if events clarify the  odds  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Actually, Mr Chairman, I have had the staff start a fact book on the   zero bound situation, which will list the unusual actions mentioned in the recent speeches by you   and Governor Bernanke  It will include the authority under which the actions can be taken and   any historical precedent  The work has been fairly closely held because I had some concerns   about what would happen were it to become known that we were actively engaged in   contingency plans about the zero bound  I’ve also asked the staff to look into some other issues,   such as whether difficulties are posed already by the compression of deposit rates and money   March 18, 2003 85 of 101    fund rates  So, we are looking at that and questioning whether there are any other consequences   for the functioning of money markets—problems that the Bank of Japan sometimes complains   about—that would possibly incline you to resort to unusual policy actions before you get the   nominal funds rate to zero  I know that Dino, working with the Research Department at the New   York Fed, has been looking into these issues as well  I guess it might be helpful to get a little   guidance from the Committee about whether there is a memo in my future  [Laughter]     People are working on a couple of aspects of that  We’re looking at it   in terms of depositories, the compression of deposit rates and money fund rates, and just   generally wondering about market functioning  For instance, if the general collateral rate is   ½ percent, then the unattractiveness of failing to deliver securities is not particularly high        I am going to refer to the same material that Dino was  speaking from and emphasize the net changes in market quotes rather than the market  conditions that Dino updated you on  As can be seen in the top panel of exhibit 1,  Treasury yields are not much different from their levels just before the 800 pm  deadline to Iraq on March 19  An initial wave of optimism associated with the                                                     1 The materials used by Messrs Kos and Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 25, 2003 3 of 29    success of the air campaign buoyed equity markets and removed some of the safe  haven demands for Treasury securities  That optimism faded with the grimmer  reality of the ground campaign  On net, Treasury yields are a touch lower, and the  yield curve now (the middle left panel) is barely discernible from that on March 19   While yields are down on net since the onset of hostilities, as shown in the bottom  panel, they are up from just before the FOMC meeting on March 18 and more sharply  so from the publication date of the Greenbook  From the time of the FOMC meeting,  yields are up 6 to 21 basis points; and from the time the Greenbook was published,  yields are from 27 to about 50 basis points higher  The reason Treasury yields are  higher is evident in exhibit 2 in that the expectation and the onset of war significantly  boosted equity prices and lowered expected volatilities  As a result, Dave Stockton is  facing equity values that are about 7 percent higher than when the Greenbook was  closed       With this backdrop, money market future rates—shown in exhibit 3—have risen   since you met, although they moved a tick lower yesterday  On net, the path of the  expected federal funds rate (the middle left panel) has edged lower before turning up  next year  Our read is that there’s a probability in markets of about 60 percent of a  ¼ percentage point easing by the FOMC by May  It’s hard to get as reliable readings  on credit markets at a high frequency  What we have is in exhibit 4, and it suggests  no evident problems  Swap spreads over Treasuries are a little higher, but credit  default swap premiums have narrowed a touch  All in all, as Dino said, markets are  functioning well, but they are very sensitive to every television bulletin from the war  front  That’s it, Mr Chairman       Dino, Governor Bernanke is asking whether you did an outright   purchase of Treasury indexed securities    1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that begins with a chart labeled “Exhibit 1, Treasury Securities Market”  That exhibit  gives an update of financial market trading through noon today  As Dino mentioned,  market participants have had their attention squarely focused on the war front  So  you might be better off having one of those retired generals who seem to be so  ubiquitous doing this update instead of me!  But the message from the markets seems                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   April 1, 2003 3 of 34    to be the same as that from those talking heads  The war is expected to run a little  longer than originally hoped  As a result, the past week completed the rolling back of  the market rally that occurred in the run-up to the March 19 deadline to Iraq that we  spoke about in the last conference call  As shown in the bottom of the first exhibit,  the Treasury yield curve has shifted 16 to 22 basis points lower, with very little of  that change associated with a response to economic data  While some of the decline  in Treasury yields probably reflects a flight toward safer assets, the sense that the war  would run longer has also been associated with some marking lower of the outlook  for economic activity  In that regard, indexed debt yields fell as much as their  nominal counterparts, implying that there was a revision to the outlook for the real  economy with no role for a change in inflation compensation  Also supporting this  notion, equity prices—the subject of exhibit 2—have fallen 2 to 3¾ percent since the  March 19 deadline  Although prices have been volatile ex post, implied volatility  (the middle panel) is lower  That’s a topic that Dino already has raised, and one I’ll  come back to later     Given the revision to the economic outlook, market participants have marked   down futures rates in the short run, as shown in exhibit 3  That is, the path of the  expected federal funds rate (the middle left panel) is noticeably lower than it was  before the deadline, with the expected funds rate touching below 1 percent by this  summer  As you can see in the bottom panel, market participants put very strong  weight on the possibility that the funds rate will be trading below 1¼ percent by the  time of your next meeting     There’s not much to say about corporate debt spreads—the subject of exhibit 4—  other than that they have been remarkably well behaved  Swaps spreads actually  have narrowed some, as have credit default swap premiums for some important  intermediaries (the right column in the middle panel)     If you turn to the next page, in exhibit 5 I have plotted actual and implied   volatilities  As Dino mentioned, implied volatilities across asset classes—that is,  interest rate instruments such as the two-year and ten-year swap volatilities (the top  two panels) and equity indexes such as the S&P and the Nasdaq (the bottom two  panels)—have moved sideways or if anything have fallen a bit  But what has  happened is that actual volatility has risen over the last couple of weeks toward that  level of implied volatilities  That is, in effect trading has been volatile—fulfilling the  expectations that market participants had in advance     Turning to the last set of charts, exhibit 6, and looking at the entire term structure,   you can see that volatility has increased at the very front end of the swap yield curve   Implied volatilities for contracts of less than one year in maturity (the solid line in the  top left panel) have gone higher  But for longer-term instruments they really haven’t  changed that much  So we have a situation in which markets are volatile, as was  anticipated  But it’s a volatility that is expected to occur only in the near term   That’s all I have to report, Mr Chairman      April 1, 2003 4 of 34     1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that were sent out to you about an hour or so ago  Once again, financial market  quotes have mirrored the changing fortunes of war  As seen in the top panel of your  first exhibit, through 1100 this morning Treasury yields have risen about a dozen  basis points since your conference call last week  That places the current yield curve  (as shown in the middle left panel) about where it was just before the war began   Equity prices, the subject of exhibit 2, have moved in tandem with interest rates  The  rally over the past five trading days implies that major indexes (shown in the bottom  panel) are little changed on net since the onset of hostilities  I’d note that implied  volatility on the S&P 500 (the middle panel) has edged off a bit       As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, near-term money market futures rates have   risen in the past week, especially at further ahead maturities  On net, the path of  expected futures rates (shown in the middle left panel) has apparently rotated down  relative to what investors anticipated three weeks ago  In the very near term, a little  less weight is being placed on policy ease  The solid line is a touch above the dotted  line in the middle left panel, and the probability of a funds rate of 1 percent by the  May 6 meeting (shown in the bottom panel) has fallen to that of a coin toss  Such a  judgment, though, depends on the swing of just a couple of basis points  More  evident is the decline in expected rates for next year, which are off about ¼  percentage point since March 19     As shown in exhibit 4, credit spreads have narrowed a bit further, with swap   spreads (the top panel) edging lower  For the key financial intermediaries (shown in  the middle panel), share prices since March 19 are higher on net, and credit default  premiums have fallen      Your last exhibit, exhibit 6, provides an update on the behavior of the money and   credit aggregates in March  As shown in the top left panel, M2 growth slowed in  March to an annual rate of about 3 percent  Special factors, including prepayments of  mortgage-backed securities, tax effects, and currency shipments pulled down M2  growth last month  I must admit, however, that tax effects are highly uncertain at this  time of year  As shown in the top right panel, the performance in March continued  the pattern observed for a while now, given sustained low short-term nominal interest  rates  Liquid deposits are expanding, and small time and M2 money funds are                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   April 8, 2003 4 of 31    running off  After a surge in February, currency growth, both domestically and  abroad, seems to be returning to trend  As shown in the bottom left panel, bank credit  expanded at an annual rate of 6½ percent in March, a bit below the pace in the first  quarter as a whole  Total loan growth slowed, owing to an unusually large volume of  residential mortgage securitizations  As can be seen by the dark portion of the bars at  the far right, C&I loans ran off again in March, about in line with the pace of  contraction that has prevailed for the past two years  This weakness continues to be  concentrated in large domestic banks and in US branches and agencies of foreign  banks  Commercial paper, the hollow portion of the bars, declined once again last  month  On net, though, the receptiveness of bond markets allowed nonfinancial firms  to expand their debt last month, albeit at a lighter pace than in the previous couple of  months  That’s all I have, Mr Chairman        Well, that would depend in part on how one interprets the economic   data that have come out since March 19  Not to steal Dave Stockton’s thunder, but I think on   balance the data have been a bit negative  So one could imagine that stock prices are reflecting   that  Another factor is that we’re hard pressed to explain the run-up in stock prices just before   the March 19 deadline to Iraq  As you can see in exhibit 2 of my package of charts, there was a   very substantial rally—on the order of 8 percent—in that run-up before the onset of military   action  So I think one might argue that this is one of those cases where markets did buy on the   rumor and then moved sideways on the facts     Mr Chairman, I might just point out that the reason we shifted the   meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday of next week was a scheduling conflict for two Committee   members  I’ve received a couple of inquiries about why the meeting date was changed, and   that’s the reason    1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given that Dino has run down  market developments of late, I’d like to review very briefly the net changes since the  staff forecast for the March meeting was put to bed and then focus on the current  configuration of expectations about monetary policy  In doing that I’ll be referring to  the material on financial markets that was distributed to you earlier     As can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit, Treasury yields have marched   unsteadily higher over the past month to post net increases, as presented in the bottom                                                   1 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)      April 16, 2003 4 of 47    panel, of 24 to 38 basis points  Note that indexed debt yields moved up even more,  suggesting a shift in expectations about the prospects for the real economy  But this  is probably more manifest in the review of equity markets in exhibit 2  Major equity  indexes are currently about 10 percent higher than when the Greenbook was closed,  and a forward-looking measure of share price volatility (shown in the middle panel)  has moved noticeably lower     As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, near-term money market futures rates have   extended their rise from their low point at the end of March  On net, the path of  expected futures rates (in the middle left panel) has shifted up about 25 basis points  fairly evenly across the maturity structure  The shifting up of the very front end of  the expected path of rates appears consistent with an unwinding of any expectation of  an intermeeting move, a notion that had gained some currency among market  participants in the previous two weeks  More-recent market commentary appears  consistent with the belief that policy easing, if it comes at all, will be deferred   Indeed, the May futures contracts can be read as implying that much less weight is  now being placed on policy ease, with the probability of a ¼ point easing move at the  May 6 meeting (shown in the bottom panel) having fallen to 1 in 4       As for private markets, in exhibit 4 you’ll see that swap spreads on balance have   declined just a touch over the month since March 12  Also, share prices for key  intermediaries (shown in the middle panel) are up more than the general market, and  their credit default swap premiums have come in some  That’s all I have, Mr  Chairman       The middle panel of exhibit 2 shows equity volatility     Yes  That importantly is related to the increase in the level of equity   prices  We often observe that inverse correlation     I think one could probably say that about nearly every figure in this   presentation  Share prices are higher on balance, and that has been associated with increases in   yields and declines in volatilities      2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that Carol is handing out now  The marked shifts over the intermeeting period in  market participants’ expectations about monetary policy are evident in the top panel  of your first exhibit, which plots the evolving probability that the funds rate would be  ¼ point lower by this afternoon implied by the May federal funds futures contract   Over the latter part of March and early April, before hostilities with Iraq were settled,  investors talked about the possibility of an intermeeting easing, making them  relatively confident that the funds rate would be below 1¼ percent by the end of  today  The cessation of hostilities and the related rally in the equity and corporate  debt markets, along with the perception that the Federal Reserve was not preparing  the market for easing, deflated that notion  As a consequence, market prices are now  consistent with about a 1-in-4 chance of action, about where that expectation has been  for the past two weeks     Market participants still expect the Committee to ease though and ultimately by   more than anticipated at the March meeting  As shown by the solid red line in the  middle left panel, the current path of expectations of the federal funds rate touches  1 percent by November and has shifted about 50 basis points lower at a longer  horizon  Indeed, the option-implied probability distribution of the funds rate this fall  (the middle right panel) suggests that investors are placing considerable weight on a  level well below 1 percent       Evidently, a string of weak economic releases—especially on production and   employment—more than offset the lift to the economic outlook that presumably  attended the decline in uncertainty, the fall in oil prices, and the run-up in share prices  over the intermeeting period  It is worth noting that the decline in uncertainty about  interest rates, the bottom panels, was pronounced all along the yield curve  The  narrowing of the width of the 90 percent confidence band for the federal funds rate  150 days hence derived from options on Eurodollars, at the left, was paralleled by  those posted by one- and ten-year-ahead forward rates on swaps, at the right                                                       2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to the transcript (appendix 2)   May 6, 2003 71 of 115    A more favorable backdrop of financial and commodity markets might be one of  the factors inclining the Committee to keep policy on hold at this meeting, a subject  treated in more detail in your next exhibit  The case for holding policy unchanged  would be supported if the Committee viewed, as noted in the top panel, the staff  forecast to be likely and, over the period that could be reasonably thought to be  influenced by action today, acceptable  Underlying that forecast is the judgment that  economic fundamentals will spark a relatively quick pickup in the growth of  aggregate demand over the balance of the year even holding the funds rate at  1¼ percent  This can be seen by the blue bars in the middle left panel, which show  the staff’s forecast that the growth of real GDP will step up from its sub 2 percent  pace to a rate first closer to and then beyond that of potential  While it will take some  time for this growth to eat into the prevailing level of economic slack, especially  given the lackluster performance thus far this quarter, monetary policy action taken  today would mostly be felt—at least according to the staff forecast—when the  economy already has gained a full head of steam     You may have reason to believe that economic acceleration will be quicker,   implying, as given by the second item in my list in the top panel, that economic slack  would be worked down sooner and disinflation would be less likely than in the staff  forecast  For example, while the extent of fiscal impetus in the current baseline  forecast is a bit larger than in the previous one, the Committee might believe that the  political compromise likely to be struck will take part of all the proposals currently on  the table so that the total ends up significantly larger than now envisioned  To give  you a sense of the upside risk, the Greenbook included an alternative simulation with  both higher government spending and lower taxes  As shown by the red bars in the  middle left panel, that would be sufficient to boost the growth of real GDP  1 percentage point this quarter and hold growth at the baseline thereafter  Even if you  are not confident that fiscal stimulus will be forthcoming—as gridlock is always a  possibility—you might want to wait for those prospects to come into sharper focus  before adding monetary policy easing into the mix     Another reason the Committee might not view the time as right to ease—even if it   were leaning in that direction—is that it might be worried that financial markets could  react adversely to such action, as noted by the third item in my list  As shown in the  middle right panel, markets have been on a tear in the past nine weeks, with equity  prices up 16 percent from the March 12 low and riskier corporate yields ¼ percentage  point to 1½ percentage points lower  That rally came even as expectations of very  near-term monetary policy ease, as I already described, were being rolled back   Investors might wonder how weak the Committee considered the outlook to be that it  was necessary to augment the already appreciable relaxation of financial conditions  since mid-March  Moreover, such an action would stand out all the more in  comparison with your recent behavior  The bars in the bottom panel record the  immediate surprises associated with Committee decisions over the past three years,  measured as the actual target rate decided at each of the meetings less the expected  funds rate gotten from futures markets the day before  As can be seen, a surprise   May 6, 2003 72 of 115    today on the order of 20 or 45 basis points, as would be the case if you ease 25 or 50  basis points, respectively, would be an outlier     Alternatively, you might see the need for easing, discussed in exhibit 3, as too   compelling to be countered effectively by arguments about timing and reception  As  noted in the first bullet point, in the Greenbook outlook resources remain underused  throughout the forecast period, shown in the middle left panel by the unemployment  rate, which stays at or above 6 percent in this and the next four quarters  While a  ¼ or ½ point easing may not materially influence the near-term contour of that path,  the projected almost 1 percentage point spread of the unemployment rate over its  natural rate at the beginning of next year is more likely to be within the ambit of your  influence     You may not be so sure that the economy will deliver even that performance,   particularly if you believe that chief executives still see capital stocks as excessive or  you believe that the prospects for economies abroad are especially gloomy  A failure  to get the forecasted rebound in growth raises the possibility that households’ support  to the economic expansion will finally sag, setting in motion adverse dynamics that  may be difficult to stop by future easing  Market concern about the economy may be  growing in that the implied probability of the funds rate sinking below 1 percent by  the autumn (the middle right panel) has risen of late  The insurance provided by a  prompt easing may be attractive when, as in the second bullet point, downside risks to  demand are more likely or more costly     Third, even if the Committee believes in a forecast that, to a first approximation,   meets its responsibility to foster sustainable economic growth over time, it has  another objective as well  Easing may be favored on the concern that, as in the third  point, inflation may fall further from an already low level and jeopardize your  commitment to price stability  The four-quarter growth in the consumer price index  is 14 percent at the end of the staff forecast, which is shown by the horizontal line in  the bottom panel  While such an outcome or lower has occurred about 30 percent of  the time in the postwar period, it has happened in only two years since 1965  True,  for part of that time the Federal Reserve had lost the anchor provided by price  stability, but you may have concerns that some costs arise from being in a region so  seldom traveled     Whatever the choice about the level of the federal funds rate, you will still have to   grapple with the risk assessment, as discussed in the last exhibit  The elevated  uncertainties of March that led the Committee not to characterize the balance of risks  have abated  Indeed, those uncertainties have probably diminished to the point where  the same rationale as in March could not plausibly be repeated to refrain from stating  the balance of risks  Still, judging from a recent survey of primary dealers, informed  outsiders are confused about the Committee’s next step  As reported in the top panel,  about half the dealers expect an announcement of balanced risks, while the rest are  split between a tilt toward economic weakness and no assessment at all      May 6, 2003 73 of 115    I think that there are three possibilities to consider  First, keeping policy  unchanged or easing modestly is unlikely to change materially the evident downside  risks to the path of inflation over the next several quarters, and the relative  distribution of the risks to sustainable economic growth would remain debatable  If  that is the period over which the Committee defines the “foreseeable future,” then it  could reassert the old language tilted toward economic weakness on the logic that the  weighted average of those risks represents a downside threat to its objectives   However, March’s deferral of a risk statement might make May an appropriate time  to drop the statement altogether, the option listed second  That might be particularly  attractive if you have been troubled in the past by the misperception fostered by the  existing language of trading off economic growth and inflation and the ambiguity  attached to the notion of the foreseeable future  In that case, this afternoon’s  statement could relate that the balance of risk assessment is no longer seen as helpful  in conveying the Committee’s views to the public  On the theory that you can’t beat  something with nothing, I’ve listed a third option  The Committee could augment the  risk assessment portion of the statement  One possibility would be regularly to  include two declarative sentences that describe the risks individually to the goals of  price stability and maximum sustainable growth and a third that summarizes the  balance of those risks  While this may convey the Committee’s view of the outlook  more clearly, it probably would be greeted with bewilderment by some Fed watchers  at the onset     While your deferral in March opened a window to change the balance of   risk assessment, you might want a bit more time than available today to  deliberate on a matter that will set a precedent  However, the problem that  you face is that anything you do today will be read as precedential  That  concludes my remarks, Mr Chairman       We have heard different things from different market participants    The Bond Market Association met in this room just last week and devoted one segment of the   session to complaining about the balance of risks statement as not being helpful  They indicated   a preference that we be a little more descriptive in the statement  But I think that would result in   May 6, 2003 74 of 115    some confusion because right now the balance of risks statement provides the comfort of giving   coded words  The problem is that the codes are a limited number of choices, and at least some   members have complained that they have constrained your ability to convey what you really   think about the near-term outlook  For example, in today’s case you might say that plausibly   under the language of the last three years, you’d have to state that the risks are tilted toward   economic weakness, whereas in fact most of the members have expressed concerns about further   disinflation from an already low level  So I think expanding the risks assessment on balance—I   hate to use the word “balance”— [laughter] on net would provide more information to the   markets and more flexibility to you going forward  But flexibility comes with a cost  You don’t   have those coded signals       Your remarks this morning and those of Governor Bies and others   around the table echo the comments I’ve heard from members over the last couple of weeks in   other conversations  So the Chairman has agreed that the special topic at the first day of the June   meeting should focus on alternative policy regimes in an environment of very low short-term   rates  Dino and I will organize the staff work on the strategy, tactics, and communication policy   associated with that  That does crowd out a bit of the background material that the Board staff   has prepared on communication policy more generally  What I’ll do is circulate that material in   a couple of weeks, and I’ll ask for guidance when you receive it on whether you’d prefer to   tackle the communication policy at the next two-day meeting in January or if you’d like to deal   with it piecemeal at meetings before then       1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  called “Conducting Monetary Policy at Very Low Short-term Interest Rates” which  was on the table when you came in  It’s the same as the material I sent to you  electronically last week  I’d like to start on a personal note, though  I was in line at  midnight on Friday with my 11-year-old son to purchase Harry Potter and the Order  of the Phoenix  At 870 pages it is somewhat longer than the briefing documents the  Committee has received  But it, too, considers an alternative world filled with  uncertainty and great perils!                                                    1 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)      June 24-25, 2003 3 of 211    As the top panel of your first exhibit makes clear, the current nominal federal  funds rate of 1¼ percent places the Committee in a region it has not been in a half  century  In our briefings this afternoon, Dino and I will try to provide some  background to help you map a route across that unfamiliar terrain  I shall address  aspects of the conduct of monetary policy at very low short-term interest rates,  emphasizing the options available to you through open market operations and  communication policy  Toward the end of my briefing, I shall also touch upon a  broader range of policy possibilities, including the aggressive use of the discount  window  Dino will then discuss specific options as to how the Domestic Desk might  implement policy should you decide to move away from the current approach of  setting a target exclusively for the overnight federal funds rate  I will close out the  staff presentation by asking a series of questions to get some guidance from the  Committee about priorities going forward  How much urgency you attach to the issue  depends on the interaction of your views on the likelihood and costs of deflation,  where the federal funds rate will be over the next few months, and the costs in terms  of market functioning attached to very low short rates  We decided to cut this  Gordian knot in the following way  As to the first in the list, the Division of Research  and Statistics forwarded a memo to the Committee last week on the subject of  deflation, and aspects of that will be discussed in the chart show by David Wilcox  later this afternoon  We suggest that you put off to the greatest extent possible any  discussion of the appropriate setting of the current short rate until tomorrow       The middle panel of your first exhibit opens my briefing with the issue of the   direct costs associated with a low overnight nominal interest rate viewed from the  perspective of the functioning of financial markets  This was also the subject of a  memo that the Committee received last week, but I’d like to start from a different  perspective than in that document because I am afraid that cognitive dissonance may  have set in already  According to a very influential paper that Milton Friedman  published in 1969, a low nominal interest rate imposes no costs but only benefits  In  Friedman’s framework, an overnight interest rate of zero is optimal because it implies  that society does not wastefully devote resources to economizing on transactions  balances  While the example of Japan strongly suggests that a zero-rate environment  creates other difficulties, his perspective is instructive in that what many people call  costs of low short rates are actually related to the unwinding of schemes designed to  make holding transactions balances less burdensome  That said, it is important to  remember that the economy would bear adjustment costs twice—once as interest  rates fall and these schemes are unwound and then when they are built up again as  short-term interest rates ultimately revert to more normal levels       With that in mind, the first of the three costs listed is the problem of compressing   rates  By that I mean that the overnight federal funds rate regularly exceeds some  other money market rates, including those on liquid deposits, many money market  mutual funds, and collateralized financing in the RP market  Were the overnight  federal funds rate to fall, those other instruments would have less room to preserve  their typical spreads  In addition, the incentive for sharp-penciled reserve managers  to trade funds in the market would diminish as the overnight rate falls, probably   June 24-25, 2003 4 of 211    thinning brokering in the market  Two opposing points are worth noting  First, the  high-cost providers of intermediation services in the money fund industry will be the  ones feeling the initial pinch  Perhaps those are the firms that should appropriately  lose out in the Darwinian competition for scarce resources  Second, there was an  active federal funds market in the 1920s; but after the subsequent two decades of low  overnight rates, it withered away and was not to revive until the early 1950s  Overall,  my reading of the staff memo is that these two costs are inflicted on only narrow  segments of financial markets  Still, trouble in even a narrow segment of the market  can get quite a lot of attention in the media, potentially elevating the concern of the  broader public about the economy and financial intermediaries  A more serious  concern, also one about perceptions, is that a central bank that eased policy to the  point that short rates were very low might be seen by the public as having run out of  ammunition—that is, low rates risk fostering the mis-impression that monetary policy  is ineffective  To ward off this risk, the Committee may want to communicate to the  public going forward that there is a contingency plan and that it does not envision  monetary policy becoming impotent     The remainder of my briefing will examine policy alternatives that may help to   ensure that monetary policy remains potent, beginning with the discussion of the  implementation of policy in exhibit 2  To start with the most obvious point, monetary  policy actions are put in place by altering the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet,  a simplified form of which is presented in the shaded area  Over the years, the  Federal Reserve has acquired a significant volume of Treasury securities, about two- fifths of which is held in bills and three-fifths in notes and bonds  (Our relatively  small holdings of indexed debt are not shown separately)  Also note that we’re not  currently much in the lending business, as discount window credit typically runs  under $100 million  In principle, the Federal Reserve can spur economic activity by  increasing the overall size of its balance sheet—that is, by blowing up its liabilities  through some combination of open market purchases of securities and discount  window lending  Such changes are reflected directly in the overnight federal funds  rate until it is driven to zero  At that point, the quantity of reserves can still be  increased, but any effects will have to show up in places other than the price of  overnight reserves  Additionally, changes in the composition of the balance sheet— the mix of long-tem and short-term assets held—potentially could influence risk  premiums  Policies regarding both the size and composition of the System’s balance  sheet could also influence expectations about the future path of policy—that is,  expectations about how the size and composition of the balance sheet will change  over time     Equally as important as how the Committee changes its policy is how that   impetus is transmitted through the economy, the subject of exhibit 3  In particular, as  outlined in the green box, the principal channel of transmission of monetary policy to  spending is through the prices and returns of long-lived assets  In turn, those returns  depend on the current and expected future path of short-term interest rates as well as  risk premiums  Monetary policy would have an additional lever on spending if, as  some economists argue, the quantity of liquidity has an effect on spending   June 24-25, 2003 5 of 211    independent of its influence on the current overnight interest rate  Three somewhat  overlapping forms of monetary policy stimulus are implied from this general  principle as listed below  The Federal Reserve can provide impetus to the economy  at an unchanged current short-term interest rate by encouraging investors to expect  short rates to be lower in the future than they currently anticipate and by shifting  relative supplies to affect risk premiums   If the overnight rate is already zero, the  Federal Reserve may be able to provide additional impetus to the economy by  oversupplying reserves at the zero funds rate       I’ll now give a bit more detail about such policies in turn, but it will become very   evident that any individual policy shares elements of these three mechanisms  I term  the first policy “shaping interest rate expectations,” as at the top of exhibit 4   Because the pricing of long-lived assets depends on the current and expected future  short-term interest rate, if the Federal Reserve could encourage investors to lower  their interest rate expectations, the economy might receive a boost  But how can the  Federal Reserve encourage lower interest rate expectations?  One possible approach  would be to offer some form of commitment to the public  An example of an  unconditional commitment is pledging to hold short-term rates at a low level for x  period of time  In an environment where investors were expecting tighter monetary  policy, stimulus would take the form of lengthening x and would presumably pass  through the yield curve and other asset prices  The middle panels show how that  might work  The solid blue line at the left plots the path of the expected short-term  interest rate derived from a two-factor model fit to the swap yield curve as of two  weeks ago  (Note that this views policy over a much longer period than the futures- based measures we usually show the Committee)  The corresponding swap yield  curve is plotted in a similar manner in the right panel  The long blue and short red  dashed lines at the left contravene the dynamics of this model to hold the expected  short rate at its current level for the next one and three years, respectively, after which  it returns to that predicted by the model  The consequences for swap yields are  shown at the right  The convincing promise to keep the short rate at its current level  for the next year only nudges the term structure lower, probably because policy rate  expectations are already subdued for the immediate future  A three-year standstill on  rate hikes has a more dramatic effect on yields, pulling swap rates in the three-to-five- year sector 2 percentage points to 1 percentage point lower  While such effects may  be significant, the reality of policymaking is that a promise would not likely be  conveyed as starkly as an explicit commitment to keep rates low as measured in x  years  Rather, through the Committee’s statements and the speeches and testimonies  of members, the message could be sent that the policy rate would be kept low for a  while barring some major unanticipated shock  Even then, given the variety of  shocks that have hit the US economy over the past few years and the imponderables  critical to the outlook, the Committee might be reluctant to tie its hands by making an  unconditional promise about its future actions potentially far into the future, no matter  how vague and nuanced       An alternative would be to make a promise linked not to the calendar but to some   economic event  Under a conditional commitment, the Committee could pledge to   June 24-25, 2003 6 of 211    hold short rates at a low level until some event y happens  Possible triggering events  would include posting sustained economic growth, making progress in trimming  economic slack, and recording inflation above a specified floor  The yellow warning  sign along the road to a commitment strategy is that words ultimately have to be  matched by deeds for the public to believe the Committee—that is, shaping  expectations does not introduce another policy instrument in the long run  Moreover,  the Committee might be concerned about its credibility in delivering on its promise   As one example, you might be concerned about establishing a target range above the  current rate of inflation if you thought there was a reasonable risk that the actual  outcomes for inflation will move lower for the next few years  As another example,  the Committee might be worried about its credibility in the other direction if a focus  on a backward-looking indicator of economic progress induced overshooting     The next exhibit examines policies aimed at altering the composition of the   Federal Reserve balance sheet  As is evident in the chart, the Federal Reserve already  participates in all segments of the Treasury market  As the focus of that participation  has shifted over the years, the average maturity of the System’s holdings has varied  since 1955 from as short as about one year to as long as four years  Stepping up our  purchases of notes and bonds might be a way of lowering risk premiums on Treasury  securities  Simply put, when a large purchaser shifts its demand, relative prices  change  Lengthening the maturity of the portfolio may also convey the sense that the  Federal Reserve sees little likelihood that it would put policy on a tighter path than  currently expected  That’s because, if the policy rate turns out to be firmer than  anticipated, the value of those longer-term securities would decline  The Committee  might pursue such a policy relatively indirectly—say, by instructing the Desk to tilt  its purchases toward longer-term issues  A more formal scheme might be to target  both the overnight rate and the average maturity of the System Open Market Account   The extreme example of a policy keyed to the composition of the balance sheet would  be to announce a ceiling on a longer-term yield below the prevailing rate, signaling  both dissatisfaction with current expectations about policy and a willingness to put  our capital at risk if the Committee doesn’t follow through by keeping short rates low     The caveats to manipulating the balance sheet are numerous  As to affecting   relative returns, empirical evidence suggests that relative supplies do not matter much  for risk premiums, at least within the limited range of variation in the US  experience  Moreover, purchases of securities might have to be massive to enforce a  ceiling if investors came to doubt that rates would be kept low  At that point, you  might have the concern that the security would become disconnected from the rest of  the yield curve and from private rates  As to underscoring a commitment to keeping  rates low, it is not obvious why a central bank issuing a fiat currency should care  about capital gains or losses  If that is the case, then shifting the composition of the  portfolio would not do much to reassure investors  Such a policy would also have to  be closely coordinated with the Treasury to ensure that debt-management changes do  not simply offset the effect that the Committee desires on the composition of the  stock of debt held by the public      June 24-25, 2003 7 of 211    Another form of policy stimulus could possibly be put in place by expanding the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet even beyond the size required to drive the funds rate  to zero, the subject of exhibit 6  In general, a central bank eases monetary policy by  expanding the stock of reserves  These days, most central banks choose to calibrate  that easing by targeting the price of reserves—that is, the overnight federal funds rate  in our case  The Federal Reserve could switch its focus from the price of reserves to  the quantity of reserves (or the growth of reserves)   If it so desired, the Committee  could then set a reserve growth target designed to drive the funds rate to zero and  subsequently provide further monetary stimulus by oversupplying reserves at that  zero rate  As related in the box, over-supplying reserves—some might call it  quantitative easing—could affect the economy by lowering the returns on the assets  purchased to supply those extra reserves, by convincing market participants that the  overnight interest rate will be kept low in the future, and by working though a  quantitative channel, if it exists  It is noteworthy, as detailed in the memo the  Committee received on policy in the 1930s, that there were distinct business-cycle  fluctuations that decade even as the overnight rate hugged close to its zero bound   Moreover, those changes in economic activity were preceded by changes in the size  of the Federal Reserve balance sheet       The basic logic that more reserves have to do some good relies on the observation   that boosting reserves by enough ultimately must lead to rising prices  However, as  in the yellow-warning box, a long-run association between the monetary base and  prices does not provide much guidance about the short-run performance of the  economy, implying that it would be difficult to gauge policy effects and that it risks  confusing market participants  Most important, the long-run association observed in  the data is that a permanent increase in the money stock is associated with a  permanent increase in the general price level  For oversupplying reserves to have an  effect, the public has to be convinced that the increase in reserves will stick around as  long as needed, so there still will be a communication challenge that might include a  role for some form of commitment     Although I have spoken about these policies in relatively abstract terms, they are   part of our history, as shown in exhibit 7  The Federal Reserve has always  appreciated the importance of correctly aligning market expectations about the  economy  In that regard, and as shown in the top left, one of the more sizable  reactions in financial markets in the past few years to an FOMC decision followed the  decision on May 6 not to change the overnight rate  The System has also been  willing to put its balance sheet at risk to encourage appropriate expectations about  interest rates or to calm fears about funds availability  As plotted at the top right, the  Desk sold options on RPs for the weeks around the century date change that totaled  nearly $05 trillion of notional value  Given that the Desk already operates in all  segments of the Treasury market, we wouldn’t have to move up a learning curve if  instructed to increase purchases of longer-dated issues  Indeed, from 1942 to 1951,  the Federal Reserve enforced a ceiling on the Treasury yield curve, the subject of  another staff memo sent to you last week  As shown in the middle left panel, our  holdings of Treasury securities scaled by net debt outstanding did rise over that   June 24-25, 2003 8 of 211    period, but that uptick was dwarfed by the one that occurred during the inflationary  excesses of the late 1960s and early 1970s  Within that total and as shown at the  right, by 1946 the System owned almost nine-tenths of the outstanding (relatively  small) stock of bills, suggesting that at the short end, the ceiling on the bill rate was a  binding constraint  Policy expectations looking over a longer period in the 1940s  must have been more consistent with the ceiling on the long end of the yield curve, as  our relative holdings of notes and bonds fell over the decade  That episode also  highlights a concern that you might have about an explicit ceiling on yields—that of  how to unwind such a program when it was no longer needed  Concerns about the  financial health of commercial banks that were heavily invested in long-term  securities that had their rates caps for nearly a decade led the Treasury to create a  bond conversion program after the Accord was signed in 1951  As for policy geared  toward quantities not prices, the Federal Reserve targeted nonborrowed reserves from  1979 to 1982  That experience teaches that the demand for reserves is sufficiently  erratic that such a procedure would be a blunt instrument—perhaps appropriate if the  Committee had already driven or wanted to drive the federal funds rate to zero     This brings up the general issue of sequencing, which is addressed at the top of   your final exhibit  The forms of monetary stimulus that I have been speaking about  can be used once the overnight rate has already been driven to zero or as a way of  driving the overnight rate to zero  Alternatively, the Committee might desire to keep  the funds rate above zero and rely on its ability to shape expectations or alter the  composition of the balance sheet as means of providing stimulus  In principle, for  example, the Desk could be given targets for both the overnight rate and a longer  maturity yield  In such a scheme, monetary stimulus could take the form of gradually  marching out the maturity structure to pull the yield on a slightly longer-term issue  down toward—but not necessarily to—its zero bound  To enforce those targets,  though, if the Committee wanted to keep short rates above zero, the Desk might have  to add reserves in one segment of the Treasury market and to drain them out of  another        I have focused on policy alternatives that rely on conventional open market   operations—perhaps of large scale or directed to a different end than done currently   There are other alternatives if the policymakers believed that deflationary forces were  severe  In particular, as outlined in the bottom panel, the Federal Reserve could rely  more on the discount window by lowering the primary credit rate or perhaps by  establishing a special program to provide funds on concessionary terms and for a  maturity longer than overnight   The Committee could also instruct the Desk to  purchase a wider set of assets in open market operations, potentially including foreign  exchange to foster currency depreciation  If the menu of permissible assets is viewed  as too short to provide sufficient stimulus, we could seek legislation to expand that  authority—presumably to include corporate debt and even equities  There is another  weapon in the Board’s arsenal  It could cut reserve requirements  True, the available  base is narrow (transactions deposits) and the amount limited by law (at most from  the current 10 percent to the 8 percent floor), but such an action would signal a  willingness of the Federal Reserve to use all means at its disposal to revive the   June 24-25, 2003 9 of 211    economy  Finally, the Federal Reserve could coordinate its policy with the  Administration and the Congress to encourage, say, tax cuts that would be directly  financed by money creation  You can see why I put this list last  These options  would change how we are viewed in financial markets, involve credit judgments of a  form we are not used to, perhaps smack of desperation, and pull us into a tighter  relationship with other parts of the government  But they are available if you felt the  other, more traditional forms of monetary stimulus would be inadequate to the  situation       In general, the appropriate sequencing of policy action depends on the costs   associated with low overnight interest rates as compared with the benefit of additional  macroeconomic stimulus  Complicating matters, considerable uncertainty surrounds  the timing and magnitude of the effects of any of these policies on the economy  The  Committee might also be concerned that the public would take a switch in regime as  evidence that the economic situation had turned especially adverse  At this point, I  would be the first to admit that predicting market psychology in response to an  unprecedented event is a losing game  It is also possible that the public would come  to the view that the Federal Reserve was “jumping into the breach” with seldom-used  policy tactics and be reassured that policymakers would go to any length necessary to  support satisfactory economic performance  The uncertainties attached to such  actions may well counsel taking insurance to avoid being put into the position to have  to rely upon them—but I suggest that that should be a subject for tomorrow  As for  now, if the Committee believes that such action may be required, much work is  needed to be done in advance       At this point, the staff is seeking guidance from the   Committee on how to proceed  In particular, we will be listening especially intently  to your discussion this afternoon for answers to the four questions highlighted in  exhibit 9, the very last chart in my package  First, are there any alternatives that the  Committee particularly favors for additional study?  Second, are there any  alternatives that should be dropped immediately from consideration?  Third, how  does the Committee assess the costs of very low nominal overnight interest rates, and  are they such that an alternative policy should be put in place at a funds rate above  zero?  Finally, how should the Committee’s assessment of these policy alternatives be  conveyed to the public in the months ahead?       I think the short answer is that I have every confidence in Dino,   [laughter] but he may have to do transactions in very large size  One could imagine, for instance,   the Committee calling out a ceiling on the five-year note yield—one would hope that would be   consistent with the expectations it was trying to engender through other statements—but also   calling out a 1 percentage point federal funds target  What that would mean is that Dino would   be buying five-year notes to enforce the ceiling if expectations called for that  That is, if prices   started falling and pushing the yields up to that ceiling, he would inject a lot of reserves  He’d   June 24-25, 2003 37 of 211    have to offset those reserves by doing reverses—in effect using the securities just bought as   collateral to pull reserves back out of the banking system     The other important concern you identified, President Moskow, is that   the more two points on the yield curve had to be enforced by large-scale transactions, the more   likely the targeted longer-term security would be disconnected from the rest of its neighbors on   the yield curve and then from private rates  That could happen if we wound up purchasing the   five-year note, say, and doing large reverses  I think the goal would be more to encourage   expectations consistent with a low five-year yield, which would be priced into all assets  If we   get involved in a corner solution where we own a lot of the five-year note issues, it’s less likely   to be transmitted to other market prices       I think that, in principle, we could set the price of any point on the   yield curve  There’d be obvious questions about why we’d want to do that if our goal was to   June 24-25, 2003 38 of 211    affect private rates  More likely than not, the operations would involve, as was the case in the   experience of 1942 to 1951, targets all along the yield curve       Governor Ferguson, some of this will be addressed in the chart show   tomorrow morning, and there are also a number of indicators in Part 2 of the Greenbook about   corporate credit quality  Just to underscore what Dino said, forward-looking measures of   expected year-ahead defaults, for instance—a KMV-type measure—have come off in the last   couple months  Actual recovery rates are doing a bit better, and so are default rates; and though   the rating changes are still toward the downgrade side, the margin has narrowed     On Thursday, yes, Mr Chairman  I put a cover memo on the   materials on communication policy that we circulated yesterday asking for the Committee’s   guidance as to when it would be appropriate to discuss general issues about transparency—  whether it should be at a lunch, at a one-day meeting, or not until January  This is one topic that   I can put on the agenda whenever you’d like   5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that Carol Low distributed during the coffee break  The financial market backdrop  for the Committee’s decision is provided in exhibit 1  Your announcement on May 6  set in motion a significant downward realignment in market expectations, as can be  seen in the movement from the dotted to the dashed line in the top left panel  After  all the dust from testimony, speeches, and newspaper articles settled, investors have  come to place considerable weight—as seen in the solid line—on a funds rate trading  below 1 percent for the remainder of this year and into the next  Options on federal  funds futures indicate, as seen in the last column in the table at the right, that the odds  slightly favor a 50 basis point move at this meeting  Moreover, as the red bars plotted  in the middle left panel suggest, options on Eurodollar futures are consistent with a  significantly greater likelihood that the funds rate will be below 1 percent five months  hence than was foreseen at the time of the May FOMC meeting (the black line)   Indeed, the upward climb of the blue line plotted at the right shows that a notable  mass is now being put on the probability that the funds rate will trade at or below  50 basis points in five months  The sense that the Committee intended to keep the  funds rate lower and for longer than previously expected supported equity prices,  with the major indexes plotted at the bottom left gaining about 10 percent over the  intermeeting period  This was also so for bond prices, with the yields plotted at the  lower right shedding 60 basis points     To repeat, the recent financial market rally was importantly underpinned by the   expectation that the Committee would ease  As discussed in the top panel of  exhibit 2, one pillar in the case for moving the fund rate 25 basis points lower would  be to ratify at least a portion of the easing currently built into market prices   Extending the rally in financial markets would bolster wealth and keep funding  available to businesses on easy terms, thereby providing encouragement to spending   Such a configuration of financial market conditions would, as reported in the second  bullet, work down resource slack more quickly  The solid line in the middle left                                                    5 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)      June 24-25, 2003 132 of 211    panel plots the Greenbook baseline path for the unemployment rate that is expected to  prevail if the Committee lowers the funds rate to 1 percent and holds it there, whereas  the dotted line shows the consequences for unemployment, according to the FRB/US  model, if the funds rate is held at 1¼ percent  While the spread between the two lines  is small, the difference does cumulate over time to lessen the pressures on  disinflation     In the benefit–cost calculus in current circumstances, the Committee might be   reassured that, as shown in the middle right panel, inflation expectations gauged from  financial markets (the red and blue lines) or gleaned from a survey (the dotted line)  remain subdued  Indeed, the alternative FRB/US simulations presented in the  Bluebook give evidence of how little risk there is, given the staff’s assessment of the  economy, that inflation pressures may flare  Those simulations, which assume that  the nominal funds rate moves down to 1 percent today, all envision the real funds rate  being moved up to its long-run equilibrium level of about 2¾ percent over the course  of one year  They differ as to whether that adjustment takes place in 2005, 2006, or  2007  The punch line is given in the two bottom panels  The Committee could move  the funds rate ¼ percentage point lower from its current level and not have to reverse  that action for 1½ years while still keeping inflation on a gentle downward trajectory  toward ¾ percent, as close to price stability as one might imagine  Perhaps too close  for some, in light of the renewed importance of a cushion of inflation to protect  against the zero bound to nominal interest rates  One way to fatten that cushion is to  ease 25 basis points today on the expectation that any reversal would be delayed for  some time  Another way to fatten the cushion, as listed at the top of exhibit 3, is to  ease 50 basis points today  In one sense, such a policy move would merely  reestablish the degree of monetary policy accommodation of late last year  As seen  by the thick solid line in the middle panel, the ex post real funds rate has moved up  from the level prevailing in the second half of 2002, mirroring the decline in inflation,  while its equilibrium value—at least as gauged by staff models—has been a moving  target that fell over the same period     While the staff anticipates that a quickening of aggregate demand is imminent, its   assessment of aggregate supply is such that an ease of 50 basis points would seem to  position policy better to support a more rapid rundown of slack  Moreover, the  Committee might harbor some reservation about the staff projections that spending  will show such vigor  Given the lags in the effect of monetary policy, action today  will mostly shape economic conditions next year  As shown in the bottom left panel,  in the list of the projections for GDP growth and the unemployment rate next year  made recently by major investment banks, the staff forecast of vigorous economic  expansion (the memo item at the bottom) is squarely at the upper end of the range of  projections     A projection that you may put even more stock in is your own  As David Wilcox   reported earlier this morning, the central tendencies of your economic projections for  2004, not shown, are that real GDP grows at 3¾ to 4¾ percent, the unemployment  remains around 5½ to 6 percent, and PCE inflation clocks in at 1 to 1½ percent  Dave   June 24-25, 2003 133 of 211    Lindsey reports in his opus distributed to the Committee yesterday that the setting of  the federal funds rate since the late 1980s can be described well by a Taylor-style rule  using those forward-looking forecasts and a lagged dependent variable to capture  gradualism  By that standard, as plotted in the red dotted line at the bottom right  compared with the actual funds rate in black, your current economic forecast would  call for putting the policy rate at nearly ¾ percentage point if you were to operate as  you had over the prior ten years       Alternatively, it is possible that the Committee views the risks to its forecast of   economic growth as especially susceptible to upside surprises, perhaps to the point of  arguing for keeping the funds rate unchanged, the subject of exhibit 4  Easing might  be viewed as unnecessary because considerable fiscal stimulus is in train  As shown  in the middle left panel, the staff estimates that fiscal impetus will to rise to an eye- popping 1¼ percent of nominal GDP this year, moving it into a range rarely seen in  the past forty years  Given the complexities of the recent legislation, there’s a large  amount of judgment in forecasting how much kick there will be to household and,  especially, business spending  If the staff has shaded its estimate of the effects too  much, there would be an even more marked pickup in growth than in the Greenbook     A muted response to investment incentives and a slow dissipation of the gloom   that has damped capital spending over the past few years help to explain why, as in  the middle right panel, the staff forecast places the expansion of equipment and  software spending during this business cycle (the solid blue line) below the range of  postwar experience (the shaded area)  If you think we are about to see a rebound in  investment more in keeping with its typical cyclical amplitude—that is, the  Greenbook is too pessimistic—the corresponding need for monetary policy stimulus  would be lessened  You may also have the sense that economic expansion had  already gained sufficient traction from the ongoing rapid growth of liquidity  The  four-quarter growth of real M2 (the red line in the bottom panel) and real bank credit  (the black line) remains robust and in a range typically associated with  contemporaneous growth in activity     Likely, though, the question is not if but by how much to ease policy  After all,   the Committee left its May meeting with a strong presumption that it would ease  policy today, leaving the burden of proof to those who believed the economy had  picked up enough to make such an action unnecessary  Although the tone of recent  readings has brightened, at best the Scottish—and perhaps English—verdict of “not  proven” is in order  Your last exhibit examines the Committee’s assessment of the  risks to the outlook by first bringing up a procedural question  On May 6, the  Committee separated the risk assessment into statements about the risks regarding its  objective of sustainable economic growth, risks regarding its objective of price  stability, and an overall balance of those two risks  However, as was the case in  March, but not the previous three years, the Committee voted only on the policy rate  and not on the risk assessment  I assumed in the Bluebook that you wanted to return  to the practice of voting on the assessment of risks so that it had the full force of the  Committee’s imprimatur  But given the numerous times in the past that members   June 24-25, 2003 134 of 211    have indicated that it would be unworkable for the statement to have nineteen editors,  I also assumed that you would not want to review it routinely before the vote, except,  as in May, when substantive changes to the format seemed to be called for  To solve  this governance puzzle, I suggested in the Bluebook that the Committee choose  among generic formulations of the parts of the risks assessment to allow some  discretion to the drafters  That is, when the time comes, the Deputy Secretary would  read a single proposal put on the table by the Chairman that wraps together a decision  of the intended funds rate and directions for each of the three parts of the assessment  of risk     As for today’s choice, as considered in the bottom left panel, almost regardless of   your decision on rates, growth rate risks would seem to be balanced  Similarly, with  inflation edging down from an already low level in most forecasts, risks to the  Committee’s goal of price stability would seem to be to the downside  As a result,  the overall balance would presumably be to the downside  Conceivably, the  Committee might view a 50 basis point ease as sufficient to balance the risks, similar  to the action it took last November  There’s some sentiment in the market for this, in  that in the latest Money Market Services Survey (the bottom right panel), almost half  the respondents who thought the funds rate would be 75 basis points this afternoon  also thought the Committee would opt for balanced risks  But it does seem a stretch,  in that fostering a sense in the market that the Committee wanted to draw this easing  cycle to a close would undercut some of the stimulus of a 50 basis point move  That  concludes my prepared remarks, Mr Chairman         I think there is a risk that moving to balance in the current   circumstances would be interpreted as having the funds rate as low as the Committee really   wanted it to go  Given that there is a misperception that 75 basis points might be the bottom end   of your comfort zone, I think it may very well turn out that way     It is the case that 25 basis points would not get you to as easy a policy   as, say, in the first half of last year     But it’s also the case that your sense of the forecast going forward is   probably more positive than it was a year ago or even in May     One thing I have learned is that people read different things into the   word “sustainable”  I think some members would view the words “sustainable growth” as   saying the growth rate of potential       Whereas I think others have felt that the word “sustainable” also   includes a level concept to it  That is, if the economy is well below its level of potential, the   growth rate that it could sustain for the next several quarters is actually higher than that of   potential       I think the word is ambiguous  And that’s one reason I would like at   some point to put on the Committee’s agenda a discussion of its communication policy       In my proposal and in the proposal in the Bluebook I was trying to   come up with words that were as generic as possible with regard to inflation  I think the May 6   June 24-25, 2003 137 of 211    statement served the Committee well by indicating a direction—the unwelcome risk of a   substantial further fall in inflation from an already low level  I’m not proposing this wording as   part of the press statement for today’s meeting but rather as a way for you to convey your views   about the direction in the statement     It was implied that you were voting on the risks, but when it came to   the actual vote and what Normand read to you before the roll call, you voted only on the interest   rate decision       Yes, we handed out the draft statement before the vote     All I really wanted to do was to get the formal process back to the   point where the Committee actually does formally vote on the two aspects of its decision     Not necessarily in those exact words, but that sense would be in the   statement  There will be a declarative sentence about inflation, and it will follow the direction   that the Committee indicates     Not word for word     It will be in the transcript, yes, and it will be in the minutes     We had a request from the folks in our Public Affairs office to   continue referring to it as the discount rate because some reporters have expressed confusion   about the new terminology  So we’ve indicated that we would call it the discount rate       If the Committee has a different view, the terminology in the press   statement can be changed  In the previous system we had multiple discount rates; we had the   adjustment program, the seasonal program, and the extended program But the actions taken   were adjustments to what we termed colloquially “the discount rate”     It’s the same situation now except that it’s the primary credit rate that   we refer to as the discount rate        I would point out, Mr Chairman, that growth in currency held   domestically also has been about flat, but that had been growing relatively slowly for the last   four months Where we get the slowdown is in our estimates of the currency held abroad  That’s   a fact, not an explanation     I would point out, President Minehan, that there’s some empirical   work that suggests that hedging flows on the order that we saw over the intermeeting period   would be associated with a 20 percent rise in implied volatilities on longer-term rates  So just to   August 12, 2003 11 of 110    get a sense of perspective, hedging activity doesn’t ultimately change the level of the ten-year   rate, but it does increase the amplitude  In the magnitudes that Dino has been talking about,   that’s the rule of thumb we’ve been using     Well, like Governor Gramlich, I am not looking forward to the next   meeting       Everyone, both voting and nonvoting members of the group?     Mainly, I should issue a warning that the next meeting will be a long   day for you  We’ll reconvene the meeting after lunch to talk about both the process and the   content of the press statement  That will be the first item of discussion on communications  And   then, depending on the outcome of that discussion, we’ll ask what you’d like to talk about at the   January meeting—whether you want to consider more aspects of communications in January     I don’t know practically how to do it any other way because—      We could start at 500 pm  For someone from California that would   be easier!  [Laughter]       If that’s what you would like, we can do that       It’s also the case that they often—but not always—ask when the   meeting ended  So we may very well have to explain why the meeting has been extended if we   reconvene after lunch     If an intermeeting discussion is held, it wouldn’t be announced until   later     Okay  We will arrange a dinner on Monday before the next meeting   to discuss communications    1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that were at your seats when you came in, but you also received a copy of these  materials from me last Thursday  Please bear with me, but I’d like to begin on a note  of parliamentary procedure  It seemed to stretch to the breaking point any  interpretation of the Committee's rules to argue that members and their alternates  could gather to discuss its communication policies outside a formal meeting  The  choice, then, was to view this as an intermeeting consultation or an early start of the  September 16 meeting  If we had done the latter, our customary procedures would  seem to involve informing the press tomorrow morning that the meeting had actually  started early, risking the building-up of expectations that a major change in your  communication policy was brewing  We opted for the former because it permits an  ex post announcement of the meeting with the release of the minutes for the August  meeting on Thursday  To do this, we will circulate a draft summary of this meeting  to you tomorrow for inclusion in the minutes     I shall focus the bulk of my remarks on what appears to be many members'   immediate concern  the drafting and the content of the announcement  Those  concerns have arisen, in part, because there have been notable changes in the  announcement over the past four meetings  To facilitate your discussion on the  subject, my briefing will have four parts  First, I will offer five general principles that  the Committee may wish to weigh in choosing an announcement policy  Second, I  will review precedents established by the experience of foreign central banks and the  Committee’s own history  Third, I will suggest some options you might want to  consider on how to proceed with regard both to the process of preparing the  announcement and to the substance of the announcement  As to the latter, I will then  address some specific aspects of the language of the announcement, trying to keep the  discussion general enough to be appropriate for this evening’s discussion of the                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are attached to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 15, 2003 8 of 78    Committee’s procedures rather than tomorrow’s meeting on policy choice    Since February 4, 1994, the Committee’s discussion of communications with the   private sector has centered on the announcements of its actions  I’d note that the first  few such releases were explicitly billed as statements of the Chairman explaining the  Committee’s action  After mid-1994, though, this distinction disappeared  I am  going to assert that five principles governing the process of producing the statement  seem part of the received wisdom (or revealed preference) of the Committee, which I  list in exhibit 1       First, the process should respect the important role of discussion at the meeting    To circulate a single prospective draft announcement or several proposed alternatives  that isolate a limited number of the current features of the economy before members  have discussed their views of economic conditions and monetary policy generally  might stifle that discussion  At the same time, it is hard to imagine how nineteen  people around the Committee table could constructively edit a draft release after their  deliberations  The most repeated sentiment across the past nine years of transcripts is  that group editing cannot arrive at an acceptable result       Part of the worry, as in my second point, is that the Committee has not seemed to   want to complicate the forging of consensus on policy action  While words are  important, it is only because investors have come to expect them to be acted upon  consistently  The risk is that some disagreement in the future about a subordinate  clause in the fourth sentence of a draft release might cause a rift among members who  otherwise might agree on the policy action if not the exact words to describe its  rationale  The events of this summer have shown that the words of the announcement  can be powerful       My third observation is that you might want to take the opportunity that this   potential influence provides to increase the effectiveness of your policy actions  To  settle on a stripped-down announcement because it is hard to compromise on  anything more specific might represent an admission that the Committee is unable to  use a potentially important instrument at its disposal       Fourth, the Committee surely wants to avoid mistakes  From my experience,   drafting a press release shares some similarity with juggling chainsaws, in that you  mostly spend your time worrying about what can go wrong and then counting your  digits when you’re done  The less the time and the greater the number of last-minute  changes, the more likely there will be mistakes       Fifth, and this almost goes without saying, everyone should want to preserve the   confidentiality of the Committee’s decision until its release  I would not have raised  this but for the fact that just in the past year there have been several instances in  which we have read about the Committee’s deliberations in newsletters less than  twenty-four hours after the fact  Given that reality, the longer the time between the  decision and the announcement, the more likely it may become that there will be   September 15, 2003 9 of 78    leaks, either inadvertent or otherwise      In light of these five principles, the Committee might want to consider the five   models for drafting an announcement presented in exhibit 2  Some members might  consider the experience immediately prior to the introduction of announcements on  February 4, 1994, as relevant to today’s discussion  In those days, the Committee’s  decisions were signaled to markets through open market operations, and only those  associated with changes in the discount rate were announced to the public  Except for  discussions about the wording of the directive, which was released with a lag,  concerns about words did not intrude on deliberations  However, the Committee did  forgo a means of communicating with the public  A variant on this that you might  find appealing would be to release information limited to the Committee’s policy  decision—the intended funds rate, perhaps a simple risk assessment, and the  breakdown of the votes  The Committee would have to weigh whatever benefits are  seen accruing to its deliberations against a variety of costs, not the least including the  likely criticism that would be levied at perceived backsliding in transparency     The Committee might hope to avoid heavy criticism of a reduction in the   information content of its policy announcement by following the example of the Bank  of England listed in the second row  The Monetary Policy Committee releases a short  and direct announcement with its action and defers a more complete explanation until  the publication of its minutes about two weeks after its meeting  While stripping the  announcement of content beyond the policy action and, perhaps, a brief risk  assessment might seem a step backward on the communication front, the quicker  release of the minutes would provide a more nuanced description of policy choice  than can be done even in the current statement  That is why I placed a question mark  in the appropriate box in the third column on communications  I’m a bit more  confident that the expedited production of the minutes introduces a greater risk of  error  Because the minutes would be released while the circumstances they described  were still relevant, market participants would likely pay considerably more attention  to them than they do now  That raises the odds that news reports would latch onto  any differences of opinion that were highlighted or aspects of the outlook perhaps  underappreciated by the drafters and reviewers in the short window available to  prepare the document  As a consequence, the attention members pay to draft minutes  and probably the number of iterations in the drafting process will have to be stepped  up, with obvious implications for the schedules of nineteen busy people       If the Committee decided it was important that its announcement be accompanied   by a more complete justification, it might consider the example provided by the Bank  of Canada  As shown in the third row, policymakers at the Bank of Canada deliberate  on rate-setting and then draft the statement after the policy decision  In their case,  this means delaying the announcement until just before the opening of trading the  next day  By pushing your announcement past 215 pm, you might accommodate a  drafting session after your policy decision so as to release an announcement the same  day  That has advantages, in that the Committee’s announcement would reflect its  complete deliberations  However, an enhanced emphasis on the words of the  announcement could raise the odds that words would interfere with the Committee’s   September 15, 2003 10 of 78    achieving a consensus  Even more problematic, drafting on the fly risks making  mistakes, and lengthening the time between the decision and its announcement raises  the unwelcome specter of leaks     The Federal Reserve’s experience of the 1980s provides another model, shown in   the fourth row  At that time, the directive to the Account Manager contained  standardized concerns about the economy, but their order varied with circumstances   The Bluebook distributed to the Committee before the meeting discussed possible  alternative orderings to give members a sense of likely possibilities  In current  circumstances, the staff could identify potential themes for the description of the  economy in the first full paragraph of the announcement consistent with the policy  alternatives presented in the Bluebook (as we did in the section titled “Policy  Announcement, Directive, and Assessment of Risks” in the most recent one)  As a  further step, the Committee could standardize the language of its risk assessment in  the second full paragraph so that it would vote on what was to appear in the  announcement  In circumstances when a more substantive change in the  announcement was contemplated—say, as in March or May of this year—a memo  could be circulated in advance of the meeting no later than on Monday afternoon   Given these indications of what would appear in the announcement, members might  be more willing to defer consideration of the specific words until after the vote on the  rate decision and the risk assessment  Putting consideration of the words of the  announcement into play in advance of the vote on policy might complicate forging a  consensus, and routinizing the form of the risk assessment might limit its  effectiveness in communicating with the public  However, the Committee may well  view doing both as a reasonable compromise to ensure that its decisions are based on  full and complete information  This being the Federal Reserve, maintaining the status  quo is always an option  The Committee could routinely review a prepared draft  statement after the policy decision, with the advantages and disadvantages noted in  the bottom row     As to process going forward, of these five possibilities, implementing the models   of your Anglo-Saxon counterparts would probably require the most lead time  If you  decide to emulate the Bank of England, the Secretariat will have to speed up its  drafting schedule, which may take a meeting or two to implement  If you opt for the  Bank of Canada model, market participants would have to be given some advance  warning that the announcement would be delayed past 215 pm, perhaps in the  minutes that will be released this Thursday     Of course, the Committee could abandon or sharply reduce the content of the   statement at any time—it is only a matter of deciding when you are best positioned to  accept the criticism that may well follow  The rapidity with which you can make the  risk assessment more routine so that you could vote on what is published (as in the  fourth row) depends on whether you are comfortable with the current three-part  structure that was adopted in May  That is the first of several questions about the  content of the announcement that are flagged in your final exhibit  Again, are you  satisfied with a three-part assessment that individually lists the relative threats to your   September 15, 2003 11 of 78    goals of maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability and that weight  those threats in an overall balance?  The decision in May to split the old balance-of- risk assessment into the first two components has seemed to serve the Committee  well, as it appears now to cover all the relevant possibilities confronting the economy   But members have expressed differing opinions on the wisdom of then combining the  two different judgments in the third sentence      Individual words in the announcement also seem to have taken on different   meanings for different members at different times  In particular, as in the second  question, the Committee may want to settle on what it means by “sustainable”  economic growth  In the report of the Ferguson subcommittee in 2000, sustainable  growth seemed to serve as a stand-in for expansion at the growth rate of the  economy’s potential to produce  In more-recent announcements, the same words may  be read to imply the growth pace consistent with avoiding the creation of economic  imbalances, thereby implicitly introducing a notion of the level of economic activity  relative to the level of its potential  Members might also have concerns about  whether the word “risk” carries negative connotations that might be avoided by  speaking of the balance of probabilities or the odds of outcomes on both sides of their  median forecast  Fourth, Committee members may have doubts concerning whether  the “foreseeable” future is too slippery a concept to provide guidance to the public as  to its view of the outlook  But being specific about that time dimension now may  limit your options at a later date  Similar concerns may also be raised about “the  considerable period of time” in the last sentence of the August announcement, which  concludes my list of questions  I won’t speak about this issue beyond that because it  seems woven inextricably into the policy debate scheduled for tomorrow and is  unlikely to be a long-lasting feature of the announcement       These may be too many options to tackle at once  One strategy would be to   identify your main areas of concern and pick them off one by one in an incremental  approach over time  Another would be to use this meeting to identify problems and  charge the staff or a subcommittee to come back at a later date with more specific  alternatives  Doing so, however, may delay progress in improving the announcement  for a time  As to other issues not directly related to the announcement, the first day of  next January’s two-day meeting has been reserved to talk about the Committee’s  communication policy once again       Yes, in January     None whatsoever, Mr Chairman       I think we evolved into the current situation by working from what   was an imperfect assessment of the risks—that is, the balance of risks language  We tried first to   make that sow’s ear into a silk purse, and it didn’t quite work  Because the statements were   September 15, 2003 28 of 78    changing, it didn’t seem possible to be able to present to the Committee the exact words that   they’d be voting on  After the decision in May to split the risk assessment into two parts, with a   third sentence providing the balance—if the Committee feels that’s the appropriate structure—I   don’t think there’s any reason you couldn’t agree on a formulaic presentation of the risk   assessment that could be in the Bluebook     Everything—in the sense that the Bluebook has to be produced after   the Greenbook     It’s posted electronically Thursday night     One thing I would point out is that there’s a lot of inertia in the words   of the first paragraph on the description of the economy  So I think the Bluebook could highlight   that, if you decided to take this policy option, say, the sentence characterizing the labor markets   presumably would have to change  Implicit in that is the assurance that there would be no reason   to change a sentence that was still relevant given that policy choice  So it might not be that just   two-thirds of the words would be predicable in advance of the policy decision but closer to three-  quarters or more of the words     They all sit in the same room and have an editing session  They go   through the minutes line by line      Mr Chairman, “long-term” could be moved to the end of the   sentence   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the materials  that were distributed during your break, which may seem as if it was a long time ago   [Laughter]       I guess I could update the financial market quotes by now!  As  Dino has already related, the message from financial markets about today’s meeting  is fairly straightforward  As indicated by the path of the expected federal funds rate  in the top left panel, investors apparently anticipate that the Committee will stay with  the current level of the intended federal funds rate for about one year  As to other  aspects of today’s decision, the Domestic Desk’s survey of the twenty-two primary  dealers reported in the top right panel revealed that virtually all are betting that the  risk assessment to be announced this afternoon will be the same as that in August   Indeed, the probability that the nominal funds rate will touch a very low level in the  next five months—inferred from Eurodollar options—has receded considerably from  its height of early summer, although it has ticked up since the August employment  report  On balance, recent quotes on options produce a probability distribution for the  expected funds rate—the red bars in the middle right panel—not much different from  that prevailing just before the August meeting     Two other aspects of recent financial market experience that are shown in the   bottom panels are worth highlighting  First, the chart at the left depicts a measure of  the volatility of expected federal funds rates—the average of the absolute value of  daily changes in futures rates—across maturities measured on the horizontal scale   The average changes in futures rates over the past four months (the red bars) have  been much smaller at short maturities than has been the norm over the prior decade  (the blue bars)  Second, as shown by the bars at the bottom right, expectations about  the funds rate across the maturity structure have tended to move less on average in  response to the last four monthly surprises in the unemployment rate than was the  historical experience  Taken together, this suggests that the Committee has been able  to anchor expectations about the very near term course of policy—in effect making  them less volatile and less sensitive to revisions to the expected path of the economy     The case for contradicting those prevailing expectations by easing policy 25 basis   points at this meeting is presented in your second exhibit  As has been a feature of  the past few Greenbook forecasts, considerable resource slack is seen lingering over  the next few years  Indeed, as shown in the middle left panel, the expansion of  aggregate supply is now anticipated to be sufficiently vigorous that the  unemployment rate runs noticeably above the path projected by the staff in June,  when the Committee last eased policy  While monetary policy no doubt works with a  lag, action today should help to foster a quicker working-down of resource slack in  2004 and 2005     Another way of making this point is shown in the bottom panel  Given the staff’s   assessment of the forces impinging on the economy, the actual real federal funds rate  is not obviously below some estimates of its equilibrium value  The Committee may  harbor doubts that the expansion of aggregate demand will have as much vigor as in  the Greenbook forecast that underlies this analysis  For example, if your own  assessment of the prospects for capital spending is more similar to the “weak  investment” alternative in the Greenbook than to the baseline (including the financial  market repercussions), a ¼ point ease at this time may be viewed as desirable  As can   September 16, 2003 75 of 106    be seen by comparing the black bars of the baseline with the red bars depicting the  alternative in the middle right panel, the unemployment rate would be more than  1 percentage point higher on average over the next two years if you held policy  steady in the face of investment expanding 4 percentage points less than in the  baseline, at least according to the staff model     This scenario, however, is an alternative, not the baseline  As outlined at the top   of your next exhibit, the Committee may be willing to keep policy unchanged at this  meeting if it finds both plausible and attractive the forecast in that baseline that  inflation will hold fairly steady at around 1 percent, which might be seen as consistent  with a working definition of price stability  The Committee may be especially  inclined to keep policy unchanged, at least for now, if it thinks that there are other  sources of impetus to economic growth that may make it difficult to restrain inflation  to its current pace  In particular, as shown in the middle panel, the term structure of  nominal yields is unusually steeply sloped, at least by the experience of the past  twenty-five years  As was discussed earlier, in the staff’s view this unusual  configuration will not persist because longer-term yields edge lower as market  participants come to see that inflation pressures remain muted and monetary policy  can remain on hold for some time  But you may feel that the staff went only part way  in anticipating the market response should events in coming quarters convince  investors that both inflation and the policy rate will stay on hold  A more substantial  rally in the bond market in those circumstances would probably provide considerable  additional financial impetus to support capital spending and the housing market     The other way the yield curve could shift to a more typical configuration over   time is by its short end rising  As noted by the third bullet in the top panel, this  alternative seems part of the thinking of many market participants, who are  apparently expecting that building pressures on inflation next year will lead you to  tighten policy sooner than foreseen in the Greenbook  Some concerns in that regard  may be raised by the 50 basis point runup since June in inflation compensation  derived from the Treasury market, which is plotted in your bottom left panel  As  shown in the bottom right panel, the recent inflation forecasts of major investment  banks—listed in the second column—are generally higher than the Greenbook  projection, whereas their GDP growth projections, shown in the first column, are  uniformly weaker than the Greenbook—an observation several you have already  made  This apparently less appealing mix of output growth and inflation on Wall  Street might arise because market participants project either slower growth of  aggregate supply going forward or a less benign Phillips curve—either of which  would make holding steady seem more appropriate     In addition to its rate decision, the Committee faces nettlesome questions   regarding its assessment of risks to the outlook going forward, the subject of your  final exhibit  With three potential characterizations of risks—downside, balanced,  and upside—to two objectives (price stability, shown along the horizontal dimension,  and sustainable economic growth, shown along the vertical dimension) the current  policy announcement allows nine combinations  The Committee ended its August   September 16, 2003 76 of 106    meeting in the blue box, in which balanced risks to the growth objective and  downside risks to the inflation objective reduced to an overall assessment that the  risks were tilted to the downside  As was discussed last night, the meaning of words  does matter  If you take the phrase “sustainable economic growth” to stand in for the  growth rate of potential output, then you well may envision a transition from that blue  box to the yellow box directly below  In that case, the risks are individually  characterized as upside to sustainable economic growth and downside to inflation,  revealing the implicit judgment that the level of output probably remains below that  of its potential  The resulting balance of those two risks depends on the welfare  weights attached to those outcomes and span from upside to downside  While it  seems a stretch to consider such a change at this meeting, that shift seems more likely  in the near term than to either of the boxes highlighted in red associated with  balanced risks toward inflation, absent surprising developments     A more immediate concern is whether to retain the last sentence of the August   statement, which, as shown in the box at the lower left, held  that “the Committee  believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period”  In  last night’s meeting, most members expressed discomfort with extending some form  of commitment about the future path of the policy rate  At the same time, some noted  that, in unusual circumstances, guidance offered to market participants about near- term intentions could amplify the effectiveness of policy  It is probably the case that  the sentence about “a considerable period” helped to anchor near-term expectations  about policy in a manner reflected in the unusual behavior of futures rates I reported  on at the start of my briefing  But if you see the need for tightening closer down the  road than, say, in staff forecast, you may want to begin thinking at this time about an  exit strategy from this part of the statement  Market attention to those words and the  likely reaction were they to be excised, however, may make you hesitate to head for  that exit too abruptly     There is one aspect of the current sentence and one potential wording change that   might blunt a tendency for market participants to view the statement as a hard  promise to keep the funds rate at its current level—the notion so many of you  objected to last night  The first applies as a matter of meaning once again  The  Committee has indicated its expectation that policy can be kept accommodative for a  considerable period  Determining whether the stance of policy is accommodative is a  matter of judgment in setting the real funds rate some distance below an estimate of  its equilibrium value  In circumstances in which economic fundamentals are  improving, the stance of policy can be kept accommodative, even with increases in  the nominal policy rate, as long as the associated rising real rate does not move up  faster than the rising equilibrium real rate  It is instructive that, as shown in the lower  right panel, the Committee has been describing its policy as accommodative since  January 2002, shortly after the funds rate moved down to 1¾ percent and before two  additional policy easings  That said, market participants seem to have rebased their  view on what is accommodative to the current setting of policy  To avoid  disappointment in financial markets at some later date, it will be important that public  statements as a rule do not equate accommodative policy with the current level of the   September 16, 2003 77 of 106    nominal short rate  Second, the Committee might want to shade its current implicit  commitment away from being based on a period measured in chronological time to  one determined by economic events  For instance, the Committee could assert that its  judgment was that policy could stay accommodative for the considerable period it  currently assesses will be required to foster the containing of disinflationary  pressures  That concludes my prepared remarks        Governor Ferguson, may I just add an observation?  It is a low   inflation, low interest rate environment  It’s also one of an improving US economy     So for domestic assets it may very well be the case that investors are   thinking that recovery rates in the event of default may be better and the default risk itself may   be lower  Spreads could be narrowing independently of investors’ aversion to risk because their   perception of the risk has gone down     With regard to C&I loans, I would note that in the latest Senior Loan   Officer Opinion Survey, banks reported that demand had been weak over the last three months    That is consistent with declining inventories, although the answers to more forward-looking   questions provided a little glimmer of hope in that regard  As for the monetary aggregates, we   believe that the slowdown in mortgage refinancing has pulled down liquid deposits to a   considerable degree  We suspect that it actually pulled down M2 growth in particular—more so   than we’d previously been allowing for using our rules of thumb—and we were working in that   direction  Depending on the assumptions one makes with regard to timing—in terms of how   long the deposits sit there—much of the slowdown could be accounted for by refinancing effects   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the materials  that Carol Low handed out during the coffee break  As shown in the top left panel of  your first exhibit, investors seem to have raised the path expected for the federal  funds rate over the course of 2004  They are still counting on cumulative tightening  to bring the federal funds rate to 3 percent by the end of 2005, but they are now  betting on the Committee to be a bit quicker in getting there  That said, market  participants apparently don’t anticipate that process to begin at this meeting or the  next  Futures rates over the balance of the year are unchanged at 1 percent   Moreover, as shown in the table at the right, primary dealers do not expect any  substantive change in the economic assessment issued this afternoon  With only a  couple of exceptions, they expect you to announce that risks are balanced with  respect to your growth objectives and tilted to the downside with regard to price  stability, with the latter remaining the predominant risk       Other manifestations of this shift in expectations are given in the middle panels    The solid black line in the middle left panel plots a measure of uncertainty about the  federal funds rate expected in the next six months  For most of the summer and early  fall, investors have been relatively confident that the funds rate will remain near  current levels six months hence, no doubt importantly because of your assurances in  the statements of August and September that policy can be kept accommodative for a  considerable period  In recent weeks, though, there has been a growing sense that a  turning point may be drawing closer, and this measure of implied volatility has  moved higher  The middle right panel plots the distribution of the federal funds rate  about six months ahead derived from options quotes yesterday (the solid bars) and  just before the September meeting (the dashed line)  More weight is now being  placed on funds rates in the neighborhood of 1½ to 1¾, apparently at the expense of  odds on the funds rate holding at 1 percent or going lower  Aside from the                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   October 28, 2003 73 of 126    encouraging data on the economy, developments in financial markets may have made  investors more confident about the outlook  As can be seen in the bottom panels of  the exhibit, financial market conditions have eased considerably on net this year,  including a modest contribution made over the intermeeting period     I list this improvement in financial conditions first at the top of the next exhibit,   which outlines the case for an unchanged target federal funds rate  You may view  eased financial conditions to be one consequence of the current accommodative  stance of monetary policy  As shown in the middle panel, the real federal funds rate,  represented by the solid line, lies below the range of estimated equilibrium real rates   Indeed, a firming outlook for the economy has meant that r* is an upwardly moving  target  Keeping the real federal funds rate unchanged in such circumstances implies a  widening interest-rate gap  That may be especially troubling if you think that  pressures on resources may emerge a bit faster than the staff forecasts  As shown in  the bottom left panel, in the Greenbook projection, the near-term surprise in the level  of real GDP has been carried over the entire forecast period, the difference between  the dotted line for September and the red line for October  Particularly if you thought  that there was some risk that the most recent surprise also tilted up that red line some  or that the speed of its ascent represents looming pressures on inflation independent  of the output gap, you might be inclined, at a minimum, to keep policy on hold   Financial market participants may be expressing just those sorts of concerns in the  upward climb in inflation compensation as measured from the Treasury market (the  bottom right panel)  These measures have moved higher looking over the next five  years (the black line) and from five to ten years ahead (the red line)  Of course,  inflation compensation is a far-from-perfect proxy for inflation expectations, and  these measures have not broken noticeably out of their range of the previous four  years, but you might believe a neighborhood of 2 to 2½ percent to be on the high side  of your objective     To be sure, a pickup in pressures on inflation is not part of the staff forecast    Indeed, the case for easing 25 basis points, which is laid out at the top of exhibit 3,  could rest on the view that, as resource slack lingers, inflation may drift into an  unacceptably low region—if it is not already there  In the Greenbook baseline, the  unemployment rate, seen as a solid line in the middle left panel, makes only a gradual  approach to its natural rate of 5 percent by the end of 2005  Policy ease at this time  might be viewed as helpful in working down economic slack more quickly   Moreover, such monetary policy impetus would be welcomed after the fact if a less  robust expansion eventuates  In Part 1 of the Greenbook, the staff used the FRB/US  model to consider what would happen if the economic recovery faltered at the  beginning of next year, the implications of which are plotted as the dashed line in the  middle left panel for the unemployment rate and in the middle right panel for PCE  inflation  Worse still for the unemployment rate would be if this hesitation in  economic expansion led market participants to move up their desired compensation  for risk (the dotted lines)  In circumstances in which actual inflation is low, inflation  expectation are fairly well contained, and a sizable output gap remains, putting just a  bit of weight on the adverse outcomes of the dashed and dotted lines might incline   October 28, 2003 74 of 126    you toward policy ease  That inclination might be strengthened by the fact that  inflation is projected to fall to below ¾ percent in 2005 in either of these scenarios      Last, at recent meetings, some members took encouragement from the   performance of financial flows as evidence that there was some fundamental support  to economic growth  As reported in the bottom left panel, on a twelve-month-change  basis, M2 growth has turned down in its most recent readings  We think that relates  importantly to the effects of a slowing of mortgage refinancing on liquid deposits and  so is not a reading on the vigor of the economy, but we may be wrong  Concern  about the performance of M2 might be underscored by the fact that other financial  flows, including, as seen at the right, business loan growth, commercial paper  issuance, and bond issuance, have all been anemic of late     The remaining issue for your consideration centers on language, which is the   subject of your final exhibit  Two points of procedure about that language  First, we  included a fuller discussion of alternatives for the wording of the announcement in  the Bluebook, in the hope of getting some feedback from the members  We did get  some, and in the future we will circulate on the afternoon before the meeting a  summary of all the comments received by close of business Friday  Second, in the  Bluebook, we assumed that you intend to fit this afternoon’s statement within the  current structure and reserve any discussion of changes to that structure for later       Within that structure, the top panel repeats a table from the Bluebook and shows   that there are only a limited number of combinations of the assessments of the risks to  growth and inflation that seem plausible among the nine that are logically possible   The current words lie squarely in the blue box, in which risks to sustainable economic  growth are seen as balanced and inflation more likely to fall than not, with low  inflation being the predominant concern  While the economic outlook has improved,  much of that improvement remains a forecast, not firmly established in the data— especially so for readings on the labor market  That said, spending indicators have  shown vigor, and the most likely transition in the near term would presumably be a  move from that blue box to the yellow box, in which the risks to sustainable  economic growth are viewed as weighted to the upside  Moving the assessment on  the inflation outlook to balanced (the green box) seems likely to be a subsequent step,  given the current room for the economy to run before resource slack is worked down     The Committee’s willingness to change the language at all must presumably be   related to how it views the last sentence in the August and September announcements,  the relevant portion of which is repeated in the middle-left panel  You might be  comfortable in repeating that “policy accommodation can be maintained for a  considerable period” if you believe the Greenbook forecast is likely  The staff’s  assessment of the current shortfall of the level of aggregate demand below that of  potential aggregate supply, the likely expansion of aggregate supply over time, and  the relative unresponsiveness of inflation to diminishing slack in resource utilization  combine to suggest that the Committee could keep the funds rate at 1 percent through  2004 and foster acceptable economic performance  An examination of private-sector   October 28, 2003 75 of 126    opinions, however, may leave you with more concerns about the definition of a  “considerable period”  As shown in the middle-right panel, readings on money- market futures contracts suggest sizable weight on policy tightening that brings the  funds rate to 1¼ percent by midyear  Wall Street economists, the solid line  representing the median of a survey of investment bankers, also expect firming, but a  little bit more delayed  As outlined at the bottom left, dropping the sentence at this  meeting may risk an outsized market reaction, as investors begin to wonder if the path  for policy embedded in futures rates is not aggressive enough for your taste  One  possibility would be to convert the reference from calendar to economic time  That  is, the Committee=s definition of a considerable period could be made contingent  upon the outlook for further disinflation  One such possibility, given at the bottom  right, would have the statement read that “the Committee believes that policy  accommodation can be maintained for the considerable period it currently assesses  will be required to foster the moderation of disinflationary pressures”  The  Committee considered such a change at the September meeting, felt it to be a close  call, and ultimately decided that altering the language would draw more attention than  warranted  You may feel yourself still to be in that position at this meeting       Well, I would say that, on one level, rapid growth in aggregate supply   only raises the bar for the growth of aggregate demand that the Committee should desire to get   the outcomes it wants  So in that sense, there still could be unwelcome declines in inflation     But they would not be associated with problems relating to the   economic expansion  In general the linking of “unwelcome” and “disinflation” or “a pickup in   inflation” may pose a problem in the current structure of this language  It’s a problem that   October 28, 2003 76 of 126    President Stern also referred to in his discussion of disinflation as not necessarily being   problematic  But I would say that, from the Committee’s perspective, a decline in inflation from   current levels, while perhaps not posing a threat of serious damage to the economy if it is due to   a rapid increase in the aggregate supply, may send the inflation rate below your longer-run   objective     In that regard, you do have your other assessment to separate the   distinction between less unwelcome and more unwelcome  An unwelcome decline in inflation   that was associated with a growing resource gap would presumably be closer to those pernicious   deflations that members have expressed concern about in the past  A decline in inflation   associated with balanced economic growth or even upward pressures on economic growth would   have different implications for policy  One thing that’s fairly clear to me in working on the   communication policy is that Committee members really want a lot of different toggle switches   in the statement to express contingencies like this     I view that as a serious problem with the current structure of the   language  In the proposals discussed in the two memos that I circulated, I separated out the first   two statements as being declarative statements about your forecast couched in probability   terms—the probability of inflation rising or falling and the probability of growth above or below   a sustainable rate  Then I ladled in the welfare judgments, the judgments about relative costs in   your objective function  That is, everything that relates to risk management in a central bank is   put into that third sentence      What I propose, Mr Chairman, is for everybody to go get lunch and   come back to the table  When everyone settles down, I can read some brief remarks, and then   we can proceed with the discussion     3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  called “Briefing on FOMC Communications Policy” that Carol Low handed out  while you were getting lunch  One of my favorite quotes, which offers some  perspective on my work on the Committee=s communication policy over the past few  months, comes from William of Orange, who held that “you need not hope to  undertake nor succeed to persevere”  When it comes to the structure of the  Committee’s assessment of the outlook, I can report to the members that your  Secretary has undertaken and persevered but sees little hope of success  To raise the  odds just a bit, I would appreciate it if you would use the time until 200 pm to  provide some feedback on a few key issues     To facilitate that discussion, I have listed in the first exhibit some alternative ways   of assessing risks  I started with the pre-March balance-of-risks language to establish  that some progress in the Committee’s communication has been made  The second                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   October 28, 2003 87 of 126    panel gives the current wording, the next is the proposal in my memo dated  October 22, and the last is the suggestion of Governor Gramlich circulated at that  same time  These panels are for your reference  What I will focus on are the four  questions listed in exhibit 2  In particular, do you have a clear preference for the risk  assessment among the various proposals that have circulated?  If there is a basic  structure identified today, then the task of homing in on specific language will be  easier       Second, in that process it would be helpful if the Committee provided guidance as   to whether it wants a bilateral or a multilateral approach to arriving at new language   By that I mean that I can get feedback from the members individually and iterate on  new drafting language or I can look for opportunities to schedule a discussion of these  matters by the full Committee  A middle ground would be to consider charging a  subcommittee with the task, but only a few members have expressed enthusiasm for  that       Third, how much importance do you place on wrapping up this issue quickly?    Many of you have expressed concurrence with postponing the adoption of new  language, often with the comment that you’d rather have it done right than done  quickly  A countervailing consideration, however, is the observation that the  economy seems to be improving, perhaps at a pace that would make you anticipate  changing at least some part of the risk assessment in the near future  If so, there is a  question of sequencing  Do you want to grapple with modifying the existing  language to express a new tilt, or would such a transition be an appropriate time to  adopt a new structure?     Fourth, when do you want to talk about this next?  Looking at the calendar, there   are three immediate opportunities  I could set aside time on the December 9 agenda  after the policy decision to consider the matter, and you could decide perhaps not to  be bound by the 200 pm deadline  I could arrange a dinner meeting on December 8,  the night before that meeting  Third, this could be the subject of the discussion on the  Tuesday afternoon of your next two-day meeting in late January  With any of those  options, though, you might want to take into consideration how the public will react  to news that the Committee is once again talking about communications, especially if  you are not certain that the conversation will bring closure, at least for now       The first question is, Is there any clear preference as to the basic   structure of the assessment of the outlook?     October 28, 2003 88 of 126      Although what you agreed on formally were instructions to the   drafters of the statement  I think in the proposal—      What Normand read was from the page in the Bluebook     The proposal was that, when you decide on a risk assessment, what   you vote on would be what appears in the directive  I think everyone agreed to that  The   problem for this meeting operationally was that, if you decided to adopt language that differs   from what you used at the last meeting, we would not have known what the alternative would be     Mr Chairman, in answer to President Moskow’s question, I would   make one observation  The Bank of England is the model for this approach, and they get their   minutes out in two weeks  They also have the advantage that everybody in the policy group is in   the same building, so they sit down and devote a half-day to editing the minutes line by line    The original assumption with regard to the January discussion on communications was that we’d   have this issue of the statement behind us by then  Our intention was to talk in January about the   early release of the minutes and an expanded use of the central tendency forecast  The forecast   would have a big role in the process because the forecast appears in the minutes and if the   minutes are out earlier, the forecast will be, too  The staff is preparing two documents related to   that  Right now the communication agenda is rather crowded, and any guidance as to   sequencing would be helpful     I think your next Secretary, Mr Chairman, will have a challenge    [Laughter]   October 28, 2003 108 of 126      We are preparing a document on the early release of the minutes     Of whom?   October 28, 2003 109 of 126      I don’t know the answer to that, Mr Chairman  I suspect it’s related   to the fact that the tape recording equipment is in this room  But that is something that we can   address      I would point out, Governor Ferguson, that financial economists refer   to observed equity premiums historically in the neighborhood of 500 to 600 basis points as the   equity risk premium puzzle  The fact that it’s now a little high in the range that has prevailed   over the last decade doesn’t put it well out of the range of the last century or so  Economists   have a hard time understanding the pricing of equities importantly because it depends on risk   aversion and expectations  So I’m not sure that I’d feel comfortable saying that what we’re   observing now is particularly at variance with the historical norm     The other point I’d add, President Moskow, is that the difference   between the nominal and the indexed yield is inflation compensation that includes both inflation   expectations and an inflation risk premium  So it wouldn’t be that far-fetched to say that, while   market participants may not believe that the Committee’s views on longer-term inflation   expectations are materially different, people in the markets might be a little more uncertain about   whether that’s the case They might well have greater uncertainty about that, given various   comments about the range of views among Committee members in terms of how they interpret   their longer-run inflation goals     There are two points to make about that, Mr Chairman  The first is   that we do think the TIPS market is more liquid  That’s in part a reflection of the fact that more   instruments are tied to TIPS, including some exchange-traded products that are priced relative to   TIPS  So that provides more liquidity and more opportunities to trade, and there are more   mutual funds that use those products  So we think it’s a more liquid instrument and that is   associated with the declining bid–asked spreads and the increased trading volume     I’d also point out that one of the other briefings yesterday looked at the inflation   compensation measures from the euro market, Canada, and the United Kingdom  As was noted,   there was a considerable synchronicity to the run-up in inflation compensation in those markets    That would make one think that perhaps there was something about the overall liquidity and   arbitrage across those markets rather than an unraveling of investors’ confidence in the long-term   inflation target of three different central banks     In terms of implied forward rates?     Over the intermeeting period that forward rate structure really hasn’t   changed much at all     They don’t in part because the inflation risk premium and the   potential for differential term premiums between the indexed and the nominal securities drive—     Right  So one can’t read it as an inflation premium  We’ve found   historically that the slope of the term structure does not do a particularly good job in forecasting   either activity or inflation  There’s a little information on the further-ahead forward rates but not   a lot  It is the case that the very far ahead forward rates were up a bit up over the intermeeting   period  But the ten-year was actually down  So it isn’t as if there are some obvious sets of   signals there  Nor is it the case if you look at volatilities that we could get from swaptions  The   implied volatilities on ten-year instruments are higher, but all interest rate volatilities are a little   higher       And that’s where we are expending a lot of effort to try to figure it   out      I have nothing to add   2       Thank you, Governor Ferguson  I’ll be referring to the  material called “The Committee’s Communication Strategy” that was handed out to  you before the start of the meeting     Next week marks the tenth anniversary of the Committee’s first public explication  of a change in its intended federal funds rate not associated with a change in the  discount rate  But increased openness has not been a US phenomenon alone   Across the industrial world and in many emerging-market economies, monetary  policy makers now provide real-time information on their forecasts, the risks to  those forecasts, and their goals and objectives, often accompanied by narratives  explaining their strategies  These come in the form of statements, policy (often  called inflation) reports, and regular press conferences     The Committee has been riding that wave of increasing communications  In some   ways, it has been ahead of other central banks  For example, no other policymaking  body immediately releases the vote tally at its meetings  However, in other ways,  the Committee has not been at the leading edge  On page 2 of your handout, I  provide a reason why you may have felt it important to be measured in changing  your information policy  Your words matter  The bars plot the market response—as  measured by the change in the two-year Treasury yield in narrow windows  surrounding the events—around the release of the Committee’s statement (the top   2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 27-28, 2004 12 of 238    left panel), its minutes (the bottom left panel), and the Chairman’s semiannual  testimony (the top right panel) since 1997  (The reason I describe the top left panel  as exclusively the response to the statement is that I have used federal funds futures  rates to strip out the portion of any market surprise about the level of the funds rate)   The responses both to statements and to testimonies have been sizable  Except for  the most recent release, though, minutes have tended to be much less of a market  event—presumably because of their publication lag  As shown in the table at the  bottom right, your statements and the Chairman’s testimonies have had effects on  market prices that, on average, have been as large as those associated with releases  on the employment situation and larger than those associated with the publication of  data on the ISM index or consumer prices       Another point to make about your ten-year experience with statements  At least   as can be judged from the transcript of your meeting on February 4, 1994,  Committee members may not have fully appreciated that they were setting a  precedent with a public announcement  In the event, the response to that short  paragraph was so positive, you could not go back to signaling policy changes  through open market operations  That might be a lesson to remember as I outline  various potential changes to your communications strategy in the rest of my briefing     Page 3 gives a roadmap of the rest of my remarks  The options confronting the   Committee are interrelated  To facilitate your discussion, my briefing will have five  parts  I intend to lay out the range of plausible options before the Committee at the  outset and then speak about them in more detail  Those include alternative formulas  for the risk assessment of your statement—that is, I will report on the progress of the  working group chaired by Governor Ferguson  Then I will discuss the pros and cons  of expedited release of the minutes, which were given more completely in the memo  by Brian Madigan that I circulated, and of an enhanced role for the FOMC  projections, which were examined in a memo by Benson Durham  I will end about  where I start by repeating the “Chinese menu” of possibilities so that you can begin  the hard work of determining how the pieces might fit together     Your first look at that Chinese menu is provided on page 4, which gives a broad   overview of options across three main communication issues on today’s agenda   The left column lists the possibilities for the paragraph in the Committee’s statement  that gives an assessment of risks to the outlook expressing a probabilistic assessment  of the uncertainty surrounding the dual goals of inflation and output  To some, this  serves to hint at the direction of future policy without offering a commitment  This  being a central bank, it is always an option to maintain the status quo in which the  drafters start from a formulaic assessment of the risks to inflation and output but  have some discretion in the exact wording—with the expectation that the result will  preserve the three-part assessment of risks used since May  This approach allows  some consultation with Committee members through the Bluebook       The option dubbed “gradual evolution” involves expanding both aspects of the   process by allowing more discretion to the drafters to alter the words according to   January 27-28, 2004 13 of 238    evolving economic conditions and to provide more discussion of the words of the  statement in the Bluebook  However, there would be an explicit expectation of  including a forward-looking aspect to the statement and an assessment of risks,  except on those rare occasions, as last March, when no such assessment could  reasonably be made  If you would like, we could structure the forward-looking  portion of the Bluebook around two or three draft announcements keyed to  conveying to the public possible changes in either the outlook or policy  Those  alternatives would provide the basis for your policy discussion and vote, and one of  them—with whatever last-minute changes you wanted—would be released to the  public  If events between the publication date of the Bluebook and the Committee  meeting changed the situation sufficiently, we would circulate a Bluebook  supplement that suggested more appropriate wording      Another set of possibilities is to adopt new formulaic language, as you had with   the “balance of risks” from 2000 to early last year  In just a bit I will report on the  three formulas that the working group forwarded to the full Committee  Lastly, you  could choose to discontinue the assessment of risks portion of the statement,  accepting that substantial criticism would ensue for backsliding away from  openness  In principle, that need not be backsliding if the Committee decided to  alter some of the other margins of its communication policy  Of course, such other  changes also may be viewed as desirable in conjunction with retention of the risk  assessment  One possibility would be to expedite the release of the minutes, the  subject of the middle column  About two weeks is the barest minimum required for  the Secretariat to draft, circulate for comments, and release finished minutes, but you  may see some benefit in providing a bit wider cushion by releasing minutes, say,  three or four weeks after each meeting  Another possibility is to enhance the role of  the economic projections of the Governors and Bank Presidents as outlined in the  right column  You might want to increase the frequency with which the survey is  conducted, lengthen the projection period, or increase the number of variables  projected  You might want to continue to release those projections in the Monetary  Policy Report, but they could also be part of expedited minutes or the subject of a  separate release     As you could probably tell from the thirty-page memo that circulated last week,   the working group and its staff devoted considerable attention to alternative  formulaic language  Page 5 reviews some of the key lessons learned  In particular,  members settled on six important design principles that any formula should satisfy   (1) Good governance suggests that the Committee should vote on the exact wording  of the risk assessment  (2) The statement should not hamper the policy discussion,  nor should the Committee feel constrained in its choice of action by a formula   (3) The statement should be flexible enough to encompass the Committee members’  views about the operation of the economy and the concepts that can be usefully  measured  (4) The statement should be clear to the public, or at least as much as it is  possible for central bankers to endeavor to be  (5) The statement should cover the  range of feasible contingencies so that the formula would last, if not for the ages, at  least a few years  (6) The statement should avoid the use of potentially charged   January 27-28, 2004 14 of 238    terms, such as “risk,” when referring to outcomes that may be seen as positive  For  example, the statement should not convey the mis-impression that the Committee is  against strong economic growth for its own sake     While the working group settled on these six principles fairly quickly, three   questions remained unresolved, which are provided in the column at the right  In  particular      •  Should the wording of the risk assessment be in terms of the levels of output  and inflation or their changes?  Conveying a sense of levels may make it easier to  describe economic performance relative to the benchmarks of potential output and  the Committee’s inflation goal  However, such specificity may be seen as a  drawback because there is a range of opinion among members about appropriate  benchmarks     •  What conditioning assumption for monetary policy should be employed?  The  forecast could be based on the assumption of unchanged interest rates, as was the  case with the old balance of risks language, but that presents problems for  projections far into the future should that assumption diverge significantly from  what is built into financial market prices  The alternative would be to assume a  historically normal policy path; but if the Committee does not reveal that  assumption, the public may have difficulty understanding the message of the risk  assessment    •  Over what period should the outlook and risks be considered?  A shorter  period—that is, the next several quarters—has the advantage of limiting the  factors that influence the outlook  However, such a horizon may not be sufficient  if you think the lags in the transmission of policy are substantial, suggesting that  you should look forward to the foreseeable future     Confronted with different potential reasonable answers to these questions, the   working group narrowed the field of potential formulas to three  two stated in terms  of levels but differing as to the policy assumption and period, and a third stated in  terms of changes  I should note that the three alternatives do not explicitly mention  the conditioning policy assumption  In principle, that design feature could be  conveyed to the public when the new policy is announced and mentioned  periodically in the minutes as a reminder  The “levels A” alternative is provided on  page 6, with the left column repeating what was in the memo you received on  January 20  As noted in red in the text and highlighted at the right, this alternative is  stated in terms of levels of inflation and economic activity and makes explicit  reference to benchmarks for inflation and output  While the paragraph is silent about  the conditioning assumption for policy, it is based on an assumption of “normal”  policy  In addition, as shown in blue, the horizon is “several quarters,” but outcomes  are described relative to paths that extend further into the future  The “levels B”  alternative provided on page 7 shares a focus on levels and explicit benchmarks (as  noted in red at the right) but differs in two important dimensions  First, while it is   January 27-28, 2004 15 of 238    also silent about the policy assumption, the drafters assumed that the implicit  forecast is based on an unchanged policy stance  Second, as shown in blue, the  horizon is “the foreseeable future,” that elastic concept borrowed from the old  balance of risks language  The “changes” alternative given in the left column of  page 8 focuses, as indicated in red at the right, on changes in output relative to  potential and changes in inflation  Presumably, if the Committee saw fit, the prior  paragraph of the statement that describes economic conditions could refer to levels  and benchmarks  As in the “levels B” alternative, this formula is based on the  undisclosed assumption of unchanged policy and applies to the foreseeable future     Staff subjected these three alternatives to a variety of stress tests to gauge their   performance both in scenarios that seem likely in the near future and that have  challenged the Committee in the past  I am not revealing any secrets of the working  group by indicating on page 9 that problems emerged with all three formulas  In  particular, measurement issues arise when words with vague or multiple meanings  are used, such as the “long-run trend of potential” or “long-run sustainable pace” or  even an unquantified notion of “price stability” In addition, you may feel  uncomfortable about the clarity of any statement that relies on words such as “path  consistent with,” which may admit many possible trajectories, or “the foreseeable  future,” which, for some, appears to have meant a period as short as the intermeeting  period and to others a period measured in years  Lastly, the conditioning assumption  used in the implicit forecast introduces a fundamental question as to the purpose of  the risk assessment  Do you want to send hints about the future direction of rates  (which seems easier to do with the assumption of unchanged policy), or are you  conveying qualitative information about the fan chart surrounding your forecast (as  seems the case with the assumption of “normal policy” or the related assumption of  “appropriate policy”)?  The working group decided that its mandate was to present  information to allow the Committee to determine an acceptable tradeoff among the  various pitfalls, recognizing that abandoning an attempt to arrive at a formula is also  an option       No doubt, this decision also interacts with any you might make about expediting   the release of the minutes, the subject of page 10  Central banks that do release  minutes before their next scheduled meeting, such as the Monetary Policy  Committee of the Bank of England, stress advantages such as a desire to provide  more timely information to the public consistent with their responsibility to be  transparent and accountable  In addition, minutes provide a platform to present the  outlook and policy strategy in a more nuanced fashion than is possible in an  immediately released statement  And relevant to my earlier discussion, expedited  minutes may make you more comfortable in trimming the statement      The disadvantages mostly seem related to possible effects on Committee   dynamics and other aspects of your communication policies over time  You might  be concerned that, as the minutes increase in market importance because they are  released in real time, mention in the minutes would be viewed as a chip in the  bargaining process in arriving at a policy decision  The quality of the minutes might   January 27-28, 2004 16 of 238    suffer over time if they were “scrubbed” to mitigate potential market reaction  In  particular, you might be hesitant about including conditional statements in the  minutes, such as a desire to change policy at the next meeting if intervening data run  in a certain direction or to hold an intermeeting conference call  The bottom line is  that experience has shown that market participants tend to overreact to contingent  statements, and fear of possible inappropriate market response might be viewed as a  decided negative  In addition, the Committee, and future Committees, would have to  exercise some self-discipline so as not to succumb to the temptation of using the  minutes to send signals in response to developments after the meeting     Some thought would also have to be given as to the timing of the release of the   minutes, particularly on those occasions twice a year when the Chairman delivers the  Monetary Policy Report to the Congress  Indeed, as a general principle, the prospect  of creating an additional news event in which market participants and reporters await  some fixed release from the FOMC may seem especially daunting  And in that  regard, the Committee may want to review its policy regarding blackout periods so  that the release of the minutes marks the first news about the thinking of  policymakers at the previous meeting     Twice a year, the minutes include the central tendencies and the ranges of the   Governors’ and Bank Presidents’ forecasts of key macroeconomic variables  Early  release of the minutes naturally raises the question of the role of those projections, as  is discussed on page 11  There are several margins over which the Committee could  enhance the role of those forecasts  In particular, you might want to (1) increase the  frequency of the survey to every meeting or every quarter; (2) increase the length of  the projection period, thereby giving the public some sense of the Committee’s  views of the longer-term prospects for the economy; (3) increase the number of  variables in the projections, perhaps to include core PCE inflation, which seems  central to the deliberations of the Committee  Indeed, you might view the  projections as a means of conveying to the public your view of the longer-term  elements essential for policy, such as the growth rate of potential output and your  individual working definitions of price stability, and perhaps the degree of  uncertainty about that outlook, by including the width of uncertainty bands about  each variable forecasted  The latter might be particularly attractive, as wide bands  would reinforce that monetary policy is as much about controlling potential risks  when a forecast, almost inevitably, does not come true as it is about making  projections  At a practical level, the Committee will also have to decide whether it is  appropriate to separate its projections from the Monetary Policy Report and  testimony     The pros of an enhanced role of the projections given at the top right should seem   familiar  By getting them out earlier, you would be providing more-timely  information to the public, both about your central tendencies and range of opinion,  thereby increasing transparency and accountability  Some might find a particular  attraction in substituting a survey of numbers that is mechanical for the risk- assessment portion of the statement, which requires consensus  The cons relate   January 27-28, 2004 17 of 238    mostly to the Committee’s process and market participants’ interpretations  You  will have several decisions as to whether the forecasts should be included in the  minutes of the meetings, can be revised after meetings, or their release augmented  with explanatory text  The public might not understand the conditional nature of the  projections and ascribe to them more weight than they actually receive in the policy  process, thereby creating another news event in intermeeting periods and impairing  your reputation as forecast errors cumulate     With the last page in your package, I deliver on my promise to end where I   started  Page 12 repeats the Chinese menu and underscores that I am seeking  direction from the Committee on all aspects of its communications policy  Many of  the options that are listed will require much more staff work to arrive at a solution  acceptable to the Committee  That is, the discussion to follow will not be the end of  work on communications policy, but I am hopeful that it is the end of the beginning  of work on communications policy        We did the easy part of the experiment, which was the staff side    Well, it may not have been easy for the people actually drafting the minutes  We created a rough   draft by about this time next week  We’ll do that again  The harder part of the experiment is   resolving how you will comment on the draft  Will you want to see other members’ comments?    January 27-28, 2004 48 of 238    How will you know that the Secretary has incorporated your comments and weighed various   suggestions against each other?  How will we deliver it to you electronically in a secure manner?    So there is some work to do  Also, we need to think about the rules associated with the   production of the minutes, such as the deadline for submitting comments and other items of that   nature       I think we have already crossed that bridge     There have been times when they are not even included in the   testimony  In the last ten years the Chairman has almost never referred to them in the reading   draft of the testimony, but there have been times when they haven’t even been in the text of the   formal testimony submitted  They are always in the report     In the last report we significantly trimmed back the discussion in the   testimony  Basically we just presented the table, did the table reading, and did not offer an   interpretation     I would say that there are basically two things that go wrong with   regard to the testimony process  One is that occasionally there will be questions such as  Six   months ago you were forecasting this, and it didn’t happen  What went wrong?     The second is that the forecasts are numbers, and it’s easy for   reporters to characterize them  So sometimes the newspaper articles that come out after the   testimony are not what we would have expected because the reporters latch on only to the   numbers     It was an open question because the Committee had established a   precedent and they interpreted “prospects” to mean these forecast numbers  But the issue isn’t   whether you will be sued; it’s whether you’ll get a worse outcome when the Congress pushes   back   6       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that Carol Low is handing out  There is a Zen koan—which is a meditation riddle  spelled K-O-A-N, not a relative of the Governor—that holds that the most difficult  act of all is to do nothing well  This sentiment seems to apply to today’s meeting   As can be seen in the top right panel of your first exhibit, market participants have  scaled back the path expected for the federal funds rate as much as ½ percentage  point in 2005, with the nominal funds rate seen opening 2006 at 3 percent  This path  of the expected funds rate is consistent with a probabilistic assessment that the  median expected date of the start of tightening, seen as the peak of the dashed line at  the right, rose from around five months to about ten months, the solid line  As judged  by options on money market futures (shown in the middle left by the red bars plotting  the implied probability distribution that prevailed yesterday), investors are somewhat  surer that the funds rate will trade around 1 percent six months hence than they were  at the time of the December meeting (the dashed line)  While considerable weight is  placed on the possibility that policy will firm, some weight—and more than at the last  meeting—is placed on policy easing  In the latest survey of primary dealers  conducted by the Desk, the greatest number of respondents judged—as shown at the  middle right—that the onset of tightening would take place in the second half of this  year, although a sizable portion thought it would come sooner or later than that       As to the specifics of the statement to be released this afternoon, as shown in the   bottom left panel just one primary dealer foresees a change in the assessment of  output risks, and only a couple more view the risks to inflation as anything but  balanced  In that regard, I would not view that consensus on balanced inflation risks  as a change in your assessment  While the Committee’s last statement indicated a  balance slightly skewed toward lower rather than higher inflation, market participants  mostly interpreted this as “balanced”  Thus, the four respondents calling for  “downside” risks are more likely predicting that you will scale back the current  setting toward odds favoring disinflation  The staff has interpreted a goodly portion  of the rally in financial markets over the intermeeting period as resulting from a   6 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)   January 27-28, 2004 167 of 238    downward shift in market expectations toward our assumption that policy tightening  will not take place until next year  That there remains considerable mass on the  possibility of earlier tightening embedded in financial market prices implies that there  is a potential for the rally to be extended as expectations correct more to the  Greenbook baseline  Why market participants might still expect earlier and more- significant firming is evident in the bottom right panel  A survey of economists at  eight dealers indicates that their outlook for inflation is decidedly less subdued than  the staff’s, even with a growth forecast that is less robust than the staff’s  A distinct  possibility is that many in the market have a gloomier view of the prospects for the  growth of aggregate supply, a point that came out in the exchange between President  Poole and Dave Stockton       One of the more interesting market developments over the intermeeting period   was the further decline in yields on Treasury indexed debt, seen in the top left panel  of your second exhibit as the shift from the dotted to the solid line  The real yield  curve remains steeply upward sloped, but this has prevailed because both short- and  longer-term yields, shown in the top right panel, have moved lower  These  movements have two implications relevant for setting policy  For one, the low level  of longer-term TIPS yields may signal that real rates need to be very low to  encourage private spending, suggesting that forces of restraint still loom large,  including an equity premium on the high side of historical experience and a desire on  the part of households to raise the saving rate to something more in line with  historical norms  If the Committee puts much weight on such possibilities, it might  be inclined to ease policy, or at least to project a willingness to do so, as is the subject  of the middle left panel  In particular, a sense on your part that business confidence  would remain impaired might lead you to seek a policy offset  While the anecdotes  about spending are encouraging, firms have yet to put their money where their  mouths are when it comes to new hiring or additions to inventory stocks  The recent  sluggish performance of the monetary and credit aggregates, shown in the table at the  bottom left, may raise your discomfort level on that score  Another possibility is that  we are seeing additional once-off increases in productivity that, as the simulations in  the Greenbook and the extended scenarios in the Bluebook suggested, imply that the  increase in aggregate supply is actually outstripping that of aggregate demand,  thereby generating additional resource slack and putting further downward pressure  on inflation  Even if you are satisfied that spending has settled onto a sustainable and  acceptable upward track, the recent sluggish readings on inflation may be worrisome,  either because they suggest that the level of inflation is already on the low side of  your preferred range or that it may be poised to go lower      The second implication follows from the steepness of the indexed debt yield   curve, which could be taken as a measure of the gap between the currently very low  real short-term rate and its longer-run equilibrium value  If aggregate demand is  sluggish, then such a configuration would be appropriate  However, you might be  concerned that—as related in the middle right panel, which makes the case for policy  firming—too much financial accommodation is in place  If the Committee was  comfortable with the level of the nominal funds rate at its December meeting, it might   January 27-28, 2004 168 of 238    believe that, as in the bottom right panel, the decline in longer-term yields, the run-up  in share values, and the depreciation of the dollar since then warrant a policy offset,  as President Geithner was mentioning  Such concerns would be more intense if you  believed that the staff was a bit too optimistic about the prospects for inflation to  remain subdued  If events unfold similarly to the “more inflation pressures” scenario  in the Bluebook, the Committee would probably want to begin firming sometime  soon       Of course, there is an obstacle in doing so  The last sentence of your past four   statements held that policy could be kept accommodative for a considerable period,  thereby constraining the flexibility of your actions  But as related in exhibit 3, such a  constraint may not really be binding on your current rate decision  In particular, the  case for keeping policy on hold could rest squarely on your confidence and  satisfaction with the general contours of the staff forecast, in which the economy is  expected to grow briskly, resource slack to narrow, and core PCE inflation to remain  at around its current level  Indeed, in the alternative long-run simulations reported in  the Bluebook and repeated in the bottom four panels, the nominal funds rate could  remain at 1 percent until next year if the Committee’s inflation goal were 1 percent  (the black lines) or until 2006 if the goal were 1½ percent (the blue lines)  Given the  limitations of our ability to model the economy, such simulations are really only for  illustrative purposes  Your policy decision involves weighing a variety of costs and  benefits in a probabilistic setting  And in that regard, 1 percent may look like an  appropriate level for the funds rate if you view the costs associated with a firmer  policy—should you be wrong about aggregate demand expanding vigorously—as  large relative to those incurred by running a little easier policy and risking a more  vigorous expansion if aggregate demand proves more robust than you now expect   Committee members might be reassured in that regard from the fact that measures of  longer-term inflation expectations, the top right panel, remain subdued as well as  from the staff’s assessment that resource slack remains considerable and that potential  output will be a target that is moving rapidly upward  However, as opposed to the  past few meetings—given the buoyancy of financial markets—you might be less  confident about that tradeoff going forward, and therefore be more reluctant to make  promises about your future action, which brings me to your final exhibit       At times over the past six months, members have chaffed at the constraint   imposed by the commitment to keep policy accommodative for a considerable period   But by being explicit to the public about this self-imposed constraint, you did help  limit the tendency of market participants to build in unhelpfully aggressive  expectations of policy firming, thereby keeping financial conditions accommodative  at a time when you might have been concerned about the efficacy of alternative  monetary policy actions  In the event, the expansion of aggregate demand did not  falter, and there was no need to dig deeper into the toolkit of policymaking  But the  fact that insurance was not needed ex post does not imply that it was unwise to  purchase it ex ante        January 27-28, 2004 169 of 238    Three options for the wording of the statement are laid out in the middle panel   For one, you could decide to retain the sentence, which would be particularly  appealing if you were confident that the economy was likely to evolve in a relatively  benign manner at an unchanged funds rate for some time, as in the staff forecast   That option would be even more appealing if you thought inflation was currently on  the low side of your desired outcome  In addition, as President Moskow and  Governor Bernanke have pointed out, the news on the conditioning elements of the  statement—inflation and slack—moved in a way over the intermeeting period that  would seem to have extended the considerable period  And that is how the markets  took those developments as well  Given that most market participants appear to  expect retention of the “considerable period” sentence, you might want more time to  prepare the way more for its deletion, perhaps using the opportunity provided by the  Chairman’s upcoming semiannual testimony  As another possibility, you could drop  the sentence, as would be appropriate if you either anticipated tightening within the  next few meetings or were no longer confident that you could rule it out  If you  viewed aggregate demand as growing along a self-sustaining track and were worried  that inflation pressures might pick up, you might welcome a check on the extent of  financial stimulus  Even if the Committee put low odds on tightening policy  sometime soon, it might view either delaying needed tightening or reneging on its  commitment should inflation pressures pick up as sufficiently damaging to its  credibility to warrant dropping the sentence preemptively     But if you are concerned that the reaction to dropping the sentence might be   outsized, a third option would be to soften the sentence  In the Bluebook, we  suggested adopting the notion of “patience” that the Chairman introduced in a recent  speech, which market participants would probably take as implying that the  Committee viewed events as such that it could be gradual in firming policy  We  suggested the sentence  “With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the  Committee believes that it can be patient in adjusting the very accommodative stance  of monetary policy”  In the feedback I’ve gotten since the publication of the  Bluebook, some members expressed concern that describing policy as very  accommodative, which has not been a feature of previous statements, might be taken  as too strong a signal that significant tightening would soon be under way  Another  possibility, as shown in the bottom panel, would be to have the Committee  characterize itself as “patient in removing its policy accommodation”  I would  advise, however, that you run the statement through a spell checker, something I  forgot to do  That concludes my prepared remarks       Well, you are right  The estimates of r* have moved up rather   sizably, as you can see in the bottom panel of chart 8 in the Bluebook  The estimate from   FRB/US is up about 1 percentage point, meaning that the gap between actual r and r* is bigger   than you thought over the prior two years and that the current stance of policy is more   accommodative than you thought  I think the revision relates to a couple of things—in part the   benchmark revisions and a rethinking of saving behavior but also that the estimate of the risk   premium in equity prices is higher     I think the other thing to note when you look at that chart is that the   band is wider as well  Our uncertainty about r* is very sizable     Mr Chairman, the Committee did vote on the exact words of the   press statement  If you intend to do that in the future, that is another piece of positive news that   Michelle can relay  And that will be in the minutes     But you voted on the risk-assessment paragraph       Well, at the last Bond Market Association meeting—or rather the   time before—the significance of not voting on that wording was an issue that was raised       The contours of the chart would be the same if one used the ten-year-  ahead forward rate less, say, the one-year-ahead forward rate  The amplitude would be higher,   and the spread would wind up at something like 5⅛ percent   2  Mr Chairman, in front of you is a chart of the forward rate yield   curve that you spoke about during Dino’s briefing The red line is the ten-year-ahead one-year-  forward rate less the one-year rate, and the black line duplicates the line that Dino showed on his   chart  And, yes, it is the case that the spread is quite high when we look at it in forward rate   terms, and the amplitude of the swings is greater                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   March 16, 2004 54 of 107    3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that was just handed out  This is another meeting about words, not action  Your  discussion about policy would seem likely to center on how to characterize the  economic situation and risks to the outlook so as to retain your flexibility going  forward  As is evident in the current readings on federal funds futures plotted in the  top left panel of the first exhibit, over the intermeeting period market participants  moved closer to the staff’s assumption that the funds rate will hold at 1 percent for the  remainder of the year  Indeed, futures quotes are now consistent, as shown in the top  right panel, with the onset of tightening being pushed back about three months—to  sometime near year-end       This message is similar to what primary dealer respondents reported to the   Domestic Desk in a survey last week (the middle left panel)  All twenty-three dealers  anticipate that the stance of policy will remain unchanged at this meeting, and about  one-third expect no action until 2005  The dealers apparently do not anticipate any  significant change in the language of your announcement, either  It is also worth  noting, as in the middle right panel, that market participants are fairly confident about  the near-term path of short-term rates, at least as judged by the low level of volatility  implied by options on Eurodollar futures  This strongly held sense in markets that  policy will be on hold for some time, along with the phrasing of the last  announcement—and the sense of quietude in many of the telegrams on the discount  rate sent in by the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks in the past few days— explains the lack of policy alternatives in the Bluebook, a document with the official  title “Monetary Policy Alternatives” To provide some perspective, the bars in the  bottom panel parse the reaction in markets at your meetings over the past five years  into that owing to the surprise on the policy rate and the residual, which presumably  is due to the words of your statement  The message to take from the chart is that  words seem to figure importantly as to how markets react to your decision     You might think that we’ve taken that principle to an extreme in the centerpiece   of the most recent Bluebook, the table I’ve included on the next page  The three  columns of the table present variations on the wording of the announcement  according to your view of the economic outlook  Alternative B, given in the middle  column and explained in more detail on the next page in exhibit 2, suggests only the  most minor variation of the wording that would be required to square the statement  with economic developments over the intermeeting period  To be sure, readings on  the economy of late have been disappointing, as is shown in the top left panel by the  staff’s estimate of the cumulative effect on the two-year Treasury yield of surprises in  key economic data releases, similar to indexes of market “surprises” that Governor                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   March 16, 2004 73 of 107    Ferguson mentioned  But the market reaction to such disappointments, on net, also  produced, as shown in the top right panel, a significant decline in investment-grade  corporate yields that worked to offset a decline in share prices and an appreciation of  the dollar  Thus, financial conditions, on net, probably do not differ much from those  prevailing at the time of the January meeting      While encouraging the expectation of more-accommodative policy would support   spending going forward, the lags in monetary policy might lead you to believe such  effects would mostly be felt when the economy was in less need of support  As  shown in the middle left panel, the period when any action taken today would have its  maximum leverage on the economy is next year, when the staff anticipates that real  GDP will be growing at 4 percent, following this year’s projected 5 percent  expansion  With inflation tame, the Committee might feel that preserving current  financial conditions would best foster the achievement of its objectives  Such an  attitude is consistent with the assurance made in the last sentence of the January  announcement, at the right, that the “Committee can be patient in removing its policy  accommodation,” an assurance that market participants evidently took to heart in  shaping their near-term expectations  If that is the case, as in the bottom panel, you  could stress that spending is continuing to expand at a significant pace  I’d note that  the description of the labor market in the second bullet is a little different from that in  table 1 of the Bluebook The feedback I got since distributing the Bluebook made me  think that the Committee would be more comfortable relating that “although job  losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged” Such an announcement would likely sink  quickly among the waves of economic news and be associated with little market  reaction Touching any other element of the January announcement would probably  prompt a more sizable response, which is discussed first for an easier alternative in  exhibit 3       As is plotted in the top left panel, the simple summary of the Greenbook is that   the staff now believes that the output gap will run about ½ percentage point deeper  than previously expected  That implies that about ¾ percent of the nation’s resources  are expected to go unused at the end of 2005  The fitful performance of the labor  market, seen by the shallow bars in the middle left panel, might pose a threat that  outcomes could be even worse than that  If households begin to doubt their income  prospects in the context of a poorly performing job market, spending may not fare as  well as in the staff forecast  The Committee might put some weight on an assessment  of such adverse alternatives  If the Committee’s characterization of the economy  leads market participants to expect a tighter stance of policy and adverse outcomes  for aggregate demand materialize—such as a compression of household spending— the cost in terms of lost output might well be higher than if the Committee seems to  be inclined to ease and the economy snaps back quickly  While investors do not  expect action at this meeting, to be sure, as shown in the middle right panel, the  distribution of possibilities for later this year implied by options on Eurodollar futures  rates has a noticeable portion of its mass below 1 percent—and more so than at the  January meeting  If you thought that you likely would be keeping policy on the easy  side longer than currently priced into financial markets, the Committee might want to   March 16, 2004 74 of 107    highlight, as in the bottom panel, the darker shades to recent economic releases  In  particular, it could point out, as in the second bullet, that “resource utilization  generally appears likely to remain somewhat below levels consistent with the  economy operating at its productive potential for some time” and could even tilt the  balance between inflation and disinflation more clearly into the negative zone     While such a shift seems consistent with the last few weeks of data, the   Committee might have more in mind the longer sweep of your policymaking history  As shown at the top of your last exhibit, the real federal funds rate has been negative  for the past ten quarters  Although a few staff models would suggest that the  equilibrium short rate may well be negative—that is the lower bound of the blue  region—you may well find it disquieting to be in an area traveled rarely by central  bankers who are favorably remembered  [Laughter]  Moreover, the estimate of the  equilibrium real short rate derived from financial markets—the thin line plotting the  far-ahead real forward rate derived from quotes on indexed debt—is now, and has  been for a while, well above the actual real short rate       A sense that the staff has a more benign view of the threat of a pickup in inflation   than other forecasters can be gotten from the latest Blue Chip survey of forecasters   Twice a year, the folks in Arizona ask about expectations over the next five to ten  years for several variables, including real GDP growth (plotted in the middle left  panel) and CPI inflation (plotted in the middle right panel)  As to the first panel, such  far-ahead projections of output growth would seem to reveal private-sector  economists’ notion of potential output growth  If so, forecasts of potential output  growth, with a median of just above 3 percent and spanning a confidence range from  2¾ to nearly 3½ percent, might be read as suggesting that pressures on resources  could emerge more quickly than in the staff forecast  As to the second panel, and as  President Parry noted, despite the good performance of inflation over the past few  years, longer-term inflation expectations may remain above your longer-run target  and, judging by the dispersion of the responses, may be less anchored than you’d like     Words to express such cautionary notes are given in the bottom panel, with the   important changes contained in the paragraph assessing the risks to the outlook  In  particular, if you think that you may be more likely to tighten than seems built into  market prices, you might want, as in the fourth bullet, to tip the balance of inflation  risk to neutral, from its current slight tilt toward disinflation, and qualify your  “patience”  The latter could be done, as in the last bullet, by noting that “the  Committee recognizes that the stance of monetary policy has been quite  accommodative for some time”  That would likely be taken in markets as a marker  that your patience was wearing thin       In retaliation for the hard questions President Parry has asked  the staff over the years, I will be delaying the start of his lunch!  [Laughter]  In doing  so, I’ll be referring to the memo I circulated last night  Commenting on the January  draft minutes, one policymaker suggested trimming the first four paragraphs covering  the Committee’s discussion of its communications policy  Four others recommended  that only paragraph 3, which reviewed issues related to expediting the minutes, be  shortened  I’ve included the full set of comments beginning on the second page of  the memo, showing potential additions in bold and potential deletions as bracketed  material in italics       Not to sound defensive, I started drafting the minutes on the assumption that you   intended to be transparent about your discussion of transparency  Providing a full and  accurate record of the meeting seemed to require describing the different aspects of  your discussion about the risk assessments, the minutes, and economic forecasts  To  my mind, the contribution of paragraph 3 was to lay out the pros and cons of  expediting the release of the minutes—in particular, the arguments against elevating  the role of the minutes, including feedback on the Committee’s deliberations—which  have not previously been well articulated in the public domain      That said, two changes do seem appropriate  For one, the last sentence of the first   paragraph—that’s lines 7 through 9—concerns the working group, which was  directed solely to arrive at formulaic language for the risk assessments  That sentence  would seem to be positioned better in the second paragraph, which is centered on the  risk assessments, so that people do not read too much into the working group’s  formation and dissolution  For another, the last sentence of the third paragraph— lines 38 through 40—suggests that it was premature to expedite the minutes, seeming  to imply that at some point the minutes would be expedited  On further reflection, the  one-sided nature of that statement appears presumptuous about your future decisions,  suggesting that a more neutral description would indicate that you have not reached a  decision  I believe that covers four out of five of the objections on that part of the  minutes       The rest of the possible changes have policy import, which is why I’m coming   back to the Committee  In particular, do you want to shorten the description of your  discussions about the formulas for the risk assessment, the minutes, and the economic  projections?  You might favor such a cut on the grounds that it’s not worthwhile to  talk about procedural issues in public  But the main points have mostly already made  it into the press, and this offers you the opportunity to frame the main issues in a  balanced way  I would also add that reducing the discussion to its bare bones would  offer more than a few commentators the opportunity for irony about the Committee’s   March 16, 2004 89 of 107    views on transparency, something I certainly wouldn’t pass up!  If you do, I take that  as direction on preparing the next set of minutes  That is, I should downplay today’s  discussion of your prior discussion of transparency  [Laughter]     Let me close with this observation  Given your decision to experiment with   accelerating the production of the minutes, you will not have the luxury of an  extended discussion of the minutes for this meeting and those for the remainder of the  year       Five     I have all the time you want  The Committee, however, will have to   vote on the minutes      For the Reserve Bank members, this will be the first experiment with   notation voting electronically  You’ll have to do that kind of vote in two weeks anyway for the   minutes of this meeting, which we will be circulating at that time     President Guynn, in the experiment with expediting the minutes,   we’re going to post drafts of the minutes every evening so you’ll be able to see how the   comments evolve  Then we’ll deal bilaterally with Committee members if people have specific   comments  When we talked about the possibility of forming a subgroup of the Committee, we   ran into the legal issue that the FOMC cannot delegate matters of monetary policy  If the   minutes are viewed as a part of monetary policy, you can’t—      I’d just like to report on the first dry run of our experiment in expediting   the production of the FOMC minutes  We were able to produce a proposed final version of the   minutes and get all twelve voting members of the Committee to indicate by our deadline that they   were inclined to vote to adopt the minutes at the next meeting  There was not a lot of slack in our   May 4, 2004 3 of 112       schedule, though, and we received the last of the members’ responses as to their inclinations on the   vote pretty close to the wire    Two factors contributed to the success of the experiment  One was contracting for an   outside professional to help provide a typed transcript of the meeting on an expedited basis  That   sped up the process of preparing the initial draft of the minutes considerably  For another, there   weren’t all that many comments on that first draft, so we were able to incorporate them and turn out   a revised draft in fairly good order  One problem, which we had anticipated, was getting   information to and from Committee members who were out of their offices  Needless to say, we   learned a few things about the process, and we will make some minor adjustments, but they will be   in the background from your perspective   Once the minutes were ready, we asked Dave Skidmore of the Public Affairs staff to prepare   some hypothetical headlines and the first few paragraphs of a news wire story on the minutes  Then   Board and New York staff members independently looked at that information as well as the minutes   and tried to estimate the likely market effects of an early release of those minutes  The results,   which should be taken with a grain of salt, suggested that there could have been a fairly substantial   market reaction, and that was because of the timing  These minutes would have been released on   the afternoon of the outsized employment report, and perhaps would have reinforced the market   reaction to the numbers released earlier that day   I’m sure you noted that in this exercise we asked you to indicate whether you were inclined   to vote to approve these minutes but not actually to vote on them  The reason was that if we had   asked you to vote, we would have to indicate in the next set of minutes that the Committee had   taken a notation vote on that decision  That’s why two and a half weeks after the meeting we’ll   May 4, 2004 4 of 112                                                         1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   continue to ask you to give us your inclination as to whether you would approve the draft minutes   but actually have you vote on them at the next meeting  Thank you     We did     Virgil thought that the wording of the request we sent around was   perfectly appropriate     Mr Chairman, you can see in Dino’s chart on page 2 that, when rates   are unchanged and are expected to be unchanged, the duration of a thirty-year conventional   mortgage levels out at around four and one-half years  So we have at most about another half year   to go if rates were to rise     No, that’s more a reflection of the mobility of our population  When   rates are unchanged for long enough, the economic incentive to refinance goes away, but people still   do prepay their mortgages because they move or they trade up  So, I think the four and one-half   years is not immutable, but it’s a reflection of deeper demographics     Yes   May 4, 2004 9 of 112       2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the material  that Carol Low distributed to you during the coffee break  Market interest rates staged  a remarkable runup over the intermeeting period, spurred on by data releases that  surprised investors by their strength and by comments of the Chairman during  congressional testimony  As shown in the top panel of your first exhibit, the funds  rate expected to prevail one year ahead advanced 85 basis points  The red line in the  middle left panel indicates that market participants currently believe that you are on a  path to raise the funds rate 3 percentage points over the next two years—and that  you’ll embark on that journey sometime soon  Indeed, a full ¼ point tightening is  first priced in by the August meeting, and as shown by the bars at the right,  significant weight is placed on the funds rate being at least as high as 1¾ percent by  October  Nonetheless, no weight is placed on action at this meeting, although surveys  suggest that you’ll seek to carve out additional elbow room for future action by  dropping or modifying the “patience” language      The revision over the intermeeting period to the outlook for policy prompted a   75 to 90 basis point rise in nominal Treasury yields, which was recorded  predominantly in their real components  Despite some narrowing of corporate risk  spreads, an average of real corporate yields (weighted by capital spending and plotted  at the bottom left) gained 60 basis points since your March meeting  Adding in the  appreciation of the dollar and the small net change in equity prices, it would appear  that financial conditions tightened appreciably over the intermeeting period—a point  Governor Bernanke has made     An important element in your decision today is whether you view this tightening   as commensurate with the revision to the economic outlook  To help frame those  deliberations, three alternatives were presented in the Bluebook, which are repeated at  the top of exhibit 2  The wording of alternative A was designed to address the worry  that market participants may have built in excessively prompt and aggressive policy  tightening and that the associated firming in financial conditions could threaten  economic outcomes in 2005  Alternative B might be favored if you believe that  market participants have pegged about correctly your assessment of the odds of  policy action over the next few meetings but you also desire to emphasize that policy   May 4, 2004 70 of 112       firming will be gradual to limit the chance of an overreaction in markets when  tightening commences  In contrast, alternative C includes a ¼ point hike in the funds  rate, which might seem appropriate if you interpret the tightening of financial  conditions as the initial signs of building pressures on inflation or increases in  equilibrium real interest rates      Taking these alternatives in turn, the case for A, which makes only minor changes   to the wording of the statement and retains the commitment that you’ll be patient,  likely rests at least in part on dissatisfaction with the slow progress in working down  resource slack in most forecasts and perhaps, too, on concern about downside risks to  such forecasts  In the staff outlook, as shown in the middle left panel, substantial  resources go unused over the next one and three-quarters years, with the output gap  lingering at ¾ percentage point in the final quarter of 2005, while core PCE inflation  still runs at just 1¼ percent  Although readings on payroll gains and CPI increases  might indicate that businesses have become less hesitant to hire and that some pricing  power has returned, the two histograms derived from data since the early 1980s at the  middle right serve as a reminder that those monthly readings are very volatile  A  70 percentile range of the monthly change in payroll employment spans 300,000; the  comparable figure for CPI inflation is 03 percentage points at a monthly rate   Moreover, given the outsized increase in the core CPI last month and the evidence of  some tendency toward reversal, you might think that the risks around the next CPI  release are skewed to the downside       The Committee might be inclined to go slowly if recent developments seem   reminiscent of the false economic dawn of two years ago  Back in March 2002, as  sketched out in the bottom left panel, market participants were also firmly of the view  that tightening was imminent and priced in 1¾ percentage points of funds rate  increases over the balance of that year  Both economic data and the moral fiber of  some of the leaders of corporate America subsequently proved shaky, and those  expectations unwound, just as (in the bottom right panel) the consensus expectation  of the year-end unemployment rate rose       This time around may really be different  The discussion of alternative B in your   next exhibit begins by noting that members might find the staff forecast both  plausible and acceptable in its outlook for durable economic expansion and muted  pressures on inflation  A notable aspect of the economic releases over the past six  weeks was the consistency with which they surprised on the upside  But economic  forecasts are always uncertain  Some sense of that can be gotten from the middle  panels, which plot the distributions of three-quarters-ahead Greenbook forecast errors  for the unemployment rate and four-quarter CPI inflation, centered around the current  forecasts for 2004Q4  Those distributions—derived from the past twenty-five  years—are notably spread out  Over the last year or two, we’ve pointed to the lower  tail of the distribution at the right, in conjunction with the zero bound to nominal  interest rates, as a rationale for maintaining any unusually easy stance of policy   Now, with the risks of deflation substantially diminished, you may wish to shift your  focus more to the upper tail of the distribution  The possibility of significant upside   May 4, 2004 71 of 112       surprises unfolding in short order may make you uncomfortable with the commitment  that “the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy  accommodation”  But “patience” was meant to convey two notions  that the  Committee believed it could wait awhile before acting and that, once policy firming  commenced, it could be gradual in returning the real funds rate to its neutral setting   It is the former, not the latter, that at the moment may seem to be confining       In the Bluebook, we offered modified language that the “Committee believed that   policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace” to emphasize that  you see yourselves entering a tightening phase but one that likely will not be as  aggressive as in prior episodes  That emphasis seemed important because, as in the  table at the bottom left, market participants currently anticipate about 200 basis points  of firming in the next year  That is probably influenced by the experience of the three  prior tightening phases, in which the funds rate moved an average of 2⅔ percentage  points higher within the first year  But with inflation lower now than in those prior  episodes, you may see less need at this juncture for such firming, perhaps viewing as  more likely something on the order of the 100 basis point increase assumed by the  staff  In the Greenbook, the gradual realization by investors that you will not need to  tighten as sharply as they now believe imparts an accommodative offset to your  policy firming  Without that offset, you may be concerned that the swing of both  monetary and fiscal policies toward more restraint may slow the growth of spending  next year even more than is built into the Greenbook        There are potential costs associated with delaying tightening and conveying a   sense of gradualism  The recent increase in short-run inflation expectations—say, as  measured by inflation compensation in the Treasury market as in the bottom right  panel—may represent a cautionary flag in that regard  But inflation compensation  between five and ten years from now seems much better anchored, perhaps  encouraging you to believe that a statement along the lines of alternative B would not  cause market participants to question your inflation-fighting resolve       If you think that the odds are higher that inaction might prompt building of   inflation concerns, you might opt for alternative C, which is discussed in exhibit 4  In  particular, a ¼ point firming might be favored if you are of the view that inflation has  more than bottomed—that businesses have regained a considerable measure of their  pricing power and intend to use it rather than absorb higher costs by cutting into their  fat profit margins  In that environment, persistent monetary policy accommodation  may spell trouble down the road  And as shown in the middle left panel, monetary  policy has probably become more accommodative of late, as higher inflation by some  measures has sent the real federal funds rate further into negative territory and the  brighter outlook for the economy has been associated with an increase in the  equilibrium funds rate  Such concerns would be heightened if you suspected that the  natural rate of unemployment was higher than the staff currently assumes  As an  alternative simulation in the Greenbook indicated, a natural rate of 5¾ percent,  instead of less than 5 percent as assumed by the staff, would add more than   May 4, 2004 72 of 112       ½ percentage point to the inflation forecast for next year (as shown in the middle right  panel)       One consideration regarding the timing of such a move is that, as in 1994, it could   spark significant financial market turbulence  Indeed, as shown at the bottom left, in  both episodes the Committee kept rates low for a protracted period  This time,  however, market participants seem better prepared, in that the expected path of the  federal funds rate (the dashed red line) points decidedly higher than was the case in  1994 (the dashed blue line)  Moreover, the large upward revision to expectations  over the course of 1994 should not necessarily be taken as evidence of the primary  role of a self-feeding dynamic in which policy tightening prompted investors to  expect more tightening  Rather, a portion was due to the response to incoming data  that suggested a more rapid improvement in the labor market, seen as the downward  drift in a consensus forecast of the unemployment rate at the end of the year (shown  at the bottom right)  That said, you should be prepared for a sharp revision to  expectations and heightened volatility should you surprise markets by firming today,  especially acting so close in advance to key readings on employment and inflation   That in itself may be sufficient to dissuade you from such an action before making  your intentions more clear        In the last exhibit, I provide an updated version of the table from the Bluebook   that gives the statement wording for the three alternatives that I have discussed  Of  particular note across the columns is the characterization of inflation risks as now  balanced—which was driven by recent data—and the promise that policy tightening  would be measured under B and C  Based on feedback I got since the Bluebook was  distributed, I offer three changes to the suggested wording, one in the rationale  paragraph and two in the risk-assessment portion, with all three highlighted in bold   First, some members were troubled by the characterization that inflation was well  anchored, so that has been softened to “contained”  Second, it seems appropriate to  stress that the outlook has changed by noting that “the risks to the goal of price  stability have moved into balance”  Lastly, to be sure that the qualifier “likely”  obviously applied only to the pace that you intended to remove policy  accommodation rather than when you’d start the process, I redrafted the last portion  of the last sentence to read “policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is  likely to be measured”  That concludes my prepared remarks         To what significant digit?     I think we can agree on the sign  The experience of taking out the   promise of remaining accommodative for a “considerable period” and substituting what seemed to   be a similar concept of “patience” was that it prompted a good-sized market reaction  Similarly,   “patience” has now become a loaded word, and the first thing traders will do at 215 this afternoon   is to look to see if that word is in our statement today  If there is nothing there at all, then I think   you should expect a movement up in forward rates on the order of 10 to 15 basis points  Leaving   the sentence there but changing the language and using the term “measured” will send them to their   dictionaries where they will find that the second meaning in most common dictionaries is “connotes   a gradualism”  In my view, that will prompt a reaction on the order of, say, 5 to 10 basis points    I’m looking to Dino to see if he agrees or disagrees     The other point I’d like to make, President Moskow, is that in the total   scheme of things, any reaction to the wording today is going to be dwarfed in significance relative   to what happens at 832 Friday morning after the employment report comes out     Yes, but it will also influence how market participants subsequently   react to the data  That is, their view of the employment report or the CPI is going to be filtered   through the lens of what they think the Committee is going to be doing  In that sense “measured” is   a speed bump to them as well, in terms of overreacting to the data  So it’s not just a matter of what   happens this afternoon; it’s what happens over the next six to eight weeks     In the survey by the Desk, the question we asked market participants   was whether they expected us to drop or modify the word “patience”       It’s hard to know how to interact with market participants about   potential wording  Obviously I am making a guess here, but it does seem, on the basis of reading   various newsletters, that the preponderance of economists who write about the issue expect the   Committee to modify rather than to drop the word “patience”  But that is a guess  I once asked a   Nobel laureate what he thought was the best way of finding out how market participants would react   to wording in the statement  He suggested that we do what those in the survey industry do—have   focus groups and really experiment with traders  My reaction was that the only time I’ve ever   thought about experimenting with traders it involved cattle prods!  [Laughter]  It’s just hard to—     I think you would take this word out if you envision circumstances   comparable to the latter part of 1994 where you’d be moving, say, 50 or 75 basis points  In other   words, if it were February 1994 and we were using this framework, we probably would have sent   you a Bluebook that said “policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace”  Most likely   that would have stayed in the Bluebook until July or August when you felt you were behind the   curve and had to do larger increases       In some circumstances it might be helpful to keep in the “measured”   phrase even in the act of tightening so market participants don’t extrapolate that tightening more   than you think appropriate     Yes  Just last night we received copies of the audit statement on the   System open market account and the participation of the Reserve Banks  We’ll be circulating those   to you in a couple days, and we’ll seek a notation vote      Now as a taxpayer, Mr Chairman, it would probably be churlish to   complain that the foreigners are buying our debt at high prices     I think there are consequences for market liquidity within the   Treasury market because some of these foreign purchasers do act differently in the primary and   secondary markets than private holders  In particular, there are differences in terms of   participating directly in the auction and not putting in competitive bids and in the secondary   market not putting the securities out to lend     Mr Chairman, I was wondering if there would be enough time for   Dino to give his report from the Desk  That way we can start tomorrow with the chart show    5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that Carol Low is in the process of handing out  The staircase plotted in the top left  panel of your first exhibit shows the path of the federal funds rate consistent with  money market futures through year-end assuming that you will act only at regularly  scheduled meetings  Market participants uniformly expect you to firm policy  ¼ percentage point this afternoon, the first installment in a sequence of actions that is  anticipated to push the funds rate up to 2¼ percent by December  This message from  futures markets, repeated in the top line of the table at the right, was mostly echoed  by primary dealers in the Desk’s recent survey, the second line, although the median  respondent saw the funds rate as just touching 2 percent at year-end  As shown in the  remaining cells of the table, eight out of ten of those dealers expected the Committee  to keep its assessments of the risks to its growth and inflation objectives as balanced,  and all of them anticipated retention of the “measured” language or substitution of  something similar     The remaining four panels of your exhibit make the case for ratifying expectations   for this meeting by moving the funds rate up to 1¼ percent— which was presented as  alternative B in the Bluebook  As shown by the black line in the middle left panel,  keeping an unchanged nominal funds rate even as inflation has ticked higher has  pulled an estimate of the real funds rate below zero and even further below the  upwardly moving estimates of its equilibrium denoted by the shaded region   Moreover, the recent step-up in inflation and erosion of the output gap combine in the  monetary policy rules we routinely track (which are mostly variants on Taylor’s rule)  to call for a higher nominal funds rate, seen in the upward slope to the green shaded  area at the right  Indeed, as you have kept policy unchanged for the past year, you’ve  moved from the middle portion of that band to its lower edge  The bottom two panels  bear on the question of why you might be inclined to tighten now when you weren’t  willing to do so in May  For one reason, the two employment reports averaging near  300,000 monthly additions to payrolls since the May 4 meeting may have convinced  you that the expansion is self-sustaining  For another, the continued updrift of  inflation compensation at the five-year maturity and the recent swing in the five-to- ten-year-ahead measure may make you concerned that inflation expectations could  come unglued  The time may have come to begin to remove policy accommodation  at the measured pace of 25 basis points     Or not, which is the subject of exhibit 2  In the Bluebook, we presented   simulation exercises using the staff’s FRB/US model  Unlike earlier incarnations of  “optimal policy” in the Bluebook dubbed “policymaker perfect foresight,” these   June 29-30, 2004 140 of 203          simulations give investors as well as monetary policymakers perfect foresight  Even  so, workers and households are assumed to form their expectations using a more  limited set of information, a distinction that makes sense given the huge amount of  resources devoted by financial market participants to divine policy intent and other  economic conditions      The simulations considering different inflation goals provide a convenient   mapping from your longer-run intentions to near-term policy decisions  As noted in  the first bullet in the top left panel and shown by the dotted red line in the middle  panels, if the Committee interprets its goal of price stability to be an about unchanged  level of the bias-adjusted core PCE price index—that is, if it has an inflation goal of  1 percent—these scenarios suggest that firming should commence immediately and  probably at a pace that is quicker than “measured”  A 1 percent inflation goal,  though, may not be appealing for a number of reasons, including the nearness of the  zero lower bound to nominal interest rates and a concern about an increased reliance  on declines in money wages and prices to effect needed changes in relative prices   Under a 2 percent inflation goal, the blue dashed line, the optimal control exercise  recommends tightening soon, but not today  Rather, you could accept the recent  declines in the real federal funds rate as a spur to spending that erodes resource slack  a bit quicker than in the baseline       Your view of current and prospective resource slack may also influence your   deliberations today  The bottom left panel plots capacity utilization in manufacturing  over the past quarter-century  Capacity utilization has rebounded almost 4 percentage  points since its trough last spring  Some members might wonder if the rapidity of that  climb casts doubt on whether inflation will remain as well behaved as in the staff  forecast  In particular, you might be of the view that the closing of the gap influences  price setting independently of the level of the gap or, given the uncertainty  surrounding estimates of the level of capacity, that resource utilization has risen into a  region where it is difficult to assert with confidence that much slack remains  If so,  and remembering the missteps in monetary policymaking in the late 1960s and 1970s,  you might see the recent uptick in inflation as suggesting that it would be better to err  on the side of firming forcefully today rather than risk the trench battle required to  remove excessive inflation at a later date      But other members might see this same picture as evidence that a sizable amount   of resources is still going unused and be dissatisfied with an outlook in which that  slack is worked down only slowly  Indeed, recent economic data on spending have  been a shade disappointing, perhaps calling into question the vigor of the economy in  the second half of the year and offering the possibility that slack persists at a more  elevated level  And next year, the end to investment incentives and the waning of the  effects of last year’s tax cuts produce a pronounced retrenchment in fiscal impetus, as  seen in the sidebar, which will restrain aggregate spending  The simulations suggest  that deferring tightening a quarter or two would allow the real rate to remain lower— and a bit below its equilibrium range—for longer than in the baseline, providing   June 29-30, 2004 141 of 203          encouragement to spending and sending production above that of its potential next  year     There may be an obstacle to either the firmer or easier policy considered in this   exhibit—the words of your May announcement  Given the economic outlook at the  time, it seemed prudent to guard against the building of outsized expectations of  tightening by conveying both the intent to begin removing policy accommodation  soon and the plan to do so at a measured pace, sentiments reinforced by many public  comments by members over the intermeeting period  Events would not seem to be so  different today as to justify either not beginning to remove policy accommodation or  not doing so in a measured way     While the intention embodied in those words—even though quite conditional—  may have chafed at times, the statement appears to have encouraged market  participants to prepare for a stint of policy tightening, the subject of exhibit 3  As can  be seen in the first column of the top left panel, market participants currently  anticipate about 2¼ percentage points of firming over the next year, considerably  more than had been anticipated on the eve of the three prior episodes of policy  tightening and more in line with what was actually delivered, the second column   And substantial uncertainty lay beneath these averages  For instance, as shown in the  top right panel, economists surveyed just before the February 4, 1994, tightening  reported a median expectation that the funds rate would be ½ percentage point higher  by the fourth quarter of the year  And the responses were quite diffuse, with one in  ten expecting no policy action or even easing  The limited available data on net  positions in Treasury securities suggest that at least some market participants are  acting on the expectation of policy tightening  Those identified as nonhedgers in the  futures market have significantly lightened their long position in two-year Treasury  futures (the middle left panel), and the primary dealers, in aggregate, have deepened  their net short position in Treasury securities with more than three years to maturity  (the middle right panel)     One source of large and variable demands for Treasury and other fixed-income   securities in the past few years has been those of holders of mortgages and mortgage- backed securities  As the mortgage rate changes relative to its recent level, the  economic incentive to refinance fixed-rate mortgages varies, implying corresponding  alterations in prepayments of mortgages and their effective duration  In an  environment of rising longer-term yields, durations of mortgages tend to lengthen,  requiring those holders who seek to keep the aggregate duration of their portfolio  relatively steady to sell some of their longer-term securities, potentially reinforcing  the updraft in yields  In current circumstances, though, the average duration of  mortgages, one estimate of which is plotted at the bottom left, has moved up to about  4½ years, about as long as it gets  It would seem unlikely, then, that mortgage  hedging flows would contribute to upward pressures on rates as tightening  commences  Lastly, the very low cost of protection from default by financial firms  plotted in the bottom right panel indicates that market participants are not expecting  significant strains  Evidence that the market seems ready in the aggregate, of course,   June 29-30, 2004 142 of 203          does not preclude that individual firms will run into trouble  But many have taken the  opportunity to prepare, suggesting that those who have not pose only limited systemic  risk and should receive even more limited sympathy      I have left discussion about your words for my last exhibit, which updates the   alternative B column of table 1 of the Bluebook based on members’ comments to  soften the characterization of incoming inflation data and to trim the last sentence for  clarity  Besides aligning the language to the reality of recent data releases, the  wording of alternative B points out that policy remains accommodative, even after  policy action, in the rationale paragraph  It also retains assessments of balanced risks  to your two objectives on the view that the outlook does not differ materially from  that at the May meeting, when you made a similar choice  Also in the risk- assessment paragraph, the measured pace sentence refers only to inflation, not  resource slack, to align market expectations to the Committee’s dominant concern   Lastly, the alternative B wording pairs the conditional commitment to remove policy  accommodation at a measured pace with the reassurance that you’ll do whatever it  takes to keep inflation in check should the price outlook turn adverse  You might  view this as piling on extra words to solve a problem that could be resolved by  dropping the measured sentiment altogether  To be sure, saying less would restore a  good measure of flexibility  But depending on the data over the next six weeks, these  words encompass a 25 or 50 basis point move at the August meeting; and by deleting  them, you would lose the opportunity to reassure market participants that your  outlook is such that you likely can tighten gradually and that you retain your  inflation-fighting credentials     This raises a final topic that I embrace with all the enthusiasm associated with   Sisyphus when he determines the time has come to begin rolling that big rock up the  hill once more  Namely, I should point out a structural issue about your  communication policy that may emerge in the next few meetings  The risk- assessment paragraph provides the opportunity to hint about the future direction of  interest rates  In the past few meetings, the last added sentence has been sufficiently  explicit about your intent—whether about a considerable period, your patience, or a  willingness to be measured—as to trump however you characterized the risks to your  two goals  If you envision dropping the final few sentences, you’ll be left with the  stripped-down risk assessments, which may not be that informative if they are left at  balanced  One possibility would be to tilt the risks toward the upside now, explaining  that, if the current degree of accommodation were maintained over the next few  quarters, growth could well exceed its sustainable pace and inflation exceed that  associated with price stability  But the nuances of the switch might well elude market  participants, who as I have already noted expect the announcement of balanced risks   The risk-averse recommendation on the risk assessment is that, if it hides a few  landmines that may prove troublesome in the future, there may be time to fix it after  this meeting, including in the Chairman’s semiannual testimony next month  That  concludes my prepared remarks      June 29-30, 2004 143 of 203            I would be tilling some of the ground of the two prior Ferguson working   groups, but I can give you alternative wording on different rationales that the Committee considered   in its previous discussions of communication policy      Another way of putting it, Mr Chairman, is that the wave of refinancing   has made the distribution of mortgages more concentrated, and it isn’t until rates get down to the   levels they were a year or so ago that we would really hit the mass of that distribution  While it is   August 10, 2004 7 of 103          true that the amount of new financing in the last year hasn’t been all that great, a lot of it has been in   ARMs  And if rates were to decline some, we might see refinancing out of variable-rate and into   fixed-rate products  So, there is some scope for refinancing    With regard to the first point you made about the anchoring of the term structure made   possible by the Committee’s measured pace of policy action, I’d note—and this is something   you’ve noted in the past—that the term structure is also anchored at the long end The ten-year-  ahead one-year-forward rate has moved in a very narrow range, and that has very powerfully   lowered the volatility of the longer-term instruments that Dino showed  I think we have other   manifestations of a sense of lower volatility—perhaps also bearing on risk aversion  The equity   premium is in the middle of its historical range, and risk-neutral bond spreads also seem to be in   their typical range  And while volatility is low, the market reaction to news has been rather high    Just think of what happened in response to the employment reports and the CPI      It really does look as if that line has rotated  So although volatilities are   low, that isn’t preventing the market from repricing when news comes out  That may say   something about market functioning, and that would be a more favorable interpretation than the   lesson you took away       Mr Chairman, I might just point out that the sentence before that—  where we say that a portion of the rise in inflation is transitory—is itself predictive  So, it isn’t   unprecedented to be giving some sense of an outlook in the rationale part of the statement     I have three brief items to bring to the Committee’s attention  Let me   deal with the two bureaucratic ones first  Dick Porter, now of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,   conducted a survey of readers of the Bluebook to see how they felt about the content and the   distribution of that document  There are thirty-six separate responses from people at the Board and   the twelve Reserve Banks, expressing a very wide range of views  Indeed, the range is sufficiently   wide to make me glad you’re asked to vote on my appointment as Secretary only once a year!    [Laughter]    As to the content of the Bluebook, there were some suggestions about the structure that I   think we’ll be able to fold in over time  As to its distribution, there was widespread enthusiasm for   the Secure Document System as a way of delivering that document more quickly to the Reserve   Banks  But there were also some suggested changes, a few of which would involve changing the   FOMC’s Program for the Security of Information  A couple of the suggestions we can put in place   fairly quickly, including allowing access to SDS through laptops, given that NRAS provides a   sufficiently secure platform for that communication, and also allowing differential access to those   with Class I versus Class II access  So we’ll be doing that  As to the number of staff with access to   SDS, I got very conflicting guidance on that, so I’ve asked a couple of people here at the Board to   work with the research directors at the Reserve Banks to spell out some potential alternatives   Second, I surveyed the Committee over the period on preferences regarding the special topic   for your two-day meeting in February  A clear winner emerged among the thirteen potential topics   August 10, 2004 89 of 103          I listed  Three out of four respondents listed a discussion of the Committee’s inflation goal as the   preferred item, with the second most cited item being a discussion of inflation targeting and   communications in third place  Anyway, I rated the responses by the order in which they were   cited  The inflation goal seemed to be the favorite topic  So Chairman Greenspan has asked me to   put that topic on the February agenda, with the intention of discussing the appropriate inflation goal   for the Committee and potential means to communicate it to the public, if appropriate   Third, events evidently pushed further into the future your consideration of the structural   tension of the risk assessment paragraph that I discussed in a memo distributed to the Committee on   August 5  That is, the language about removing accommodation at a measured pace gives the   public some sense about the direction of rates independent of your assessment of risks to the   economy  You might want to bring more content into that economic assessment, which would be   especially important when the time comes to eliminate the removing accommodation sentiment but   might also be viewed as useful independent of that  I had one proposal to do so in my memo, and I   would appreciate your feedback over the next couple of weeks, as it will influence the policy   alternatives presented in the Bluebook      But, Mr Chairman, the alternative would put Dino in the position of   giving a signal of your action at the upcoming meeting      We often consider alternative ways of implementing policy, and in   light of this discussion, the committee of two will look into the issue, for sure, Mr Chairman  I   would just note another observation that Dino made in his briefing, which is that implied   volatilities are quite low  So the cost associated with a somewhat more volatile overnight rate   doesn’t have much consequence if the Committee also has anchored down expectations about the   target rate     And I’d make another observation  If one looks at the pattern of fed   funds futures contracts, in the months in which there are no meetings scheduled, one can see that   the probability of an intermeeting move has gone down to as low as it gets  The Committee’s   decision to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace has signaled to markets that it’s a   decision that is made at meetings  So they have a fixed target, and that, therefore, puts Dino in   the sights of the fed funds traders  But the consequences, in normal times, seem fairly   manageable   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the help of the first exhibit  in the material distributed at the break, I want to begin by pointing out several notable  features in financial markets over the past six weeks likely bearing on your policy  deliberations  As shown by the solid line in the top left panel, short-term interest rate  futures indicate that market participants currently expect the Committee to tighten  gradually over the next year and a half, with the funds rate reaching 2⅞ percent by  early 2006  Compared with the interest rate sentiment prevailing in the markets at the  time of the August meeting (the dotted line), this path is a little firmer in the near  term and shallower later on  Apparently, investors read recent statements by  policymakers as confirming a desire on your part to continue to remove  accommodation and interpreted data releases—especially subdued readings on  inflation—as indicating that a lessened cumulative amount of firming will be required  to deliver satisfactory economic performance  The shift over the intermeeting period  was small relative to that in the run-up to the August meeting, when the weak  employment report for July was released between the publication of the August  Greenbook and your last meeting Current market expectations relative to those at the  time of that Greenbook (the dashed line) are about ½ percentage point lower one and  one-half years from now—similar to the revision to the staff’s policy assumption  from Greenbook to Greenbook     The top right panel focuses on near-term expectations by plotting the policy path   that is consistent with the futures curve and assumes that the Committee will move  only at regularly scheduled meetings  Those expectations indicate a near certainty of  a ¼ point hike today—which is also what dealers told the Domestic Desk in its  regular survey—and put the funds rate near 2 percent at year-end  Thus, market  participants expect you to pause sometime soon in the process of removing policy  accommodation—probably in December  These expectations seem to be held  relatively firmly, in that implied volatility on near-term Eurodollar futures rates  (given in the middle left panel) has trended lower, a phenomenon not unique to this  market  Despite subdued readings on interest rate volatility, market prices have  responded forcefully to key data releases  The middle right panel compares the  change in the ten-year Treasury yield (plotted on the vertical axis) in the half-hour  surrounding the release of the employment report with the surprise in the nonfarm  payrolls (or the actual value less a survey measure), which is given along the  horizontal axis  As shown by the red regression line, the average response to  employment surprises in the last year has been considerably more marked than in the  prior ten years  As President Geithner noted, one possibility linking the two middle   September 21, 2004 77 of 100          panels is that the explicitly conditional nature of your statements has lowered  uncertainty about your actions and focused attention on a few indicators  The arrow  in the figure points to the observation corresponding to the release of the August  employment report on September 3, which is a bit of a puzzle  The monthly gain in  payrolls was a touch weaker than market participants expected, yet rates rose  considerably  You might rationalize this as owing to backward revisions to the  employment data, but I think it also shows the market’s judgment that the data were  not soft enough to halt your process of removing policy accommodation       The net effect of other data over the intermeeting period, however, more than   offset this one-day rise in rates  The downward revision to policy expectations was  associated with a considerable relaxation in financial conditions, in that, as shown in  the bottom panel, corporate yields are lower, equity prices posted sizable gains, while  the exchange value of the dollar moved sideways  How you interpret this easing no  doubt influences your decisions today both on the funds rate target and on the words  of the statement     Members might view the decline in yields and the concomitant rise in share prices   as the dawning recognition among investors that a lower track for the real risk-free  rate of interest will be necessary to support economic growth  As discussed at the top  of exhibit 2, a decision to hold the funds rate at 1½ percent would no doubt encourage  an even more substantial revision to the outlook for policy  While the Committee  may be convinced that a sustainable economic expansion is in place, it may be  concerned that the pace of output growth will not be sufficiently vigorous to ensure  satisfactory progress in reducing economic slack     As shown in the middle left panel, the advance in payrolls has been fitful in recent   months and perhaps indicates a lingering hesitancy on the part of businesses to make  commitments, which several of you have already mentioned If that hesitancy  continues for too long, then it may also be reflected again in capital spending and  begin to dent consumer confidence  Persisting slack has also rolled back a portion of  the turn-up in inflation of the first half of the year  As can be seen in the middle right  panel and as noted by President McTeer, the three-month change in the CPI has  dropped back to the levels of last year, when worries of the possibility of deflation  surfaced  And market participants apparently have lowered their expectations for  inflation going forward  For instance, as plotted in the bottom left panel, the nominal  one-year forward rate ten years ahead, which has been quite sensitive to longer-run  inflation sentiment, has edged down to just below 6 percent  If resource slack  persists, inflation could fall to levels that the Committee might find uncomfortably  low, given the limits to conventional policy maneuvering posed by the zero bound to  nominal interest rates     I’d add that the “measured pace” language would not seem to pose an obstacle to   pausing in the process of firming, in that futures rates indicate that financial market  participants already anticipate inaction at one of the next three meetings—although   September 21, 2004 78 of 100          evidently not at this one  Indeed, a pause at this time might be seen as having the  benefit of ensuring that market participants do not come inappropriately to view the  “measured pace” language as a promise to firm policy 25 basis points at every  meeting  There is, however, an important obstacle to putting the process of  tightening on hold at this meeting  The universal conviction in markets that you will  not do so implies that the reaction to inaction could be sizable  A pickup in mortgage  hedging flows could magnify any initial downdraft in yields  The rally in fixed- income markets in recent weeks has pulled down the thirty-year mortgage rate to 5¾  percent, which is shown as the vertical line in the bottom right panel  According to  an estimate of the cumulative distribution of rates on outstanding mortgages, about  35 percent of them could be refinanced economically given current pricing  Because  of the wave of refinancings last year, outstanding mortgages are tightly clustered at  rates not much lower than the prevailing level  As a result, further reductions in  longer-term yields would likely lead to substantial prepayments of mortgages  The  experience of last year suggests that the resultant shortening of the duration of  mortgage-backed securities would prompt purchases of other longer-term securities,  amplifying the decline in rates and elevating volatility  Deviating from the currently  expected path of measured firming would seem to risk a considerable easing of  financial conditions, which may not be judged as appropriate at this time     But the most compelling reason not to opt for alternative A is that you see merit   in tightening, the subject of exhibit 3  The Committee may believe that the economic  expansion will remain on a desirable track under current financial conditions, which  incorporate market expectations of gradual policy firming  In such circumstances, it  would seem appropriate to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points at  this meeting, as in the B and C alternatives presented in the Bluebook  As can be  seen in the middle left panel, even with the two tightening steps that the Committee  has taken to date, the real federal funds rate is still close to zero and near the bottom  of the range of equilibrium values estimated by the staff  A modest boost to the  nominal funds rate would also be consistent with a number of monetary policy rules  shown in the middle right panel  And given the forces likely to impinge on aggregate  demand in coming quarters—including the efforts by households to rebuild savings,  the swing from fiscal impetus to restraint, and the intensifying drag of net exports— the Committee may find a quarter point move to be a sufficient step in removing  policy accommodation at this time      As to the wording of the statement—which is the only distinction between   alternatives B and C—if the Committee put much weight on the possibility that  growth will rebound sharply, it may believe that the scope of its future action is  unduly constrained on the upside by the “measured pace” language and may prefer to  drop the last two sentences from the statement  That may be especially so if you  interpret the decline in risk spreads and increases in the price–earnings ratio shown in  the table at the bottom left as evidence of an increased appetite for risk-taking  In  that case, you may be concerned that the spur to spending of a lower cost of funds  and higher wealth poses the risk that the growth of aggregate demand would quickly   September 21, 2004 79 of 100          outstrip that of potential output  While such an outcome may be welcomed if the  output gap were as large as in the staff forecast, you might share President Guynn’s  fear that the prospects for aggregate supply were described not by the Greenbook  baseline but by the “less room to grow” alternative simulation  In that alternative, the  NAIRU is higher, and the labor force participation rate does not rise any further to  augment labor inputs going forward, putting inflation on an upward march toward  2 percent, as shown in the bottom right panel     Removing the last two sentences would certainly surprise market participants,   who would presumably build in expectations of more-substantial action to come   Therefore, you probably would not want to consider acquiring the flexibility  associated with alternative C unless you also desire an immediate tightening of  financial conditions  Alternative B would provide the comfort of aligning your  decision with prevailing expectations while giving only limited and highly  conditioned guidance on your future actions  Retaining the risk assessment of August  would seem appropriate if you believe that you will have to be cautious about the  extent and speed with which policy accommodation should be removed  After all, it  is not yet firmly established that the economy has exited its soft patch, and you may  prefer to await more information on that score      Your last exhibit updates table 1 from the Bluebook in light of comments received   since its distribution on Thursday  In particular, as shown in bold, it seemed clearer  to link the description of the performance of output and the labor market in the  rationale paragraph by writing, “After moderating earlier this year partly in response  to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some  traction and labor market conditions have improved modestly”  That concludes my  prepared remarks       That was at the suggestion of the house grammarian, who complained   about the wording in the August and previous meeting statements     I don’t think my maneuverings are that subtle!  [Laughter]   September 21, 2004 80 of 100            I would note that some market analysts have pointed to such a   possible inclusion as an explicit signal that policy will pause     Yes  So that would have more import than just aligning the statement   to the goals in the Federal Reserve Act  It would be taken as a market signal     I just wanted to give a quick report on the experiment with the   expedited minutes  Once again, we got the Committee to indicate its inclination to approve the   minutes in time to meet our deadline  That is, we would have been able to publish the minutes   two and a half weeks after the August meeting  Once again, it was a close call  The Chairman   has asked me to put a discussion of the minutes experiment on the agenda for December  I’ll   brief you then on some of the lessons we’ve learned and ask for guidance going forward  Now I   think the Chairman has a report on other developments relating to the Secretariat      It’s something that we regularly do, Mr Chairman     We take the structure of WTI futures rates, use the 6 percent weight in   the overall CPI and apply it to the non-seasonally-adjusted figure, and then subtract off to get a   measure of the core     Yes     Well, one thing I would note is that because of the backwardation of the   futures curve, it’s in fact—     Yes  So you have the two effects  You have the spot effect of the   whole futures curve shifting up, which gives you the immediate increase in inflation compensation,   but you also have the forecasted subsequent decline, which actually subtracts from it     Right     I would make two observations  One is that I haven’t actually seen the   time series  My recollection is that it’s only a couple of points in the intermeeting period  It’s not a   large number—on the order of 10 to 15 basis points  The second point is that five-to-ten-year   forward inflation compensation is actually lower  So this is something that happened in the first   five years of the term structure of inflation compensation  But we can do this adjustment for you in   the time series perspective   November 10, 2004 8 of 107      When we look at these special factors, which included the smaller-than-   expected auction and the change in oil futures prices, it really is hard to get those special factors as a   large component in the parsing  It’s on the order of 10 basis points out of the 40 basis point rise     We took some consolation from the fact that the five-to-ten-year   forward inflation compensation really just moved sideways  And the ten-year forward rate, given   the flattening in the term structure that Dino noted, basically also moved sideways   3       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Carol Low is handing out some  materials I’ll be referring to  This was one of those intermeeting periods that served to  remind me of the ephemeral nature of my work here  Not long after the Bluebook was  distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that it found 450,000 new payroll  jobs—337,000 in October and back revisions worth 113,000—and the document we  struggled over would be read, or at least skimmed, in a different light  In particular, the  shifting up of policy expectations following the employment report brought the net  intermeeting rise in federal funds futures rates, shown in the chart at the top left of  exhibit 1, to 10 to 40 basis points  The 3 percent funds rate expected for the end of  2005 is consistent with the belief that you plan to tighten policy in ¼ point increments at  about half of the FOMC meetings between now and then as Governor Kohn noted  I  take that to mean that market participants have apparently come to define “measured” as  “carefully calibrated” rather than “regular and rhythmic”   As for today, as shown in the middle left panel, respondents to the Desk’s survey of  primary dealers universally predict that the Committee will firm policy ¼ point, will  assess the risks to its goals as balanced, and will retain the “measured” language in the  statement  A minority of dealers still expect a marker in the statement indicating that  you’re likely to pause in December in the process of removing policy accommodation,  although the number that actually expect such a pause dwindled after Friday morning   3The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   November 10, 2004 71 of 107      With this revision to policy expectations, the nominal Treasury yields shown at the   top right gained 14 to 38 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the largest  increases posted at shorter maturities  But this should not be read as a tightening in  financial market conditions, as indexed debt yields fell; more broadly, equity prices  gained 4¼ percent, and the dollar depreciated 6 percent against a basket of major  currencies       Fluctuations in oil prices dominated the chatter among participants in global   financial markets during much of the period  Although the price of West Texas  intermediate crude ended yesterday about $1 above its level at the time of the September  meeting, it varied in a $10 range  There are three main channels of influence of energy  prices on the economy  First, a rise in oil prices makes a direct arithmetic contribution  to consumer prices, which should be of concern primarily to the extent that it prompts  an increase in underlying inflation expectations  Second, as the United States is an oil  importer, a rise in prices amounts to an increase in an excise tax, which tends to restrain  aggregate demand Third, since energy is a factor of production, an increase in its price  tilts the production mix toward other inputs, lowering their marginal products; down the  road, this leads to a lower level of labor compensation  But given adjustment costs, this  latter effect emerges only slowly over time  In consequence, as long as inflation  expectations are well contained, market participants might expect policymakers to focus  mainly on the effects of energy prices on aggregate demand—that an increase in oil  prices is associated with lower aggregate demand and hence with lower interest rates   As shown by the three bar charts in the bottom right of the exhibit, that seems to be  what happened over the intermeeting period, as Governor Bernanke noted  Day-to-day  changes in oil prices were inversely correlated with share prices and ten-year Treasury  yields—and statistically significantly so  Moreover, inflation compensation over the  next five years (as derived from the Treasury market) was not correlated with oil price  movements, at least at a daily frequency     As discussed in the top left panel of your next exhibit, the case for firming policy   today may rest on the view that economic data, including solid gains in employment  (the red bars), on balance indicate that financial conditions are supporting a durable  economic expansion  As those financial conditions are predicated on firming policy  today, you may feel it appropriate to validate those expectations You may also be  concerned that pressures on inflation may soon emerge  While longer-term inflation  compensation (plotted as the black line at the right) has been well contained, there has  been a notable updrift in the shorter-term measure (the red line)  As shown in the  middle panel, raising the nominal funds rate to 2 percent today would put it at about the  midpoint of the range of standard policy prescriptions  As shown in the bottom panel, a  ¼ point hike would also turn the real federal funds rate more decidedly positive and  raise it further above the lower limit of estimates of its equilibrium value     The more difficult part of your decision would seem to be how to describe your   future action, which is the subject of the third exhibit  In the staff forecast, a variety of  factors combine to make it possible to hold the funds rate at 2 percent for about one year  without exhausting resource slack and putting upward pressure on inflation  Even if  you don’t anticipate waiting that long before firming policy, you might see merit in   November 10, 2004 72 of 107    contemplating the possibility of sitting on the sidelines in December and letting the  world know of that likelihood now  A pause would give you the opportunity to assess  the durability of the expansion—an opportunity that might seem to be particularly  attractive if some of the recent strength in spending has been borrowed from next year  in anticipation of the end of partial expensing  Signaling that intent would limit the risk  that market participants, extrapolating from four consecutive tightenings, mark up their  rate expectations inappropriately     Let me say a bit more about this point  The chart at the top right plots FOMC rate   decisions over the past five years as hollow bars and shades the relative surprise (as  judged from futures quotes) from that action  Being more explicit in your statements  over the past year or so has allowed market participants to peg precisely the past three  tightenings  But it may also have led them to expect such guidance going forward  In  that case, silence about a pause might very well be taken as a signal that no such pause  was being contemplated  That said, you might, as discussed in the middle panel, view  the “measured pace” language as already encompassing enough scope to allow you to  keep the funds rate at 2 percent in December if you see fit  The extent to which the  outlook for policy has changed in the past few days may underscore the need to remain  flexible  Indeed, as shown by the probability density function implied by options prices  at the right, market participants already place a wide band of uncertainty around where  the funds rate will be just six months from now, suggesting that you already have  latitude in the pace with which you remove policy accommodation without surprising  markets     Alternatively, you might view yourselves as unlikely to pause in December  As   noted at the bottom left, with oil prices higher and the dollar weaker, inflation pressures  may emerge relatively quickly  They could do so especially if we are in the midst of a  slowing in the rate of growth of structural productivity that will put upward pressure on  unit labor costs  As plotted at the bottom right, the four-quarter growth rate of output  per hour in the nonfarm business sector (the black line) has turned down, whereas at the  same time, unit labor costs have picked up (the red line)  As an alternative scenario  presented in the Greenbook attests, monetary policy choices will be much less attractive  should structural productivity growth ratchet down permanently     For your reference, the last exhibit repeats the table of alternative statements that   staff circulated on Friday with one change noted in bold  Consistent with the view that  the aggregate demand effects of the oil shock seemed to have been relatively more  important, the phrase “despite the rise in energy prices” has been moved to refer to  output growth  That concludes my prepared remarks       That’s the reverse of what we used to talk about as “looking in the   mirror” That was the issue of whether we were being guided by market signals because, if the   market was guided by our signals, then again there was this positive feedback question  Also one   worries that market participants are not investing independently in the effort to forecast the   economy and to decide what is the appropriate monetary policy  In that regard, I think a good   example is not this intermeeting period but the prior two where data came out that seemed to   suggest that aggregate demand would be weaker than previously thought  Market participants   didn’t change their view of the monetary policy actions over the next five months because the   Committee’s statements seemed to suggest that you would be removing policy accommodation    Everything that moved was at a further-ahead time horizon  So the whole structure of the term   structure of fed funds futures rates shifted down past four or five months out, whereas the near-term   track of tightening seemed to be baked in the cake   That said, volatilities are low, but market participants seem to understand the conditioning   nature of the Committee’s decisions  In support of that notion, as we’ve noted in past briefings,   implied volatilities are low but the reaction to surprises in the data have been much larger than in   the prior decade  So if you look at the reaction to surprises in the employment report or consumer   prices, you see that markets are repricing their expectations for policy action  There just seems to   be less idiosyncratic noise about where policy will be    3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the not inconsiderable number  of discussions of communications policies over the past few years, members have  often brought the meeting minutes into the mix  For those in favor of expediting the  release of the minutes, the benefits of such a change, as listed in the top left box of  your first exhibit, include providing more timely and nuanced information about the  economic outlook and monetary policy choice  In particular, releasing the minutes  well before the following meeting would help prevent situations in which market  participants incorrectly interpret the lagged minutes as reflecting current Committee  thinking     The minutes convey the range of views within the Committee, and expediting   their release could be seen as an advantage for a few reasons  After their release,  market participants will be able to put individual statements by policymakers into  perspective according to the description in the minutes of the spectrum of members’  preferences  In addition, policymakers might be more willing to speak publicly about  a wider range of policy possibilities if they can point to a mention of those  possibilities in the minutes, thereby improving public communications  In addition, if  members thought the expedited minutes provided a sufficiently complete and timely  explication of the policy decision, the policy statement released after the meeting  could potentially be shortened     Some members might not be convinced by such arguments, perhaps for the   reasons given in the box at the top right  Expedited release could lead to undue  market attention to the minutes, particularly so if early release were taken as a sign  that policymakers attached enhanced importance to them  Moreover, members might  be concerned that any resulting increased attention could complicate the Committee’s  deliberations  In particular, members might conceivably alter their discussion at the  meeting in order to be sure certain views were represented in the minutes  It is also  conceivable that a member would offer support for a given policy decision only in  return for agreement on a particular reference in the minutes  If an adverse dynamic  of increased market attention and increased contention within the Committee set in,  the result might be that the minutes would become sanitized and increasingly  unhelpful over time     A last objection has been that it may be operationally difficult to manage   expediting the minutes  (In that regard, though, I note that, as described in the memo  by Brian Doyle circulated last week, two central banks—the Bank of England and the  Swedish Riksbank—have succeeded in releasing minutes about two weeks after their  policy meetings  To be sure, though, the policy committees of those institutions are  smaller than the FOMC, and their memberships are not so geographically dispersed)   To address concerns about operational difficulty, this January the Committee directed   December 14, 2004 70 of 118           its Secretariat to conduct an experiment in expediting the minutes  As shown in the  middle panel, for the typical FOMC cycle, we posted a first draft for your  consideration seven working days after the meeting  Based on your feedback, we  produced two more drafts over the next week, with the goal of gathering indications  of your intention to approve the final draft in time to meet a hypothetical publication  deadline of two o’clock on Friday afternoon     In order to meet this schedule and to assess the experiment, as noted in the bottom   panel, staff changed the process of producing the minutes in several ways  We  contracted with a private firm to produce transcripts quickly  (This change also  provides an important redundancy in our operations that was previously lacking)  We  distributed drafting responsibilities among more staff so that work could be done  along parallel streams  And we’ve provided more systematic feedback on your  comments in the final week to make it more likely that the revision process comes to  closure by the deadline  To make it easier for a geographically dispersed membership  to approve the minutes in a relatively short time frame, staff developed a procedure  for secure, chad-free, voting  Lastly, we collaborated with staff members in Public  Affairs at the Board and the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York to assess the likely market reaction had the minutes been released early  This  involved internally generating representative headlines and wire-service stories about  the minutes consistent with the current environment and asking staff familiar with  financial markets to hazard a guess as to the likely market response     I take away four lessons, listed in exhibit 2, from this experience  First, using   more resources to produce and distribute the minutes soon after the meeting is helpful  in ensuring that they are a true and accurate record of your discussion  In particular,  memories are still fresh, and information arriving after the meeting is less likely to  shade the summary of the discussion  Second, not all FOMC participants were  familiar with all the rules governing the drafting of the minutes  There’s been an oral  tradition enforcing a hierarchy of “a few,” “several,” “many,” and “most” Committee  members and defining whether speakers are described as “members” or not  To make  this process a bit more transparent, last week I circulated a guide to the preparation of  the minutes drafted by your Deputy Secretary, Debbie Danker  Third, the expedited  schedule poses the risk that not all members will be able to vote by the deadline   Given complicated travel schedules and holidays, on two of six occasions this year I  was able to reach only eleven members by the time the minutes would have been  released to the public  That, however, does not strike me as a particularly serious  problem given that the results of the notation vote would not be reported until the  subsequent set of minutes  As long as we have the approval of a majority of  members, the minutes can be released on time, and we can note the subsequent  concurrence or dissent with that decision by those who could not be reached in the  following set of minutes  A more serious risk is that the schedule may be too tight to  achieve a consensus by the publication deadline, a risk that is elevated if some  members have significant and contradictory comments on the first and second drafts   My last observation is that Friday afternoon is a terrible time to release the minutes   On two occasions, the minutes would have been released on the same day as a   December 14, 2004 71 of 118           surprising employment report and probably would have added to the already  significant market volatility  In addition, financial markets tend to be thin on Friday  afternoon, elevating the possibility of an outsized reaction     This was a limited experiment, and in the bottom panel I’ve listed several aspects   of a new regime that went untested  In particular, the experiment was conducted over  a period in which there were no significant disagreements among members about the  direction of policy, perhaps leading to a false sense of security about the ease with  which a drafting consensus could be achieved  Nor has there been an intermeeting  conference call this year, so we did not have to work through procedures to handle  that contingency  Such a possibility does not seem to pose an insurmountable  obstacle, though  I would suggest that, as a rule, the minutes relate information  available from the close of the prior meeting to the close of the current meeting   Thus, the description of an intermeeting conference call would be included in the  minutes of the next regularly scheduled meeting  If the Committee wanted to ensure  the continued timely release of information, it could acknowledge a meeting held  outside its regular schedule in the subsequent policy announcement     Because the experiment stopped short of actually releasing the statement early, it   remains unclear how much increased scrutiny more-timely minutes will receive or  how members will adjust their editing behavior  It is also unclear how the public will  react to the inclusion in the minutes of conditional statements, such as heightened  interest in certain key data releases or the possibility of an intermeeting conference  call  That said, the minutes do not often include such conditional statements   Moreover, when they do, they tend to expand on statements already made public in  the Committee policy announcement, implying that the information content of such  conditional statements in the minutes would seem to be limited     On the last exhibit, I’ve listed three possibilities for today’s meeting  As one   possibility, the Committee could vote today to expedite the release of the minutes  If  so, I recommend beginning expedited release with the minutes of the February 2005  meeting and adopting a schedule of releasing the minutes of regular meetings three  weeks after the day of the policy decision  By beginning with the February meeting,  the decision would be noted in the minutes of today’s meeting, which would be  released soon after the February meeting and thus give the public advance notice of  the new policy  Adding a few days to the schedule by releasing the minutes after  three weeks would give staff more time to draft and participants more time to  comment  Such a schedule would also position the release in the middle of the week,  which would be less likely to cause difficulties  You might alternatively decide that  the experiment has not been conclusive enough and decide to extend it  If so, I  recommend shifting to a three-week schedule because it seems more sustainable   Lastly, you might not have liked what you saw in the experiment or feel that the risks  are too great to establish the precedent of early release  If you do stop the  experiment, I recommend continuing approximately the same production and internal  distribution schedule so that the minutes are prepared while the memory of the  meeting is still fresh    December 14, 2004 72 of 118           About one thing I am sure  If you decide to expedite the minutes, you will be  setting a precedent that will make it hard to go back to lagged release if the results  prove disappointing  In such procedural matters, you have tended to go forward only  if a preponderance of participants supports the change  To facilitate your discussion,  I have asked President Poole and Governor Kohn to make the case, respectively, for  maintaining the status quo and for expediting the minutes  So I first turn to President  Poole       In the last several paragraphs, which bear only on the policy decision, a   statement refers only to comments made by members  Before that, in the discussion of the outlook,   the minutes reflect the entire go-around, so it includes all participants at the table   December 14, 2004 89 of 118             In the material Debbie circulated last week, the proposal was to make   the distinction sharper by talking about members and other participants in the earlier section  But,   again, when it comes to who voted on the policy decision, it’s only members     It is nineteen     In trying to actually write down what was the oral tradition, we did find   that not everybody agreed on what it was  One thing was clear  As the Chairman said, the last two   paragraphs essentially are viewed as explaining the vote of the Committee  Hence, in those   paragraphs, the “members” we talk about are the members of the Committee     The problem is if you want to represent everyone’s views in the   discussion of the economy several paragraphs earlier and you refer to them as “members”  Then   you’ve used the same word to describe two different sets of people     Yes  Unfortunately, it turned out that the rule was that anyone in the   discussion was called a member up to the last couple of paragraphs, and then only members were   called members in the last couple of paragraphs  That seemed to be an unsupportable inconsistency    We didn’t want to exclude nonmembers’ characterizations of the economy and the risks to the   outlook, and one way to do that would be to call them “participants”   SPEAKER(?)  Can’t you call the group in the last few paragraphs voting members?     I was rapped on the knuckles by Joe Coyne fifteen years ago on exactly   that point  The membership of the Committee is twelve people, and there is no such thing as a   nonvoting member     We’re quite happy to do that, yes   SPEAKER(?)  That’s what he’s proposing     That’s the proposal     So up to paragraph 21, or whatever paragraph number it is, if you   express a view you’re a participant in the meeting  If you express a view that is included in the last   couple of paragraphs of the minutes, it’s there because you are a member     One possibility, Mr Chairman, is basically to pick up the language that   you, in fact, voted on  “The Committee voted unanimously to begin expedited release of the   minutes with the minutes of the February 2005 meeting and to maintain a schedule of releasing the   minutes of regular meetings three weeks after the date of the policy decision”  I would also suggest   that we put more detail, in terms of a paragraph or two, in the minutes of this meeting, so that   market participants will know what is coming  You will have precluded the possibility of a leak,   and market participants will get more explanation at a later date     We could release these minutes in three weeks, if you so direct  I   thought there were certain advantages to having a paragraph or two explaining why the Committee   made this decision and giving details of how the Committee would do this going forward before   those in the market actually got the first release     Not if you say it isn’t  [Laughter]     I did want to make clear the distinction between “participants” and   “members”      We thought of making a little index card that we could hand out to Fed   watchers  [Laughter]     The Committee’s discussion of the relative merits of an  explicit quantification of its price objective is likely to be complicated by  consideration of how to govern the process of choosing an objective and how to  communicate it to the public and the Congress  I believe that the decision tree                        February 1-2, 2005 12 of 177  provided in exhibit 5 can help to shape this discussion, however unlikely that may  seem to you at the outset   The key question before you is listed in the box in the top row Would an  explicit, numerical specification of price stability be helpful in furthering the  achievement of your goals of maximum employment, price stability, and moderate  long-term interest rates?  Weighing the arguments that David and Doug just posed,  you might be of the view that the Committee’s behavior over the past two decades  has revealed enough to the public and to each other about your inflation preferences  to make the marginal benefits of this additional step small relative to the additional  costs If that is the case, you would presumably prefer the status quo as represented  in the left branch of the tree   Even so, there might be scope for incremental improvement while preserving  the current structure At the margin, the Committee could encourage participants to  be more specific about preferences about inflation, both within this room by  periodically having discussions like this and in public through speeches and  interviews The Committee could use the minutes, testimonies, and Monetary Policy  Reports to provide additional guidance to the public, so as, in effect, to signal the  shape of the zone surrounding your working definition of price stability As the  memo from the Division of Research and Statistics noted, in the summer and fall of  2003, comments from various policymakers and mention in the policy announcement  and minutes of “unwelcome disinflation” sent a clear message to the public that  inflation had fallen about as low as you would tolerate This meeting provides  another such opportunity You could, for instance, indicate in the minutes that, after  considering the issues related to the inflation rate most likely to achieve maximum  employment and price stability in the long run, the Committee viewed the current  rate of underlying inflation as consistent with its goals   Some of you, however, might view this approach as relatively oblique and as  making the policy discussion needlessly imprecise  You might also be concerned  that you would miss an opportunity to anchor better the public’s inflation  expectations If you choose to quantify an explicit price objective, as in the right part  of the schematic, you then have to decide whether or not to make that objective  public, leading to the possibilities in the third row In principle, you could decide to  be specific about your numerical goal but keep a close hold on that information, the  possibility outlined at the left  To be sure, private agreement on a specific objective  would facilitate internal communication, in that you’d agree on an end and be able to  focus your discussion on the most effective means to that end  From a narrow staff  perspective, our jobs would be easier if we knew your inflation objective, as it is an  important variable on the right-hand side of interest rate policy prescriptions and the  fixed point toward which econometric model simulations gravitate over time  But I  cannot conceive how the Committee could justify keeping an agreed-upon inflation  objective secret nor how, as a practical matter, it could be kept secret A  consideration so central to your policy decisions would have to be reported in the                                      February 1-2, 2005 13 of 177  minutes for them to remain an accurate depiction of your discussion  And, besides,  the world would learn of (and likely little appreciate) your secret pact five years later  when the transcripts were released Thus, the odds that you would settle at the end of  this branch of the decision tree seem remote, which is why the box has a thick red  band around it   Thus, if you want to settle on a numerical definition of price stability  amongst yourselves, I believe that it almost surely has to be a decision announced to  the public in some form or other, introducing the question in the right box of row  three Should the inflation goal be decided by the Congress (presumably though the  process of amending the Federal Reserve Act) or by the Committee?   The choice of an inflation objective that best achieves the multiple goals that  the Congress has assigned might be viewed as a technical decision most  appropriately delegated to specialists—the members of this Committee—the left  branch But if you see the major benefit of stating an inflation objective as anchoring  longer-term expectations, then you presumably would want to commit to it in a fairly  binding way That might incline you to prefer legislative action, the right branch, as  it is less likely to be reversed at some future date  Such a route through the  legislature, however, may well lead to the issues listed in the box directly below in  the fourth row   In particular, is the Committee comfortable in seeking amendment to the  Federal Reserve Act?  Reopening the act could lead to other changes that the  Committee might not welcome, and success in obtaining guidance on an inflation  objective is by no means assured  Indeed, on two occasions in recent memory,  proposed legislation to make the goal of price stability more explicit never made it  out of committee  Moreover, if you request consideration of an inflation goal by the  Congress, are you confident that it would pick a target you viewed as appropriate?  There are good reasons, grounded in the economic theory of time inconsistency, that  a decision about an inflation target should be delegated to a conservative central  banker That seems to have been the compromise worked out over time, and you  might not want to perturb that equilibrium now   I should also add that, once a dialogue is opened, you will surely be asked by  some to specify an objective for the other of your dual objectives—maximum  employment  There is a convincing answer to that question, in that, given the  Federal Reserve’s ultimate control of the inflation rate, it may be viewed as  appropriate to have a long-run goal for price growth But if monetary policy is  neutral—that is, real economic outcomes are virtually independent of your actions in  the long run—then events outside your control determine the sustainable level of  employment and output growth  However, that there is a good answer does not  guarantee good legislation, which is why this box, too, has a red border                                   February 1-2, 2005 14 of 177  But if a numerical quantification of price stability were to be exclusively an  FOMC decision, you will have to ask, as in the box at the left, how will the FOMC  choose that objective?   The bottom row offers two possibilities  As at the left, the Committee might  view a quantification of its price-stability goal as a group decision, similar to  choosing ranges for the monetary aggregates from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s   Periodically, the Chairman could propose and the Committee vote on a single  number or a range for the growth of a specific price index or indexes representing the  long-run inflation outcome consistent with best achieving your dual mandate of price  stability and maximum sustainable employment  Structuring the proposal in this  manner underscores that you are not undercutting congressional intent but rather  providing numerical guidance on how best to achieve your legislated instructions   Some of you, however, could view this as an excessively rigid procedure at  odds with the Committee’s tradition of diversity  You are not asked to share a  common economic framework or agree on the outlook for the economy, so might it  not be appropriate to allow room for differences in opinion about your definition of  price stability?  In addition, you may harbor the concern that a formal vote might  lead the public to believe mistakenly that the price objective is your sole focus   One way of capturing this diversity, the right branch, would be to poll  participants periodically as to their preferred specification of the Committee’s price  objective For example, this could be done directly by adding such a question to  your semiannual survey of participants’ economic forecasts  Or it could be done  indirectly by adding a few years to that forecast, on the logic that a longer-ahead  forecast likely implicitly reveals your inflation objective  On the same logic, further- ahead forecasts of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate would also convey  your views, respectively, of the rate of growth of potential output and the natural rate  of unemployment  Indeed, such specificity, particularly if it were offered more  frequently than the semiannual schedule of your current survey of economic  forecasts, may make it possible to trim back on the policy statement released after  each meeting   There are a lot of issues to cover today and I suggest, as listed in your final  exhibit, one possible strategy for organizing the discussion   The primary question to address is  How do you define price stability? Is it  known only by inference about behavior, when businesses and households are not  distracted by changeable prices, or by a numeric specification?  If it is the latter, what  price index or indexes do you prefer?  Is it stated in terms of a path for its level or as  a rate of change, and what are the desired point estimates or ranges for their rate of  growth?                          February 1-2, 2005 15 of 177  Having shared those views about your inflation objective, you may next want  to consider what role that objective plays in the Committee’s regular business There  are three chief possibilities listed in the lower panel, which correspond to the  branches of the decision tree that did not seem to be dead-ends   The first alternative is to maintain the status quo in which the Committee  defines price stability in terms of behavioral attitudes  Resisting strict quantification  does not mean being silent, however, and you might choose to provide more  information to the public over time as to your attitudes toward prevailing and  prospective inflation, so expectations can be more firmly anchored   As a second alternative, you may choose the formal apparatus of voting on an  inflation objective—explained as the best means to achieve your dual mandate—at  some regular frequency  If you do not view this as consistent with the diversity of  the Committee process, the third alternative is to use the semiannual survey of  economic forecasts to summarize the central tendency of your individual indications  of the inflation objective   While these issues are no doubt interrelated, separating discussion of the  appropriate inflation goal from discussion of how the Committee should incorporate  that knowledge in the policymaking process might aid progress today   That concludes our presentation   5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At least from the perspective of most    investors, your policy decision today seems foreordained  The universal belief in the  market holds that the Committee will raise its target for the federal funds rate ¼  point, to 2½ percent and issue virtually the same announcement as was released after  its December 14 meeting  Presumably, this settled opinion results from market  participants’ reading of your recent statements—including the minutes from the  December meeting, which I can assure you did not escape the world’s attention—as  well as incoming economic data that seemed to present no obstacles to deflect the  Committee from its path of continuing to remove policy accommodation  In other  words, the case for a ¼ point tightening at this meeting, which is laid out in your first  exhibit, is expected by people outside this room to be compelling to you   In particular, the Committee may be inclined toward such action—what we  dubbed alternative B in the Bluebook—if it believes that market participants have  pegged the desired pace of tightening just about right As can be seen in the upper  left panel, the path of money market futures rates can be read as indicating the  expectation of a succession of ¼ point moves until the summer, followed by a slower  pace of firming that puts the funds rate at around 3¾ percent by the end of 2006, a  little above the staff assumption in the Greenbook  The staff views such a trajectory  for policy as likely to be consistent with working down resource slack, which is  shown in terms of the unemployment rate at the upper right, and with about steady  inflation, as measured by the core PCE inflation rate shown just below  You might  find some appeal in those outcomes and seek a decision that preserves the path of  expectations thought consistent with them  In that case, you should probably direct  Michelle Smith to take the statement from your last meeting and substitute February  2 for December 14, ½ for ¼, and be done for the day     You might, however, harbor some concerns that those favorable macro-  economic outcomes are predicated upon liquidity conditions, including low long- term interest rates, that could be encouraging excessive risk-taking in a wide range of  asset markets  Indicia of a relaxed attitude toward and lessened perception of risk on  the part of investors may include the narrow spreads in the markets for corporate and  sovereign debt (as shown in the middle left panel), as well as low levels of implied  volatilities of financial prices, and high and rising home values (not shown) But  perceived excesses in financial markets have not triggered action by this Committee  in the past In that regard, policymakers have tended to follow the logic outlined in  the middle right panel  To be sure, some asset prices importantly influence economic  behavior However, because the determinants of asset prices are difficult to know   5 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)                         February 1-2, 2005 123 of 177  with precision, it is neither obvious that asset price bubbles can be identified in real  time nor clear what policymakers should do if they were confident that some prices  were misaligned  Moreover, there may be other instruments of policy better suited to  dealing with such problems, including supervisory restraint  As a result, you might  conclude that asset prices should influence monetary policy decisions only to the  extent that they have a material effect on the outlook for the things you care about—  output and inflation   Any sentiment to shade toward a firmer policy than in alternative B because  of concerns about potential asset market imbalances might well be tempered by the  range of policy prescriptions based solely on these macroeconomic objectives shown  in the bottom panel  You already have moved the policy rate toward the high end of  the range of standard recommendations—the green shaded area—and are anticipated  in futures markets to move even higher relative to that range in the quarters to come   I earlier described prevailing market expectations as consistent with a string  of ¼ point moves followed by a more gradual pace of tightening  With the aid of  exhibit 2, I’d like you to consider an alternative characterization that also fits the data  and that may be more appropriate if market participants have taken the word  “measured” to mean regular and methodical, like a metronome   The key identifying assumption is listed in the upper left panel  In particular,  suppose market participants expect you to firm ¼ point at every meeting until you  stop this tightening cycle for good The unknown in markets, then, is when you will  end the current firming cycle  We can use futures quotes—which represent the  market’s average of the possibilities of continuing to tighten and of stopping—to  back out the probabilities attached to action at each upcoming meeting being your  last This interpretation of the path for the expected federal funds rate is given at the  right Current futures rates are consistent with a median probability that you will  have halted policy firming by the September meeting  Such an eventuality would  deliver the path for the nominal funds rate given at the middle left  Along that path,  five more hikes (including one at this meeting) will cumulate to put the federal funds  rate at 3½ percent by August Assuming that inflation holds around its recent pace  and that short-run measures of the equilibrium real rate don’t move, that nominal rate  would accord with a real federal funds rate that is about one-half of the way up the  red river of estimates of its equilibrium in the familiar Bluebook chart plotted in the  bottom panel   Those ranges in the bottom panel also map into the seemingly eccentric  shading scheme of the stopping-time distribution in the upper right  If you wanted  the real rate to remain in the blue region—below the range of model-based estimates  of its equilibrium—you should be prepared to stop tightening at this or one of the  next three meetings  If you’re shooting for the red region of model-based estimates,  then you should expect to stop this firming phase anywhere from August to  December  But if you anticipate wanting a cushion above those model estimates—                       February 1-2, 2005 124 of 177  say, in the higher blue region—you might not stop firming until the winter or spring  of 2006 According to the frequency distribution, it seems that investors put the  probability at about two-in-three that you would be done before that   There are three reasons why I have walked you through this alternative  explanation of futures rates First, it underscores that our understanding of financial  prices is sufficiently imprecise that there can be several plausible interpretations that  are observationally equivalent Second, if you would prefer that market participants  not anticipate an unbroken string of policy moves, you could reiterate that  “measured” means tightening that is carefully calibrated, not actions that are  routinized and mechanical, and is consistent with a pause if that proves necessary   Mention of that sentiment in the minutes of this meeting may prove helpful in  aligning market expectations with your own—as it seemed to be the case when  similar notions were published previously  Third, the current structure of futures  rates is consistent with a noticeable probability mass placed on the bet that this  firming cycle will soon come to a close, with the median guess being that you will be  done after the August meeting  If that market expectation does not seem  unreasonable, then you are going to have to come to grips relatively soon with  various aspects of your statement, including the characterization of the degree of  policy accommodation and the risk assessment—the communication challenges  diplomatically referred to by President Moskow   The next exhibit focuses on the risk assessment, with the top panel repeating  the last paragraph of the statement released after your December meeting   Historically, this paragraph and its predecessors have been designed to provide some  guidance about the future direction of interest rates The statement has evolved to a  point such that either of two parts of this paragraph could convey such a message  It  can be done obliquely by describing the risks to your macroeconomic objectives (as  in the sentence typed in green that is the successor to the balance-of-risks language)  or it can be done more directly by stating the direction of rates and the pace with  which you anticipate acting (the sentences in blue type that are the successors to the  “considerable period” language of 2003) In both places, there is the opportunity to  convey that these judgments are conditional in nature   Not every branch of an evolutionary tree ends in success, which is witnessed  by the fact that each of you started life with an appendix The equivalent to the  vestigial appendix in the current statement is the first part of the paragraph  Its hints  about the direction of rates through its characterization of the risks to your objectives  have been trumped by the more explicit nature of the final two sentences And the  fact that the Committee has tightened five times while depicting the risks as balanced  must have been read in markets as implicitly revealing that the assessment was based  on a policy path you viewed as appropriate, not the assumption of an unchanged  policy that was employed when the balance-of-risks formulation was introduced in  2000 If the risk assessment, indeed, is conditioned on your expecting to do the right  thing, you would presumably always choose a balanced assessment unless you                                      February 1-2, 2005 125 of 177  thought you were behind the curve and expected to stay that way or thought that the  possible outcomes had a decided skew  Thus, this formulation will generally not be  informative about the direction of rates   As the time approaches when you are no longer confident there is any more  policy accommodation left to remove, you will face the three choices listed in the  bottom panel   First, the Committee could get out of the business of hinting—either  obliquely or directly—about its future actions While this has been advocated  previously by some on the Committee, you would be giving up an opportunity to  help to keep market interest rate expectations aligned with your own—opportunities  you took over the past 1½ years and which apparently paid off Even if you are not  sure where rates are headed, there may be some merit in revealing your tentative  assessment so as to make it less likely that investors come to a different and  inappropriate conclusion   Second, the Committee could try to revive the risk assessment  One way, as I  suggested back in August, would be to base it on the explicit assumption of an  unchanged stance of policy for the next few quarters and couch it in terms of  probabilities rather than risks You might find it appealing to introduce such  language when potential outcomes really seem even-sided at the prevailing federal  funds rate—a possibility not necessarily that distant in time  Such language need not  be formulaic, as history suggests that agreeing on a formula is neither a happy  experience nor one that results in a durable solution   Third, you could feel that the balance-of-risks assessment in the first part of  the paragraph is no longer necessary and instead rely on the gradual evolution of the  latter part to convey your sense of the future path of interest rates As a governance  issue, though, it will be harder to be inclusive in drafting when there is less of a  structural foundation agreed upon in advance   These may be worries for the future which you do not feel as palpably as  does your Secretary, but time is passing by   Your final exhibit repeats Table 1 from the Bluebook without change  I draw  your attention to alternative B, which basically repeats the statement that you issued  in December    To stop tightening, yes                                                       February 1-2, 2005 126 of 177   Right This is an alternative explanation that says you will not pause but   will stop This views the expected federal funds futures curve as a weighted average of a succession   of moves followed by a flat funds rate      Right But I would point out that our understanding of expectations   formation is such that you could also direct it to mean that you’ll do a ¼ point move every other   meeting and fit the probability of those events  It’s just what identifying assumption you use      No, this just uses the futures rate But, actually, that has been an   extension we’re looking at to see what this model does imply about the distribution, the pdf   [probability density function] from options prices    Right    I’m assuming that those “rivers” just move sideways    Probably not A number of you have articulated over the course of this   meeting reasons why they’d probably drift up over time, one of which is that as the output gap   closes, you have less room to go and you presumably would have a higher real rate    If you follow the staff forecast, the answer is “not really”  It could shift   these colors over a bar or two but it would not materially influence the story    Yes, I circulated that to the Committee back in August, I think    Essentially it says that the Committee judges that if the current level of the federal funds rate were to   be maintained, the probability of output growth being above its sustainable pace about equals the   probability that it would be below Also, the probability that inflation would be above that   consistent with price stability is about equal to that of it being below That is, you essentially call   out a point on the fan chart and characterize where you think the outcomes are relative to that  And   that sentence would characterize it in terms of the next few quarters  It said “If the current amount   of policy accommodation were maintained over the next few quarters, then the Committee assesses   that…” It was stated in those terms    I would say that there are tradeoffs possible  That is, if all you did was   cut out the last paragraph, it would be seen and interpreted by markets as cutting back on the degree   of transparency in a retrograde step But if you wanted to, you could expand your characterization   of the outlook in the previous paragraph, implicitly providing some sort of forecast and, therefore,   hinting at the future direction of rates You could be more numeric in your characterization of the   outlook, say, by releasing your central tendency surveys more frequently  So, there are some   possibilities But I think that just dropping it outright would probably not be well received    But telling people you’re not sure of the future direction of rates is giving   them information, and it may be superior to being silent about that and leaving them to form   potentially inappropriate expectations    I think there are going to be a couple of speed bumps in the process   along the way The first is earlier in the rationale portion of the paragraph in your characterization of   the degree of policy accommodation  One could imagine a succession of steps, as you continue to   move the funds rate up, that will get you to a point where you can no longer confidently assert that                                 February 1-2, 2005 129 of 177  policy is accommodative  You’d therefore have to make that a qualified statement rather than an   explicit statement    That’s the first speed bump that you think about if you try to walk   through the changes that might need to be made in the statement going forward given, say, the   Greenbook outlook If you wanted to introduce new language, an opportunity to do so would come   when you’re just not quite sure of the direction of rates—when the funds rate is in a zone where the   Committee can no longer be confident that it can remove policy accommodation at a measured pace    When you reach the point where that is no longer true, you’re going to have to drop that sentence    You’re going to have to ask the question Should we try to change the risk assessment or try to write   another sentence that characterizes the Committee’s view that it is not sure of the future direction of   rates?    I don’t think there was advocacy in the two different interpretations of   the federal funds curve, only a suggestion that if you are not of the view that the path will involve a   ¼ point move at every meeting, it would be helpful to define “measured” once again  I say that   because there is a real risk that market participants, having extrapolated from six policy firmings by   the end of today, are going to say that you are on a path to do so Indeed, it may have come to the   point where they wouldn’t expect a pause unless you signaled a pause—that is, that you wouldn’t   feel that you could keep policy unchanged with the existing statement    But you could make it a symmetric statement  You could say that the   measured pace language is not inconsistent with a pause in the policy of 25 basis point moves at   each meeting nor with a larger move  There was at least one member who indicated a sentiment for   a firmer policy    Over the intermeeting period, I surveyed you about whether the   summary of your economic projections should be expedited—that is, released next week rather than   three weeks later when the Chairman delivers the Monetary Policy Report in testimony to the   Congress   My experience in surveying you has been that if I ask the 19 of you “What is the color of an   orange?”  I couldn’t be sure of getting a majority on a single answer  [Laughter] This most recent   survey was no exception Almost as many of you strongly endorsed an expedited release of your   projections as strongly opposed it An equal number of you endorsed it as opposed it, and there   were two lonely people who were indifferent [Laughter]  Thus, since expediting the release of the   forecast is a decision that cannot be reversed, it doesn’t seem appropriate to move forward with a   discussion of it today But let me add that one argument in favor of expediting the release of the   forecast seems particularly pertinent at this time There’s a risk that if those forecasts are particularly   stale when the time comes for the release of the Monetary Policy Report, it will be harder to convey                                           February 1-2, 2005 136 of 177  a consistent message to the public  This is pertinent now because the employment report will be   released this Friday, raising the possibility that material changes in your economic projections will   be necessary It seems appropriate, then, to give you a little more time than usual to revise your   projections So I would ask that you get your final forecast to Dave Stockton by the close of   business next Monday    You get the weekend Feel free to use it all!    2  Carol Low will be handing out copies of my presentation   As can be seen in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the expected trajectory   of Federal Reserve tightening now steps up considerably more steeply than was the   case at the time of your February meeting  In part, this movement is an example of   how words can matter  Chairman Greenspan’s testimony, along with other remarks   by Federal Reserve officials, apparently led market participants to ratchet up their   policy expectations and made them more suspicious of the current pricing of long-  term assets  With this fresh look on asset returns, along with higher prices of oil and   other commodities and a couple of faster readings on overall inflation, the 10-year   nominal Treasury yield moved up to 4½ percent and now looks less like a conundrum   than it did in mid-February    The information gleaned from options prices, plotted at the right, indicates that   market participants think the funds rate will most likely be 3¼ percent going into   your August meeting, but they see outcomes as decidedly skewed to the upside  The   implied volatility of money market rates, plotted in the middle left panel, moved off   its unusually low level of early February, suggesting a bit more uncertainty about   your future actions    Some more detail about the actual day-to-day volatility of the staff’s measure of   fed funds rate expectations might be helpful in thinking about your communications   strategy The blue bars in the middle right panel plot the average absolute daily    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                      March 22, 2005 72 of 116  change in the expected funds rate at horizons from three months to eighteen months  ahead, observed from the fall of 1998 to the fall of 2003  The red bars do the same  calculations for the past year and a half The point I take away is that the relatively  explicit nature of the Committee’s guidance about its policy outlook has anchored  near-term market expectations but has had no material effect at horizons of one year  or beyond That is, the market still adjusts to news bearing on monetary policy but  does so through changes in further-ahead expectations   How you feel about that observation will most likely color your views on how the  Committee’s statement should evolve over coming meetings  For some of you, the  reduced volatility of near-term expectations evidences an improved alignment of your  own and market participants’ expectations that reduces the uncertainty confronting  investors and allows them to better plan for the future  Others may hold the view that  the elimination of near-term uncertainty has encouraged excessive risk-taking and  leveraging—perhaps best embodied by the “carry trade” that so preoccupies the  popular press—and may be seen as limiting the range of possibilities of your future  action   As can be seen in the bottom panels, financial conditions showed mixed changes  over the intermeeting period, as the ratcheting higher of corporate yields in line with  those on Treasuries was accompanied by about unchanged equity values and modest  depreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar If you believe that these  financial conditions are likely to be consistent with relatively favorable  macroeconomic outcomes in coming quarters—perhaps (as in the top panel of exhibit  2) along the contours of the Greenbook forecast for resource slack and inflation—you  would presumably want to deliver the policy path currently built into market  expectations What you’re expected to do is firm ¼ point today and signal that you  believe you will continue marching the funds rate higher for some time thereafter,  which is what we tried to convey with alternative B in the Bluebook   As can be seen in the middle panel, a nominal funds rate of 2¾ percent would fit  within the range of recommendations for the second quarter from the policy rules that  we routinely track And the resultant real federal funds rate, the solid black line in  the lower panel, would move closer to model-based estimates of its equilibrium  value   Of course, a 50 basis point hike in the funds rate today would make up twice the  distance to the red band of estimates of the equilibrium rate, but you might not favor  such a move for two sets of reasons  For one, market participants would be caught  unawares, and you might be concerned that they would conclude that the Committee  had discovered itself behind the curve and build in expectations of additional 50 basis  point hikes that could significantly constrict financial conditions or roil markets  For  another, you might not see the need for a brisker pace of policy tightening at this  time Resource slack probably still remains, and pressures on inflation—although a  bit more intense of late—have mostly been held in check                                   March 22, 2005 73 of 116  Thus, issues for today’s meeting would seem to be what you anticipate doing at  the next few meetings, and, working backwards, what that implies for the language of  the Committee’s announcement today  Your answers to those questions, in turn,  depend on how far you think the funds rate is from neutral  The top left panel of  exhibit 3 provides a longer perspective on the path for the federal funds rate currently  embodied in financial market prices  Judging from futures quotes, you’re expected  ultimately to bring the funds rate to 4¼ percent  That is about the same answer we  get from a multifactor model attempting to explain the term structure of Treasury  yields, as plotted at the right   The solid line in the middle left panel plots the average response from the Blue  Chip Survey, which asked economists where they expect the three-month Treasury  bill rate to be six to ten years from now  Their answer—4½ percent—is only a bit  higher than that inferred from financial prices  The survey also reports the averages  of the 10 highest and the 10 lowest responses—plotted as the dashed lines—out of the  50 or so economist participants  The wide span covered by the survey responses  underscores the range of views about the destination of your current tightening cycle   Those of you who identify relatively more with the respondents in the bottom  quintile likely foresee pausing in the process of firming sometime soon  Working to  reinforce that opinion would be the belief that recent higher inflation readings are  largely transitory In that regard, it is true that businesspeople have talked more of  late about passing higher costs through to their customers and hinted about renewed  “pricing power” However, as shown in the middle right panel, fairly consistently  over time (and for longer than the sample plotted here), the share of the small  business respondents to the NFIB survey reporting plans to increase prices has moved  closely with real oil prices You might interpret that correlation as suggesting that  anecdotes are heavily influenced by pressures posed by higher energy costs and may,  as Governor Bernanke noted, be a feature of intermediate goods and services rather  than an independent source of inflationary impetus  In that regard, you might take  comfort from the fact that five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation compensation inferred  from Treasury yields (and plotted as the red line in the lower left panel) is up only  modestly and remains well off its 2004 peak  With longer-term inflation expectations  well contained and resource slack apparently being worked down slowly, the  Committee may see relatively little cost in continuing along a path of gradual removal  of policy accommodation  That may incline you to choose the words of your  statement so as, at the least, to keep market participants from marking up their  expected path of tightening or, perhaps, even rotate that path down, which is what we  tried to do with alternative A in the Bluebook   Some others on the Committee, however, might look at this same chart with  trepidation Since early February, near-term inflation compensation has risen about  ⅜ percentage point and longer-term compensation is up about 10 basis points  This  could be taken as a palpable sign of inflation jitters that should be dealt with promptly                             March 22, 2005 74 of 116  and forcefully, perhaps leading you to tighten 50 basis points today or to toughen the  words of your statement so as to warn investors of such a possibility in May  (In that  regard, such a decision might reflect a view of long-run outcomes for the short rate as  being more likely than not at or above the Blue Chip average)   Even if you had a benign point forecast for inflation over the next two years, such  as the Greenbook outlook for core PCE inflation shown as the solid line at the lower  right, you might not view the outcomes on both sides of that central tendency with  equanimity  And the width of the fan chart surrounding that forecast suggests that the  odds of a different outcome are sizable  If inflation runs on the high side of the staff  forecast, you may well have to pick up the pace of firming and work hard to contain  inflation expectations, even as financial disruptions become more possible  In  contrast, with the momentum of aggregate demand well entrenched, inflation falling  short of what is currently expected could be dealt with more readily  At first market  participants would unwind some of the anticipated restraint already embodied in  financial prices, giving the Committee some time to calibrate its setting of policy  through its communications  Some members may believe that projecting a more  forceful sense of resolve now might lessen the risk of an adverse outcome by helping  to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored  We tried to accomplish this with  alternative C in the Bluebook, which introduced resource slack as a concern and  asserts that inflation pressures have intensified   A common slur about economists is that they are drab and colorless  Not so  This Bluebook set new records for the varieties of hues used for fonts The best  example of this is repeated as your next exhibit, which was in a box in the policy  alternatives section Over upcoming meetings, the Committee likely faces five key  issues concerning its statement language  First, as noted in the markup of the  February FOMC statement, you will need to determine whether the characterization  of the stance of policy—marked in red—should be modified in some way  Second, as  noted in blue, the FOMC may need to revise its assessment of the pace of underlying  productivity growth in light of the realized and anticipated slowing in actual  productivity growth Third, the assessment of inflation and inflation expectations—  noted in green—may need to be revisited  Fourth, as marked in purple, the  Committee may wish to remove the “measured pace” language at some time  This  might be the case if the Committee judged that a pause in the process of removing  policy accommodation might be called for or, alternatively, if it determined that  economic circumstances could require a more rapid policy adjustment some time  soon However, eliminating the “measured pace” language without a replacement  would leave the risk-assessment paragraph without a signal about the future direction  of policy That omission raises the fifth issue—noted in orange—regarding the  balance of risks assessment   For reference, the last exhibit repeats the table of alternative statements that staff  circulated in the Bluebook with a few changes reflecting comments received since  publication Two design principles served as the basis for alternative B First, it                                   March 22, 2005 75 of 116  seemed important to highlight the Committee’s watchfulness about inflation   developments  Hence, the rationale paragraph points out that inflation pressures have   picked up, with this latest draft a bit tougher on that score than the earlier version   Second, it seemed important to remind people that keeping the risks balanced may   take some effort  Hence, the assessment of risks is explicitly conditioned on an   appropriate path for policy The Committee has accompanied its six prior tightenings   with an assessment of balanced risks, so observers must by now have inferred that it   was based on an appropriate policy However, I must admit that explicitly stating   that conditionality will limit the usefulness of this form of the risk assessment in   signaling the direction of future policy moves    But you may believe that the useful shelf life of this language has already passed   In the Bluebook, alternatives A and C offer an alternative formulation of the risk  assessment that could work now or in the future  Both drop the “measured pace”  language—in alternative A because it seems to rule out a pause any time soon and in  alternative C so as to signal a faster pace of firming—and adopt a risk assessment  based on an unchanged policy for the next few quarters It may be premature to adopt  such language now, but having a discussion about such a possibility might be the first  step in the process    You can’t use it to signal the direction of rates So if it stands in   isolation—that is, if there are no other statements providing guidance in that portion of the   announcement—you won’t be telling market participants anything particularly useful  A risk   assessment based on appropriate policy would only be unbalanced if you thought, first, you were   behind the curve; second, if a shock came that was so large and sudden that the lags in monetary   policy did not allow you to offset it; or third, if there were a particularly large skew one way or the                             March 22, 2005 76 of 116  other So, the question is Is it news to put this clause in the paragraph?  I guess I’d have to argue   that it really isn’t, because how could you have been tightening six times off a risk assessment that   was balanced, unless it was implicitly conditioned on appropriate policy  The suggestion in the   Bluebook was to make that conditioning explicit because, at this particular point, it would emphasize   that it takes some work to keep the risks balanced  But I did want to flag to you that if you go in that   direction, at some point along that road you are not going to be happy with the statement    I think we put that in there because later in the statement you do say that   underlying inflation is expected to be contained, and it seemed necessary then to provide at least   some offset to the concern expressed earlier about pressure on inflation having picked up                                               March 22, 2005 77 of 116   Yes    Mr Chairman, not that I’d like to reopen alternative B, but I was   wondering in paragraph 5 whether or not it would be appropriate to refer to “appropriate monetary   policy” rather than just “appropriate policy” because it’s obvious that not many of you believe that   either fiscal or trade policy is likely be appropriate anytime soon    2   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that were distributed during the coffee break    Market participants see today as another step in your journey of removing policy   accommodation  As shown in the upper left panel, futures prices and survey   responses indicate that a ¼ point firming today is a lock, as is the retention in the    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                                          May 3, 2005 73 of 116  statement of the judgment that the risks to both of your objectives are balanced   Some doubts, however, have surfaced about whether the “measured pace” language  will survive the day One in four of the respondents to surveys by the Desk and by  Blue Chip think not   Market views about your action today were essentially settled by your March  statement  As the solid line in the top right panel shows, the May federal funds  futures contract has traded at about 3 percent over the entire intermeeting period   But investors also apparently understood that your actions in coming quarters  depend on economic prospects, as they revised down the funds rate expected at year­ end (the dotted line) about ¼ point—or about as much as the staff has assumed in its  baseline   Some of the twists and turns of that path owed to Committee statements  As can  be seen in the middle left panel, the announcement released after your March  meeting was viewed as hawkish about inflation and prompted the largest swing in  the two-year Treasury note yield in the window surrounding 215 pm in the past  year (the red bar) Some of that was taken back by the more nuanced description of  your deliberations provided in the minutes of that meeting released three weeks later  (Note that only the last three pairs of bars cover the new regime of expedited  publication of the minutes)   As can be seen by the bars in the upper of the two panels at the middle right, the  two-year yield rose in the windows bracketing major economic data releases, as  increases following data on faster-than-expected consumer price inflation more than  offset the changes sparked by spending, production, and employment releases with a  surprisingly soft cast That latter information, along with well-publicized problems  at a few prominent corporations and declines in equity prices, soured market  sentiment about the vigor of the economic expansion  And as can be seen in the  panel just below, intraday movements in the two-year note yield were highly  correlated with those of the S&P 500   As shown in the lower left panel, equity prices shed 2½ percent on net over the  intermeeting period, and risk spreads on debt instruments widened  Triple-B yields  (the solid line in the middle panel) edged lower, but speculative-grade yields (the  dotted line) actually rose With the value of the dollar appreciating slightly on  foreign exchange markets (the lower right panel), financial conditions likely  tightened on net   If you believe that these financial conditions—which are predicated on market  expectations of policy action today and more to follow—will preserve satisfactory  economic expansion while containing inflation, you probably would be comfortable  with moving the federal funds rate to 3 percent this afternoon  No doubt, the staff’s  assessment of the economic outlook, as summarized in the upper panels of exhibit 2,  has moved in an unsatisfactory direction, with the output gap, at the left, narrowing                                                           May 3, 2005 74 of 116  more gradually than in the previous forecast, and core PCE inflation, at the right,  running along a slightly higher path This fits the bill of an adverse supply shock,  likely at least in part the product of sustained higher oil prices In effect, higher  inflation—and probably upside risks to inflation—act as a constraint limiting how  fast slack can be worked down As a result and as many of you have noted, the  policy menu available to you looks dourer than it did six weeks ago   In that brave new world of diminished possibilities, a ¼ point increase in the  nominal funds rate would help prevent an erosion in the real funds rate (as the result  of the upcreep in inflation and perhaps short-term inflation expectations) and might  even close a little of the distance of the actual real rate (the solid line in the middle  panel) with estimates of its equilibrium (the swath of red)   Taking as given the wisdom of the crowd about policy expectations, the issue  isn’t whether you will tighten by ¼ point, but whether you will signal a slower,  unchanged, or quicker pace of firming going forward in the words that accompany  that action The staircase plotted in blue in the bottom left panel considers a future  in which you tighten 25 basis points at upcoming meetings for as far as the eye can  see That path is not built into markets  The expected federal funds rate (the dark  solid line) veers to the south of the staircase and flattens out, implying the  expectation of an end to this cycle of firming  Looking at the readings along the  vertical line denoting year-end, an expected federal funds rate of 3½ percent adds up  to two more ¼ point increases in the final five meetings of 2005    The same structure of expected funds rate can be described as averaging over  different branches of the probability tree in which the Committee tightens ¼ point at  each meeting until it stops for good  The distribution of stopping times, given at the  lower right, shows that current futures quotes are consistent with ¼ weight given to  the funds rate being on hold starting in June and a six-in-ten chance prevailing that  you will be done at some point before the end of this year   The arguments for pausing sometime soon are laid out in exhibit 3  In particular,  as seen by the position of a nominal federal funds rate of 3 percent plotted as the  solid line in the upper left panel, standard policy rules mostly call for something  south of that target As shown in the two panels at the upper right, policy rules agree  that the nominal funds rate this quarter should be higher than the average of the first  quarter You’d be more comfortable with a funds rate at the level of 3 percent if  your inflation goal is a 1½ percent annual increase in the core PCE (the upper right  panel) than if your inflation goal is 2 percent, as noted directly below   Holding the funds rate at 3 percent for some time would have added appeal if  you viewed spending as potentially prone to a negative confidence shock that could  spill over to financial markets, perhaps as spelled out in one of the alternative  simulations in the Greenbook that turns out to be a favorite of Governor Gramlich   As shown in the middle panels, in that simulation the unemployment rate ends the                                                   May 3, 2005 75 of 116  forecast period 1 percentage point higher than the baseline, and core PCE inflation  moves back into the territory where “unwelcome disinflation” was once a serious  concern Moreover, a signal that policy would be on hold might not provoke  particular concern on the part of market participants given that employment  compensation (the lower left panel) remains subdued and inflation expectations (the  lower right panel) generally seem well anchored   For some of you, such reasoning may sound uncomfortably like an echo of  arguments made 30 years ago, just at the point where people around this table made  serious mistakes  Core PCE inflation, the solid line in the upper panel of exhibit 4,  is running well above the central tendency of your forecast for this year made just  three months ago  And at 5¼ percent, as in the middle left panel, the unemployment  rate is within spitting distance of most estimates of its natural rate  In addition, as at  the middle right, productivity growth has slowed, perhaps suggesting that less  restraint on unit labor costs will be provided in coming quarters  With such an  outlook, you might be justified in wanting to pick up the pace of firming sometime  soon   Indeed, as shown in the bottom panel, both the spot price of West Texas  intermediate crude (the solid line) and far-ahead futures prices for that resource (the  dotted line) have moved up decidedly, implying that more of the “excise tax” an  import-dependent country such as ours must pay is permanent, presumably to the  detriment of spending and the economy’s potential to produce and posing the risk  that inflation expectations will pick up Putting greater weight on the reduction in  supply associated with this run-up in energy prices—which includes both a possible  deterioration in inflation sentiment as well as longer-run effects on potential  output—presumably would incline members to want to project a firmer stance of  policy   A useful starting point for your discussion of the policy statement might be the  one you issued in March, which I have included as exhibit 5 In previous meetings  and in comments on the early drafts of potential statements I distributed last week,  some of you expressed a clear preference for eliminating forward-looking language  from the announcement  It is important to recognize, however, that the forward- looking content comes in two flavors, one explicit and one implicit  The Committee  characterizes its future policy action in the next to last sentence, which is typed in  red This is a relatively explicit message, in that the Committee forecasts both the  direction and the likely pace of its future action The implicit forecast is typed in  blue As long as you assert that policy is accommodative against the backdrop of a  generally positive depiction of the economy, readers will infer that you intend to  raise rates over time   This opens up the two possibilities for altering the statement to enhance your  flexibility that were discussed under alternative C in the Bluebook You could be  asymmetric and trim the explicit description of your future action—the red-typed                                                May 3, 2005 76 of 116  language about “a pace that is likely to be measured”—but leave the part where you   describe policy as accommodative  Readers will likely view that change as giving   the Committee the scope to tighten more quickly than previously expected    Alternatively, you could excise all guidance, both the red and the blue, on the notion   that the changes would indicate symmetry about the possible paths for policy    Whatever may be the merits of a statement that does not restrict your range of   future action, the current situation may make you willing to tolerate the status quo   for a bit longer The expansion probably seems less vigorous and more uncertain to   you now than it did six weeks ago, and you might be concerned that an adverse   market reaction to an asymmetric statement without the “measured pace” language   could further dent the economy’s momentum  But despite the recent hesitancy in   spending and production, you’re likely to view a 3 percent nominal funds rate as still   accommodative  Thus, it risks misleading the public to remove that sense under a   symmetric approach to eliminating forward-looking language If you share that   appraisal, you probably would favor, even if reluctantly, alternative B of Table 1,   which is repeated for convenience as the last exhibit     It’s material that was in the last Bluebook, and it is repeated again in this   one, where we talk about the changes in forward-looking inflation compensation  In fact, the   inflation swap market developed mostly in Europe  That’s where the market is deeper, in part   because in Europe apparently there are participants on both sides of that trade—mainly utilities that   have legislated rates and, therefore, are willing to pay for getting that protection   In the United States, the volume of trading has increased over the last year or so, and we do   think that it is a useful market  One mystery in that market, which still prevails, is that at least at the   front part of the TIPS yield curve and the inflation swap yield curve, there’s a bit of an arbitrage   opportunity Dealers we talk to say that, yes, they know it exists, but to exploit it would involve                                    May 3, 2005 77 of 116  basically exploiting their customers, and they are reluctant to do that while the market is still limited;   it hasn’t deepened enough    I would note with some irony, Mr Chairman, that in the December 1999   memo that introduced the balance-of-risk language, it was taken for granted—I think this was on the   first page—that draft language for the statement would not be circulated before the meeting because   it had the potential to stifle the discussion at the meeting  So, the views of the Committee have   changed in this regard I would say it’s an open issue of where the pendulum is now relative to   perpendicular I welcome everybody’s comments  I look forward to those e-mails  And one   possibility, if there’s enough interest, is that we can figure out when to have a Committee discussion     John can correct me if I’m wrong, but I think there is an important   element to your question about what is the source of uncertainty  If the source of uncertainty is   going to be the evolution of house prices, that basically is uncertainty of a linear type that’s affecting   aggregate demand  So you take your best shot and, therefore, set policy accordingly  The other   possibility is that you’re not certain how house prices will react as you change your instrument    That becomes multiplier uncertainty; and depending on the structure of the uncertainty in your   model, you may either attenuate or not    I think the argument, Mr Chairman, is that the residual seasonality is in   the underlying  That is, the compensation you get is based on the not seasonally adjusted CPI, so   the arbitrage is actually to have the real rate get a seasonal to offset the seasonality in the   underlying The one thing I would note in terms of the divergence between the near-term oil futures   and the TIPS inflation compensation is that we’ve also seen a difference in the behavior of the front-  month contracts and the longer-dated contracts in oil futures  During the latter part of the period   where they’ve moved differently, it has been more of a parallel shift  That is, if you don’t anticipate   future declines in oil prices—if you were reading it off futures markets—whereas earlier you did,   TIPS market participants would presumably price in anticipated future declines in oil prices and its   consequence for the CPI  But in the last month or two, it has been flat                                                     June 29-30, 2005 79 of 234  8  I’m fairly confident, Mr Chairman, that this will not end with  applause [Laughter]  I will be referring to the materials that were handed out during  your break   No one would be surprised if you admitted that you agreed with Yogi Berra’s  characterization that it “feels like déjà vu all over again”  Once more, the market  backdrop for your deliberations is, as shown by the black line in the upper left panel  of your first exhibit, one in which expectations seem firmly fixed on a quarter point  firming today  In addition, it’s hard to find any market participant who believes that  there will be any material deviation from the scripts of the past few meetings in the  announcement this afternoon   8 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)                                June 29-30, 2005 160 of 234  There have, however, been some changes  Market participants, apparently taking  comfort in incoming economic data, revised down their expectation of the end point  of this firming cycle, shifting from the expectation in early May of around 4 percent  (the red dotted line) to the current reading where the black line flattens out at under  3¾ percent With a quarter point hike today seen as a certainty, this implies that  market participants also foresee a pause sometime soon  The black bars at the upper  right show that investors assign about three-fourths probability weight to your being  done before November and a ninety-five-out-of-one-hundred chance of your finishing  up by the last scheduled meeting of the year   The issue before you today would seem to be how to describe the reasons for your  action and whether to ratify current market expectations of a pause sometime soon—  decisions that, in turn, likely depend importantly on the answers to two questions  related to the economic outlook and policy strategy  For one, what do you make of  the further decline in the 10-year yield?  That yield, plotted with the black line in the  middle panel, ended the intermeeting period a touch over 4 percent, further narrowing  its spread over short- and intermediate-term rates   As can be seen in the lower left panel, the nominal 10-year Treasury yield—line 1  —is now 79 basis points lower than its level just before your meeting one year ago,  back when the funds rate was 1 percent As noted in lines 2 and 3, indexed debt  quotes indicate that this decline was two-thirds real and one-third inflation  compensation  With short rates rising and long coupon yields falling, the arithmetic  of the term structure requires that far-ahead forward rates fall by more than the note  yield Indeed, the 1-year forward rate maturing 10 years hence—line 4—shed 179  basis points over the past year  Also of note, the decline in Treasury yields showed  through to private yields, with the AA corporate rate in line 5 of the table dropping a  like amount  Similarly, the yield conundrum is not a domestic phenomenon alone, as  Mike Leahy showed Euro swap yields, for example, have declined by more than  dollar ones   The bottom right panel makes one last point The decline in yields over the past  year has come as a surprise  By the expectations approach to the term structure, the  upward-sloped yield curve of one year ago—the dotted line—predicted that its  successors would shift up and flatten over time  Instead of the long dashed curve that  was predicted one year ago to prevail now, we observe the very flat solid line   Market participants got about right what would happen at the front end of the term  structure—probably because your actions were so telegraphed—but after that, they  went increasingly astray   The flattening of the yield curve is put in a longer perspective in the upper panel  of exhibit 2 The sharp decline in the spread of the 10-year over the 1-year yield may  not seem so scary if you ascribe it to shifts in the demand and supply of longer- duration securities, the subject of the two left panels  As discussed in the memo I sent  to the Committee last week, the allure of longer-duration fixed-income securities                       June 29-30, 2005 161 of 234  might have increased of late if investors perceive the macroeconomic environment—  both nominal and real magnitudes—to be more predictable  An appreciation of the  significant demographic shift in our near future may also have encouraged some shift  toward longer-term assets by institutional fund managers  At the same time, the US  Treasury has been making relatively fewer of those obligations—with the average  duration of Treasury debt outstanding declining by about one-half year since issuance  of the 30-year bond was discontinued Lastly, befitting the global dimensions of the  decline in long yields, the downward pressure on domestic yields may owe to  burgeoning saving relative to shrinking investment internationally, including the  efforts of foreign official entities to direct their own surpluses toward dollar assets   Changes in demand are difficult to measure  And it is incipient demand that  needs to be measured, not quantities realized after asset prices adjust  One way to  quantify the relative shift in demand is to consider the predictions of multifactor  models of the term structure  Those models try to explain the behavior of yields  across maturities as parsimoniously as possible while making sure all assets are  priced consistently The models we keep in-house predict, as in the lower left panel,  that a substantial portion of the reduction at the long end of the forward rate structure  owes to a lessened term premium  The current reading of 5/8 percentage point is  indeed low in its historical range, but those estimates do tend to be volatile  If that  represents an exogenous shift in investor preferences, then it also represents increased  financial accommodation that warrants a higher policy rate than previously expected   But not much is really exogenous when you talk about financial markets  If investors  are buying more long-dated Treasuries, what are they buying less of?  That is, the  financial impetus associated with a lower term premium might be trimmed by lower  stock prices and a higher foreign exchange value of the dollar than would otherwise  be the case   The flattening of the yield curve would seem more worrisome if you thought  investors were predicting that short rates should be lower than previously expected—  perhaps because, as in the middle right panel, they expect further restraint on  spending from high oil prices, some rebound in the domestic saving rate, or continued  drag from the external sector  Note that the flattening of the yield curve need not be  predicting slower growth, only that you will run policy on the easier side than  previously expected to deliver good macroeconomic outcomes  As shown in the  bottom right panel, predictions of GDP growth from a simple regression employing  the term spread indeed have come down appreciably  But levels matter; and a  forecast of 3 percent growth over the next year in an environment in which slack has  been materially reduced may not seem so unwelcome   As estimates of resource slack narrow, Committee members might be particularly  intent on ensuring that policy accommodation is correspondingly removed  If it is  any consolation, the top left panel of exhibit 3 shows that the current setting of the  nominal funds rate, the black line, is well within the policy prescription of the  standard rules that we follow Moreover, recent increases in the real funds rate, the                             June 29-30, 2005 162 of 234  black line in upper right panel, have pushed that indicator closer to the range of  estimates of its equilibrium value     As Secretary to the Committee, I spend some time worrying about the  documentary record of your deliberations  Thus, I can recognize a pattern in these  meetings  You repeatedly predict that your last policy move will be a mistake   Stated so bluntly, it is a paradox worthy of Bertrand Russell, but practically it means  that, as in the middle left panel, you may be close to the point where you should  worry about what can go wrong And that is the second major question pertinent to  your policy choice I put before you   Logically, there are two possibilities, as in the middle left panel  You might be  worried that you will stop firming policy too soon or too late  If market participants  came to believe that you were behind the curve in policy tightening, inflation  expectations could become unmoored and a good portion of your subsequent action  would probably be directed to reasserting your inflation-fighting credibility   That risk is why the Committee highlighted its watchfulness about price  developments in the rationale part of the statement and added a sentence to its  statement underscoring its vigilance against inflation  Such a risk seems well  contained, at least as judged by the measures of inflation compensation derived from  the Treasury market plotted at the middle right  Inflation compensation—based on  the CPI—has moved well south of 2½ percent over the foreseeable future   The other mistake you could make would be to stop too late—that is, move the  funds rate up beyond the level required to work down resource slack and keep  inflation controlled This could prove problematic if the Committee subsequently  took some time to recognize its mistake or desired particularly compelling evidence  to reverse itself However, the Committee has been relatively nimble—say, in 1989  and 1995, as seen in the lower left panel—in unwinding some of its policy restraint   Besides, with corporate risk premiums as low as shown in the bottom right panel, it  seems unlikely that market participants view you as about to overshoot in policy  firming sometime soon   As laid out in the matrix at the top of exhibit 4, in drafting the Bluebook, we tried  to capture the implications for policy choice given the potential answers to these two  key questions That is, you could take the yield curve as signaling (as along the  column headings) economic weakness or a decline in term premiums and you might  fear (as along the row headings) stopping either too soon or too late  Accordingly,  alternative C offered both a firmer stance of policy and words that would lead market  participants to project even more firming to come  Alternative A was structured to  express more concern about the outlook and to signal that the tightening cycle may be  drawing to a close The passage of time may make some of the words of these  alternatives relevant for future meetings, but they’re probably not today                           June 29-30, 2005 163 of 234  You may see little reason to diverge at this point from what seems to have worked  fairly well thus far—measured policy firming—and therefore be attracted to  alternative B Although aggregate spending and output growth evidently slowed in  early spring, the economy appears to remain reasonably robust  Moreover, the recent  evidence may be read as indicating that the pace of expansion is likely to rebound  during the second half of the year to a rate somewhat above that of potential output,  even with further modest policy tightening  And if inflation expectations were seen  as well contained in May, they would seem even more so now    Not to nag, but the structure of the existing statement will become increasingly  strained over time at the four stress points listed in the bottom panel  You currently  describe policy as accommodative, productivity growth as robust, the risks as  balanced, and the pace of tightening as likely to be measured  An issue of strategy  going forward is whether the statement should be patched up as the situation warrants  or left intact until the time comes when you believe additional policy tightening is no  longer likely If the latter, you’ll have to come to grips with just how much guidance  you want in the statement in the future   For completeness, I’ve enclosed the latest version of Table 1, which was   distributed this Tuesday and varies only slightly from what was in the Bluebook    That completes my prepared remarks      Another point I would make, Mr Chairman, is that the contract   allows you to make delivery of any securities maturing between 6½ and 10 years  The Chicago   Board of Trade has a set of adjustment factors that are appropriate when the yields are at 6   percent  And if the yield curve were flat at 6 percent, any of those securities maturing between   6½ and 10 years would be perfect substitutes  So any small movement in the cash market would   immediately mean that you could bring in another security to make delivery  But yields in that   sector are well different than 6 percent now, so the cheapest-to-deliver security is more distinct    And you can get more movement in the cash market without it spilling over to the next security   or the security after that  So in that sense, the natural arbitrage that the basket of deliverable   securities is supposed to provide is not working as well, because the adjustment factors by which   the settlement price is multiplied are out of kilter with the prevailing level of yields    Right And they used to trade May Maine potato futures when there   were no potatoes in Maine in May [Laughter]    There are two aspects of the TIPS market that make it hard to do such   comparisons using those securities  The first is that we think there were significant liquidity   effects, as in the United Kingdom, early on  Our estimates of the liquidity premium have come   down a lot That is, TIPS were a real bargain in the first two or three years of trading, and it is   only now that they probably more closely reflect the macro environment   The second thing is that what we measure is inflation compensation, and inflation   compensation is inflation expectations plus an inflation risk premium And the inflation risk                   September 20, 2005 22 of 117  premium could vary over time  Indeed, our models would think that part of the reduction in   long-term rates has been a reduction in the inflation risk premium  So that’s another reason why   it would be hard to read those as predictors of future inflation    I think you actually alternated your requests—asking each one of us   in turn—and we haven’t updated that in a long time   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the material  that Carol Low is now passing around  And out of deference to Governor Bernanke,  I’m going to start reading before everybody has a copy of the material   As Dave explained, there is a lot going on underneath the newly revised green  sheets, as the effects of higher energy prices and the disruption of Hurricane Katrina  shift the timing and composition of GDP growth over the next few quarters  As is  unfortunately familiar, such a supply shock confronts central bankers with unpleasant  choices, as you have to weigh the benefit of a potential policy offset to near-term   softness in spending against the cost of adding impetus to inflation  By my reading,  however, investors do not share your pain As can be seen in the top left panel of  your first exhibit, market participants apparently interpreted the confluence of events  over the past six weeks as reason to mark down the anticipated path of the funds rate  as much as 30 basis points  While you are expected to tighten today, the market is  betting, on net, that only one more action will mark the conclusion of the measured  removal of policy accommodation   This reduction in expected policy restraint was associated with inflation  compensation moving higher (as shown in the top right panel) and longer-term   nominal yields dropping more considerably (as shown by the 10-year yield plotted at  the lower left) The fact that equity prices posted an increase on balance and  corporate risk spreads remained thin would seem to suggest that investors believe that  the anticipated path of monetary policy, together with fiscal policy stimulus, will be  sufficient to cushion the adverse effects of Hurricane Katrina on aggregate income   and production, albeit with you accepting a little more inflation   The staff’s assessment, summarized in exhibit 2, differs somewhat  In light of the  effects of the hurricane and other news over the intermeeting period, the staff  trimmed its forecast of real GDP growth in the second half of this year (plotted in the  upper left panel) but boosted it in the first half of 2006 as destruction gives way to  reconstruction The outlook for core PCE inflation, given in the second column of the  table in the upper right panel, is a touch lower this year than was anticipated in  August in light of another favorable CPI report but noticeably higher in 2006 as  higher energy costs are passed through into core prices   The bottom four panels offer one perspective on the policy choice confronting  you today—an optimal control exercise, using the version of FRB/US with investors  who are assumed to foresee policy outcomes correctly  The blue solid lines in the  four panels plot the paths of key macro variables under the Greenbook outlook, given  a policy trajectory chosen to minimize a loss function that weights equally   2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                 September 20, 2005 87 of 117  unemployment and inflation gaps and that also puts a small penalty on interest rate  volatility The red dotted lines report the same exercise, excluding the estimated  effects of Katrina on confidence, energy prices, and overall inflation that are  embedded in the baseline forecast  As can be seen, the simulations produce nearly  identical paths for the nominal federal funds rate (the middle left panel)  Essentially,  the Katrina effects temporarily boosting inflation (the bottom right) lower the real  federal funds rate (the middle right) enough to damp the swing in the output gap (the  bottom left)  Thus, the advice coming from the model is to proceed on the path for  policy that you had envisioned before the hurricane’s landfall   Exhibit 3 addresses that policy choice a little more colorfully  The official title of  the Bluebook is “Monetary Policy Alternatives,” and we certainly delivered on that  this time  [Laughter] We included only two explicit policy alternatives A, in which  there is no change in the funds rate; and B, in which it is increased 25 basis points (as  noted in the column headings of the table)  In the associated draft statements, we  assumed that you would not want to send a strong signal about future action  But we  also considered descriptions of how you could signal more conviction about the  future path—either that it would involve a prolonged pause, A-, or a more substantial  ultimate extent of tightening, B+, which is the difference between the “sure” and  “unsure” subheadings   In the Bluebook write-up, we assumed you would continue with the “measured  pace” language, as in the heading of the first row  But recognizing the greater  uncertainty about the economic outlook, we also included a box describing a new risk  formula (the middle row) and the dropping of all guidance (the bottom row)  Three  rows by four columns produce 12 alternatives for the statement—a new Bluebook  record [Laughter]   We paid more attention to the familiar formulation of alternatives A and B for a  reason that would not surprise any viewer of C-SPAN over the past week—stare   decisis As was explained during Judge Roberts’ confirmation hearing and is  summarized in the middle panel, stare decisis translates to “let the decision stand”  and holds that it is proper to adhere to precedent and not unsettle things that are  established Justice Frankfurter noted that it “embodies an important social policy  that represents an element of continuity and is rooted in the psychological need to  satisfy reasonable expectations”   That sentiment favoring delivering the expected has been repeated often in this  room—not in Latin and not always in English either  [Laughter] As shown in the  bottom left panel, market expectations have settled on roughly a 90 percent weight on  a ¼ point firming today  As the right panel relates, primary dealers predominantly  believe that today’s statement will retain the key features of the prior ones, including  describing the Committee’s intention to continue removing monetary policy  accommodation at a measured pace                                September 20, 2005 88 of 117  Some arguments for alternatives A and B are presented in exhibit 4, which begins  with those two Rorschach tests for policymakers—the behavior of the real federal  funds rate relative to the range of estimates of its equilibrium (at the left) and of the  nominal federal funds rate relative to the range of predictions from policy rules (at the  right)   You might favor holding the nominal funds rate at 3½ percent today if you  viewed the real federal funds rate (the solid line at the left) as close enough to its  neutral value to afford you some time to assess the effects of cumulative policy  firming and the near-term dislocations associated with Hurricane Katrina  The fact  that the current nominal funds rate at the right is within the range of recommendations  from standard rules might provide you some confidence in the decision to pause  today In particular, the information that accumulates over the next few weeks might  be seen as particularly revealing about the serious downside risk that the disruptions  in the Gulf region will sap household and business confidence  In that regard, the  preliminary reading on consumer confidence from the Michigan survey plotted in the  middle left panel might be taken as a warning flare  Although that drop was not far  from staff expectations, a deeper and more pronounced slide would be troubling  One  example of the adverse possibilities is the “sentiment slump” scenario in the  Greenbook, which shows the unemployment rate (graphed as the dotted line in the  lower left panel) moving up about ½ percentage point above the baseline (absent a  monetary policy response)   Those favoring alternative B probably see less chance that the outlook will clarify  materially in the next six weeks, in part because economic data are likely to be  contaminated by hurricane effects for months to come  And as for those two upper  panels, the real rate may have risen considerably, but our models suggest that it is still  likely below its equilibrium level  A constant 3½ percent nominal funds rate may  now be consistent with most policy rules but it will not be for long, as the green  envelope of rate recommendations moves upward over the next year   The case for alternative B might have been strengthened by another element of  the Michigan survey released on Friday As plotted in the middle right panel, one- year-ahead inflation expectations (the solid line) spiked higher and even the much  less volatile longer-term expectations moved north of 3 percent  In particular, this  might have served as an unpleasant reminder of the “deteriorating inflation  expectations” scenario in the Greenbook, in which, as at the bottom right, core  inflation remains above 2½ percent through the end of next year   Whatever your choice of policy rate, market participants believe, as I already  mentioned, that the rest of the statement will follow the path laid out in the 11 prior  ones In exhibit 5, I provide draft statements should you want to deviate from that  route, presumably because you view the uncertain economic outlook as rendering                                      September 20, 2005 89 of 117  forward-looking portions of the current statement no longer appropriate  The upper  panel accompanies the policy choice of alternative B with a risk assessment explicitly  conditioned on maintaining the current stance of policy for the next several quarters   Should the macro fundamentals play out as in the Greenbook, output growth is more  likely to exceed that of its potential than fall short of it and inflation more likely to  increase than decrease at an unchanged funds rate  Given that the output gap is  already quite thin, neither outcome would seem to be acceptable to the Committee,  thereby sending the signal that the funds rate is more likely to rise above 3¾ percent  than fall bellow it   This formula follows the convention since May 2003 of describing the uncertainty  about both of the Committee’s goals  Such a formula lacks the nuance possible from  writing the statement afresh each time  But experience suggests that the freshness  date of the statement passes by very quickly given the Committee’s reluctance to  change wording that market participants seem to obsess over  This simple, albeit  coarse, formula also might solve the governance issue of how 19 people can agree on  the key attributes of a statement in a limited time   The bottom panel is silent about the possible path of the funds rate by dropping  the risk assessment and the description of policy as being accommodative  This  version satisfies the test of simplicity, but something may be lost in its economy   These probably are considerations for another day  I bring them up now, however, to  remind you that as the real federal funds rate moves higher into the region where  reasonable people can disagree about whether policy remains accommodative, the  time when you will have to deal with the statement’s structure comes closer   The last exhibit provides the latest draft of Table 1 from the Bluebook  This  version of the table incorporates a few changes from what you saw in the Bluebook   The first is stylistic in that, on re-reading, the last sentence in the paragraph  addressing the effects of Hurricane Katrina on energy prices seemed repetitive  And I  think that has been fixed The other two changes are more substantial, at least from  the perspective of the geological time over which the statement evolves  For one, the  characterization of policy accommodation as “remaining” in the last sentence, as  proposed in the Bluebook, was not in the August statement and has been struck  For  another, longer-term expectations are “contained,” not “well contained” as described  in the August statement  Both changes were made in light of the run-up in inflation  compensation and higher readings on inflation expectations  That concludes my  prepared remarks     We have a cottage industry, Mr Chairman       What we do is take the energy futures curve, take the weight in the CPI—    Actually, Governor Ferguson saw something very similar just this week    I guess the answer is that you do have a need to know, and you will!    [Laughter]    In previous episodes, increases in spot oil prices had brought the spot rate   well above the longer-ahead futures rate, which implied that market participants were expecting   inflation compensation to be going down because of the anticipated decline in energy prices    Relative to those episodes, this time around the curve is relatively flat, so you don’t have that  And   it’s a more permanent effect  It affects the very near-term part of the curve, but it’s a relatively   small weight in the total                                                  November 1, 2005 7 of 114   Mr Chairman, there is also conversion risk  That is, a sovereign   government at a later date could limit what its currency could be used for  Witness all the capital   controls in the ’50s and ’60s    So, in principle, if you’re guaranteed the payments in dollars, you know   you’ll get dollars rather than reals that perhaps couldn’t be used for as many things later on    Mr Vice Chairman, the expected funds rate in April, which is a fairly   clean reading on the March meeting—is about 5 or 6 basis points above 4½ percent  So that puts a   25 percent probability of action there   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials that  Carol Low is distributing   Over the intermeeting period, market participants marked up their expectations of  your coming actions, as seen in the drift upward of Eurodollar futures rates in the top  panel of the first exhibit  The rate for contracts ending this year, the black line, and  next year, the red line, rose 40 and 50 basis points, respectively  Three factors  apparently came into play  First, the economic effects of the spate of hurricanes this  fall seem less momentous now, at least to market participants, than they did on  September 20, the date of your last meeting  Essentially, a portion of the worries  about the economy that lowered rates in advance of the September meeting was rolled  back  Second, data releases, on net, were read as evidence that the economy had  considerable momentum in advance of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina  And third,  many of you expressed concerns in public about inflation risks, and those statements  were taken as a warning of more tightening than previously anticipated   The net result was to shift up the path expected for the federal funds rate, plotted  as the solid black line in the middle left panel, by ⅜ to ½ percentage point relative to  that prevailing before the September meeting, but by only ⅛ to ¼ percentage point  relative to the August meeting  The funds rate is now anticipated to peak at about 4½  percent in futures markets, which is a touch below long-run expectations of the funds  rate suggested by the Blue Chip survey  As shown in the middle right panel, the  surveyed economists see the terminal funds rate at around 4¾ percent  That same  survey, however, suggests that economists pitch a pretty big tent, in that about 50  percent of their responses span a range from 4¼ to 5¼ percent   This ratcheting higher of policy expectations was associated with a tightening of  financial conditions more generally, seen in the bottom panels as the rise in longer­  2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                                                     November 1, 2005 80 of 114  term Treasury yields, decline in stock prices, and appreciation of the foreign exchange  value of the dollar   If you are worried that this financial market reaction was overdone, thereby  imparting too much financial restraint, you might favor holding the intended funds rate  at 3¾ percent today—the subject of the left-hand panels of exhibit 2  As noted in the  first bullet at the top and in the middle panel, the staff forecast of the growth of real  GDP for 2006 has been marked down over the course of the year  You may see  reasons why this might happen again—say, because the economic dislocation from the  hurricanes could be larger than expected or because household spending could sag as  real estate values stop escalating, or even decline, and as consumer confidence, plotted  in the bottom left panel, sinks further  If so, the shock in financial markets in reaction  to alternative A would certainly realign market expectations lower  Indeed, even if  you viewed inaction today as likely to be merely a pause in the process of firming, it  might be difficult to convey that to the public, making it likely that the rotation  downward in rate expectations could be considerable   More probably, you’ll find the arguments for tightening ¼ point—in the right hand  side of the exhibit—to be more compelling  In particular, as the top bullet point and  the middle panel relate, you might view the upward drift in the staff’s inflation  forecast for 2006 over the course of the year as signaling that the risks to the price  outlook are on the upside  A number of you have noted at previous meetings that  inflation was running on the high side of your comfort zone, suggesting that the  prospect of any further rise would be especially unwelcome  In that regard, you might  consider the pickup in the Michigan Survey responses of near- and longer-term  inflation expectations, plotted at the lower right, as evidence of such an unfolding  dynamic   A ¼ point firming might be seen as sufficient at this time to keep inflation  contained, as long as it was expected to be followed by at least a few more moves  going forward  The difference between alternatives B and C in the Bluebook hinges  on how many more tightening moves you see in your future—which could be  conveyed by the language of the statement  With the aid of exhibit 3, I’d like to cover  some of the same ground as President Yellen, but more colorfully, if I say so myself  [Laughter]   This exhibit takes as a starting point the statement issued in September  Among  the pertinent questions are   1 Is productivity growth still robust (the red text)?  2 If the nominal funds rate moves up to 4 percent, will policy still be   accommodative (the green text)?   3 If policy remains accommodative, are you likely to remove that accommodation   at a measured pace (the blue text)?  4 Is there an appropriate path of monetary policy that will balance the risks to   your dual objectives in the face of a supply shock?  (By now, I’ve used up much of my  color palette—but I think it’s the purple text)                                                                November 1, 2005 81 of 114  I would remind you that, even if you do not want to address some of these  questions this afternoon, the passage of time could ultimately force you to do so  An  earlier, rather than later, dialogue about these issues would provide the opportunity to  use the minutes to forewarn the world of changes in language that has been unchanged  for so long that the public might be forgiven for thinking it was carved in stone   Exhibit 4 provides some perspective on these questions, starting with the table at  the upper left listing the four-quarter growth of output per hour over the past few  years The 4 percent growth rate of productivity in the third quarter pulled the four- quarter change to 3 percent  While the FOMC statement refers to underlying, not  actual, productivity growth, this performance may well make you comfortable  retaining the “robust” characterization  In that regard, as can be seen in the chart at the  upper right, the private-sector economists in the Blue Chip panel continue to see  output growing at better than a 3 percent pace in the long run, an assessment that has  been essentially unchanged over the period the Committee has asserted that underlying  productivity growth has been robust   As for assessing the degree of policy accommodation, the middle panel shows that  bringing the nominal funds rate to 4 percent would place the real funds rate at the  midpoint of the range of the staff’s estimates of its equilibrium level  There are three  reasons, listed in the bottom left panel, why you might think that describing policy as  accommodative is nonetheless appropriate, beyond Governor Kohn’s gutting the word  of any meaning  [Laughter]   First, you might believe that the staff is underestimating the vigor of aggregate  demand, perhaps because we’ve penciled in too big a drag on consumption from  higher energy prices and an as-yet-unobserved slowing in home-price appreciation  If  so, your personal estimate of the equilibrium real rate of interest would be to the north  of that plotted in the chart  Second, you might believe that the real rate should be  calculated based on a forward-looking proxy for inflation expectations, not the  backward-looking four-quarter actual core inflation rate used in the chart  If you also  believe that an inflation scare has pulled expected inflation above its recent pace, then  the real rate lies to the south of that plotted here  Third, the gap between estimates of  the equilibrium real rate and its actual level may not be an appropriate measure of  policy accommodation at all  Mechanically, the staff calculates the equilibrium real  rate by determining, within a given model, the level of the real rate that would close  the output gap in about three years  You might view the path of the output gap in the  transition to its ultimate closure as unlikely to unwind current pressures on inflation or  maybe even as consistent with pressures building for a while  That is, if you waited  three years’ time to close the output gap, you might not like the inflation rate likely to  prevail then    The chart in the lower right panel showing the recent jump in energy prices is a  reminder that you might label the current set of forces impinging on the economy as a  supply shock  As the textbooks tell us, a supply shock confronts monetary                                                       November 1, 2005 82 of 114  policymakers with unpleasant alternatives, as it tends to weaken aggregate demand  and put upward pressure on inflation  In such circumstances, there might not be an  appropriate path of policy that balances the risks to your dual objectives  That is, you  might have to accept—and relate to the public in your statement—unbalanced risks   Exhibit 5 presents four alternatives for the language in the relevant part of the  Committee’s statement  As in the top panel, you can limp along at this meeting with  the current wording, reassured by the fact that this would likely preserve something  close to the current path of expected future tightening, because few market participants  anticipate any change   As in the second panel, you can get out of the business of characterizing the degree  of policy accommodation by describing the change, not the level, of the funds rate   Thus, you could say that “   policy firming can continue at a pace that is likely to be  measured,” which implicitly admits the possibility that you may have to impose policy  restraint, on net, to check inflation  This could establish the precedent of providing  guidance by writing a fresh characterization of the odds of your likely future action at  each meeting, appropriately conditioned on the economic outlook  I know that I  discourage easily, but I’d like to point out that this was exactly what you were doing  with the addition of the “measured pace” language in May 2004  But if the policy  outlook does not change materially from meeting to meeting, fresh language can get  hardened pretty quickly   As in the third panel, you can replace the current risk assessment with a formula  based on an unchanged stance of policy, thus providing a coarse signal of your likely  future action My argument for tilting at this windmill one more time is that such a  formula both provides some transparency about your intentions and should simplify  the process of the Committee coming to closure on the language of the statement at  each meeting  In my view, prior efforts to find a satisfactory formula to provide  guidance about your future policy intentions ran aground because most proposals were  too ambitious by incorporating assessments of levels and changes of the Committee’s  dual objectives  A simpler formula—perhaps even couched in terms of interest rates  rather than the Committee’s goals—is more likely to last  If it is not specific enough  on some occasions, you’ve got the rationale part of the statement and the minutes to  provide a more nuanced view   The fourth panel would be appropriate if you wanted to scrap the risk assessment  entirely However, reflecting on the discussion of the Committee and its succession of  subcommittees on this subject over the years, I think those of you who prefer the  simplicity of this alternative may be tilting at your own windmill  By my count,  enough members seem to believe that there is some role for words in narrowing  market uncertainty about your future action to make such guidance a durable feature  of the statement for some time to come   It has been a feature of my briefings for what seems to be a long time to remind  the Committee that a discussion of your communications policy is warranted  I now                                                 November 1, 2005 83 of 114  know the wisdom of the maxim from the “Monkey’s Paw,” “Be careful what you ask  for, you might get it”  Because you have spent some time discussing the issue, the  minutes will have to address the topic   It is also pretty clear that this conversation will continue in December  To inform  that discussion I propose circulating a survey fairly shortly to probe your views on key  principles governing the statement of the sort Governor Ferguson discussed  My goal  is to get back to the Committee before the December meeting with a summary of the  results to make it easier to find the middle ground among the various views that have  been expressed   For your convenience, the last exhibit updates Table 1 from the Bluebook    Relative to what you saw there, we’ve taken comments from some members that I   think simplify the discussion of the outlook in rows 2 and 3     I think it’s a governance issue for the Committee to decide  I was   presuming that you would continue to vote on at least a portion of the statement, the part that   contains the forward-looking language  But it is an open issue why you vote only on a part of the   statement and not the entire document     What the Committee voted on has changed over time Initially, starting   February 4, 1994, the statement issued was explicitly the Chairman’s statement describing what the   Committee did Somewhere about a year and a half later that characterization was dropped, and it   became less clear whether it was the Committee’s statement or the Chairman’s statement  By 1997   or 1998, market participants generally viewed it as the Committee’s statement  Most of the people   sitting around this table, I think, viewed it as the Committee’s statement   When we last rethought what the Committee voted on, it seemed important to bring into the   statement the forward-looking guidance, the risk assessment portion, and that’s why we did that    So, it has evolved  I assume that it will evolve again if you change the basic structure of the   statement    The main one, which has been reflected somewhat in the conversation   already, is that it’s hard to know what inflation expectations are  We don’t have a consistent proxy   over the entire period And it’s not obvious that if you took the entire sample and estimated your   model using measures of inflation expectations that you necessarily would have a different gap right   now because you would not only change the actual expected real funds rate, but you’d also change   your estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate                               November 1, 2005 85 of 114   Among other things, the staff inflation forecast is judgmental and need not   be accepted by the Committee  I think computationally you’re talking about something, if you   wanted to go to the FRB/US model, that would be difficult to do and—    Let me also say, President Moskow, that the passage of time is helping in   terms of providing other measures of the equilibrium real funds rate  We now have indexed debt   quotes We use them to back out an estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate  We don’t have a   long enough time series to know its properties as, say, a predictor of aggregate demand or inflation    Over time, I would think that would become a more standard feature of our analysis, although this   analysis is done in Dave Stockton’s area, and I wouldn’t want to commit his resources  [Laughter]    In talking about market reaction to potential statement wording, you’re   getting as far from economic science as what we do here, and that’s pretty far  It is hard to say, and   maybe I’ll ask Dino to help here, too  But our presumption was that using the “firming” word   would send a signal that you envision not stopping at what you think is the neutral rate but going   above that, and so market participants would raise their sights for how much you would tighten    But that’s only a guess, and that’s the guess we put in the Bluebook    I guess I would like to make a couple points about that  When you think   about the language, the characterization of “accommodation” and the “measured pace” are linked    So if you were, for instance, to take out “accommodation” while leaving in something about   “measured pace,” that would signal that you’re going past the firming now anticipated  On the   other hand, if you left in “accommodation” but took out “measured pace,” market participants   would probably view that as an indication that you want to pick up the pace of tightening—that is,   start doing 50 basis points   The other thing I would like to mention is that this proposal really is, in a sense, “back to the   future” The Committee at one point did signal its intentions about the possible future direction of   its next action in the form of the directive  And the experience back in 1998, when the directive   became part of the Committee’s statement, was that market participants didn’t deal with the                          November 1, 2005 87 of 114  conditional nature of that directive very well  If you were leaning in one direction, they tended to   just slam into that corner  So the purpose of the old balance of risk language was to step back from   there by talking about the Committee’s goals  So, those are all among the things that the Committee   would have to consider in framing new statement language    I really didn’t want to promise too much in my prepared remarks    The sequence I envision is first surveying you on general principles  Are   you comfortable with putting in forward-looking language?  If there’s forward-looking language,                         November 1, 2005 88 of 114  would you prefer it to be about interest rates or the risks to your objectives?  There are differences   of opinion on a number of those basic questions  Then once those survey results are collated—to   see if there really is a middle ground or if there are a couple of distinct alternatives that lend   themselves to these questions—I’d send a document around    No The one in my briefing material is—    This has the semicolon  [Laughter]  The latest version is the one in the last   exhibit of the handout that was distributed just prior to my briefing      Mr Chairman, may I make three points?  The first is that I would   underscore what Dino said  A great event study occurred when the prudent-man law in the United   Kingdom changed, and you saw longer-term yields fall as a result because pension managers had to   go out further on the curve     Around 1998  Second, as you know, in the discussion with the   Treasury, we actually tried very hard to convince them to go to thirty and then to go beyond  But   that’s a very slow-moving boat  Third, real long-term securities are very convex in return  So just   because of the arithmetic of the yield curve, you would think that the fifty-year yield should be   below the thirty-year, as the thirty-year is below the twenty-year  So in an environment of   uncertainty about future yields, it isn’t that surprising     In fact, the yield curve is a competition between two factors in   uncertainty  Because of uncertainty, the term premium itself should march up at approximately   linearly in maturity     But convexity is a quadratic and starts about at the twenty-year maturity   pulling down yields  That’s why typically the thirty-year yield is below the twenty-year yield    When you get out to the fifty-year, then the effect of convexity is even more pronounced     Sure  For instance, when the United Kingdom first issued a fifty-year   security, we priced what a fifty-year maturity would be in the United States  And it was well below   the thirty-year and not that dissimilar to what actually happened  So partly it is just that, because   bonds are in price and that’s what people care about but we quote yields, the effect of convexity is   going to pull down longer-term yields   3  3The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material that  Carol Low handed out during the coffee break  Judging by the information derived  from money market futures plotted in the top panels of your first exhibit, this seems  likely to be another of those meetings in which the important part of the discussion is  about words, not the upcoming deed  As can be seen from the bars in the top left  panel, market participants put near a 100 percent probability on a ¼ point firming  today and high odds on a like-sized move at the March meeting  Both those  probabilities were marked up over the past seven weeks, partly on apparent increased  pressures on costs, what with oil and other commodity prices surging and the foreign  exchange value of the dollar weakening, and—unfortunately—on market  commentary that was taken as having an inside track on your policy choices  The   January 31, 2006 66 of 106    expected federal funds rate, plotted in black in the top right side, now moves  modestly above 4½ percent this spring before turning down late this year     Market participants apparently have bought into the notion that, with inflation   impetus a bit more intense, the Committee will want the real federal funds rate, the  solid black line in the middle panel, more assuredly in a range that is not associated  with policy accommodation  What market participants do not seem to have bought  into is the idea that you’ll act like the hypothetical policymakers described in the  Bluebook  The paths for the nominal and real federal funds rates, derived from an  optimal control exercise using the version of the FRB/US model endowing  policymakers and financial market participants with perfect foresight, are shown in  the bottom panels  The solid and dotted lines are the policy prescriptions under  inflation goals of 1½ percent and 2 percent, respectively  With actual inflation and  the FRB/US measure of long-run expected inflation now running around 2 percent,  policymakers can hold the nominal funds rate steady and allow the real funds rate to  drift lower to achieve 2 percent core PCE inflation in the long run To induce enough  resource slack to work toward a 1½ percent inflation goal, however, policymakers  would have to raise the nominal funds rate to about 5 percent     Market participants see you steering between those two paths for a while—  probably for some combination of three reasons  The first two explain why—even if  your goal for inflation is 1½ percent—you might be less aggressive than in the  corresponding simulation  For one, market participants may see less near-term  pressures on inflation than in the Greenbook and its extension  For another, they may  believe you’d tolerate inflation toward the high end of that range, in part because of  the perception that you would be unwilling to create economic slack deliberately to  achieve a different outcome  Instead, they may think you are willing to wait for some  opportunity in the future, when a negative shock pulls inflation down  And the third  is a reason that—even if you were aiming for inflation of 2 percent—you might be  tighter than the corresponding simulation  In particular, market participants may  believe that your policy choice will be shaped by considerations about risks that  deterministic simulations cannot capture  For example, you might be satisfied with  inflation around current levels, if it were ensured, but be asymmetrically concerned  with regard to its being higher rather than lower  Thus, you might tighten more than  the 2 percent goal simulation as insurance that inflation does not move higher     If, like market participants, you see yourselves operating in the range between the   two paths called for by the optimal control exercises, you most likely would be  willing to tighten ¼ point today and place high odds of doing so again in March  The  two chief wording issues that follow from that decision are listed at the top of  exhibit 2  First, how high are the odds you place on tightening at the March meeting?   In writing the Bluebook, we thought you’d want to preserve the current configuration  of financial market prices, which appears to be based on a 70–30 split on tightening  versus no action in six weeks  Thus, in the portion of the statement language of  alternative B listed in the bottom left, we offered the sentence, “The Committee  judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the   January 31, 2006 67 of 106    attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in  balance”  We thought that this wording gives a strong presumption that policy will  tighten once more but not the certainty that makes many of you uncomfortable  From  what I’ve heard today, I would suggest tweaking that verb phrase to dial down the  market’s perception of future action by removing the word “well”      The second question is, How strongly do you want to underscore that coming   decisions depend on incoming economic data?  We thought that the last sentence of  the December statement, also repeated in the bottom left panel, provided sufficient  assurance on that score  Indeed, this layout seemed to have the attraction of  expressing a back-up strategy in which you would deviate from the anticipated policy  path if events dictate  We also thought that you’d want to make as few changes to the  language as possible today  An alternative is to reverse the order of the last two  sentences, as is done at the bottom right  “The Committee will respond to changes in  economic prospects as needed to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic  growth and price stability  In these circumstances, the Committee judges that some  further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to those objectives  roughly in balance”  Note that the first sentence now describes the baseline  assumption, not a contingency plan  This wording is similar, but not identical, to  language circulated by President Poole  It shares his reordering of the sentences but  does not repeat the “measured policy firming” phrase on the logic that the Committee  may want to free up expectations about action in March  During the policy  discussion, it would be helpful if you would focus some of your remarks on the two  questions I have raised      With the help of exhibit 3, I now turn to my standard procedure in closing to   hector the Committee on some point of governance  The issue, as I explained in my  memo of January 25, is that the statement released this afternoon will likely be only  partly covered by the Committee’s vote  The responses to the survey I sent around  earlier indicated significant support for voting on the entire statement but that a  minority was decidedly opposed  Those opposed are primarily concerned that  requiring members to agree on all the words in the statement may make it more  difficult to reach a consensus  In addition, the public may be confused if a member  dissents, not because of disapproval of the policy action but because of distaste for  the words characterizing the action  Moreover, FOMC participants arguably have  more leeway now to offer views to the public differing from those in the statement  than would be the case if the entire document had the Committee’s seal of approval       Those favoring a formal vote on the entire statement hold that all its aspects,   including the description of the economy, are important in shaping market  expectations about the future path of policy  In that view, it may be a good thing that  the formal vote constrains how members subsequently describe the rationale for  policy action to the public, as it would send a more consistent message about the  prospects for policy       January 31, 2006 68 of 106    These arguments suggest that FOMC participants may want to consider three  alternatives listed in the exhibit  (1) Vote on the entire statement and the directive   (2) Vote on the directive and assessment of risks, as now  But to clarify ownership of  the remaining portions of the statement, the Committee could also vote to authorize  the Chairman to provide a rationale for that action  (3) Retain the status quo, perhaps  with the issue to be raised again at a later date under the next Chairman     The two bottom panels present the formal vote for alternative B should you   prefer, respectively, option 1 or option 2  (The language for option 3, as always, is in  the Bluebook)  Students of this institution probably believe that the statement is  partly owned by the Committee and partly by the Chairman  For the rest, what is  issued at 215 pm on the day of decision is a Committee document  Thus, some  people would view option 1 as delimiting the Chairman’s authority, while others  would view option 2 as rolling back the Committee’s authority  It would seem best  that such suspicions not be harbored about the new Chairman by resolving this  governance issue today if option 2 appeals to you—that is, voting only on the interest  rate, not the rationale, portion of the statement and granting the Chairman an explicit  authority to craft the rest  If, instead, you prefer to vote on the entire statement, then I  would suggest putting off option 1 to another day—so as not to risk creating a  misimpression about your intent     One such opportunity might be the March meeting  Ben Bernanke has asked me   to relay that he prefers that the next meeting run for two days—Monday and Tuesday,  March 27 and 28—so that you can discuss the best way to organize future Committee  discussions  The Secretariat will send around formal notice about the logistics of this  meeting as soon as possible, subject to a notation vote by this Committee naming a  new Chairman  Some supporting documents for the two-day meeting will then  circulate during the intermeeting period     Your last exhibit repeats table 1  I should note that we changed the “smoothing”   language that few of you favored  Instead, the rationale portion opens, “Although  recent economic data have been uneven”       In these simulations, long-run inflation expectations evolve very   gradually based on the path of actual inflation  So what happens is in the 1½ percent simulation you   January 31, 2006 69 of 106    start off with inflation expectations of 2 percent, and you have to experience inflation below that to   work it down     The reason for Monday–Tuesday was that you probably already had   travel plans that got you into DC on Monday, whereas having to extend to Wednesday might pose   more of a hardship  But it was viewed as just for this meeting     As soon as we have a new Chairman, which is subject to action by the   Senate, signature of the President, and a notation vote by this Committee, I will send a memo   around providing the time of the next meeting  As the agenda is not yet set, I am not quite sure   what time it will start      I would also point out, Governor Kohn, on the day in which there was   trading at 6½, above the Lombard rate, one large money center bank borrowed from the window   and then couldn’t place it  Subsequently, the bank wound up holding a portion of the funds itself     Let me just make two other points, President Moskow  The rule itself is   explained in the table in the Bluebook, and I would add two more properties that Dave has   mentioned  One is that its estimation starts in 1988, and the implicit inflation goal in that rule you, I   think, would find unacceptable because it includes a higher-inflation-rate period early in the sample    Second, as Dave mentioned, in fact, there are two lags of the nominal funds rate in that quarterly   predicted equation  But I guess the other part of my response is, well, you have not told us what   your inflation goal is, [laughter] and so we do not have many alternatives except to look at history to   see how this Committee has acted  And if you stretch back long enough to have a satisfactory time   period over which to estimate the equation, you are probably going to misspecify what the inflation   goal is   2       Carol Low will be handing out some material  Market  participants expect you to take another ¼ point step today along the journey started in  June 2004  As can be seen in the top left panel of exhibit 1, the current March and  April fed funds futures contracts, plotted as the first two observations along the black  line, are consistent with the funds rate target moving up to 4¾ percent this afternoon   Compared with what was expected just after your January meeting (the red line)  financial prices indicate increased expectations of an additional ¼ point firming in  coming months This ratcheting up of the policy path was due in part to economic  data that mostly ran on the strong side of expectations and to the absence of a signal  from any of you that the tightening cycle was drawing to a close  The Desk’s survey  of primary dealers, highlights of which are noted in the top right panel, is also  consistent with the certainty of action today and suggests the anticipation of little  change to the statement and the retention of the assessment that the risks to the  outlook are tilted to the upside   As plotted in the middle left panel, options contracts on fed funds futures settling  after the June FOMC meeting put the largest probability weight on one more ¼ point  firming after today and about equal but less weight on the process of tightening  ending after today or continuing after May  The dotted staircase in the middle right  panel shows how far you’ve come along the path begun at the June 2004 FOMC  meeting  ¼ point steps at fourteen successive meetings  The solid line plots the  expected federal funds rate derived from money market futures price prevailing just  before the June 2004 meeting  As can be seen, your policy firming through last  winter about matched the track anticipated at the onset of the cycle  It has been only  in the past five meetings that you picked up the pace relative to market expectations  of nearly two years ago     As to why you might have tightened more than investors originally expected, the   answer is not evident in the bottom left panel, which gives the evolution of the staff  forecast for real GDP growth for 2005, 2006, and 2007 over successive Greenbooks   If anything, the outlook for real growth has moved a touch south over that period   But as shown at the bottom right, the staff outlook for inflation back in June 2004 was  decidedly more favorable than what has materialized since, reflecting, among other  factors, the more-favorable prospects at the time for the prices of oil and other  imported items  If investors also underestimated the extent to which inflation would  rise, then it wouldn’t be surprising that they would also have underestimated the  extent of your policy tightening thus far     Concerns about the prospects for inflation lie at the heart of the case for adding   another ¼ point step to this tightening episode, the subject of exhibit 2  Policy  tightening to date has brought the real federal funds rate, the solid line in the top  panel, past the middle of the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium  Bringing the  nominal federal funds rate to 4¾ percent would put the real funds rate at the top end  of that red range, although still well in the middle of the confidence band around                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 100 of 167       those estimates  Such a stance, though, would be called for if you viewed inflation as  uncomfortably high in your preferred range or poised to rise from its current level     How deeply those possibilities are felt marks the difference between alternatives   B and C in the Bluebook—that is, between signaling a modest or a strong inclination  to tighten at the May meeting  Market participants, to be sure, are confident of a  tightening today and put high odds that you will follow with another such action in  May, in line with the assumption in the Greenbook  Alternative B was designed to  validate those expectations and would be preferred if you viewed the staff forecast in  the bottom left panel of an unemployment rate under 5 percent and inflation near  2 percent to be both plausible and acceptable  The Committee might want to project a  firmer stance of policy—that is, a sure tightening in May and a chance of further  action as in alternative C—for several reasons  Chief among them might be some  mistrust of the main mechanism producing slowing in consumer spending in the staff  forecast—namely, the deceleration in house prices plotted at the bottom right   Although anecdotes of slowing in the housing market abound, you might not be ready  to sign on to that outlook until more convincing evidence is in hand     I now turn to the question posed at the top of exhibit 3  When are you going to   stop?  According to surveys and, as shown in the top left panel, futures markets  predict that you’ll most likely cease tightening by June  The policy rules plotted at  the top right would predict a quicker end than that—indeed, they see some odds that  you would already be done  Another perspective is given in the middle panel, which  plots as the red line the long-run expected short rate consistent with the staff’s  arbitrage-free model of the term structure  The current short rate, the dark solid line,  has already marched up to that long-run level       You might view arguments for further tightening to be problematic for a number   of reasons  The solid line in the bottom left panel plots the Greenbook forecast for  real GDP growth  It not only slopes downward, but its historical confidence regions  also encompass a significant possibility of subpar growth, as in the lower shaded  region  True, there is an upper shaded region, too, but if your own outlook lies below  the Greenbook path or you weigh the lower outcomes more heavily than the higher  ones, then you would want a lower, not higher, federal funds rate  The standard  argument for further policy action is that its absence would risk inflaming inflation  expectations  As shown in the bottom right panel, however, inflation compensation at  a long horizon has remained very subdued     The Committee’s choice of the funds rate target is only part of its decision  Some   wording issues are considered in exhibit 4  In alternatives B and C in the Bluebook,  we kept the risk assessment tilted toward tightening, as in the top panel  But as  shown directly below, the confidence bounds surrounding estimated policy rules (the  green region at the left) or inferred from money market options (the blue region at the  right) are quite wide  This suggests that the time will soon arrive when you will no  longer be confident in predicting the likely future direction of your next action  If any   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 101 of 167       of you thinks that time is now, we did offer words for a balanced risk assessment in  alternative A     Another sentence offered in alternative A is in the third row of the exhibit  The   statement could end, “Nevertheless, future policy action will be determined by the  evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information”  I admit that  those words don’t mean anything different from what appeared at the end of the  January statement—and were repeated in alternatives B and C  I had the hope,  though, that changing the language might draw attention to the sentiment  Despite  the presence of that data-dependent clause in previous statements and its  reinforcement in successive minutes, market participants seem more focused on the  messages they are receiving from you than from the economic data  For instance, as  noted in the bottom row, the response of the two-year note, measured along the  vertical axes, to surprises in nonfarm payrolls, measured along the horizontal axes,  had been elevated from 2003 to 2004 (that’s the middle scatterplot)  However, over  the past 1¼ years, as can be seen at the far right, the response has been more subdued,  perhaps necessitating a reminder to markets to look to the data     I’d like to point out another design aspect of alternative A, which is provided in   the latest version of table 1 at the end of your handout  As is evident, we squeezed a  lot of words into that column  We did it for two reasons  First, it seemed appropriate  for the Committee to offer an extended rationale for ending a tightening phase that  has lasted nearly two years  Second, as you become less sure of your future policy  action—remember, this alternative has a balanced risk assessment—you might want a  fuller description of the economic outlook  By the way, a longer statement might  give you the opportunity to rely less on imprecise adjectives and more on a recitation  of key facts  We tried that out last week with our first draft of table 1, but the few of  you who commented were deeply enough opposed that we struck the numerical  reference     I’d also like to point out changes made in the table overnight in light of your   discussion yesterday, which are provided in blue and seem mostly consistent with  what was said earlier this morning  Meeting participants emphasized that growth  rebounded strongly and appears likely to settle to a pace consistent with that of the  economy’s potential to produce  As a result, the risks to the growth outlook appear  roughly balanced  In alternative B, we added some forward-looking language to that  effect in row 2  Because many of you seemed a bit more optimistic about the  prospects for inflation, we repeated the qualifier “possible” from the January  statement in front of “increases in resource utilization” in row 3 for alternatives A and  B  The other minor changes were made for stylistic reasons       You are right—there are not a lot of dots in that bottom right scatter plot     We did include a box in the Bluebook that showed a more systematic   look at the response to data and that was not looking just at the payroll employment surprise  It was   looking at eleven different surprises  And it was the case that the response, no matter—Governor   Kohn is grimacing, but that’s okay [Laughter]     I can tell     It’s toward the back if you want to refer to it  But the point is, the   response has moved down  What is actually interesting is that, if you split these data observations   into real side and inflation, the response to inflation data has come down the most, consistent with   the view that they think that the Federal Reserve has actually contained inflation and also consistent   with subdued inflation expectations     That is a long answer to what I really should say  Yes, you are right    We don’t have enough observations to really know     So some concern was expressed that having dropped the word   “possible” relative to what was in January, the Committee would be making the determination that,   indeed, economic slack had gone away and that the channel itself would put upward pressure on   inflation     Right, but I think the issue there is that it is true that resource utilization   has tightened, but then to make the determination that it could add to inflation pressures is to say   that it, in fact, has gone past the level of full capacity—that is, the unemployment rate is below the   natural rate and output is above capacity  It did not seem, at least from the discussion yesterday,    that everyone would buy onto the view that the economy was working above its potential     Heaven forfend  [Laughter]       I would note that, in your discussion of the economy yesterday, a   number of you did point out that a well-maintained trend in productivity is holding unit labor costs   in check  I am not doing well in facial expressions, but yes  So I will take your objection as saying   that this is, in fact, an inner working in the inflation process that is ultimately a monetary   phenomenon, and it is not appropriate to single out one of the parts of a mechanism at this particular   time     I guess I would have to admit that the words are not that clear  What we   meant rather was that, for the given increases in compensation, structural productivity growth has   kept unit labor costs from expanding more than they would otherwise     Right     Nineteen     Well, as part of the discussion from yesterday, these policy rules are   pretty inertial, and in the seven quarters of data to the right of the forecast line, you’re not really   going to see a material difference from your choice of inflation objectives  As you can see in the   table, it really means only 10 basis points for the policy rules whether you have a 2 percent goal or a   1½ percent goal  Ultimately it matters a lot, and you see that in the extended Greenbook forecast    March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 106 of 167       You see it in the optimal-control exercises we showed previously, particularly in versions of the   model that involve perfect foresight  You bring forward some of that action, and so that   ½ percentage point difference in your inflation goal does actually control the amount of   overshooting of the funds rate that you’re going to find appropriate     The words in alternative B were designed to try to keep the prevailing   path for policy expectations, and that’s one of the reasons they are different from what is in the   leftmost column from the January FOMC statement  I think I agree with your assessment that, if   you merely repeated the January statement, then market participants would have two observations in   which the words “some further policy firming may be needed” imply certain action at the next   meeting     Right     We retained the words of row 4 but not the assessment of the economy    And that is one reason we give so many reasons that inflation prospects may be favorable—the idea   that market participants would read this to mean that you are inclined toward tightening but see   reasons why you may not have to do much     My suspicion is that they would think you’re done  No guidance on   interest rates means that you’re not likely to act     Essentially the Committee is repeating its frustration back in 1999, when   it immediately published the directive with its announcement and it seemed that the tilt in the   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 109 of 167       directive to the effect that the Committee was more likely to raise rates than lower them was read as   more predictive of your future action than many of you wanted  That is, markets moved to one of   the corners and did not view it as a probability statement  I think you’re in that position again  I   think that one reason we added to the rationale sentence was to contain that risk       The carry effects are going to matter only for the first part of it  And as we   noted in the Bluebook, at the time we had an increase in inflation compensation of about 15 basis points    Most of it was related to energy prices  If you think about the term structure of energy futures, they   actually tilt down at the far end, and so that would go the wrong way  So everything in terms of the rise   in the five-year-ahead five-year forward rate would be inflation compensation  If you go to our   May 10, 2006 6 of 120    multifactor models of the term structure, we would attribute something like half to term premiums, and   half then would be inflation expectations     Mr Chairman, I would note that the first place I could find mention of the   Federal Reserve’s asking about paying interest on reserves was in 1965  But there are some operational   implications, including in the STAR (Statistics and Reserves) process, of actually figuring out a way of   paying interest on reserves  It came close about four years ago, I guess, and we had put modifications   into STAR in order to be able to pay interest on reserves  There might be some bumps along the way     As for the longer-run implications, once we’re assured that there’s a stable   demand for reserves, we can simplify reserve requirements, which are quite antiquated and kind of   embarrassing     Yes     You see exactly that point, President Moskow, in the alternative simulation in   the Bluebook in which we asked what it would take over the extended Greenbook period to achieve an   inflation target of 1½ percent—which effectively means to work out ½ percentage point worth of   inflation  You have to keep the real five-year interest rate almost ¾ percentage point higher until the   end of the decade to do that  You also see the importance, as President Lacker noted, of the behavior of   inflation expectations because in one simulation we assume that inflation expectations evolve as they   have historically—that is, only gradually adjusting  In the other simulation we ask, what happens if that   adjustment is quicker?  The answer is that monetary policy is a lot easier when inflation expectations are   better anchored at a lower level   May 10, 2006 23 of 120      Again, as the property of the model that Dave mentioned, it’s a very flat   Phillips curve  It takes a lot of unemployment years to work that back     I’m not sure I have that expertise  Perhaps the evolution of inflation   expectations is asymmetric, as President Moskow suggested  Perhaps it’s also what we look at at a high   frequency  Inflation compensation doesn’t exactly map into inflation expectations—it includes an   inflation risk premium  We think that some of the rise in inflation compensation is due to an unwinding   of something we couldn’t explain—that is, a term premium that was very low by historical standards    To the extent that it’s the term premium rising, it could get packed into that measure of inflation   compensation  I would also note that, as Dave said, in the Michigan survey of households, longer-term   inflation expectations ticked up  In the Blue Chip consensus forecast that’s released today, longer-term   inflation expectations are actually unchanged over the last month, and that covers the span of the rise in   energy prices and the whiff of inflation jitters that we saw in financial markets   2       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the intermeeting period, the data  came in stronger than the tone of the Committee’s deliberations in March would have led any  listener to suspect  As a result, Committee communications that reflected that discussion— including the minutes, speeches by some of you, and the Chairman’s testimony—tended to  pull down the expectations of future policy action, plotted in the top panel of your first  exhibit, even as data releases tended to push them up  On net, the data won, and the path of  policy expectations, the middle left panel, rotated up 25 to 35 basis points  The term  structure of nominal Treasury yields also rotated up, implying increases in nominal forward  rates, the blue bars in the middle right panel, of 25 to 55 basis points  These gains  outstripped the rise in real forward rates, the green bars, resulting in significant increases in  inflation compensation, the difference in the height of the bars     Inflation compensation over the next five to ten years is plotted in the bottom panel   How you interpret these movements is likely a critical element in your policy choice today   On the one hand, the recent rise in inflation compensation, the shaded yellow area, has not  moved it noticeably above its range of variation in the past two years  Indeed, at 2¾ percent,  forward inflation compensation is lower than at times when the Committee described  inflation or inflation expectations in previous policy statements as “contained” or “well  contained,” the blue shaded areas  If you think that is still the case, then you also probably  believe that you have scope to be patient in policy setting On the other hand, if you focus on  the 20 basis point rise over the intermeeting period, you might conclude that there’s been a  partial outbreak of inflation jitters—not a pandemic, mind you, but the first instance of  trader-to-trader transmission  [Laughter]  The anti-virus typically prescribed is a vigorous  assertion of your willingness to tighten policy      Other evidence of possible inflation concerns is the subject covered at the top of your   next exhibit  From left to right, survey measures of household inflation expectations have  moved up for both near-term and longer-term horizons, and the value of the dollar has fallen  sharply on foreign exchange markets  It might be that financial market participants place  some weight on domestic spending retaining considerable momentum, putting pressures on  resources  One such scenario was played out in the Greenbook and is summarized in the   2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   May 10, 2006 74 of 120    middle panels  In the “Domestic Boom” alternative scenario, the growth of spending does  not moderate much—perhaps because a slowing in house-price appreciation does not  materialize and firms begin to dip into their ample cash coffers to fund investment  Inflation  differs little from the baseline, but that is, in part, because policy responds, raising the  nominal funds rate to 6¼ percent—as in the dashed line at the right  This provides an  opportunity to repeat a point made at Monday’s briefing  Such an action would be  inconsistent with current market expectations in that it would place the rate at the top of the  90 percent confidence band implied by options prices (the blue span)  But our understanding  of the economy—as encapsulated in stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model—is  sufficiently imprecise (the green range) that such an outcome shouldn’t be all that surprising      Speaking of surprises, a major objection to tightening 50 basis points at this meeting to   show your anti-inflation resolve, as in alternative C of the Bluebook, is that it would catch  market participants unaware  Indeed, as shown in the bottom panel, it would be the biggest  surprise of the modern era of FOMC announcements, at least as measured from futures  market readings just before the statement had been released      In contrast, the 25 basis point action discussed in exhibit 3 is exactly what the market is   looking for  Moreover, the staff projects that the economy will hit what you might consider  to be a sweet spot, with the unemployment rate (the top left panel) zeroing in on its natural  rate and core PCE inflation (the top right) receding to 2 percent  That forecast is predicated  on firming action today and none thereafter      Alternative B in the Bluebook was structured to accompany such an action with the   message that there is some chance that you might be done today, but you might not  As can  be seen in the middle left panel, energy prices have moved up sharply, which poses the  classic tension of dragging down spending while imparting some lift to inflation  In that  regard, the relationship between changes in energy prices and core inflation—as at the  middle right—has been tenuous at best over the past twenty years, suggesting you might  prefer to focus more on the consequences of the oil shock on aggregate demand than  inflation  If so, you might view that source of additional restraint as a substitute for further  monetary policy firming  A ¼ point hike today will bring the real federal funds rate, the  solid line in the bottom panel, toward the high end of the range of estimates of its  equilibrium—another reason you might view yourself as done, or at least close to done     Indeed, if you give credence to the simulations presented in the Bluebook you might view   yourself as already done, which is why we included alternative A, the subject of exhibit 4  If  you have an inflation goal of 2 percent and agree with the staff assessment that the  equilibrium real rate is around 2¾ percent, then the current nominal funds rate of 4¾ percent  probably has a lot of appeal  When we ran simulations of the version of the FRB/US model  in which market participants are forward looking, holding the funds rate at 4¾, as in the top  left panel, instead of tightening some and backing off a bit later, does not matter much for the  paths of the unemployment rate and inflation (the bottom panels)  Thus, from the perspective  offered by the staff model, you can go home now and not come back until the next decade,  which by the way will make the work of Governor Kohn’s subcommittee easier  [Laughter]       May 10, 2006 75 of 120    Your last exhibit gives alternative statement language, where the items in red denote new  wording relative to the March statement and those in blue represent changes relative to what  you saw in the Bluebook  Some concern was expressed that alternative B did not convey  sufficient concern about inflation risks, so we’ve tightened it up somewhat  As can be seen,  this alternative, first, stresses that current economic growth is quite strong (row 2); second, in  row 3 it now simply repeats the March language verbatim; and third, it drops the word  “modest” in referring to the outlook for policy firming  One last one-word change did not  get onto the table  In the second sentence of row 2, we’re proposing to go back to the March  language and refer to a growth as “likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace” instead of  “toward a more sustainable pace”  That concludes my prepared remarks       Oh, I thought that question was directed to Dino  [Laughter]       In yesterday’s quotes, the July fed funds contract was at 507; so that is basically   a 7-out-of-25 chance that the Committee would act  In the design of B, we thought that the probability   would move it up into the 50-50 to 60-40 range  I think it is probably a little tougher than what is in the   Bluebook, so I am a little more confident it would be above 50-50       Well, President Poole, the most unsatisfying paragraphs in the Bluebook   meeting after meeting are the ones that try to divine what the market reactions to alternative statements will   be  We do not have a scientific way of doing it     One last point is that the second part of the sentence in row 4 is partly already in   markets because it is a repetition of what was in the Joint Economic Committee testimony  So in that sense,   I agree with Dino that they will be looking at the earlier words    3       Thank you, Mr Chairman  As can be seen in the top panel of  your first exhibit, market participants marked up their expectations of policy action at  this and subsequent FOMC meetings, on net, over the intermeeting period   Apparently, the upward impetus of stronger-than-anticipated releases on inflation and  statements by Federal Reserve officials more than offset the drag of readings on  economic activity that had a soft cast  The expected path for the federal funds rate  over the next two years, the middle left panel, had shifted 25 to 35 basis points by the  time of the publication of the Bluebook  In the week since, those expectations edged  higher still, with investors sure of a ¼ point hike today and expecting more of the  same by autumn  As has been true for a while, the funds rate is apparently seen by  investors as trailing off subsequently—with your last ¼ point rise rolling off in 2007   Three explanations have been offered for this inversion of the money market  futures curve, as noted in the middle right panel  The first, which is probably more  popular inside this building than outside it, is that it may well be optimal to raise the  nominal funds rate in response to a temporary bulge in inflation so as to keep the real  interest rate from falling  As inflation recedes, the nominal funds rate can be reduced  so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising  Such a path has been a common  feature of the Bluebook exercises we’ve shown you when the Committee is assumed  to desire an inflation goal below the prevailing rate of inflation     The second explanation is based on an assumed nonlinearity in the housing   market  Housing demand, some analysts claim, has been importantly buoyed by  outsized expectations of capital gains, expectations that for a time have been  impervious to the level of the policy rate  In such a circumstance, the FOMC has to  tighten to the point that it gets the attention of those investors  But when it does get  their attention and housing demand softens suddenly, the Committee will have to  change gears quickly     The third explanation relates to a hardy perennial in FOMC transcripts  Over the   years, many of you or your former colleagues have said that your last action in any  phase of a policy cycle is always a mistake  And you can’t look at the current  configuration of futures rates without wondering whether it is happening again  The  Committee might, however, be willing to accept tilted odds of over-tightening if that  were judged to be the least unattractive alternative  That is, a funds rate a little higher  than that consistent with full resource utilization for a time may be seen as the  necessary cost of countering inflation that has risen above your comfort zone  Note  also that the extent to which markets view you as rolling back some portion of your  anticipated 50 basis points of additional firming will lessen the consequences of that  near-term policy path for the prices of longer-lived assets and, presumably, aggregate  demand   3 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   June 28-29, 2006 94 of 177      As can be seen in the second column of the table at the bottom left, the upward   revision to near-term policy expectations flattened the yield curve somewhat, with  rates on two-year Treasury notes rising 30 basis points compared with the 13 basis  point gain in their ten-year counterparts  As the bars at the right show, the rise in  nominal rates was more than accounted for by an increase in their real components,  especially at short maturities, and inflation compensation edged lower     This rise in real rates, along with the decline in equity values shown in the bottom   two rows of the table, implies that financial market conditions tightened over the  intermeeting period  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 2, such a tightening,  against the backdrop of weakish data on spending, might incline you to keep the  funds rate unchanged at 5 percent today  Such concerns would be particularly acute  if you interpreted the anecdotes and survey measures of participants in the housing  market (as in the middle left panel, for instance) as suggesting a more pronounced  housing slump than embedded in the staff forecast     But you might see some reason to pause now even if you bought into the basic   contours of the Greenbook outlook  Estimated policy rules explaining the  Committee’s behavior over the past eighteen years that are fed outcomes for inflation  and the output gap as in the staff forecast (plotted as the dashed lines in the middle  right panel) predict that you will be lowering the policy rate  Similarly, the  simulations shown in the Bluebook and repeated in the remaining panel suggest that,  with a 2 percent inflation goal and specific assumptions about your preferences,  you’d also be satisfied with a funds rate no higher than 5 percent  In that scenario,  however, you’d be willing to accept core PCE inflation (the bottom right figure)  running at 2⅜ percent for almost one year  Market participants, in part learning from  your public comments, evidently view you as unwilling to accept such an outcome   And if your own assessment of the economy has evolved in the same direction as that  of the staff, then your near-term policy choices have probably gotten more  unpalatable       As can be seen in the top panel of exhibit 3, the Greenbook outlook for   unemployment (at the left) and for core PCE inflation (at the right) has worsened over  the course of this year  We tried in the Bluebook to summarize the net consequence  of the changes over the past six months in the forces shaping the economy using the  FRB/US model  In those simulations, repeated in the middle panel, the policy that  best accomplishes the assumed objectives and the resulting macroeconomic outcomes  given by the current outlook (the solid lines) are compared with those implied by the  extended outlook at the time of the January Bluebook (the dashed lines)  In each of  these simulations, policymakers are assumed to have a long-run inflation goal of 1½  percent and to place equal weights on the three stabilization objectives  output,  inflation, and policy stability  The current outlook implies a funds rate path that  peaks a bit above 5½ percent in mid-2007 and then declines gradually to about 4½  percent by 2010, noticeably above the rate call in January      June 28-29, 2006 95 of 177    Another aspect of the changed outlook, this time seen from the perspective of  financial markets, is the rise in far-ahead inflation compensation, the red-dotted line  in the bottom panel, over the past year  True, you may be heartened that inflation  compensation has moved lower since the outbreak of jitters in late April and that, as  noted in the inset box, changes in policy expectations prompted by official statements  appear to have been associated with a decline in far-ahead inflation compensation   But concerns about investors’ confidence in your commitment to price stability,  witnessed by the positive correlation of data surprises and inflation compensation  over the same period, are probably at the root of a decision to tighten at least 25 basis  points today and signal that more may come, the subject of exhibit 4     As can be seen in the top panel, a ¼ point move today would position the real   funds rate more assuredly above the center of staff estimates of its neutral level  And  putting some weight on the simulations presented in the Bluebook, if your inflation  goal is 1½ percent, as in the middle panel, you may see the need to move the nominal  funds rate up from 5 percent sometime soon  Indeed, if you put a particularly high  priority of the attainment of that goal—as in the dashed lines—even more tightening  is in store     As shown in the bottom panel, the prevailing market sentiment is toward a   ¼ point firming today, which has been a compelling, but not conclusive, argument for  action in the past  The key question for each of you is, What probability do you place  on another ¼ point firming in August?  The solid line in the bottom left figure plots  the implied probability currently in financial markets of tightening at both the June  and the August FOMC meetings  When drafting the statement, we thought an 80  percent market probability of such a dual action was on the high side of what you  would prefer  So, in table 1, which is updated as your last exhibit, we put a few  markers to rein in expectations of action in August  Note that the rationale paragraph  asserts that growth is moderating and repeats reasons that inflation might be held in  check  More important, the assessment of risk is also couched in terms of your goals  rather than just the policy instrument  My bet is that, with the release of the  statement, the odds would go to 50-50 on action in August, but you should probably  view that as no more informative than the flip of a coin        The minutes are released three weeks from today  Testimony is   tentatively scheduled to be the day before and the same day  Is that right, Brian?      So the testimony is Wednesday, and the minutes are released   Thursday  The first leg of the testimony is on Wednesday; the second leg is on Thursday   June 28-29, 2006 110 of 177       It was also the most distasteful option from the perspective of staff, both   at the Board and at the Reserve Banks, because it does interfere with the briefings many of you   receive and just makes our life more complicated  I appreciate that that’s not necessarily in your   welfare function     We will do our best to solve the over-determined system that you’re   telling us about     Also remember that Debbie said Tuesday and Wednesday in part   because we also have to line it up with the calendar of international commitments, which include   June 28-29, 2006 144 of 177    BIS meetings and the annual meetings  So we start with Tuesday and Wednesday, but we may not   get there     Remember that, by the time the calendar is released, the minutes of this   meeting, the Monetary Policy Report, and the Chairman’s testimony will be out, and we already had   a marker in the Report to talk about the formation of the subcommittee     President Lacker, the thing to point out in the staff forecast for CPI   inflation is that they are forecasting declines in the CPI in September and October That’s   September 20, 2006 8 of 132                                        reflected in the shift in the bars at the left in that box in the Bluebook  So it really is at the very   front end    Yes There is something happening at the near end  [Laughter]    Also, look at the relative movement  The first five years it’s moving   in a much wider range  The five-year five-year-forward rate has come down a bit but really not a   lot   September 20, 2006 9 of 132                                                   I’m okay with that interpretation    That was the forward rate    Right The numbers in the box are the twelve months ending in   October and November, and they’re not carry adjusted  They’re straight reads from that portion   of the differential between the two yield curves  So there are two things going on  the shifting in   time and the carry adjustment    If it was a forward rate, yes    I only speak when asked, Mr Chairman  [Laughter]   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman and some participants [Laughter]  Over the intermeeting period, tumbling oil prices, better-behaved inflation, and the  minutes of the August meeting, which conveyed a more widespread disinclination to  tighten than investors suspected, pulled nominal interest rates lower  As can be seen  by the solid line in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the rate on three-month  Eurodollar futures expiring this December declined a touch, on net, and is now  consistent with the federal funds rate remaining at 5¼ percent for the remainder of the  year Investors seem to expect policy easing thereafter, in that the contract expiring  one year later has a rate about ½ percentage point lower  This can be seen most  clearly by the black line in the upper right panel, which shows that the path expected  for the federal funds rate over the next two years has a decidedly negative slope     As indicated by the shift from the black dotted to the black solid line in the lower  left panel, this revision to policy expectations was associated with a roughly parallel  step downward in the term structure of nominal Treasury yields over the intermeeting  period The yield curve for indexed securities moved up closer to its nominal  counterpart—the shift from the dotted to the solid red line—implying that the  difference, inflation compensation, declined     These relative movements can be made more precise by putting them in terms of   changes in implied forward rates, as at the right  Nominal forward rates (the top   panel) declined in a relatively uniform fashion, from 8 to 15 basis points  The   rotation up in the real yield curve, however, was associated with sizable increases in   short-term real forward rates and declines at longer horizons  The arithmetic   difference between the two is plotted in the bottom right panel  Inflation   compensation fell noticeably at short horizons, but the decline tapered off as the   maturity lengthened      3 Materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   September 20, 2006 91 of 132                        One way to tie these disparate movements into a neat package is to argue that the  substantial decline in oil prices in recent weeks represents a disinflationary impetus  that is anticipated to be only partly offset by you  That is, nominal rates will move  lower but by less than the drop in inflation so as to keep real interest rates higher for a  time  In this story, the decline in oil prices represents an opportunity to disinflate—an  opportunity that investors expect you to take by being slow to lower nominal interest  rates The same story, however, can take on a darker hue if it is argued that the fall in  the prices of oil and other commodities evidenced a slowing in global activity brought  on at least in part by your previous 17 policy firmings—that is, this opportunity for  disinflation could be one of your own making     Either explanation—one of omission or one of commission—produces a  moderation in spending and a drift down in inflation that would seem to be consistent  with holding the funds rate at 5¼ percent for now, a possibility examined in more  detail in exhibit 2  At its August meeting, the Committee assessed the risks to be  such that it could hold policy unchanged given its expectation that growth would  moderate and inflation decline  The information received since then would seem to  strengthen that determination  As shown in the top left panel, inflation compensation  measured in the Treasury market is about unchanged at the longer horizon (the red  line) and distinctly lower in the near term (the black line)  How much of this decline  represents a drop in inflation expectations as opposed to a decline in inflation risk  premiums is hard to say, but the evidence at the right may be suggestive  Merrill  Lynch conducts a monthly survey of global fund managers about their views of  macroeconomic risks and portfolio inclinations  More than 200 of them typically  reply, and last month an increased share of them were of the view that inflation would  be lower, rather than higher, than in recent months  This view seems to be  underpinned by the expectation that economic growth will moderate so that resource  slack will open up, perhaps as in the staff forecast in the middle left panel  Indeed,  when asked about global economic growth, the fund managers surveyed by Merrill  Lynch mostly expected it to slow, as at the middle right, with more of them of that  view than earlier in the year     As can be seen directly below, the slowing is not anticipated by investors to be so  precipitous as to tip the world economy into recession  More than 90 percent of the  managers view such an outcome as unlikely  Thus, they wouldn’t seem to be putting  much weight on the flatness of the yield curve, plotted at the bottom left, as a leading  indication of recession—nor would you if you’re inclined to keep policy on hold  In  that regard, as the chart makes clear, the yield curve has had some predictive power  for recession over the past forty years  For instance, the inversion of the term  structure in 2000 was sending a signal that, in retrospect, might have warranted a  response This indicator may seem less compelling now for two reasons  First, a  flattening yield curve has sent false signals as well over the years, including of  recessions that didn’t occur in the mid-1990s  Second, much of the downward tilting  of the term structure seems due to a decline in term premiums, which might be a sign  of reduced uncertainty rather than a sign of increased economic vulnerabilities     September 20, 2006 92 of 132                              Indeed, some Committee members may be far from seeing the economy as  vulnerable—perhaps to the point of inclining them toward firming policy 25 basis  points, as in exhibit 3 In particular, financial market participants do not seem to have  heard the message of the August statement that the risks were tilted toward higher  policy rates Rather, as shown in the top left panel by the spread of the December  2007 Eurodollar futures contract below the December 2006 one, about 50 basis points  of easing is expected next year This expectation of ease may be contributing to low  credit spreads (the top center panel) and the recent rise in equity prices (the top right  panel) This financial impetus might be seen as a reason that spending will not  moderate sufficiently to make a noticeable dent in inflation     Even if those expectations are wrung out of financial market prices over time—as  in the staff forecast—the resulting path of inflation may not be acceptable to the  Committee  As shown in the middle panel, core PCE inflation is projected by the  staff to remain above 2 percent through the end of 2008, which would mark the fifth  consecutive year of such an outcome  The survey expectations of CPI inflation—  plotted at the bottom left—similarly remain well above 2 percent  While survey  responses came down over the intermeeting period, you might discern a slight  uptrend in the past few years that could be taken as an erosion of the public’s  confidence In such a circumstance, members may believe that more-acceptable  progress toward price stability will likely involve a firmer stance of policy, a  judgment that would be strengthened if you thought the spike in the growth of  compensation per hour plotted at the right was not as likely to roll back as the staff  projects   The Bluebook lived up to its title, “Monetary Policy Alternatives,” by offering the  five different options given in exhibit 4—three formal ones and two variants (which  are shaded) that were discussed in the text If your intent is to solidify current market  expectations of easing, switching to balanced risks, as in A, probably has some  appeal The words of alternative B were designed to leave market rates about  unchanged, whereas B+ emphasizes that tightening is more likely than easing  It  doesn’t really say anything new, but we thought the force of repetition might get the  attention of market participants  The alternative labeled C- couples tightening with a  removal of the rate bias, signaling that the Committee may be done, whereas C  imposes considerable additional restraint by retaining an assessment of upside risks  even after firming     Your last exhibit repeats table 1 from the Bluebook with a minor change noted in  red in the second row      Half the class [Laughter]   2       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The pulse of the market  regarding your policy action today is the flat line in the top panel of your first exhibit  [Laughter]  Not weakish data releases early in the period, nor stronger ones later, nor  speeches by some of you interpreted as hawkish shook the belief that the intended  federal funds rate would remain at 5¼ percent after this meeting  Expectations about  the policy rate at the end of next year, proxied by the December 2007 Eurodollar  futures rate—the dotted line—showed more life, falling about 20 basis points by the  middle of the period but ending up 5 basis points higher, on net  As can be seen in  the middle left panel, market participants still anticipate almost ½ percentage point of  policy easing next year  Once again, as denoted by the green shaded area, the 70  percent confidence interval derived from options prices is quite narrow  We routinely  track the economic forecasts of a subset of nine of the primary dealers, and their  average path for the federal funds rate through 2007 is plotted as the dashed line in  the middle right panel  Those dealers and the forecast from market quotes—but not  the Greenbook assumption plotted as the horizontal line—call for policy easing next  year  The primary dealers’ policy call occurs against the backdrop of forecasts for the  unemployment rate (the bottom left panel) and core CPI inflation (the bottom middle   panel) that about match the Greenbook’s  What is different is plotted at the bottom  right  These dealers expect real GDP growth to track about ½ percentage point  higher than does the staff  One possibility is that these market participants, compared  with the staff, foresee both more drag on domestic spending and faster-expanding  potential output  If so, dealers would correspondingly view policy ease as necessary  to generate economic growth that will be acceptable to you                                                     2 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   October 24-25, 2006 78 of 203    Your own view as to the economy’s potential to produce no doubt influences your  views on policy, as do your interpretations of the three factors described in exhibit 2   The top left panel plots existing and new home sales as the solid and dotted lines,  respectively  You might see in that chart that house sales have declined sharply and  view the resulting weakness as a risk to the outlook, as has been the case at the past  few meetings  Alternatively, you might see that home sales appear to be bottoming  out amid generally strong fundamentals  As one newsletter put it—and I think that  the author meant it to be good news about the prospects for spending—that “the point  of maximum deterioration in housing activity has probably passed”  The middle  panel plots the real federal funds rate, which some of you may emphasize has risen  considerably and take its level now to be restrictive  Others, however, might stress  that the real federal funds rate remains below its average of the late 1990s  A third  potential source of alternative interpretations might be the measures of inflation  compensation plotted in the bottom left panel  For some, the chart shows that  inflation compensation remains contained and has declined of late at shorter horizons   Others may find only cold comfort in this because inflation compensation  nevertheless remains above the range consistent with their price stability objective     The policy choice today depends on your assessments both of the economy in the   near term and of the appropriate path of inflation over a longer time frame—the  subject of exhibit 3, which repeats some material from the “Medium-Term Strategies”  section of the Bluebook  The solid line in the top left panel plots the setting of the  nominal funds rate that, in the FRB/US model, best achieves the objective of  minimizing deviations of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU and of core PCE  inflation from a goal of 1½ percent, while avoiding jarring adjustments in the nominal  funds rate  The forces shaping the outlook are the same as in the extended Greenbook  baseline, and investors are assumed to understand the entire path of policy—which  they deem credible when determining asset values  Wage and price setters, in  contrast, base their expectations on less information and alter their views on long-run  inflation only sluggishly in response to actual inflation  As is familiar from such  exercises in previous Bluebooks, it thus takes a long time to work down inflation  when the goal is below prevailing inflation expectations at the start of the simulation   With the Phillips curve as flat and inflation expectations as inertial as in the FRB/US  model and with equal weights placed on the objectives, policymakers find it optimal  to trade off a persistent miss of the inflation goal (the bottom left panel) for smaller  cumulative labor market slack (the middle left panel)  In this simulation, progress  may seem especially glacial because the steady dollar depreciation that is required to  rein in the deterioration of the current account generates persistent upward pressure  on domestic inflation  But even the modest progress that is made on inflation under  this scenario requires about ¾ percentage point of firming over the next year     We explored two modifications of the standard framework to help speed   disinflation  In the first, and as plotted as the dashed red lines on the left,  policymakers are assumed to put much more weight on the inflation goal relative to  maximum employment  Indeed, progress in reducing inflation is notable, but the  unemployment rate is also notably elevated  The simulation underlying the dotted   October 24-25, 2006 79 of 203    green lines maintains the assumption of equal weights in the objective function but  changes the assumption about the information that wage and price setters use so as to  create a more favorable inflation-unemployment rate tradeoff in the short run  This  variant assumes that the level of the nominal funds rate conveys a noisy signal to  wage and price setters about policymakers’ inflation goal  It is optimal, then, to  impose policy restraint early on so as to send inflation expectations down and  accomplish a quicker and less costly disinflation  The credibility you attach to such a  channel may play some role in your willingness to firm policy in the near term  But  you may not see any need to do so if you are drawn to the dashed blue lines in the  right-hand column of charts  Those lines summarize macroeconomic outcomes for  policymakers with an inflation goal of 2 percent  Because current inflation  expectations about comport with that goal, policymakers can keep the nominal funds  rate at 5¼ percent for some time and still observe declines in inflation given the other  forces of disinflation in the baseline     Exhibit 4 considers some aspects of the wording of your statement to be released   after this meeting, starting with the rationale portion in the boxes at the top  As noted  at the left, in drafting the Bluebook, we proposed including in row 2 of all the draft  statements that “economic growth appears to have slowed further in the third  quarter”  This wording seemed to have the advantage of acknowledging the  upcoming release of the initial third-quarter estimate of real GDP on Friday, which by  the staff’s reckoning is likely to be weak  Some of you may be concerned, however,  that this mention might heighten market scrutiny of that data point or potentially set  up the Committee for failure if the release proves surprisingly strong  As noted in the  top right box, we simplified the language about inflation pressures in row 3 of  alternative A, partly in response to earlier criticism that the Committee could be  interpreted as having slipped a derivative  The statement has been pointing to the  levels of the prices of energy and other commodities as having “the potential to  sustain inflation pressures”  Even if you are not drawn to the phrasing of the rest of  the alternative, you might see some merit in this simplification for row 3  Or you  might not, [laughter] given the focus in markets of changes in the wording of the  statement     The Bluebook effectively offered four alternatives this time, the three in the table   and a possible middle ground between B and C mentioned in the text  These are laid  out in the remainder of the exhibit  In recent statements, the risk assessment has  pointed to upside risks to inflation and the possible need to firm policy further    Market participants nevertheless appear to attach greater likelihood to policy easing  than tightening  To protest that view and to underscore its commitment to reduce  inflation, the Committee might choose to modify its words to note, as in alternative  B+, that “although the Committee both seeks and expects a gradual reduction in  inflation, it continues to view the risks to that outcome as remaining to the upside”   Some of you, however, may view this as change for the sake of change that  unnecessarily risks confusing market participants as to the Committee’s intent      October 24-25, 2006 80 of 203    For the sake of reference, the last exhibit repeats, with no change, table 1 from the  Bluebook  That concludes my prepared remarks         You’re exactly right, and that’s why we tried to put them closer   together in this Bluebook  [Laughter]     We’re making progress—incremental, as all progress at the Federal   Reserve is  [Laughter]  The notion of the equilibrium real rate is  if you held the real rate   constant for the next twelve quarters, the output gap would close at the end of that period  That   doesn’t, however, mean that you would like the inflation rate you get at the end, twelve quarters   from now  It’s not a policy rule  It’s just a way of summarizing the forces at work in the model    October 24-25, 2006 81 of 203    The optimum policy exercises explicitly take into account your preferences about inflation as   well; hence, you can get different results  In the future we do want to try talking more about the   equilibrium real interest rate in terms of the full model simulations rather than the reduction   presented in chart 5  Actually, my intention was to include a medium-term scenario in the   Bluebook four times a year  They don’t change all that much, and if your calendar is such that   you’re going to have four two-day meetings next year, it seemed appropriate to line those up     Let me make two points, Mr Vice Chairman  First, a good measure   of the compliment should be directed to Dave and his staff as well because these model   October 24-25, 2006 82 of 203    simulations really do take a lot of effort on the part of the folks in the MAQS Section in   Research and Statistics  Second, in the box in the Bluebook we tried to take our best guess of   that  Actually, President Lacker mentioned it  The basic problem is that those are measures of   inflation compensation, not inflation expectations  There are both an inflation risk premium and   a differential liquidity premium between nominal and indexed debt that pollute the measure of   inflation compensation  Not only could they change, which potentially changes the level relative   to inflation expectations, but also they could very well be time varying  We’ve seen big swings   in our estimated term premium in the nominal yield curve  We could just as well also be seeing   swings in the inflation risk premium  When we go to those factor models of the term structure   and try to back out those estimates of the inflation risk premium and also try to take account of   the adjustment between CPI and what most of you talked about in terms of core PCE inflation,   we see inflation expectations, at least coming from the Treasury market, in the neighborhood of   2 to 24 percent across the term structure  That’s a higher number than what many of you have   identified as your comfort zone, and it’s not inconsistent with what we see from survey measures   as well     I don’t know     It’s sustainable or solid  I really hate to have to say this  [Laughter]    We have been using “solid” as “at or above potential,” and it seems symmetrical to use   “moderate” as “at or below potential”     I think the issue is whether “going forward” means starting from the   quarter we’re currently in or whether it is a statement about 2007  The reason we drafted the   explicit reference to the third quarter is that we’re in the fourth quarter, and at least if you believe   the staff forecast, you think GDP growth has already bounced back from the third quarter     I would say, President Minehan, that the reference in the minutes of   the past two meetings to the staff’s marking down the rate of growth of potential has certainly   caught the attention of market participants     I think, actually, that the chart I had in my briefing that showed the   nine primary dealers’ forecast of real GDP tracking above the Greenbook forecast suggests that   they may have moved it down but they haven’t moved it down as much as the staff     Who says 18 people can’t draft a statement?  [Laughter]  I have some   late breaking news  If you go to the dictionary, the first meaning of “moderate” is “being within   reasonable limits,” which I believe is what Governor Kohn was referring to  But it also means “of   limited or average quality,” and in the federal statistics, there is a term of art, “moderate income,”   which refers to households supported by average or slightly below average income  [Laughter]     Since you’re not likely to be making any decisions, then there’s not   much to convey in the minutes other than that you had a full and frank exchange of views [laughter]   regarding your attitudes toward articulating a price objective      So it will not say “laughter” in the margins  [Laughter]      We reported in yesterday’s briefing that subprime borrowers   constituted only about 13 percent of all mortgages outstanding      The 05 percentage point increase in the Greenbook-consistent R* is   really due to a collection of factors  In the model, the estimated bond premiums come down a little,   and the equity premium came down over the intermeeting period  That just means you need a   higher real interest rate to get the same level of policy restraint  Also, they take the model and force   in the errors to get the Greenbook simulation  Effectively the model is less enthusiastic about the   economy than the Greenbook, and so the model errors tend to raise R*  As to why inflation is   coming down, we do have the lagged effects of the drop in energy prices, inflation expectations are   contained, and the output gap is closing   January 30-31, 2007 33 of 255      The intervals are, no doubt, wide  In the materials we sent to you in   October, when you were talking about your inflation goal, a staff memorandum looked at the gap   between the CPI and the PCE price index  From 1994 to 2004, the minimum is minus 02, and the   maximum is 12  They do move around  We found in the regressions that we reported in the   Bluebook box that they’re not very precise at all  The standard errors were quite large  So I think   the answer is that we don’t have a measure of inflation expectations that we could put much   confidence in   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout  “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  As noted in the top  left panel of your first exhibit, the path of policy expectations rotated up over the  intermeeting period, and investors now apparently anticipate the federal funds rate to  move down only about ½ percentage point over the next couple of years  As related  in the panel at the top right, primary dealers are unanimous in expecting no change in  the policy rate at this meeting  Indeed, nearly all the dealers believe that you will  hold the funds rate steady through the May meeting  As to the wording of the  statement, some dealers are calling for a more upbeat assessment of the economic  outlook, but almost all expect no change in the Committee’s assessment of risks  In  the Treasury market, as shown in the bottom left panel, this shift in policy  expectations was associated with a rise of about ⅜ percentage point in nominal  yields—the movement from the dotted to the solid black lines—and a smaller  increase in their real counterparts—the dotted to the solid red lines  Thus, inflation  compensation, the vertical difference between the lines, edged higher across  maturities  According to the Desk survey, as in the table at the bottom right, dealers  marked up their outlook for real GDP growth and lowered their assessment of  inflation for this year, although the changes were small  If you examine the high- frequency movements of the ten-year nominal yield, about 20 basis points of the                                                     3 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   January 30-31, 2007 94 of 255    increase was registered in windows around economic data releases—that’s the red bar  in the middle right panel—suggesting that the revisions to the growth outlook  apparently predominated in shaping investors’ thinking about your near-term  behavior  Federal Reserve communications—the statement, the minutes, and  speeches—had no net effect on yields  But as the gray bar shows, a sizable portion of  the rise in yields cannot be linked to data or other identifiable news releases  A  similar measure of our ignorance in explaining yields comes from the arbitrage-free  models of the term structure that we regularly follow  Those models (not shown)  suggest that about ¼ percentage point of the rise in the ten-year yield was due to an  increase in the term premium     The same combination of a modestly higher track for activity and a lower one for   inflation was a highlight of the simulations of the FRB/US model reported in the  Bluebook and repeated in exhibit 2  The trajectory of the nominal federal funds rate  that best achieves your aims—subject to the many assumptions necessary to make  this exercise work—has shifted up over much of the projection period, whether you  have an inflation goal of 1½ percent or 2 percent  One consideration for the policy  choice at this meeting is which charts in those two columns entice you  With a  2 percent inflation goal, you can keep the funds rate unchanged for some time  because you can very nearly declare victory at the prevailing level of inflation  In  contrast, to make progress toward a 1½ percent inflation goal, you’ve got a bit of  work to do, as the sluggishness of inflation expectations and the flatness of the  Phillips curve in the FRB/US model make it costly to disinflate  Indeed, this  simulation puts the nominal federal funds rate around 6 percent by year-end     This observation on the inflation goal is mapped into two monetary policy   alternatives at the top of exhibit 3  The quarter-point firming of alternative C would  be particularly attractive if, besides having an inflation goal below the prevailing rate  of inflation, you harbored significant concerns about the underlying strength of  aggregate demand and potential cost pressures  For instance, you might view the  recent string of favorable data on spending as suggesting upside prospects for  aggregate demand, perhaps along the lines of the “buoyant consumer spending”  alternative simulation shown in the Greenbook  The results of that exercise are  plotted as the green lines in the middle panels for the federal funds rate, the  unemployment rate, and core PCE inflation, respectively, along with the baseline  outcomes as black lines  With more pressure on resources and inflation running  higher, an estimated policy rule predicts a federal funds rate heading to 7 percent   Another source of concern may be inflation expectations  Inflation compensation  derived from the Treasury market, plotted as the solid line in the bottom left panel for  the next five years and the red line for the five-year, five-year-forward rate, moved in  a fairly wide range and rose a touch on net over the intermeeting period, perhaps  undercutting some of the claim that inflation expectations are well anchored       The case for holding the funds rate at 5¼ percent, as under alternative B, would   be strengthened if you have an inflation goal of 2 percent  In addition, the central  tendencies of your forecasts for the unemployment rate and core PCE inflation   January 30-31, 2007 95 of 255    reported in yesterday’s chart show suggest that some of you believe that there is a  more favorable tradeoff between the two than does the staff, perhaps along the lines  of the “lower NAIRU” alternative simulation in the Greenbook (the red lines in the  middle panels)  Even if you viewed inflation running at or above 2 percent as  uncomfortable, downside risks to employment and growth, especially given the  uncertainties surrounding the ongoing housing market correction and possible  spillovers to other components of spending, may tip the balance toward keeping the  funds rate unchanged for now  If those risks do not materialize, the same process in  financial markets that operated over the recent intermeeting period will likely operate  in the future, as President Poole and Chairman Bernanke noted yesterday  That is,  with market expectations of the funds rate still tilted down, as plotted by the dashed  line in the bottom right panel, yields will back up further as investors come to realize  that policy easing will not be forthcoming, adding to financial restraint  Also note  that market-based confidence bands surrounding investors’ expectations, derived  from interest-rate caps and shown by the blue fan chart, are narrow in the near term  but then widen markedly  Thus, market participants see ample scope for policy  action—in either direction—in coming quarters     The last exhibit gives the latest version of table 1, which circulated Monday  It   trims the wording of alternative B to be a little more upbeat about firmer economic  growth in section 2, which feels right this morning  I also hope that you might reflect  on the risk assessment offered in section 4 of alternative C  The language about  policy firming that you’ve repeated for the past few meetings seems a little stale and  potentially misleading if you are not confident that your next policy action will be to  tighten  Talking about the relative odds of action might be a more durable structure   But this might be a discussion for a later day out of concern about an inappropriate  reaction in financial markets today        You probably won’t have that trouble in public because among the   things that will be released is your central tendency forecast and it does have a steeper decline in   core PCE inflation than the staff’s forecast does  So keeping policy unchanged at this meeting   does not validate a 2 percent inflation goal; it just means you might have a different view      May I just make one observation, Mr Chairman?  When you move from   B(4) to C(4), you make another change as well  B(4) talks about inflation risks, whereas C(4) talks   about inflation  So you are changing  You’re actually indicating distaste for the current level of   January 30-31, 2007 113 of 255    inflation, whereas the previous one could be read as “oh, there could be outcomes that are on the   high side”     As we related in the Bluebook and as a number of you said, market   participants understand the risk assessment, and they don’t expect policy action or a change in the   risk assessment  So it’s hard to see that there would be any reaction at all  I wonder what our new   Account Manager would say as well   January 30-31, 2007 128 of 255      Exhibit 5 presents a decision tree outlining the possible paths   you might take in incorporating an economic forecast in the policymaking process  I  am including this schematic because, among other reasons, it is just what you would  expect from me  [Laughter]  Before we trace out some of those limbs, I want to  remind you why the economic forecast is on today’s agenda  Discussion of monetary  policy, both here and abroad, has increasingly focused on the forward-looking nature  of setting policy  For the Federal Reserve, the structure of the current process of  releasing an economic projection was set almost thirty years ago by improvisation in  response to congressional prodding  Is it possible that the Committee could arrive at  a more coherent way of producing and releasing a forecast that would enable  policymakers to describe better what they do?     The possibilities for producing and releasing a forecast are laid out at the top of   the exhibit  Note that a couple of the nodes correspond to questions from the  subcommittee to you in a memo I distributed on Friday  In particular, as flagged by  the “1” in the decision tree and repeated in the list below, “Does the Committee want  to produce a joint forecast or conduct a survey of individual forecasts?”  The answer  to this question is both hard—because it has considerable implications for your time  and resources in the System more generally—and easy to predict—at least based on  conversations I’ve had with many of you and your staff  To make it even easier to  answer, let me paraphrase those conversations “Do you want to change the basic  nature of the Committee process by adding multiple rounds of meetings so as to  enforce a more uniform view of the outlook than has ever existed before, or do you  want to modify the status quo?”  [Laughter]  If you prefer to continue the practice of  providing individual forecasts, you might want to reexamine the extent of  coordination in that process  That is item 2 at the top and bottom, “If the forecasts are  done individually, should they be based on common assumptions about some key  conditioning factors?”  Chief among those factors is the path of monetary policy  Do  you want to continue with each taking your own view of monetary policy, settle on  some joint assumption, or use market-based quotes?     The individual entries in a numerical forecast have only limited usefulness in   describing the economic outlook and the backdrop for setting policy  Rather, the  narrative thread explaining the forecast is the most useful because it allows the reader  to assess the credibility of the projection, to position his or her own view when there  is a difference of opinion, and to gauge potential risks to the outlook  As posed in  question 3, do you want to accompany a forecast with a minutes-style narrative  description?  As with the minutes—and noted in question 4—this document could be  circulated for comments from meeting participants and ultimately be approved by the  Committee through a notation vote  Such a procedure, however, will extend the  interval between the making of the forecast and its release, raising the number of  times that inconvenient data releases will render the projection moot  If you want a   January 30-31, 2007 138 of 255    more timely release, drafting and releasing such a minutes-style document could be  delegated to either the Chairman or the staff     The last four questions cover technical attributes of a forecast  In particular, as   noted in question 5, how frequently should forecasts be made?  The current  semiannual reporting cycle was set by the Congress, but it means that the published  forecasts become stale  Another inconvenience with the current setup is that an  annual forecast made in June incorporates an implicit forecast of the second half   Would you rather be explicit and forecast half years?  More generally, as in item 6,  how many years should the forecast cover?  Seventh, how many variables should be  forecast, and which should they be?  Nominal income, for example, remains on the  survey by historical accident—from the days when the velocity of money was thought  to be predictable and knowing your expectation about income growth would help in  setting a monetary range  Are there other variables that would be more helpful?   Finally, should there be some attempt to convey numerically the uncertainty  surrounding the forecasts?  Relaying such information would more accurately convey  the balancing of risks that is an integral part in your deliberations and would remind  your readers that it is a projection, not a promise     By now, we probably have your heads spinning with all the possible permutations   of the many decisions that could be made  With this many moving parts, the problem  is complicated  But not all the issues to be resolved are hard  First, you have the  force of precedent, which is a powerful attractor within the Federal Reserve System   That is why I wouldn’t worry for a minute about whether the forecast and its  description should reflect the views of the Committee or all meeting participants  The  precedents of the outlook portion of the minutes and the semiannual survey of  forecasts establish that any release should reflect everyone’s views  Second, for the  sake of consistency, some of the decisions about the format of the forecast will be  driven by other decisions you may make later  For instance, if in your deliberations  about quantifying the price objective in March you indicate a preference for  measuring inflation in terms of CPI or PCE, whether headline or core, the variable  sampled in your survey should be a good indicator of that goal     If you can answer the hard questions today—eight of which the subcommittee   sent to you—then it would be possible to frame out a rough structure of a specific  proposal  Detail could be filled in by surveying you later on technical matters, and  sometime thereafter you could get a formal proposal for consideration as part of the  general package of work on communication  That concludes our prepared remarks       It’s the Board’s       No  Ultimately, the Board discusses it in a meeting, and it’s transmitted   on behalf of the Board of Governors to the Congress to fulfill its legislative requirement  So the   Board is directed in the law to provide it     No  The Board is explaining Committee policymaking, but it’s the   Board’s responsibility   January 30-31, 2007 152 of 255      No  The Chairman may choose to talk about the forecast in his   testimony  So in some sense you really have two opportunities to talk about the Committee’s   forecast      I think it’s the other point, President Lacker, about how much   confidence you put in the green dots, which are the survey of, to use the Vice Chairman’s words,   that strange group that the New York Fed contacts     No, no, no  Because primary dealers’ economists, quite often, probably   are reporting their modal forecast because they’re telling a story about where the Committee was   going forward and painting an overall picture of the economy, whereas the Eurodollar contracts   reflect averaging across all the states of nature  What we see when we look at options is a growing   downside tail  So it could be the emergence of that significant downside tail, which economists will   talk about as a risk to their outlook but traders actually have to price, as another reason that those   two things are diverging   2  I have the unenviable position of being the last speed bump between   you and the open bar across the street  [Laughter]  In the interest of time, I’d like to draw your   attention to the latest version of table 1 and then deliver the rest of my remarks tomorrow  That way   you’ll get a chance to cogitate over the changes to the table overnight, and I will get to showcase an   outfit that I anticipate will be just as fetching as this one tomorrow  [Laughter]  The latest version of   table 1, which was just distributed, introduces modified wording in the rationale portion of   alternative B  In section 2, the factors supporting growth are made a little more explicit, including   some of the things that you’ve spoken about today—favorable financial conditions and the recent   mixed indicators  As for section 3, the CPI release was a touch to the high side of expectations, and   the medical services component of the PPI even more so  This situation makes it likely that the core   PCE price index will be disappointing and argues for substituting material similar to the bracketed   material in the Bluebook  As for the risk assessment, this draft continues to characterize inflation as   the Committee’s “principal” concern, although some of you would prefer to identify it as your   “predominant” concern, partly because of the precedential use of that word in the Chairman’s   monetary policy testimony  I hope for your sake that your hotel rooms have both a Gideons Bible   and an unabridged dictionary  [Laughter]  That concludes my prepared remarks     Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you  That will be noted in the transcript  [Laughter]    3  That won’t be noted in the transcript  [Laughter]  I’ll be  referring to the materials right in front of you  Financial markets were volatile over  the intermeeting period amid a repricing of risky assets  As can be seen in the top left  panel of your first exhibit, monetary policy expectations shifted down almost ½  percentage point, on net, at longer horizons, and uncertainty about that path, the top  middle panel, spiked higher  Investors now admit the possibility of much lower  policy rates just six months from now—the red bars in the top right panel—compared  with the hollow dashed bars witnessed at the time of the January meeting  A part of  this downward revision was due to concerns that strains in the subprime mortgage  market would leave a more significant mark on spending than previously suspected   As shown by the blue line in the middle left panel, the spread on the BBB-minus- rated tranche of a CDS index covering subprime mortgages that were originated in  the first half of last year ballooned in response to remarkably poor payment  performance  About the same time that investors rethought the prospects for the  mortgage market, they marked down the prices of equities considerably, the bottom  left panel  The combination of lower equity prices and an expectation of markedly  easier future monetary policy presumably signals that markets think the prospects for  economic growth are now less bright       Against this backdrop, nominal ten-year Treasury yields fell about 40 basis   points, as shown by the dotted blue line in the right panel  Longer-term TIPS yields,  the red dashed line, fell as much as their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation  compensation little changed  The ten-year BBB corporate yield, the solid black line,  followed the downward track of comparable Treasury yields until February 27,  keeping the corresponding spread little changed  Since February 27, this risk spread,  like others, has widened modestly  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 2, the yield  on the two-year Treasury note remains well below the intended federal funds rate   The last time this spread was so decidedly negative was in 2000, the shaded area, late  in the previous economic expansion  As shown in the middle left panel, the  Committee began 2000 with three successive policy tightenings, which brought the  federal funds rate to 6½ percent  At those meetings, market participants had expected  some firming—that is shown by the dotted lines plotting the path of the expected  federal funds rate for each meeting  By summer, however, investors had taken out                                                     3 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   March 20-21, 2007 77 of 196    the anticipation of firming; subsequently, they priced in policy ease  This occurred as  forecasts for real activity softened, as shown at the middle right by the Blue Chip  Consensus forecasts for real GDP growth over 2001, the solid line, and for the annual  average 2001 unemployment rate, the dotted line  As noted in the bottom left panel,  in the first seven meetings of the year, the Committee held that the balance of risks  was tilted toward heightened inflation pressures—in part, it seems from rereading the  transcripts, because no one wanted to be seen as lacking vigilance against inflation   Three lessons from this experience are noted at the bottom right  First, statement  language can hamper your flexibility  Second, downward moves in financial market  yields can be informative  Third, those forward-looking adjustments in financial  markets can help to offset the effects of gradualism in policymaking     In writing the Bluebook, we tried to offer a greater measure of flexibility for   policy going forward in alternatives A and B  You might want that flexibility if you  harbor serious concerns about the housing market, the subject of the top panels of  exhibit 3  In particular, some members might be of the view that the turmoil in the  subprime market may prompt a significant pullback in funding for housing,  steepening the slide in home sales, the left panel At the same time, homebuying  attitudes (the middle panel) have improved, no doubt in part because the drop in  market yields has pulled down mortgage rates for prime borrowers (the right panel)   Given these cross-currents, you might be inclined to await more information and be  prepared to move in either direction when the time comes  Waiting a bit might not  seem so costly, in that the real federal funds rate, the solid line in the middle panel, is  right on top of the equilibrium real federal funds rate consistent with the Greenbook  forecast  By that measure, at least, maintaining the current real federal funds rate at  3 percent would imply closing the output gap in the next couple of years  Keeping  the fed funds rate steady for a time is the prescription from the standard optimal  control exercise with the FRB/US model with a 2 percent inflation goal (the solid  lines in the bottom panels)  As explained in a recent memo and a Bluebook box, the  inertia of inflation in the FRB/US model is due importantly to the sluggishness of  inflation expectations  If you believe that the public could be made to understand an  inflation goal of 1½ percent relatively quickly and costlessly, perhaps as in the  “immediate recognition” scenario plotted as the dashed lines, you might not feel the  need to hurry to move the fed funds rate even if your inflation target was 1½ percent     This was the first Bluebook in some time that fully lived up to its official title,   “Monetary Policy Alternatives”  That is, we provided three alternatives for the level  of the intended federal funds rate  The policy easing of alternative A and the firming  of alternative C, however, may have an air of unreality to them because market  participants seem so firmly convinced that you will stand pat today, and I will expand  on that issue with the aid of exhibit 4  The top panel plots the estimated effects of  FOMC policy announcements on near-term policy expectations over the past six  years  To be sure, a 25 basis point cut or hike would translate into a 25 basis point  surprise, something that has not been seen since 2001  By the way, the coloring of  the bars exposes regularity in your behavior  Policy easings, the red bars, tend to be  surprises, whereas firmings, the blue ones, tend to be more predictable  That is,   March 20-21, 2007 78 of 196    you’ve shown a revealed preference to be more willing to surprise markets on the  downside than on the upside  But before you obsess too much on the perils of  surprising markets in general, I would note that when the Bank of England tightened  25 basis points on January 11, fifty-one out of the fifty-one economists surveyed by  Bloomberg just before the meeting had expected no change  As shown in the middle  left panel, rates did rise that day but by a muted amount at longer maturities  As  shown at the middle right, the imprint on ten-year gilt yields was not long lasting, nor  was implied volatility deflected from its downward track  As to the direction of the  potential policy surprise, the case for alternative A, as laid out in the bottom panels,  probably rests on the belief that the ongoing weakness in the housing sector will  intensify and be joined by softness in some other sector  One candidate is business  spending given that, as at the left, purchasing managers see business conditions as  treading water and, as at the right, view their customers’ inventories as too high      The policy ease in alternative A, and perhaps even the holding pattern of   alternative B, might come at the cost of an increase in expected inflation, a concern  that would be at the forefront for anyone inclined to the 25 basis point firming of  alternative C, the subject of exhibit 5  As shown in the top panel, inflation  expectations as surveyed from households (the solid line) or professional forecasters  (the dotted line) remain above what many of you have identified as your comfort zone  for inflation  The apparent poor alignment of these expectations with some of your  statements may incline you to a “demonstration effect” of your resolve  You may  view this as necessary merely to hold the line on inflation  The unemployment rate,  plotted in the middle left panel, remains 4½ percent, consistent with a traditional view  of pressures on resources  You might also be taking a cue from our trading partners   Last quarter, the arithmetic contribution of the improvement in real net exports to  GDP growth was 1½ percentage points, and as shown in the table at the middle right,  the staff forecasts foreign economic growth to continue to expand robustly  The fact  that the recent angst about the US expansion is not widely shared internationally  may lend some comfort that economic growth at home still has a firm footing  You  might also view this meeting as an opportunity to set market participants straight  about your priorities  Policy firming would disabuse people of the notion that the  FOMC responds mechanically to a decline in stock prices  Indeed, the still-low level  of implied volatilities, as in the bottom left panel, may suggest that investors maintain  the faith that monetary policy will smooth every road  The bottom right panel plots  five-minute changes in the S&P 500 (along the horizontal axis) against five-minute  changes in the one-year-ahead Eurodollar futures rate (along the vertical axis) since  February 27  In the past few weeks, interest rate expectations have been very  responsive to equity prices—possibly suggesting a widespread belief that the FOMC  supports equity prices        To start where we are now, to get to about 25 basis points or zero at   the ten-year mark, you probably should smooth across the maturity structure  Yes, indeed, the   two-year term premiums are lower, so some of the low level of the spread does reflect less   compensation for risk  At the same time, we haven’t done much to change our estimates of term   premiums at very short maturities, and the implied sets of futures rates do point downward and   give you 75 basis points of easing in the next year     You have to go back about two years  The term premium started   declining about two years ago     Quantitatively, a good portion is due to lower term premiums     Well, you’d assume that there are arbitrage opportunities across the   collection of fixed-income securities, and lower term premiums in the Treasury market are not a   peculiar attribute just for the Treasury market  They say something about investors’ attitudes   March 20-21, 2007 80 of 196    toward risk and perception of risk, and that should be reflected in all fixed-income securities  So   yes, we think those term premiums are lower everywhere     I think your instinct would be guided by the top middle panel, which   shows that implied volatility went up, which would not be consistent with term premiums going   down  We would first see, at the very short end, that the sensitivity of the term premiums to   volatilities is lower than it is with longer capital instruments and then would interpret the shift in   the upper left panel as reflecting expectations about policy     I was going to say that mostly the references would be to the stance of   policy, as opposed to financial conditions     First, I’d like to thank everyone for validating my own career decision    [Laughter]  Second, in your description you use the word “fundamentals,” which might be a   substitute for “financial conditions”  You could say “supported by still-favorable fundamentals,   including gains in income and the waning of the correction in the housing market”    2  Yesterday afternoon, we posted to the secure document server  a summary of the economic projections that you submitted  The material should be in  front of you with a cover memo from Debbie Danker  I will use the table directly  behind that cover to review briefly the key features of those projections, and then I  will outline the schedule for the trial run going forward     As shown in table 1, the central tendency of the projections suggests that most of   you anticipate that GDP growth will be somewhat soft this year but will pick up a bit  over 2008 and 2009  Participants generally anticipate that core PCE inflation will  edge a little lower over the forecast period and that the unemployment rate will inch  up to the vicinity of 4¾ percent  The federal funds rate path associated with this  projection for the economy (not shown) is fairly flat over this year and next and  moves slightly lower in 2009       The width of the 70 percent confidence bands for economic variables suggests a   wide range of outcomes for growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate over the  forecast period  As noted by the memo lines, the central tendency forecasts prepared  for the May meeting, relative to the forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting,  indicate a somewhat weaker path for economic growth in the near term and a  somewhat higher trajectory for the unemployment rate  The central tendency for core  PCE inflation has changed little     In your accompanying description of the key forces shaping the economic   outlook, most of you cited continued weakness in the housing sector—with  residential construction viewed as likely to remain a drag on growth for some time  and the softness in home prices noted as a factor damping the rise in wealth and  consumer spending  Against this backdrop, GDP growth was expected to remain  somewhat below trend for a while, resulting in a small rise in the unemployment rate   It was also noted that labor hoarding in some industries over recent months had likely                                                     2 Material used here by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   May 9, 2007 21 of 130    masked an underlying easing in labor market conditions that would become more  apparent over the remainder of this year  Generally accommodative financial  conditions and solid growth abroad were seen as supporting GDP growth  While  most participants looked for core PCE inflation to edge lower, some related that the  rise in energy prices and import prices, coupled with recent sluggish productivity  readings, would put upward pressure on prices over the near term       As a group, you tended to be a bit more optimistic about the prospects for   aggregate supply than the staff  Several participants noted that their forecasts were  premised on a higher rate of potential output growth than projected in the Greenbook,  owing in part to assessments (relative to the staff outlook) that labor force  participation rates would not decline as much or that structural productivity growth  would be stronger  Some participants also pointed out that their forecasts  incorporated a lower NAIRU than did the staff outlook      As for the process from here on, if you would like to change your forecast in light   of the discussion at this meeting or data received since you prepared your projection,  we ask that you submit your revision to the Secretariat by the opening of business  tomorrow  The staff will draft a minutes-style narrative description of the economic  projections  This will be a standalone document that will circulate with the draft  minutes on the regular schedule  That means you will see a first draft on May 17, a  second one on May 22, and a final version on May 24  We ask that you comment on  these drafts as if the final version were to be published—but it won’t be, nor will you  be asked to vote on the document     3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials that  were passed around during the coffee break  For the past few years, the Committee has  taken a “belt and suspenders” approach to providing guidance to financial markets by  characterizing both the likely direction of interest rates and the risks to its dual  objectives  In March, you loosened the belt a few notches by replacing the reference  to “additional firming” with more-balanced language but retained the macroeconomic  assessment that inflation risks were the more serious concern  The top left panel of  your first exhibit provides one way to score the immediate market consequences of  that change  The black and red bars, respectively, plot the changes in two- and ten- year Treasury yields in the one-and-a-quarter-hour window bracketing the 215 pm  release of statements for the past two years  As some of you predicted, market  participants saw particular significance in the March announcement that the  Committee was apparently no longer presuming that its next action would be a  firming, and two- and ten-year yields fell 10 and 5 basis points, respectively, the  biggest moves in the sample shown       After a bit of confusion about what the statement really meant, markets ultimately   got the message, aided in part by Chairman Bernanke’s testimony, your speeches, and  the minutes  I take from this the sense that the wording of the statement is important  [laughter], but that there are also other opportunities to provide a more-nuanced  policy message  The message that market participants got both from you and from  the incoming data, on net over the intermeeting period, is seen in the top right panel  by the shift from the dotted red to the solid black line depicting the path of the                                                     3 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 3)    May 9, 2007 75 of 130    expected federal funds rate  Futures quotes now imply a consensus that policy will be  kept on hold today and at the June meeting but then will be eased ¾ percentage point  by the end of next year  This modest upward repricing of money market futures  yields accompanied a reemergence of remarkably benign financial conditions, the  subject of the three middle panels  Corporate bond spreads (at the left) and implied  volatilities on equities and money market futures (in the middle) retraced much of the  run-up of late February to end the period at relatively low levels by historical  standards  Equity prices, at the right, gained 7 percent to reach new highs  As you’ll  see a little later, this addition to household wealth pushed up estimates of the  equilibrium real federal funds rate and may importantly influence your thinking about  near-term economic prospects      In the bottom left panel, I trot out the usual suspects for why stock prices rose    First-quarter earnings reports were solid, so higher share value may just be a bet on  rising domestic and foreign profits—the latter seeming especially more secure in light  of the apparent vigor of the global economy  Our estimates of the equity premium— one of which is shown at the bottom right as the spread between the forward  earnings-price ratio and the long-term real interest rate—narrowed a bit, suggesting  that investors were more accepting of risk  Also, investors may see less risk, as in  answer C  Potentially bad things that seemed palpable as the subprime market melted  down did not go bump in the night—that is, downside risks to the outlook appeared to  ease  What is the right answer to this multiple choice test?  I think (D), all of the  above, in that the world’s growth prospects seem a little more assured and, as a result,  investors see fewer risks and are more willing to take them on      That backdrop leads naturally to a discussion of policy choices, which begins by   examining the case for alternative B, which is in your next exhibit  The last time that  you sat at this table to consider the setting of policy, you chose to keep the federal  funds rate at 5¼ percent  The way the staff has filtered the flow of information since  March has produced only minor changes to their outlook for real GDP growth, the top  left panel, and core PCE inflation, the top right panel  So, if you were content in  March, would you not be so in May?  Keeping the nominal funds rate at 5¼ percent is  consistent, as plotted in the middle panel, with the real federal funds rate, the solid  black line, rising to continue to match the Greenbook-consistent measure of its  equilibrium value, the dotted green line  If you believe that framework, this stance of  policy should return the level of output to its potential within three years  Some of  you might argue that such an outcome is not good enough  With core PCE inflation  lingering above 2 percent, a more forceful working down of inflation—perhaps even  at the cost of creating some slack—may be required for acceptable economic  performance  While that may be a relevant consideration, risk-management issues  may tug in the opposite direction  In particular, and as shown by the solid line in the  bottom panel, the staff forecast puts real GDP growth in the neighborhood of 2  percent for the next six quarters  Times in which economic growth has been at or has  dipped below 2 percent—the dashed horizontal line—have often been followed by  recession—the shaded regions  Concern that the economy would be flying close to  stall speed may stay your hand from dealing more aggressively with inflation   May 9, 2007 76 of 130       Indeed, concerns about growth may incline you to believe that your next policy   action will be an easing—the subject of the left column of charts in exhibit 3  As has  been true for some time, the case for alternative A rests importantly on your  assessment of the housing market  New-home sales, the solid black line in the middle  panel, have taken another step down, further elevating the months’ supply of unsold  new homes, the dotted red line  This inventory correction will impose a drag on  residential investment for some time—and could get worse if the availability of funds  tightens some more in light of the woes in the subprime mortgage market  You also  might now harbor doubts that businesses will step up their spending, which would  otherwise have cushioned any slowing in the growth of aggregate demand  While the  latest readings on orders and on shipments of capital goods, plotted as the solid black  and dotted red lines, respectively, in the bottom left panel, were encouraging, you  might dismiss those as one month’s noisy signal around a downward-pointing trend   In addition, you might see financial markets as ripe to correct, once investors come to  appreciate that earnings prospects are as tepid as in the Greenbook forecast       But risks to economic growth are not the Committee’s sole concerns  In March   you identified the failure of inflation to moderate from its current elevated level to be  the predominant concern  The case for alternative C, presented in the right panels,  probably hinges on the view that inflation is not clearly on a downward trend, seen in  the middle panel by inflation as measured by the core PCE price index (the solid  black line) and the market-based core PCE index (the dotted red line)  In addition,  the outlook for inflation may now be seen as less favorable than in March, given the  run-up in the prices of oil and other commodities  As shown in the bottom right  panel, futures-market participants have revised up their forecasts for the prices of  these items well into the future  If the pace of moderation of core inflation turns out  to be even slower than previously anticipated, you might be concerned that long-run  inflation expectations will drift up, making for difficult policy choices going forward   The prevailing expectations of inaction, shaped in part by official comments, may  take alternatives A and C off the table for today  But any inclination to favor the  arguments in either the right or the left columns should influence your choice of  language in the statement, the subject of your last exhibit  This exhibit is just table 1  repeated from the Bluebook with no emendation        I note that, in the discussion of communications, the Committee thus far has been   reluctant to specify an inflation goal consistent with its dual mandate  However, by  describing current inflation as “somewhat elevated,” as was the case in March, you  are implicitly characterizing the upper limit of your tolerance for inflation, just as you  delimited its lower bound in the summer of 2003 with talk of “unwelcome  disinflation”  Market participants will read much into your choice of words when the  time comes to change that characterization  So, at some point, you will have to come  to terms with your preferred specification of your inflation goal, either directly  through deliberations on communication policy or indirectly through the wording of  the statement  That concludes my prepared remarks      May 9, 2007 77 of 130      We added the term “on balance” in drafting the Bluebook for both the   time-series and the cross-sectional perspectives  That is, first, from the time-series perspective you   are not looking at just one monthly number  You may be doing as complicated an analysis as   President Stern in looking at three-, six-, and twelve-month changes  Second, it has a cross-  sectional aspect to it  You are not just focused on the one number of core PCE, but you’re taking in   the whole suite of price indexes     Yes, but you are not hanging your hat necessarily on the PCE versus the   CPI  The thought is that the insertion of that language means that you’re tending to smooth through   recent observations, and we took it as something that would be on balance—[laughter] that phrase   comes very natural to us, too—a little more hawkish      To take it out would be a little more hawkish     That it was a recognition of the incoming information  I think an   important change is also to take out the “to continue to expand” and leave it as just “to expand”   because the first quarter did not have moderate economic growth  So that part says that you are   acknowledging the most recent numbers  Again, the first clause is basically acknowledging that the   first part of the year, not just the first quarter, will potentially be kind of slow  So more than   May 9, 2007 80 of 130    anything it says that the Committee is looking through this soft patch, without using the phrase “soft   patch”     The wording of section 4 would be unchanged, yes     Yes     The theory was that you were smoothing through recent data so that, if   you got another good reading on core inflation, as you did last month, you wouldn’t necessarily   weight it as much     May I also just ask a question?  In President Stern’s formulation, you   would take the second sentence from alternative C and not make any reference to resource slack?    So I would actually take that as markets reading that you have decided to totally discount the current   pressures on employment rather than increasing your weight on inflation uncertainty  I took this as   an invitation to say disregard employment—you are not worried about slack as much, and you are   just asserting that inflation moderates     I would view that as quite a dovish statement   May 9, 2007 89 of 130      I would note that Bloomberg today had a linguist evaluate previous   statements, and he basically concluded that the language was pretty hopeless  [Laughter]   SPEAKER[?]  Who was this linguist?     In fact, it was the chief editor of the American Heritage Dictionary     Through opening of business tomorrow      Well, Bill and I can get together     I think the thing to note, President Lacker, is that, if you look   at the term structure of TIPS compensation, the five-year, five-year-forward in that has   been a whole lot more stable  The quotes you are looking at are very much influenced by   the first five years  In fact, at the end of 2001, again in 2002, and in the middle of 2003,   the first five years’ inflation compensation fell below 1½ percent      Yes, the TIPS inflation-compensation measure  During the   same period, however, the five-year, five-year-forward basically bounced up and down   around 2½ percent   3  Sure  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As was evident in the  survey responses summarized in the memo of June 15 on your attitudes toward the  economic projections, there seems to be broad agreement among you on the key  features of the process  Where there was not, including about sharing forecasts, the  specification of the monetary policy assumption, and the characterization of  uncertainty, the Subcommittee on Communications tried to find common ground   The result was reflected in the survey on the economic outlook for this meeting,  which I will discuss with the aid of the material distributed with the cover “Economic  Projections of FOMC Participants”     As can be seen by comparing the bolded with the italicized numbers in the first   exhibit, there were only minor changes in your projections of real GDP growth, the  unemployment rate, and core PCE inflation over the next two and one-half years from  those you submitted in May  Given the favorable data over the intermeeting period,  you raised your real growth forecasts a notch and lowered the core PCE inflation  forecasts for 2007  Still, as plotted in the top panel of exhibit 2, the red bars showing  the central tendency of your forecasts indicate that most of you anticipate that GDP  growth will be somewhat soft this year but will pick up a bit over 2008 and 2009   Although the submissions were not specific about potential output growth—and not  all of you would agree that it is even a useful concept—this expansion of real output  would seem initially to be slower than that of capacity in that the central tendency for  the unemployment rate (the second panel) edges higher  With resource markets less  taut and perhaps some transitory factors ebbing, core PCE inflation (the third panel)  drifts down  In this experiment, you were asked for inflation readings coming from  two measurement systems  The historical wedge between inflation measured by the  core PCE price index and the total consumer price index is about ½ percentage point   The central tendency projections for those two series in 2008 and 2009 are about that  far apart, leading to the inference that you are not forecasting significant changes to  the relative prices of energy and food  The subcommittee suggested forecasting these  two inflation series in the spirit of experimentation  Sometime in the next two days,  you might want to express how useful you found that part of the experiment     Another notable feature of your projections is that the differences among them   widen, rather than narrow, the further into the future you forecast  This suggests a  diversity of views as to key attributes of the economy as well as where you believe  inflation should be headed in the long run  As for the assumption about monetary  policy underlying these outcomes, about two-thirds of you indicated general  agreement with the path laid out in the Greenbook  As for the others, there were  explanations advanced for being on either side of the staff assumption                                                     3 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   June 27-28, 2007 33 of 261      You were also asked to provide a qualitative characterization of your uncertainty   about your outlook  The results for real GDP growth are given in the top panel of  exhibit 3  Somewhat surprisingly, there was no Lake Wobegon effect, and the  preponderance of responses viewed the real GDP growth outlook as just about as  uncertain as has been the case on average over the past twenty years  As shown in the  bottom panel, a majority of the submissions indicated that the risks around the  projections for GDP growth are judged to be broadly balanced  This contrasts with  the indication in the May minutes that, although the risks to economic activity had  “diminished slightly,” they were still “weighted to the downside”  For some, the  incoming news may have led to a reassessment of the risks to economic growth  For  others, it may reflect a view that the main downside risks to activity are concentrated  in the near term and those risks further ahead are broadly symmetric  To shed light  on this issue, participants might want to address the main risks to economic growth  and whether they are still judged to be weighted to the downside as had been the case  in your May discussion     Some more detail about your forecasts of the unemployment rate is provided in   exhibit 4  A majority of the projections embody a more muted rise in the  unemployment rate than in the Greenbook forecast, the dashed vertical lines This  smaller expected increase may partly reflect the stronger outlook for GDP growth  suggested by many of your projections  But then again, it may not  [laughter] From  the comments in the narratives about the likely strength of trend growth, it is not clear  that the projected growth in output relative to trend is expected to be materially more  robust than that suggested by the staff’s forecast  Does the more modest projected  rise in unemployment reflect a difference in views from the staff’s about the rate of  growth of potential output, the unemployment rate associated with no change in the  inflation rate, cyclical movements in productivity, or other factors?     Exhibit 5 provides a tally of the year-by-year inflation outlook  A majority of the   projections have a more benign medium-term outlook for core inflation than that  suggested by the staff’s forecast  But the responses to the question about the  appropriate path of interest rates indicate that for a majority of projections this does  not stem from a significantly tighter stance of monetary policy than assumed by the  staff  Likewise, the projections for GDP growth and unemployment do not appear to  imply greater economic slack than expected by the staff  For some, this more marked  moderation in inflation may reflect a judgment that more of the rise in core inflation  reflects the effect of temporary influences, such as the rise in energy prices and  owners’ equivalent rent, that are likely to abate over the forecast period  For others, it  may reflect an assessment that the NAIRU is lower than that assumed by the staff or  that inflation expectations may edge lower over the forecast period, perhaps pulled  down by Federal Reserve communications  You might wish to exchange views about  the main factors contributing to the expected moderation in inflation in your  forecasts      June 27-28, 2007 34 of 261    As to where inflation is headed in the longer run, many of you indicated that the  third-year projections (the bottom panel) reflect to a considerable degree your policy  goal rather than initial conditions  If that is the case, the central tendency reveals that  most of you individually define the inflation rate that best fosters the dual mandate to  be 1½ to 2 percent when measured by the core PCE inflation rate  Given your  apparent beliefs about future movements in the relative prices of food and energy,  discussed earlier, you would also seem to think that total PCE inflation should place  within a range of 1½ to 2 percent      As for the process from here on, if you would like to change your forecast in light   of the discussion at this meeting or data received since you prepared your projection,  we ask that you submit your revision to the Secretariat by close of business Friday   Unless we are instructed differently as a result of the discussion tomorrow, the staff  will draft a minutes-style narrative description of the economic projections  This will  be a standalone document that will circulate with the draft minutes on the regular  schedule as was the case in May     One last point  Your final exhibit gives the traditional presentation of your   economic projections that will be made public in the Monetary Policy Report and  included in the published minutes  If you want to change your submission, please let  us know by Friday  How you judge the usefulness of this exhibit compared with the  forecasts compiled for the experiment presumably will be one topic for discussion  tomorrow  That concludes my prepared remarks     4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Two personal notes to start  First, I  am the last person between you and British food, which means that I’m not sure whether  it is in your interest for me to speak quickly or slowly [Laughter]  Second, this week  marks the first anniversary of the Committee’s last policy action—the quarter-point  firming that brought the federal funds rate to 5¼ percent  Paper is the traditional                                                     4 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   June 27-28, 2007 94 of 261    present, and my gift to you is the material labeled “FOMC Briefing on Monetary  Policy Alternatives”      The intermeeting period saw considerable upward revision to investors’   expectations for the setting of monetary policy  As the shift from the dotted to the  solid line shows in the top left panel of the first exhibit, the path of the expected  federal funds rate rotated up, posting increases of 15 basis points at the end of this  year and about 50 basis points by the end of next year  The starting point for both the  May 8 and the June 26 lines, though, is the same  Market participants continue to  believe that you will keep the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent at this meeting   Judging by the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, you are also expected to keep the  wording of the statement mostly intact      Not much of this rise in market yields occurred in narrow windows surrounding   the release of economic data and speeches by monetary policy makers  Rather, the  economic data, which ran somewhat stronger than anticipated, and Federal Reserve  communications, with the steady repetition of the assessment that upside risks to  inflation remained, seemed to induce a rethinking of the economy’s prospects and the  attendant need for monetary policy support  This rethinking is most evident in the  middle left panel, which shows that the latest primary dealer forecasts of the federal  funds rate at year-end (the blue bars) have shifted notably compared with the survey  forecasts just before the May meeting (the dashed line)        The revision to investors’ views was associated with the increase of 20 to 50   basis points in the nominal Treasury yields plotted in the right panel (and seen as the  shift from the top dotted black line to the solid black line)  The pricing-out of near- term policy ease probably explains the now-shallow portion at the front part of the  yield curve  The rise in nominal yields can mostly be attributed to an increase in real  yields of 30 to 50 basis points, shown in the lower portion of the same panel  Our  term-structure models suggest that virtually all the rise in real yields is due to fatter  compensation for bearing risk  Because the shifts in the two sets of yield curves did  not match, the spread between the nominal and the indexed yields, which measures  inflation compensation, widened somewhat at longer maturities  Here, too, the  models suggest that some of that larger gap reflects a higher risk premium—this time  for bearing inflation risk—leaving their estimates of inflation expectations only  modestly higher      In recent days, concern about risk-taking, brought into the spotlight by the   problems of two hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns, reversed some of the upward  tug of yields imparted by the revision to the outlook for the economy and policy  As  can be seen in the bottom left panel, the cost of credit protection for subprime  mortgage pools packaged over the past 1½ years has risen over the past few weeks as  the fear of a fire sale of the collateral seized by lenders to the Bear Stearns funds  depressed prices and raised concerns about a more general spillover to other entities  and markets  These fears also seem to have set off flight-to-safety flows that pulled  Treasury yields lower in recent days  As noted in the table at the bottom right, the   June 27-28, 2007 95 of 261    ten-year Treasury yield had risen about 50 basis points from the May meeting to  when we put the Bluebook to bed (the first column)  The outbreak of skittishness in  recent days trimmed several basis points off that run-up (the second column) and put  equity prices into the red  I wonder if the recentness of these events, which unfolded  after much of the staff briefing work was wrapped up and your own interventions  were mostly written, means that they have not been completely incorporated into your  outlook  If so, this nervousness in financial markets probably adds to the list of  reasons for keeping a low profile in your policy action at this meeting by ratifying  prevailing expectations—that is, to choose the unchanged policy stance of alternative  B in the Bluebook     Some of the other reasons are the subject of exhibit 2  In the staff forecast,   summarized in the top left panel, output growth runs a bit below that of its potential  in the near term, and inflation settles in at 2 percent  If you find that both a plausible  and an acceptable outcome, you might also align yourself with the policy assumption  of an unchanged federal funds rate upon which that forecast is based  Moreover, you  were satisfied with keeping the funds rate at 5¼ percent at your May meeting  If you  have filtered the incoming economic information in a manner similar to the staff— seen in the Greenbook as a slight upward revision to the growth of real GDP and a  slight downward revision to core PCE inflation—you probably also believe that  circumstances have not changed enough to warrant a recalibration of policy  It is true  that financial market restraint has ratcheted up somewhat as investors’ forecast of the  federal funds rate path has risen—proxied in the top right panel by the year-end  expected federal funds rate in futures markets—but the staff expected this to happen  over the next year or so, which has been a sentiment shared by some of you at the  past few meetings  The adjustment in financial markets over the intermeeting period  now brings market pricing into better alignment with the Greenbook assumption— shown by the black dots—and that this adjustment took place on a more compressed  schedule than expected should probably not make for a material change to the  outlook  As seen in the middle panel, the current real federal funds rate, at  3¼ percent, matches the Greenbook-consistent estimate of its equilibrium level  That  is, if maintained, the current real rate would be consistent with the output gap closing  within three years, at least in the Greenbook outlook  An unchanged nominal funds  rate at this meeting is also consistent with many policy rules, including an estimated  one that captures your practice over the past twenty years and that is plotted as the  solid line in the bottom left panel  Of course, if you take into account forecast  uncertainty, as is done by the light and dark green regions, you can pitch a pretty  large tent with such policy rules  There is less doubt about the course of monetary  policy in financial markets  As shown by the red bars at the bottom right, options on  Eurodollar futures imply a distribution for the federal funds rate six months from now  that is tightly clustered around the current setting  Here might be another reason for  keeping the fed funds rate unchanged today  For all this year you have been hinting  that prevailing market expectations for the fed funds rate were too low  Now that  market participants have adjusted in your desired direction, you might not want to  surprise them      June 27-28, 2007 96 of 261     Many of you noted that problem with the version of table 1 that circulated in the  Bluebook, a subject discussed in exhibit 3  In the May statement, inflation was  characterized as “somewhat elevated,” as in row 3 of the left column  But favorable  data since then have put the twelve-month change in core PCE inflation at 2 percent,  a level that some of you might find tolerable  As yet the Committee has not spoken  with one voice on the subject  We dropped that contentious phrase in the Bluebook  and softened the balance-of-risks language as well  As a result, the release of the  wording in the Bluebook version of alternative B would likely trigger a decline in  money market yields  The new version of alternative B in the right column turns the  heat back up somewhat by inserting in row 3 words to the effect that the Committee is  not convinced that the present step-down in inflation will persist  This draft also  makes clear in row 2 that the characterization of recent economic growth is based on  the first half of this year and returns the language in row 4 to that used in the May  statement      Even if you are willing to keep the funds rate at 5¼ percent for now, you might   foresee policy action sometime soon, in which case the changes to the statement  probably do not represent your views  In particular, as shown in the top left panel of  exhibit 4, the unemployment rate (the red line) has bounced around 4½ percent for  almost a year  If you believe that this represents a taut labor market, you may be  concerned about inflation pressures, particularly given that the manufacturing sector  seems to have gone into a higher gear, as shown by recent readings on the ISM’s new  orders index, the black line  You might not be alone in being concerned about  inflation prospects  As plotted in the middle left panel, five-year, five-year-forward  inflation compensation has risen 30 basis points from its recent low  It might be  noise, it might be a wider risk premium, or it might be increased inflation  expectations  If it is the last, you may want to position yourself now for policy  firming sometime soon on the theory that an early demonstration of your displeasure  with a rise in inflation expectations will effectuate a less costly decline  Some  suggestions for doing so were offered in alternative C in the Bluebook, a few  highlights of which are given in the bottom left panel  In particular, the alternative C  draft reverses the order of the description of economic activity in row 2 to downplay  the qualification “despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector”  More  important, it retains the judgment that “core inflation remains somewhat elevated”  and gives more reasons that inflation many come under pressure  If you have a frame  of mind favorable to finer shades of meaning, you can always try dialing down the  modifier of elevated inflation from “somewhat” to “slightly”      More substantial changes might be required if you are inclined toward   alternative A, arguments for which are shown in the right-hand column  Regardless  of the reason behind the run-up in market yields, households borrowing to buy a  house now face higher mortgage rates (as shown in the top panel)  This may both  dissuade potential new purchasers of homes and disappoint those households that  were hoping to refinance on more-favorable terms as the lock-in periods on their  extant ARMs end  Both will act as a drag on spending and perhaps more  substantially so than in the staff forecast  Months’ supply of new homes, plotted in   June 27-28, 2007 97 of 261    the middle right panel, has edged higher  The staff projection has the feature that the  efforts of builders to bring inventories back into line will be a drag on production for  some time but that residential investment will begin to turn up by the second half of  next year  However, this is a projection, and if you are more pessimistic on that score  or want to give greater weight to downside possibilities from a risk-management  standpoint, you might want to show some leaning toward policy ease in the statement   The language of the draft statement in alternative A may do so  As summarized in  the bottom right panel, that draft pointed to “ongoing weakness in the housing sector”  in row 2, excises the reference to “somewhat elevated” inflation in row 3, and moves  the risk assessment to balance in row 4      The pieces of what I have just been talking about have been put together in your   last exhibit, which represents an ever-so-slightly revised version of table 1 that  circulated on Monday  In particular, in row 3 of alternative B, the word “sustained”  has been inserted in the middle sentence to raise the bar as to what it takes for the  Committee to be convinced that inflation has moderated  That concludes my  prepared remarks     5  Thank you, Mr Chairman, for giving me the normal role as  speed bump  In that effort we are now handing out material to which we will be  referring  If someone will let me know when the doughnut truck comes, I’ll pick up                                                     5 Material used by Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   June 27-28, 2007 124 of 261    the pace  [Laughter]  The Subcommittee on Communications began its work only  fifteen months ago, [laughter] which seems like yesterday (at least in geological  time)  Given the considerable discussion the Committee has had since then on its  communication policies, it seemed appropriate to take stock  In particular, I sent  around a list of questions designed to elicit your views on the potential roles of the  survey of economic projections, the minutes, and the statement in refining your  dialogue with the public  The material with the cover, “FOMC Communications,” is  designed to help to organize this discussion      With regard to the enhanced economic projections process, the survey results   circulated on June 15 reported general support for the key features of the process,  with three notable exceptions, given at the top of exhibit 1  The subcommittee tried  to address those concerns in the modified projections process used for this meeting   So the first question listed at the top of your first exhibit boils down to, how did they  do?  Did the changes address the concerns you expressed in answer to the May  survey?  In particular, some of you preferred not to share your forecast submissions,  mostly on the grounds that it might make the discussion of the economic outlook at  the meeting more inflexible  But some of you held that sharing was important, both  to help inform your internal deliberations and as a source of material for the forecast  write-up  As a compromise, the submissions were circulated on an anonymous basis,  with an opt-out clause that one of you took this time  Some of you were concerned  about specificity—particularly in writing down an explicit path for the federal funds  rate and in quantifying uncertainty  Those questions were turned into qualitative ones  that asked for comparisons with the staff policy assumption and historical uncertainty      Another process question is item 2  In what form should the projections be   released?  Debbie Danker’s memo identified the three options listed in the exhibit,  which basically differ by the extent to which the narrative description is tailored to  suit different purposes  Option 1 is one-size-fits-all  The staff would produce a  single document describing your economic projections, which would be dropped into  the Committee-approved minutes and repeated verbatim in the Board-approved  Monetary Policy Report  The chief advantages of this option are that the vetting  process is tried and true and that there will be consistency across Federal Reserve  documents  The disadvantage is familiar to anyone who has bought clothes off the  rack in a big box retailer—the fit will not be perfect across documents  Option 2  opens the door to some variety  The Committee-approved minutes would include a  brief description of the forecasts, as is the practice now  A separate document would  give a fuller account of the projections  In that case, there would be more flexibility  as to who approves the document and when it is released  This poses a tradeoff that  has come up in previous discussions in that the earlier the narrative is released, the  more useful it will be in explaining the policy decision but the more complicated the  governance process will be  Option 3 is the bespoke alternative in which separate,  complete discussions would be prepared for the minutes and the Monetary Policy  Report  The fit will be better, but carrying it out will be more expensive, and even  subtle differences may draw attention      June 27-28, 2007 125 of 261     The third question asks when the projections should be finalized  The choices  essentially are the day of the meeting, the end of the week of the meeting, or as late as  practicable to be close to the official release of the document  But you have a more  fundamental question to answer first  What is the purpose of the economic  projections?  If they are supposed to help explain your most recent policy choice, they  should be conditioned on the same information set that the policy decision is  That is,  they should be finalized as soon as possible after the meeting so that they are not  contaminated by post-decision information  That is the rule we now use for the  minutes  If, in contrast, the Committee’s objective is to release an up-to-date  assessment that sheds light on future policy actions, then the individual projections  should be nailed down only close to publication day  The middle ground of closing  the books on the projections a few days after the meeting seems unsustainable to me,  particularly if the narrative description is to be included in the minutes  The first time  an important piece of news hits within the window between policy decision and  update deadline, the explanation of the policy action will become muddled  Some  immediate feedback on that score will be helpful because the schedule for this round  allows for your projections to be updated through close of the week  If so, you would  seem to have to incorporate Friday’s chockfull data calendar  Do you really want to  do that, particularly as it may lead to confusion in the minutes about what you knew  and when you knew it?      The next exhibit focuses on the minutes  You have 2½ years of experience   under your belt in publishing the minutes three weeks after the day of the policy  decision  In that time, the document has received more attention from you in the  editing process and from market participants and the press on its release compared  with the previous regime of delaying publication until after the next meeting  How  do you assess the benefits and costs of further expediting the minutes?  The benefits,  listed at the left, are the same as discussed in 2004  A document made public closer  to the day of the decision will be more of an aid to the private sector in understanding  the current outlook and the prospects for policy  In that regard, you will be able to  use that material from the minutes for public statements more promptly  A speedier  release may facilitate making the post-meeting statement shorter or less substantive  I  point out, though, that my sense in 2004 was that a few of you supported expediting  the minutes in the hope that the statement would subsequently be shortened, but that  did not pan out  To appreciate the costs listed at the right, you should understand that  we use the three weeks after the meeting partly to accommodate your busy schedules  and partly to provide a cushion so that the drafting iterations can converge without a  dissenting vote  The costs, then, would include your increased effort to ensure that  your schedules align with that of the drafting and approval process for the minutes   You should also recognize that less drafting time might lead to more compromises  that make the minutes less informative so as to avoid dissent, and more staff  resources will be needed to prevent errors  Simply put, with fewer hours, we need  more eyes looking at the document      Of course, the decision on expediting the minutes further may interact with other   potential decisions on communication policies, especially those regarding the   June 27-28, 2007 126 of 261    enhanced projections process  In particular, if you decide to include a narrative  description of your forecasts in the minutes, you may want to delay any speeding-up  of the minutes until you are comfortable with the new process  You may also want to  consider ways to make drafting and commenting easier  That is the subtext  underlying question 5  How do you assess the current content of the minutes,  including the staff’s description of recent data?  Some time ago, it was suggested that  the first eight to ten pages, which provide a backward-looking review of recent  economic data, be relegated to an annex  In a similar vein, it could be described  explicitly as a staff summary—with its production perhaps even linked up  mechanically to a modified Part 2 of the Greenbook  That way, you would be  responsible for commenting only on the forward-looking and policy portions of the  document, and some of the pressures on staff time could be relieved  If you have any  other views on the content of the minutes, today probably would be an appropriate  time to raise them      The last exhibit raises issues that have not been addressed for some time, namely   the role of the post-meeting statement  Some of you might consider the statement as  a vehicle designed only to convey coarse signals about policy, with more-nuanced  information provided in subsequent communications  Others might see it as  important that the statement be able to stand on its own as a reasonably complete  explanation of the Committee’s monetary policy decisions and intentions  What is  the appropriate role of the statement in light of the changes to the Committee’s other  communication devices (question 6)?  The statement’s role, which can be described  in terms of a monetary policy rule, has varied over the years  At times the statement  has provided hints about the odds on future action by characterizing the left-hand side  of the policy rule—that is, by directly addressing the path of the federal funds rate   At times the statement has described the right-hand side of the policy rule—that is,  the risks to the dual macroeconomic objectives  That is another way of stating  question 7  If you believe that the statement should provide guidance about the  outlook, should that guidance be couched in terms of the policy interest rate or the  dual objectives?  If you decide to describe the economic outlook, you will have to  settle on the policy assumption underlying that projection, as in question 8  The  conditioning possibilities include the appropriate path of monetary policy, some  reading on market expectations, or an unchanged policy rate  This choice may  interact with the role you envisage for your economic projections in explaining policy  decisions      As for question 9, your ambition regarding the complexity of the statement will   determine how much time needs to be devoted to drafting  Because of constraints as  to how long you can meet as a group, a complicated statement necessitates pre- meeting consultation  That may get the nuance right, but it may also force you to  settle on a policy view before you have had the benefit of consulting with your  colleagues on the Committee  Moreover, it shifts some of the policy discussion out of  this room, for which a transcript is kept and minutes are produced, and into informal  back channels  A statement that could be agreed upon mostly within the confines of   June 27-28, 2007 127 of 261    these four walls is probably one that is short and relays a routinized risk assessment,  given your long-held view that “nineteen people cannot edit the statement on the fly”      Question 10 raises one last governance issue  Who owns the statement?  At the   inaugural of the age of statements in 1994, the Committee formally directed the  Chairman to explain its policy action  Over the years, the statement has come to be  viewed as a Committee product, with the words sometimes viewed to be at least as  important as the immediate policy action  But you still vote only on the policy action  and the risk assessment  Should that continue, or should you be asked to vote on the  statement in its entirety?      These three sets of questions are interrelated, and there is no obvious place to   wade into this thicket  One possibility would be to conduct two go-rounds on these  issues, with the first covering your views on the enhanced forecast and the minutes  and the second addressing the statement  The first two issues are closely related and  perhaps closer to closure  I suspect that you are closer to the beginning of your  discussion of the statement than to the end  That concludes my prepared remarks       That’s a complicated governance issue because it relates to both   what the Committee approves potentially and what the Board approves because the   Monetary Policy Report is by law a report of the Board of Governors explaining the   monetary policy actions of the Committee  The short answer is that it depends on what you   want  One possibility—that’s option one—is to write a narrative included in the minutes,   have it approved by the Committee, and then essentially lift that out and make that a   significant chunk of Part 1 of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report  Then the words   would be the same in both places   June 27-28, 2007 128 of 261      If you don’t express a view here, you’ll have a chance in   commenting on what the staff proposes  Our intention was to take a small subset of those   charts and tables that were essential for explaining the central tendency projections   themselves and the dispersion of views and to put them into the narrative  The draft that we   would circulate to you would have that information, and from there, we could take your   comments     About the same size as the last draft we circulated, which was, in   fact, circulated as an appendix in Debbie Danker’s memo     Yes     Yes  Well, that’s what we circulated last time in the draft write-  up of the May discussion   June 27-28, 2007 129 of 261      Potentially that’s what we would have     The staff draft of the June narrative will be similar in structure to   the May narrative  That, however, is only the first draft  Given that we intended it to be   similar in structure to the May narrative, then we would include a couple of histograms  We   also added in this package a revised picture of the central tendency—you know, the red bars   and the box and whiskers chart  We intended to include that  So we didn’t view any   material upgrade in the pictorial description of the forecast  We tried to come up with as fat   a package as we could for your internal discussion so that you could see how the individual   forecasts of your colleagues vary and also are related—for instance, between the   unemployment rate and the growth rate and between the inflation rate and the   unemployment rate      The particular cases that I can imagine would be employment   reports  If it takes five fewer business days—and that might be a little speedier than the staff   can actually deliver—any cutting of those business days, particularly if it gets past that   Friday, produces the chance that there would be another employment report between your   policy decision and the release of the minutes  This also interacts with the Chairman’s   testimony schedule, which is something we have to think about  Do you want to be in the   position of having the minutes more likely to be out before his testimony, or would you   prefer to have the minutes out after the testimony?  I can imagine both benefits and costs   associated with that     There were a couple of statistics in Debbie’s memo in particular   about how it interacts with the standard semiannual testimony schedule     Right  I believe the table of uncertainty was one thing that the   subcommittee viewed as useful to include, not the three big fat bars that showed uncertainty   variable by variable  That was useful background for writing the paragraphs in the narrative   that talked about the Committee’s perceptions of risks     The table had historical variability coming from a couple of   different sources     Right  That would be a reference table in the write-up  The   narrative would say, “In the Committee’s view, current uncertainty was about at historical   experience”  Then in the narrative description of the risks, we’d use the information that   you provided about the asymmetries of those risks  I don’t think we envisioned showing a   particular chart     No     Well, I would make a distinction between when the Committee   approves the document and when the Committee releases the document publicly  You   might not want, for instance, to release the minutes before the Chairman’s testimony   because it does sort of step on that message     But if the write-up is in Committee-approved minutes and a   Board-approved Monetary Policy Report, you’re going to have to figure out a mechanism   by which the Committee signs off on the write-up so that it will be the same in the report    The possibilities are that if it is an annex or a drop-in portion of the minutes, the Committee   may very well need to have two editing schedules—that is, comments on the narrative   would have to be finalized by a certain date so that it could go into the report and comments   on the complete minutes could take longer  That’s one possibility     The law says no later than February 20 and July 20  In practice,   the Committee sometimes allows for some slippage  The last few times it has tended to be   earlier than that  So that does put a T in terms of your planning horizon  You also have   some flexibility about when you schedule the meetings   June 27-28, 2007 136 of 261      Yes, the appendix to Debbie Danker’s memo is the draft that   Jim Clouse prepared  I think the Vice Chairman is correct in that, of course, there would   be some repetition in the discussion of the minutes just because the sector-by-sector   discussion of the near-term conjuncture is going to be somewhat similar to the longer-  term structure of the three-year or the three-to-five-year forecast  But they would serve   different purposes, and that repetition might not be unhelpful       Ever since you gave the guards guns, I didn’t really have any choice    [Laughter]
