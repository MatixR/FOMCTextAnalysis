6023,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman As has already been said in this room,  many reports suggest that the economy was very strong in the third quarter However, the  reports also indicate that inflation remains quite quiescent Going forward, I think there are  many reasons to be concerned that this good news on prices may soon come to an end We are  well aware of the labor market tightness from the latest BLS report and from the reports of the  Reserve Bank presidents today I also would note that a number of indicators suggest an upcreep  in both wages and benefits I admit that some of those indicators are anecdotal at this point, but  we all recognize that anecdotal evidence is sometimes a leading indicator for developments that    11/12/97 84  eventually show up in the aggregate statistics Capital has been readily available to borrowers on  very reasonable terms, and as Governor Meyer indicated, long-term interest rates, both real and  nominal, have retained much of their recent declines  However, some countervailing forces exist at this time We have talked a great deal  about the instability in Asia and the resulting fluctuations in our own stock markets In this  regard, I would associate myself with those who said they had some concern that perhaps the  Greenbook forecast may be a bit optimistic in terms of both the rapid recovery of Asian markets  and the limited spillover I will admit that the only obvious evidence I have for this is the  Brazilian austerity package  More fundamentally, we have had two quarters of productivity growth in the range of  2-1/2 to 3 percent The measured increase in productivity will obviously slow if economic  growth moderates But in the long run, capital deepening and the possibility of some  improvement in the quality of the labor force provide a reason to hope for some continued good  news on the productivity front  In sum, as others have said, we are in a challenging and complex period Several  factors indicate that the risks are on the upside for inflation However, recent instabilities in  financial markets may well result in some slowdown in the US economy and a slight decrease  in risks for general price increases Indeed, some of these instabilities create the likelihood of a  heightened reaction to any policy move that we may make today For the longer term, while I  recognize that there clearly are some limits on capacity and we may be close to them, I am also  mindful that we may be seeing some evidence of a payoff from capital deepening Thank you  I concur with your recommendation "
6048,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman As we meet today, both international  and domestic developments give us obvious food for thought I believe, as others do, that our  watchwords at this point should perhaps be a ""cautious"" and maybe even a ""nervous""  wait-and-see stance The trend of the domestic economy, as others have said, is clearly quite  strong The latest figures indicate continued tightness in some sectors of the labor market,  particularly in the area of information technology I also am impressed by indications of  declining labor underutilization, which suggest that there are fewer people, at least domestically,  who can be pulled into the labor markets by the creative solutions that others have mentioned I  am not an expert on how an employer can pull in workers internationally, but the need to attract  such workers may increase There is also some obvious strength in industrial production The  recent numbers indicate quite clearly a widespread increase in production activity There is a  large backlog of unfilled orders suggesting some continued strength in manufacturing output  I also see evidence pointing to some moderation If we look at the real adjusted orders  measures, we see an indication of possible slowing in growth, admittedly at still very high levels  of activity While we are observing tightness in the labor market, I continue to believe that the  evidence indicates an increase in productivity above the anemic 1 percent trend that we have  seen thus far It is quite clear that some capital deepening has occurred We should continue to  watch that Obviously, there have been changes in capacity utilization measurements that    12/16/97 50  indicate some room for continued output growth without taxing productive resources Others  have already talked about recent indications of some slowing in inflationary pressures stemming  from lower oil prices, which I think will continue to be important  With respect to financial markets, it is clear that credit conditions are not overly tight  In addition, some of the evidence that President Minehan referred to with respect to investments  in Boston, discussions with other bankers, and even this morning's American Banker continue to  indicate some loosening of lending standards We should be mindful of that as we go forward  Finally, with respect to the international situation I, too, commend the analysis that we  heard earlier with respect to international markets The major issue we are dealing with there is  that the recovery periods of these countries and the potential impact on US prices and export  demand are still very unclear At the time of the previous Greenbook forecast, I believed that the  actual outcome might end up being closer to the so-called ""worse case"" scenario than to the  Greenbook forecast This time, I am more convinced of that The anecdotal evidence, at least,  suggests that the Greenbook forecast as it stands now is about right Secondly, we should also  consider our own financial markets A number of different forces evidently are driving them, but  it is clear that we have declining inflation expectations, which we should continue to keep in  mind The financial markets apparently do not perceive that monetary policy is behind the  curve in terms of fostering our price stability goal I do think the dichotomy between goods  inflation and services inflation will start to come more into play going forward, but at this point  neither of them is pressing us to do anything dramatically different  In summary, there are some clear stresses, particularly in parts of the labor market  There are signs of a pickup in wage-induced inflation, but there also is room to believe that    12/16/97 51  productivity gains will preclude significant wage pressures I will admit that there are few clear  signs of moderation in economic growth or price pressures And, finally, I think the staff has the  likely impact of Asia on our economy about right in the Greenbook, and I commend them for  that I conclude that this is a period to wait and see In my view, any other posture risks  upsetting a fairly complex economic and financial system that is looking for a new equilibrium  Thank you  I, too, concur with your ""B"" symmetric proposal I agree  particularly with what President Stern has said We are in an era of significant uncertainty, and I  think it is important to signal to the markets that as a responsible central bank we are prepared to  be flexible in our effort to address whatever challenges may emerge I also recognize that this is  an intermeeting approach, and we will have a chance to rethink this in the near future "
6073,1998-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman I understand that the role of  central bankers is, in fact, to take risks I was rather surprised to learn that, coming as I  did from consulting where we took no risks But I am getting used to this job The  economy, as others have said, clearly entered 1998 with significant momentum Since we  last met, we have seen a number of indicators of notable strength going forward  Examples include consumer confidence, low long-term interest rates that make for a low  cost of capital, housing permits, and something no one has yet mentioned, the rise in real  adjusted durable goods orders So, a number of factors point to strong forward  momentum  I will concur with what Governor Gramlich had to say There are also a number  of factors that suggest that inflation pressures may well diminish as we go forward in  1998 These include oil prices, commodity prices, inflation expectations, and capacity  utilization In addition, there is obviously what I think is the least understood risk, which  is the turbulence in Asia There we are getting a broad range of signals The anecdotal  evidence suggests that developments in Asia are starting to produce some slowdown in  some US industries, but I was surprised to hear how few presidents came forward with  more of those kinds of stories In addition, of course, some have indicated that the  markets in Asia seem to have a point of view, perhaps irrational, that the situation there is  starting to turn Before this year is over--it could be in March or a little later--we may    2/3-4/98  confront some tougher policy choices I noticed that there is already a bit of a split in the  Committee about the outlook  For now, to make this short, the economy is strong, the impact of Asia is unclear,  and the risks are greater I happen to think that there is still greater upside than downside  risk But in that environment, I believe we are going to be together as risk takers, and I  would encourage us to maintain a vigilant, maybe quite uncomfortable, waiting attitude to  see exactly what emerges going forward  I agree with alternative I I think Governor Rivlin said it best  It would be nice in some sense to be more clear about what we are doing, but precedent,  previous interpretation, ease of communication, and pragmatism--none of which has  anything to do with monetary policy I suppose [laughter]--all suggest alternative I  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation Yesterday, I  spoke a bit about risks and the fact that we are risk takers I think we are taking  reasonable risks by waiting to see exactly what happens We need time to observe the  strength of the factors that will be exerting an impact on both sides of the economy The  other comment I would like to make to explain why I support your recommendation  relates to a topic that does not come up much at these meetings, namely, communications  We seem to have gotten ourselves in a position of having an implicit contract to  communicate with financial markets All we have communicated thus far is a great deal  of balance Given what we have communicated and our implicit contract, I think it is  appropriate for us to retain the balanced approach that we adopted at the last meeting It    2/3-4/98  may be that we did not intend to have this implicit contract, but I believe it is there now  and we have to live with it "
6100,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman During the coffee break, President  Boehne suggested that he had relatively little to say this time around because he had such a short    3/31/98  distance to travel My office is the nearest to this room, short of the Chairman's, so I will have  even less to say this time  Let me observe, as others have, that during the first quarter the spillover from the  Asian crisis was indeed overshadowed by the strength of domestic demand Labor markets have  remained tight, as many of you have indicated One thing I would add that we have not  discussed much is that while short-term interest rates have risen to relatively high levels by  historical standards, this de facto policy tightening is not associated with similar tightness at the  longer end of the yield spectrum Risk spreads for private debt instruments are quite narrow, and  the extension of credit to private nonfinancial borrowers from numerous sources--commercial  paper, bank lending, and so on--is running well above the pace of the last couple of years So, I  think we are in a very stimulative environment from a monetary and financial standpoint  The second thing I would add relates to Asia We already have talked about how little  impact we have seen from developments in Asia I have just returned from a trip to Japan during  which I met with central bankers and finance ministers from the affected countries Two things  emerged from those meetings that I would like to bring to your attention One is that both the  Koreans and the Thais certainly feel that their economies are on the road to recovery, but they  describe their recoveries as ""U"" shaped, and they expect their economies to bounce along the  bottom for an extended period before they finally see some uptick Secondly, the major  economy in the region, Japan, is still facing significant challenges During my visit, I found  universal agreement that the economy was at least stagnant and probably in a recession The  fiscal stimulus packages introduced to date, the latest one totaling 16 trillion yen, are thought to  be far less stimulative than they might appear As one newspaper indicated, the most recent    3/31/98  package is ""big, vague, and unconvincing"" Therefore, I think that the United States is still likely  to be the importer of last resort and that more impact is yet to be felt from Asia  To summarize these brief comments, what risks do I see? I believe, as do a number of  others, that there is an increasing inflation risk emanating from labor market tightness, from the  potential ending of some of the special factors that have restrained inflation recently, and from  the stimulus that is emerging from financial markets I still see a possibility of some greater-  than-desired drag from Asia, but I think that risk is less now than it was at the time of our last  meeting Overall, I believe we should be in a vigilant posture, recognizing that the risks now  seem to be tilted toward the upside I do see some dangers in a premature change in policy  stance that might be too great or that would take markets by surprise Unlike my colleague to the  right, I think predictability is sometimes not a bad thing  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation of ""B""  asymmetric I think it is important that we signal that we are both vigilant and want to maintain  the gains that already have been made  When we removed the asymmetry from the directive in December, I asked one of the  other Board members why we did not announce the change then I was told that it was because  we would then be announcing two different policies at the same time I wasn't sure I understood  that explanation then, and I'm not sure I understand it now, but I do think that--  It was one of many explanations! I believe, however, that the  issue deserves more consideration So, I would not rush into announcing now, but I do think we  should discuss the issue at the next meeting I recognize that we will have some explanations to  make when we move to tighten policy because, while inflation pressures are building, there also  are low inflation numbers and low inflation expectations In my view, all of these considerations  point more in the direction of a policy speech as opposed to simply a quick announcement after  the meeting I would associate myself with what President Boehne had to say with respect to  making sure that people recognize the context in which our policy action is undertaken and to  remind people that the economic benefits we have achieved to date have come from low  inflation I believe it is important to keep those two things in mind  I guess the only other concern I would have relates to our trying to think through our  policy strategy going forward It might be appropriate at some meeting, perhaps the next if it  looks as though we are on a new policy trend, to be quite clear with ourselves as to exactly what  our strategy is This is what I think Governor Gramlich was referring to earlier "
6125,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the intermeeting period, I became  more certain that the sense of upside risks that many of us expressed at the last meeting was  continuing to hold true, and I have detected a bit of that sense today in our discussion around the  table However, I must admit that the economy is showing some signs of an ongoing uptrend and  also of some possible emerging weakness The first-quarter GDP, as Mike Prell said, was a  ""stunner"" In my view, it does require some general reassessment of our outlook for the rest of this  year Early indications of retail sales and the orders and shipments data suggest that the robustness  seen in the first quarter, driven by both consumers and producers, is likely to continue for the  foreseeable future Obviously, labor markets are tight, so there is not much more to say there  Manufacturing has not yet returned to its December levels Factory output and operating ratios are  below what had prevailed last year However, manufacturing output did grow about 03 percent  last month So, while there are signs of weakness in that sector of the economy, it may be turning  around a little On balance, I would agree with the characterization that I heard before, which is  that the evidence bearing on the near-term course of the domestic economy seems somewhat  inconclusive    5/19/98  What worries me in this mixed picture is that there are some special factors that  benefited us on inflation in the past that may well be on the wane now In particular, I am worried  about indications of some acceleration in compensation It is true that the ECI increased at a low  27 percent annual rate over the three months ended in March, but the 12-month wage and salary  compensation components have broken through the 4 percent level for the first time in several  years Health insurance costs may also be giving some indications of an uptick, even though the  evidence is primarily anecdotal I did not hear very much about that as we went around the table,  but there was some discussion of that here at the Board Now, these increases in labor costs may  well be occurring at a time when productivity growth may have moved up to a new higher trend,  but I do wonder if even 15 percent growth in productivity will be enough to offset overall increases  of 4 to 5 percent in wages and salaries The changes in labor compensation that may be ahead are  particularly worrisome because I think they may occur in the context of flattening or possibly  declining profit margins in the corporate sector Some of these declining profit margins seem to be  hitting the high-tech sector as well As we well know, some of the benefits we have had in the  economy have been driven by relatively low, in fact declining, prices in the high-tech sector That  may start to change  The second risk that I see in this economy is the ""immaculate"" slowdown in the  growth of economic activity that Mike Prell has presented in the Greenbook forecast I am  concerned that it may well not work out the way that Mike has projected If inventory investments  reflect the expectations of sales growth, and I think some members have referred to the inventory-  sales ratio as not being out of line, then I am quite concerned because I believe as do others that  consumers are not likely to show much restraint Obviously, there are plenty of jobs A few  members also have pointed to some inconsistencies on the income side of the projections As many    5/19/98  have said, significant wealth considerations are driving consumers I think we can see on the basis  of what happened in the first quarter that inventory investment might not slow nearly as much as  the Greenbook has projected On balance, the domestic indicators are, in my judgment, generally  pointing toward mounting upside risks  Turning to the international side, I think as does Vice Chair McDonough that the  turmoil in Asia is entering a new and highly unpredictable social and political phase that we have  not seen before At our last meeting, I reported that the economies of Korea and Thailand might be  bouncing along the bottom for quite a while Now, it seems as though the Indonesian situation may  have placed a trap door beneath them, and the outlook for the entire region looks a lot less certain  than it did even a few weeks ago However, that situation is quite fluid and could return to an  improving trend relatively quickly Japan is even less likely to act as an engine of growth in the  near term than I thought earlier, so we cannot look there for help With regard to the other major  economies in the region, Vice Chair McDonough mentioned India, but I would turn our attention to  China China has committed to holding their peg, which I think is an act of great international  diplomacy and statesmanship But its success does depend on strong discipline and also on an  ambitious target of 8 percent growth, which seems less and less likely Therefore, in this Asian  context, I think China adds a bit of uncertainty  Finally, let me respond or refer to some of the comments that my colleague, Governor  Gramlich, made with respect to the NAIRU I agree with him in the sense that I do not believe we  know exactly what the actual NAIRU is There are people in the room who surely will tell us that  it is an unemployment rate of 55 percent There are others who will say that it is 52 percent  There are those who probably thought a year ago that it was 6 percent We don't actually know I  believe that the capital deepening and labor quality improvements of recent years may have    5/19/98  allowed for an increase in productivity I hope that is true I believe that businesses are now  focused more on achieving efficiencies, and that structural changes have made the economy  somewhat less inflation prone I do not believe, however, that that means all limits have been  removed I think we are very close to those limits  In summary, based on domestic concerns alone, I think we are probably focused  correctly on the upside risks I believe that on the basis of domestic concerns alone it might be  reasonable for us to consider acting in the near future However, I don't think we need to act now  as I expect that there will be only a slow unraveling in the forces that have held inflation at bay I  think that for international reasons, it is appropriate for us to wait and see That is what is in order  at this point, and I suspect there will be greater clarity in the economic outlook in the near future  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, I concur with your recommendation I agree with  others around the table who have said that our obligation is primarily to our own citizens  However, I also recognize that there will be spillover effects if conditions continue to get worse in    5/19/98  Asia, and I am concerned about that In my view, the monetary and credit aggregates are quite  accommodative and that is troubling at this point But I also am comforted by the fact that we seem  to have relatively low inflation expectations, and as Governor Phillips has said, we are starting  from a relatively low level of inflation I have three or four questions One is, can we wait? I  think the answer to that is yes, we certainly can wait Inflation is not out of control, and we retain  some well-won gains Should we wait? I believe the answer is yes; obviously at this meeting we  should wait Should we then be prepared to move quickly? I think the answer to that is obviously  yes I believe it probably will be appropriate to move before the summer is out, but that does not  mean that we have to move today "
6151,1998-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I'm the last to speak, so I will  try to be brief We received a number of signals during the intermeeting period Many of these  indicators point to a continued uptrend in the economy, perhaps at a slower pace but not  necessarily one that is without inflation risks  As others have said, jobs continue to be plentiful The labor market is tight April's  43 percent unemployment rate was not a fluke Indeed, for the year through May, the  unemployment rate averaged about 45 percent, which is probably below anyone's reasonable  estimate of the NAIRU Disturbingly, these labor markets are clearly creating some conditions  for wage-induced inflation that in my view are noticeably stronger than earlier Average hourly  earnings increased 43 percent over the past 12 months, up from 39 percent in the prior 12  months and in turn up from 33 percent in the 12 months before that In addition, the so-called  indicators of worker insecurity appear to have turned toward increasing security President    6/30-7/1/98  Broaddus talked about his son The median duration of unemployment is not normally two  weeks but it is down to about five weeks from eight weeks previously The quit rate is back up  and labor force participation has not grown further  I recognize that productivity increases may offset some of the nominal wage increases,  and in this regard I am hopeful that the staff is right and in fact I think that they probably are  However, the difference between nominal wage gains and productivity growth, even assuming  some uptick in productivity trend, is growing ever larger In my view, the gap between wage  gains and productivity growth is putting increasing pressure on businesses to translate some of  these wage gains into price increases, particularly if the growth of profit margins is slowing  Someone mentioned earlier that the yield curve was flattening As I see it, the  flattening is being driven more by the long end than the short end, which does not suggest to me  a slowing of the economy In fact, it might be having a stimulative effect So, I believe we  should be cautious about putting too much weight on the flattening Finally, as others have said,  the strength in labor markets is feeding unabated demand for consumer goods, and interest-  sensitive goods, housing in particular, have continued to display strength  Others have talked about the Greenbook forecast, and I will quickly give my read on  it, which is not dramatically different from that of others The staff suggests that the extremely  strong economic picture is going to be cooled to lower growth rates by net exports, correction of  inventory overhang, and some moderation in the PCE uptrend I think there is at best only the  barest evidence in support of this deceleration story  The net export story, as the Greenbook indicates, is actually more past than prologue  The staff forecast says that the worst of the direct retarding impact from net exports already  occurred in the first quarter and that going forward we are likely to see less of a direct impact    6/30-7/1/98  from that sector of the economy Therefore, we are relying on a multiplier-accelerator story to  achieve the desired results, as I think Mike Prell suggested in response to President Poole's  question  Similarly, with respect to the slowdown in inventory accumulation, I think I'm in the  same camp as President Minehan Inventory-to-shipment ratios in manufacturing have edged up  only slightly, and they remain below where they were in January Wholesale inventory-to-sales  ratios also seem to be quite well behaved Admittedly, maintaining these ratios does not require  a continued $100 billion annual rate of inventory increase, but it does seem likely that there may  be more of an increase or less of a slowdown than the staff expects  Finally, the staff is looking forward to some slowdown in PCE due to a slowing in  wealth creation from the stock market and a slight uptick in unemployment The rise in the  unemployment rate in the Greenbook forecast is only to about 45 percent this year, which I  believe most of us would not regard as an indication of a loose labor market The slowdown in  the stock market may turn out, as usual, to be more ephemeral than real So, I see some real risks  on the upside, particularly with respect to the domestic economy  There are, as others have indicated, some countervailing and potentially growing risks  on the downside The strike at GM, I think, is likely to exert a short-term but noticeable shock  The international developments that others have talked about are certainly no less certain The  one thing I could add, after coming back from Japan and talking to some private-sector  forecasters there, is that I believe the base forecast that the staff has presented to us is somewhat  more optimistic than those forecasters in Japan currently believe So, there is some more  downside potential there    6/30-7/1/98  In summary, I believe that the risks to the upside still exist However, none of these  worries are yet realities The staff forecast may materialize and, like others, I hope that it does I  think that the risks to the downside are a little stronger now than they were at the time of the last  meeting There obviously is continued international instability On balance, I would go with the  word ""uncertain"" in characterizing the outlook The future is quite uncertain and I think no  action is required on our part, either up or down The more prudent course is, again, to wait and  see It appears to be the most responsible among the difficult choices that we face The next  meeting may have a different outcome, but I think this is the appropriate outcome for this  meeting  President Stern has picked up my point I thought the paper was  very interesting, but in some sense quite inwardly focused because it is all about what we should  do It missed what for me is an important point, the one in the Akerlof paper to which the  Chairman alluded I guess I would like to see added to this study some sense of the impact on  the real economy from having inflation at various levels Is 2 percent inflation right? Is zero  inflation right? Which one does better in terms of productivity, in terms of investment, in terms  of flexible labor markets? I think it would be useful to have a summary of the information that is  available on this issue Otherwise, we are aiming at a target that may have very little to do with  our general goal of creating an economy that is performing well overall  We also have to put it in a broader context Those of us who  have recently been confirmed as Board members had to go through a bit of grilling by a few  senators on why we did not think an inflation target might be a good idea It is easy to dance  around that issue, but it would be nice to attack it directly    6/30-7/1/98  Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with President Guynn I think  it is very important for us to keep track of what ranges are consistent with our views of long-term  price stability That does allow those of us who are focused on them to remind the rest of us that  we are experiencing above trend growth I think that actually provides for a useful discipline I  also took note, as did President McTeer, of the southeast corner of Chart 4 that indicates that  stability may be returning to these relationships For me, that provides a little hope that there    6/30-7/1/98  might be some increased discipline in those ranges and therefore all the more reason to keep  them alive So, I would not change them right now I would keep the monetary growth ranges  focused on long-run price stability, and I look forward to a day when we might start to use them  more seriously in our deliberations  Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with your recommendation on  maintaining the federal funds rate where it is today and also on maintaining the bias toward  tightening I am concerned about the prospects of an updrift in inflation I guess I fear, perhaps  more than you do, that the staff's forecast for slower expansion without some policy intervention  may be too optimistic I do recognize that there are some indications of a little slowing right  now, but I'm afraid those may be short-lived I also think, based on other information we have  received from the staff, that even if there is an updrift in productivity, that may call for a higher    6/30-7/1/98  funds rate and not a lower funds rate in order to maintain equilibrium So, while I am optimistic  on both of those scores, I think the bias toward tightening that you recommend is right  However, in line with what the Vice Chair has said, I also am concerned about the  international component of the forecast as I mentioned yesterday I think the external situation is  not going to improve anytime soon Therefore, I believe the wiser course for us at this stage is to  sit tight I guess ultimately this is the least unacceptable choice, but I think it is also the most  responsible one Therefore, I would make no change in either the funds rate or the asymmetry  Thank you, Mr Chairman After listening to a number of very  good arguments from people who have much longer tenures than I do in this area, I will weigh in  just a little I believe that we have two decisions to make The first is whether we should make  any announcements after meetings when there is no change in policy I think the answer to that  is ""no"" because I don't think such a decision represents a consensus in the same sense as a  decision to change policy Bill Poole and others have suggested that there are many and  differing reasons why individual members of the Committee may decide not to make a change in  policy It is very difficult, as you point out, Mr Chairman, to write a clear summary statement  about such a decision We spend a fair amount of time discussing factors relating to our policy  preferences before coming to a consensus on not changing policy, but we would then be hard    6/30-7/1/98  pressed to state clearly and concisely the reasons for that consensus That exercise would not be  productive  Secondly, with respect to announcing the tilt, I actually see that as a close call, though  I have a slight preference in favor of making an announcement The reason is that I believe the  tilt does reflect a change in policy and a consensus is needed to make that change So, I think it  is useful to inform the markets of that for a variety of reasons that others have alluded to One is  that we often want to condition market expectations in one way or another That may be done  through statements or speeches that you make, Mr Chairman, but in some sense releasing our  decision on the tilt after each meeting is an easier way to accomplish that result Secondly, I  think we can indeed educate the markets on what this means Mike Kelley pointed to a table that  some would interpret as indicating that we are quite undecided when we adopt a tilt One of the  things we might do if we were to undertake to make this announcement would be to educate the  market as to exactly what it means We often find people in the press who ask whether we think  the risks are in one direction or the other The tilt is a way to disclose what the Committee thinks  the risks are, and that might be very helpful, though we could also then step back from that as we  get new information I think that indicates that we are responsible public servants as opposed to  irresponsible public servants I am not so concerned about having people belittle us or ask us  why we have changed our minds because we always have new information to assess after our  decision  Finally, as I understand the origin of this, some of the language of the tilt as I read it  suggests that it is aimed at intermeeting actions It seems that we have moved away from  intermeeting adjustments in the target for the funds rate, and therefore perhaps the tilt has taken  on a slightly different meaning that can be disclosed more clearly and more readily to the public    6/30-7/1/98  For those reasons, while it is a close call, I would be in favor of disclosing the tilt but not making  statements when we have made no change in policy "
6177,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I review the current economic  outlook I am, like others, struck by the strong but at least currently balanced forces that appear to  be shaping the future Potentially weakening developments stemming from the external sector  seem to be balanced against a currently strong domestic sector, although some weakness in the  latter is a possibility We also continue to see a dichotomy between the goods sector, including  commodities and agriculture, and the service sector I think the links across these various    8/18/98  balances and dichotomous elements of the economy reside in two areas One is the labor markets  and the other is the financial markets The challenge to me is that this balance is quite fragile  right now, and it seems very much like a high-wire act where a move to either side would be quite  detrimental  As others have indicated, developments relating to the external sector clearly have  slowed the growth of GDP The Greenbook projections suggest that the external sector will slow  the expansion less and less going forward Therefore, one might think that it should be less and  less a part of our deliberations However, the risk that I see here is that the staff may have  underestimated the net drag that will come from the external side I agree with Ted Truman that  its negative contribution eventually will turn around, but I see some risk that the Japanese  economy will not turn around as quickly as in the Greenbook forecast The current Greenbook  estimates that economic activity in Japan declined at a 5 percent rate in the first half of this year,  and it anticipates a flat performance in the second half and an upturn to a low growth rate in the  first part of next year That forecast seems a little optimistic to me Also, as the events of this  week have indicated, global contagion is still very much a risk that could undermine fragile  recoveries around the world The staff forecast, as Governor Gramlich indicated, has moved  some distance toward the so-called ""worse case"" scenario I hope that that partial movement is  not further abetted by unfolding events overseas In any event, the importance of the external  sector is much greater than the 3 or 4 percent of GDP that is accounted for by the US current  account deficit  The domestic economy provides a marked counterpoint to the external sector The  Greenbook forecast calls for some abatement of what has been very strong growth That  abatement is based to a very substantial extent on an anticipated diminution of wealth effects    8/18/98  Such an outcome is quite possible The recent so-called near correction in the stock market lends  some credibility to this scenario However, as others have indicated, the stock market is  notoriously difficult to forecast Therefore, I would say with respect to purely domestic  developments that I sense considerable tension between factors pointing to an overly strong  expansion and those that suggest a potential for some shortfall in demand from current  expectations For me at this point, those two sets of factors seem to be roughly in balance  The other set of mirror images that we are dealing with is the goods sector versus the  service sector It is clear that the goods sector has thus far taken the brunt of the adverse impact of  foreign trade developments Goods exports and imports seem to account for almost all of the net  export drag that we have experienced Additionally, the goods sector has been an important  player in the recent performance of the domestic economy in that the swing in inventory  investment was a key factor in the shift of GDP from very rapid growth in the first quarter to  much reduced growth in the second Forward-looking indicators, such as recent purchasing  manager surveys, show some weakness in the goods sector going forward However, I think  there are some signs of strength even in that sector While there was a slowdown in the buildup  of inventories in the second quarter, stock building was still substantial, something like 6 percent  at an annual rate For its part, the service sector is a clear story of strength building on strength,  and the Greenbook forecast shows that as basically continuing  The linkages across these various elements of our economy may be seen, as I said, in  the labor markets The overall labor market is obviously tight and likely to stay tight The  tightness seems to be discouraging some layoffs in industries that have been affected by the  externally induced drag Not surprisingly, the strength in demand also has forced employers in  other sectors of the economy, in the service sector in particular, to increase the number of workers    8/18/98  that they employ So, it seems to me that the unemployment rate, as the Greenbook suggests, is  likely to adjust very slowly to a moderating economic expansion While I think the labor markets  will be slow to adjust, we will see and have seen that financial markets are quite quick to adjust,  and they add a degree of volatility to the economy  I think the potential interplay that we are starting to see between corporate profits, stock  valuations, and consumer performance are the elements that are most relevant to us I believe they  represent the main sources of risk to the forecast The staff forecast depends on this volatility and  an adjustment in equity prices to more conservative profit outlooks to bring the various elements  of the economy into an equilibrium at a lower, indeed subtrend, growth rate Unfortunately, I  think there are many risks to this ""immaculate slowing"" forecast The most obvious stem from  the weaknesses in foreign economies and the international financial turmoil that continue to take  some toll on psychology and real economic performance On the other hand, tight labor markets,  which the staff currently expects to have little impact on prices, could potentially translate into  greater inflationary pressures than the staff has forecast if businesses attempt to maintain profit  margins by raising prices to offset declining productivity Similarly, the diminishing wealth effect  that is expected to come from the stock market may not be as strong as the staff has forecast  Overall, I think the risks are larger in both directions, and unlike where I was at the last  meeting, I now believe they are quite balanced However, I see it as a delicate balance, and I think  our current role is to do as little as possible to upset the various forces that affect the economy  By sitting still now, we run the smallest risk in a scenario that is fraught with uncertainties, none  of which is of our own making Thank you  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of alternative B I  have a mild preference for symmetry With President Minehan, I still have some concern about  the risks of rising inflation, but I also agree that the external sector has become more uncertain I  sense that symmetry is the best way to communicate these concerns taken together "
6218,1998-09-29," I am with what seems to be the growing majority here, but I  recognize that there are counter arguments I'm in favor of immediately releasing the tilt mainly  because it's a question of honesty If a consensus has emerged in the Committee that says the    9/29/98  risks have moved in a certain direction and therefore policy may follow, I think it is useful to  inform the market We are now in a posture where we do not release the tilt and we end up  having a number of people trying to interpret our speeches and our responses to questions in a  way that may not conform with our thinking I think releasing the tilt promptly will give us a  chance to be much clearer with the market, to signal with one voice as opposed to potentially 19  voices, and to be certain that if we have reached a consensus, we will tell the market what the  consensus is  I also would be happy to encourage the earlier release of the minutes in the sense that  they provide a fuller context for our decisions As to the language, I have a slight preference for  Option 1 as amended by Tom Hoenig, but I can support Option 2 as well  Thank you, Mr Chairman For much of this year, as others have  said, we have been waiting for a financial upset to hit our shores, and it looks as though that is  about to happen While many of us have migrated to a view of noticeably weaker growth, and I  am among them, I think it's important to reiterate two realities that others have brought out  First, of course, this weakness is a forecast Domestic weakness is not yet here In fact, labor    9/29/98  markets, as others have said, remain tight Anecdotal evidence suggests that the demand for  workers is still strong in some sectors GDP is likely to grow at or above trend for this quarter  and the next The boost to GDP is the result of two things the first, obviously, is the return of  the GM workers and the second is the continued strength of some interest-sensitive sectors of the  economy PCEjumped as consumers purchased more automobiles Orders for durable goods  indicate continued increases in shipments and spending, albeit at lower rates than in the first half  Retail sales reports are strong and anecdotal evidence indicates no slowing yet in housing or  housing-related durable goods I think I heard a little of that around the table There clearly  remain some risks of higher inflation, though I will agree with others that they have gone down  significantly  On the negative side, employment growth is down further and the likely impact of  international financial turmoil has become much clearer For me the important source of  potential weakness from the foreign side is not necessarily in the traded goods sector even  though that will continue to be a source of drag on domestic economic activity What is more  worrisome in my view is the transmission of financial weakness abroad to our financial markets  and the resulting impact on the investment behavior of US businesses I guess it should not be  a surprise that weakness will emanate from the investment activities of firms after a period when  growth has been heavily driven by business investment spending Importantly for me, a lot of  this investment spending from corporations has been maintained during this period by both cash  flow and leverage We have not talked much about it in this room, but I believe that nonfinancial  corporate debt grew at an annual rate of about 12 percent in the first half of this year The  difference between capital spending and internally generated funds, what many call the financing  gap, is I believe at its highest level since the recession of 1982 This approach to corporate  investment, which includes both cash flow and leverage, makes such investment particularly    9/29/98  vulnerable to changes in financial conditions, psychology, and profit prospects, all of which we  have experienced recently  I agree with Vice Chair McDonough that the vehicle for this weakness is not purely  stock market effects where we in fact had expected some deterioration Of greater importance to  me is the fact that it is more broadly centered in credit markets We have heard from the staff  that the syndicated loan market appears to have become less accommodating, and that is causing  some banks to pull back to some extent from lending I am concerned that if that reduced  willingness to lend is combined with significant increases in the cost of capital from the stock  market, we will face a real risk of serious capital-raising constraints Like Vice Chair  McDonough, I am not predicting a credit crunch, but I am mindful that it is not out of the realm  of possibility It also seems likely that a slowdown in credit-driven business investment will lead  to slower growth in job incomes and wealth-driven consumption Thus far this year  consumption has surprised us on the upside, driven by tight labor markets and by high equity  values It seems, though, that both of these factors have begun to unravel or will shortly do so  Equity markets already have done so Labor markets will adjust gradually over time  For me the final question is what the reaction of this Committee should be As others  have indicated, the international side seems unlikely to settle sufficiently or sufficiently quickly  to alter the scenario No other major economic power seems capable of engendering the growth  of demand that we need to maintain near-term trend growth in our country But like President  Boehne and others, I believe that any monetary policy adjustment that comes out of our meeting  today should be done very judiciously There are some elements of strength in the economy  The downside risks are still quite high, but we could again be surprised on the upside I for one  do not think we are yet behind the curve Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman I endorse your recommendation for a  decrease of 25 basis points in the federal funds target rate As I said in my earlier statement, I  think we are acting somewhat preemptively, and while I believe we should take action at this  point, we should not overreact    9/29/98  With respect to your policy recommendation for moving to asymmetry, I endorse that  as well Like President Moskow, I feel that further cuts are slightly more likely than not, and I  think it is important to signal that at least internally Therefore, I would move to asymmetry  Two questions come to my mind One relates to reports that some  of the institutions were not just lenders but also investors Those, I presume, mainly have been  investment banks Do we think there also are some section 20s or others that may have been  involved?  My other question is one that I also ask to make sure that we will  have an answer It involves an issue that is similar to the one that Larry Meyer was raising  Does this experience in any sense bring into question the approach we are taking with respect to  risk-based supervision? To some extent, it involves what we do and when we do it We need to  figure out how that approach might have to be adjusted based on this experience "
6243,1998-10-15," This is Roger Ferguson speaking I would like to echo and respond  to some of what I have heard on the policy issue Mike Kelley is concerned about sending a  message of panic or disarray in policymaking On the other hand, I am actually more concerned  about being perceived as being inactive in the face of what I think are going to be potentially  rapidly moving changes going forward I have been struck by some of what Bill McDonough  had to say and what Larry Meyer had to say as well The financial markets do seem to be  showing signs of a great deal of fear and uncertainty They seem actually to have gone beyond a  state of concern and uncertainty and to have seized up in important ways There are  counterparties that no longer seem to be standing on the other side of important trades I am  fairly certain that the result will inevitably be some impact on the real economy The sense of  financial foreboding that I have heard, while it has not yet translated into an impact on the real  economy, will in my view have such an impact at some point, perhaps not in the next week or  two but certainly in the next quarter or two We all know that the policy actions that we take  require some time to work their way through the economy Additionally, in a period of great  uncertainty, I think it is important for us to be shown in a leadership role and one in which we are  prepared to be as flexible and as vigilant as the markets and circumstances in the real economy  require Therefore, in terms of what has brought us here today and what is different, I conclude    10/15/98  that what is different is that the markets have not moved to support the kind of investment or the  kind of consumption expenditure that we need to maintain growth as close as possible to trend I  think it is our obligation to be pushing publicly against the significant downside risk that I  believe we face  I am mindful, as Mike Kelley indicated, that we are involved in an intermeeting  discussion Therefore, any action that we may take should in my view be on the order a 25 basis  point move It should not be larger because we will get more impact out of 25 basis points in my  opinion than from anything else So, having heard where we are now and sharing the sense that  adverse financial conditions have not yet hit the real economy but are likely to do so, my  inclination would be to take advantage of this period of quiescence to indicate that we are  vigilant, forward-looking, and responsible  Mr Chairman, I concur with your recommendation of a 25 basis  point reduction in the funds rate I think we are being preemptive and forward-looking here I  believe we should take advantage of this window of opportunity to make that change so that we  do not appear to be in a panic and reactive It will take some time before we see the effect in the  real economy  With respect to the discount rate, I think we should try to keep it at a certain level below  the current funds rate Therefore, I think a 50 basis point move would be appropriate, but I will  suspend judgment and participate in the further discussion of that issue by the Board    10/15/98 "
6266,1998-11-17," Mr Chairman, I think either option would be an improvement  over what we currently have, but I, too, have a slight preference for Option 2 mainly because I  think our discussion about risks is very internally focused On the other hand, I hope we will  decide to release the directive and, therefore, I would like something that is written in relatively  plain English In my view, Option 2 does that quite nicely With respect to the added sentence, I  will follow what I think is the emerging consensus that it be dropped, though I don't feel strongly  about that  May I speak to that point, Mr Chairman? I may be a minority of  one in thinking that your suggested revision doesn't do what we need to do Okay, I may be  speaking for others! As I read our use of the tilt, it covers a longer period than the specific  intermeeting period If we collapse the two, we will leave a false impression that we are  focusing only on the intermeeting period as opposed to indicating that we may end up adjusting  policy in a given direction over a longer period of time  That answers my particular problem  Thank you, Mr Chairman As we have already heard, there are  significant and reasonable scenarios on both sides of this discussion On the one hand, we can  believe that the most recent strength in the real economy will abate, but just slightly, and that the  economy that has surprised us on the upside time and again will continue to do so In this    11/17/98  reality, labor and households reign supreme GDP growth comes in for a soft landing without  further help from monetary policy After all, one might say, in the third quarter the economy  grew at an annual rate of 33 percent Household spending is still growing about 4 percent This  strong growth is fueled by jobs--as some have indicated, labor markets are still tight--and wage  and salary growth, and credit  In the optimistic scenario, financial markets are described as fragile but recovering  The stock market continues to defy reasonable analysis and gives added impetus to consumer  spending, and possibly to capital spending Most importantly in this optimistic scenario, Asia  already has turned the corner and Brazil avoids the worst outcomes due to timely international  intervention  For me this picture is very, very attractive, but I'm afraid that it reflects only a limited  reality I believe that growth due to labor and household consumption, which underpins the most  positive scenario, is limited Job creation does seem to have slowed considerably of late  Secondly, I note that last quarter's GDP growth was heavily fueled by inventories, which seems  unlikely to repeat Finally, in what I describe as the more pessimistic scenario, there is a great  focus on capital and capital investment Business fixed investment fell in the last quarter at  about a 1 percent annual rate, which I think is the first decline of that magnitude since 1990 or  1991; BFI admittedly was retarded by nonresidential construction, but even investment in  producers' durable equipment barely budged  More disturbingly, anecdotal and survey evidence suggests that capital spending plans  for many firms have been revised downward This slowdown reflects a realization that profits  may not be as robust as in the past Internal cash flow will not be as strong As others have  indicated, financial markets are still uncertain In any event, businesses may decide they do not    11/17/98  need to add to their capital budgets because inventories are adequate and export orders are  lagging It is this that I think brings the Greenbook home So, in this pessimistic scenario, one  would say financial markets have not yet returned to normal liquidity and risk spreads, and stock  market evaluations will soon catch up with the much changed profit outlook  Finally, the pessimistic scenario involves international concerns that have been alluded  to by others Japan, obviously the largest economy in Asia, continues to be mired in recession  Brazil's economic performance is likely to be weak I am concerned that its ability to defend  against devaluation, were that to be necessary, is limited given its reserve position Finally, as  others have indicated, China may not prove to be as strong as the current official numbers  support or suggest  So, we have these two scenarios The question is which one we believe If we believe  the optimistic one, obviously monetary policy is probably properly positioned now On the other  hand, while it is not at all a certainty, for my money the more pessimistic scenario does seem all  too possible If the domestic and international components of this scenario do come to pass, the  consequences for the US economy are dire The good news in some ways is that we do not  have to choose between these scenarios today Fortunately, by most measures, inflation is  subdued and likely to stay so Just as limitations in pricing limit corporate spending, they also  limit the risk of inflation Therefore, as I think at least one other person has said, we can afford  to buy some insurance at this time I think the premiums are manageable I think the risks of not  buying some insurance are just too great for my taste Thank you  Mr Chairman, I support both halves of your recommendation I  believe that we have achieved much of our goals from the two earlier policy easings Credit  market conditions have improved but are probably not normal Just to follow up on what  President Broaddus had to say, some may ask why we should not wait until December, given the  possibility of further improvement My answer to that question is that if we do not take this  opportunity to complete our work, we risk losing the advantage that we have now I am  concerned that if we do not act, the markets may return to their very disturbed state of a few  weeks ago That would then require us to adjust policy, perhaps by larger amounts and perhaps  again in an intermeeting move If contrary to my expectation, the easing proves to be premature,  I do think we can undo it I believe the move to symmetry is an important internal signal that we  are prepared to go either way if the facts so indicate That is why I support symmetry as well  Finally, as you have pointed out, given the direction of inflation, we perhaps have  tightened passively The tightening was appropriate earlier in the year, but I am now in favor of  the proposed easing and moving to symmetry "
6289,1998-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman In view of the unusual constellation of  real economic and financial conditions, both domestic and international, I believe the outlook for  the economy is ""murky,"" which I think is the word Mike Prell used I would say it's perhaps  even murkier than the staff presentation might suggest The data released in the last few weeks  do indicate that the economy entered the final quarter of 1998 with substantial, and I think  perhaps even surprising, forward momentum Real GDP growth was revised up for the third  quarter and the Greenbook shows that the staff forecast for the fourth quarter also has been  revised up based on early information As Governor Gramlich indicated, both the staff forecast  and broad consensus forecasts show significant abatement of this growth in the early part of  1999 with a bit of below trend growth and then returning to what is described as a soft landing  with low inflation  As others have said, and it's a view I endorse, there are numerous risks to this outlook  The downside risks are quite clear and I will not repeat all of them except to point out two One  is that Japan's economy is remarkably weak and seems to be experiencing what I can only  describe as real crowding out in which their long-term interest rates seem to be going up as the  government attempts to stimulate the economy through fiscal actions Secondly, as Vice  Chairman McDonough remarked, Europe is about to enter a very new and interesting phase that I  think is going to test their ability to have the right amount of flexibility in both monetary policy  and fiscal policy Thus far, they have shown good flexibility with respect to monetary policy,    12/22/98 47  but they may not have as much room on the fiscal side So, there are some risks because  Europe's economy seems to be slowing somewhat  While these downside risks are real, I am also concerned about the upside risks  Others have mentioned this As President Boehne indicated, the staff's scenario is plausible and  might even happen I certainly hope that it does But the economy has surprised us continuously  with the upside capabilities it has shown And next year, we are going to face a situation in  which there will be a waning impact of the dollar's appreciation and there may be some surprises  with respect to economic growth abroad And though oil prices are now low, there is a  possibility that they may turn upward, and that may undercut a bit the benefits we have had over  the last couple of years  In this world of risks on both sides--and I do believe they are balanced--I think the  current posture of monetary policy is probably about correct If the inflation forecasts prove  accurate, we can afford to adopt a wait-and-see posture We have shown that we are prepared to  move quickly and forcefully to offset downside concerns If it becomes necessary, and I don't  know that it will, I hope we can move as forcefully to offset upside risks For now, though, my  two watchwords are ""caution"" and ""vigilance"" Thank you  Mr Chairman, I, too, endorse your view of ""B"" symmetric I also  agree with Governor Rivlin that the risks are likely to be somewhat different The downside  risks, as they have over the last year, seem to have a low probability of developing but are likely  to be highly visible if they do Actually, I do slightly disagree with her I think the upside risks    12/22/98 66  are likely to sneak up on us While I don't think we will necessarily be behind the curve, I do  think it will be important to be very vigilant  I think we are, as you indicated, back to a posture very similar to  where we were earlier this year  I have a slight preference for option 2, but the consensus seems to  be going toward option 3 So, I will go with that since it does what I think we need to do With  respect to the issue of ""in coming months,"" I would retain it for the reasons that Governor Meyer  indicated I would also retain the last sentence for much the same reason The entire tone seems  to be expectations over a foreseeable period having to do with the risks and also with M2 and M3  growth    12/22/98  Mr Chairman, I support your suggestion I think we have  discovered that the markets tend to work better when there is more information as opposed to  less I think that the Committee can in fact draft the kinds of statements that are necessary and  that this will be, as you observed, an important learning experience for us "
6313,1999-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman As we start the new year, we are   clearly faced with a different situation from the one we faced last year, and we probably   will have some difficult decisions to make in the not-too-distant future Last year, our   forecast of slowing obviously was being driven by external events; now we have a   forecast that suggests slowing will be driven to a large extent by internal forces, namely   private domestic final purchases  It is obvious that just as domestic forces proved much   stronger than the drag from deteriorating net exports last year, so too the forward   momentum of the economy may prove to be stronger than the forces for domestic   slowing featured in the current forecast   As the Greenbook notes, the near term will probably reflect some unwinding of   special factors that led to the upside surprise in the fourth quarter, namely unusual   weather and an auto strike rebound Certainly there is some truth to that But the major   factor for the long-term slowing, as I read the Greenbook, appears to be a forecast that the   bull market has run its course and that the household wealth-to-income ratio will decline   I must admit that to me, as to others, the stock market does seem to be levitating above   what one might think of as reasonable levels But it is also true that we simply do not   know enough about the forces that drive the stock market to put significant weight on a   forecast that has a flat stock market as a prominent feature Therefore, it is really unclear   to me that we are going to see the slowing that we all seem to have in our forecasts The   risks seem to be mainly to the upside It is easy to determine what those risks are and   what may drive economic growth above the forecast plentiful jobs, accommodative   credit conditions, and upbeat consumers     2/2-3/99 71   The external sector was a major downside risk last year This year much of that   has been resolved with the obvious exception of Brazil Brazil is still a large and   troubling question mark, but the contagion thus far has been contained and market   reaction has been muted Most of the other issues that we were concerned about last year   seem to have resolved themselves They are reasonably well understood and probably   have already had their strongest impact on the US economy Emerging Asia seems to   have bottomed out The most credible forecast for Japan is that while it will not   strengthen in the next several years, the deterioration will be moderate from this time   forward Europe shows some slight weakening, but there are reasons to believe that   monetary policy there can offset that Therefore, despite the uncertainty created by the   Brazilian situation, we have probably seen the worst of the risks from the external sector   While citing these forces for faster growth, one must also admit that there are few   signs yet of emerging inflation The economy has achieved this benign price picture   through a combination of special factors and possibly through increasing productivity   growth However, there are some risks to the inflation outlook One is that the special   factors will unwind more quickly than we currently expect Another is that labor market   tightness will worsen at a faster pace than businesses can offset It is not only that the   unemployment rate is at a generation low, we also have fewer excess reserves, if you   will, in the labor market The number of people of working age who are not in the labor   force but want a job has been decreasing at a fairly steady pace and is now at its lowest   level since 1970, when that statistic first began to be tracked   Given the string of surprises we have had, including the strength of the fourth   quarter, like many others here I approach a forecast of slowing with some skepticism and   see the risks both internationally and perhaps even domestically as shaded slightly to the   upside compared to the baseline forecast I think the appropriate response for us is to rely   less on a future as predicted by models and more on inferences, both quantitative and   qualitative, that come in with the latest data Obviously, for those of us who take this   approach there are some challenges By necessity we are likely to have a shorter time   frame for action However, the corollary is that once the evidence is more clearly in   hand, we should not hesitate to move decisively if the data so warrant We are not   precluded from acting preemptively if new information were to tip the balance of risks to     2/2-3/99 72   the outlook much more decisively toward an unacceptable probability of higher inflation   Such a probability, if it were to emerge, would in my judgment warrant a policy response   We are not there yet in my view, but we may be soon We must be careful not to   misinterpret the signals that we receive   I am struck as I look at Chart 4 that we are being asked to   make an either/or decision That is, we have to think either that the NAIRU has dropped   or that adverse price shocks are going to hit us Is there no simulation that actually   suggests some of both--that the NAIRU may indeed be below 53 percent, and perhaps at   4½ percent, but also that these other special factors have been hitting us?  It strikes me   that that does not necessarily end up being your baseline because your baseline has a   somewhat different set of assumptions in it  Even though I understand what Bob McTeer   had to say about believing your own lying eyes in some sense, is there a simulation that   does a little of both?  I’m sure that is doable, but is there one that has been done?   Okay   Let me ask one other thing on the locking-in point Ned was   going back to Chart 13, but doesn’t the bottom panel of Chart 4 get to the issue of the   long term?  That strikes me as suggesting that even if one believes the NAIRU has   dropped to the 4½ percent you have assumed there, we will end up in the long run with a   PCE excluding food and energy of about 2 percent I think that goes back to Bob Parry’s   question   Okay, thank you   Mr Chairman, I support both halves of your   recommendation I also want to comment a bit on the strategy, which I strongly endorse   As I said yesterday, in periods when models do not seem to be working very well--and     2/2-3/99 114   we seem to be in one of those periods--I think it is quite important to weigh the incoming   data more heavily To some extent that is what you were suggesting That doesn’t mean   that our hands are tied in any sense It does mean that once the data become clearer, we   should be prepared to move And I sense that that is where we are   I’d say one other thing You put some emphasis, appropriately, on productivity   But we are aware that productivity is quite cyclically related, and I’m not sure we have   parsed out those cyclical differences well enough yet There may be some studies of the   data that do that One of the things we have to continue to look at is the degree to which   we can pull apart the cyclical components from the underlying changes in productivity   I also would agree with President Stern’s point with respect to NAIRU It has   never been measured very accurately, and I’m not sure it is going to be measured any   more accurately in the future It is an interesting concept, but we should not put too   much weight on it for policy purposes  "
6341,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I was preparing for today’s   meeting, I was thinking about what has changed in the economy that might require a   change in the stance of monetary policy I came to the conclusion--similar to what others   have expressed--that a great deal has happened but in some ways very little has changed   With respect to what has happened, the economy to date obviously gives little   evidence of a domestic demand-driven slowdown Personal consumption and business   investment spending are both quite robust I suppose this should not be surprising given   the strength in employment and the relative ease of access to credit for both consumers   and businesses Secondly, as Gary Stern commented, the international economic outlook,   though far from settled, seems a lot better than it has been at almost any time in the last   eighteen months or so Developing Asia is healing I was interested to note just   yesterday that short-term interest rates in Korea and Thailand are both lower than they   were at the start of the crisis, while their currencies have not in any sense gone down In   fact, they have stabilized and gone up some   Moreover, contagion from Brazil continues to be quite mild with respect to   most countries, Argentina being a major exception And Europe, while softening, clearly   has some room for further monetary response I suspect and would not be surprised to   see that occur Japan obviously is a question mark It is facing a daunting set of very   unattractive policy alternatives, but it does at this stage seem to be bouncing along a   relatively shallow bottom and probably will continue to do so for the foreseeable future   I will not deny that there are some risks there, but exactly how things are going to turn   out is not yet clear The third thing that has happened since we last met is that inflation   seems to be doing something of a disappearing act It is a bit like that cat in the musical     3/30/99 36   “Cats” who, when the case is solved, is not there Inflation seems to have disappeared, at   least currently and as far as one can see in the pipeline   One thing that has not changed very much is the contour of the Greenbook   forecast But I suspect, as with other forecasts, that we will take that with a grain of salt   Therefore, given the constellation of incoming data and the uncertainty we all have at   this stage with respect to our models, I believe that growth is likely to be greater than   forecast There is a possibility that the special factors that have held down inflation may   start to unwind, but that may well occur in the context of an uptick in trend productivity   growth   Therefore, while I can imagine some reason to unwind a portion of the   insurance that we took out last year, I think at this stage “steady as she goes” is probably   the better policy approach Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman I support both halves of your   recommendation I think we are struggling with an important issue Do we act based on   forecasts or do we, as Don Kohn said in his statement, look for evidence in the incoming   data? In part the challenge is that since the forecasts have been inaccurate, we are forced   to look more and more at the incoming data As you indicate, the incoming data do not   show even the earliest buildup of inflation If they did, we should act In some sense   what we are trying to understand in this economy is What is its maximum sustainable   growth? We aren’t really sure So, since there is very little pressure on inflation now or   in the pipeline, and since we haven’t in any sense prepared the markets for a policy move   in a way that would avoid an adverse market reaction--including a move to asymmetry   which, if we made one, I think we should announce--I believe the more prudent action at   this stage is to wait and see  "
6364,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, like others, have come to   recognize that the forecast outcome is quite desirable, but I think the risks are really to   the upside A number of people have already talked about the CPI I agree with Mike   Prell in that the latest CPI number does not to me indicate that the day of reckoning has   arrived If one looks at the details, besides apparel, owners equivalent rent, lodging away   from home, and airfares seem to be the drivers, along with the category called “other   services” None of those is unimportant, but on the other hand they don’t necessarily   suggest that inflation--or if you will, the wolf--is at the door   To go to another view, there are some straws in the wind that I think we do   have to be focused on First obviously, as Governor Gramlich has indicated, almost   regardless of what one thinks the NAIRU is, it is probably somewhat higher than 42   percent Therefore, one should expect some increase in labor costs at some point The   most recent ECI would not bear that out, but that index was obviously driven in part by   the fact that commissions and bonuses turned down, perhaps because of a slowing in   some of the underlying activities On the other hand, a complementary measure, the   NIPA measure, showed quite an increase in labor costs, and I don’t think we can   necessarily reject that That is at least one of the cautionary flags that labor costs may be   rising   The other thing that one might look at, of course, is the aggregates; a few   others have talked about the behavior of the money supply I was looking at commercial   bank credit, which showed strong loan growth across the board in the fourth quarter of   last year and continuing, though somewhat abating, growth in the first quarter of this   year There clearly seems to be a great deal of demand for credit out there and, indeed it   turns out, a great deal of availability of credit   If one looks to the international side, I also think some of the risks that we have   been most concerned about have abated The fat tail that we were concerned about at the   end of last year has become a lot thinner I agree fully with the Vice Chairman’s   comment that the difficulties abroad certainly are not over yet All things have not settled   down internationally, but a start has been made If one looks at the stripped Brady bond   yield, there is some indication, at least from the markets, that they expect some   turnaround in that area     5/18/99 48   One might also look at import prices and at the BLS indicators All suggest,   particularly industrial supplies and capital goods, that the decline in import prices has   bottomed out It is a forecast in some cases, but I think it’s a reality as well So that is   another one of these trends President Minehan and others have talked about increases in   the prices of a number of different commodities Indeed, if one looks at spot prices, those   are pushing in the same direction   I strongly agree with the comments that the Vice Chairman made I don’t   think it is our job to lean against growth; I don’t think it is our job to stop the creation of   jobs or the creation of wealth necessarily But I believe that we do have to be concerned   about how nominal GDP is split between solid, sustainable growth versus inflation And   my concerns now are that the risks are moving a little more to the inflationary side   That’s a fair point   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, like others, support your   recommendation for a publicly announced tilt toward tightening I believe the risks,   supported by some very early signs in the data, are sufficient for us to change at least our   tilt In my view publicly announcing the tilt will give us sufficient room to move if the   cost pressures do emerge, but they are not, as you observed, yet evident That doesn’t   mean that we should wait until they become full-fledged inflationary pressures, but I do   think we have a little more time   As others have indicated, the markets have already priced in some of this   policy tightening, so we need not be concerned about an outsized reaction on their part,   although there may be some as Don Kohn has indicated Like others here, I would be   concerned that if we don’t move to asymmetry and announce it now, there might be an   undesirable reaction in both the equity and the fixed income markets Also, I believe not   changing the tilt would, in fact, be viewed as an indication that we are not being vigilant   to early inflationary signs and that might lead to some small erosion in our credibility   For all these reasons, I support your recommendation  "
6386,1999-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the obvious question   we’ve all been addressing or attempting to address in our own ways is What has changed   since the last meeting?  In some sense I think not much has changed since then The   incoming data continue to point to vigorous growth, which may well be above trend and   therefore is of some concern, I think, to everybody around the table Consumers are   clearly the major engine for this growth, as the recent personal income and consumption   data amply indicate And while PCE growth may slow at some point, it is not slowing   yet   The other side of this, as we all know, is that labor markets continue to be tight   The unemployment rate has been at 42 or 43 percent for three or four quarters now   That is starting perhaps, and I say perhaps, to spill over into compensation  Mike Prell’s   chart number 5 indicates that average hourly earnings of production workers decelerated   a bit over the last twelve months compared to the previous twelve months But if one   looks more closely at the last three months--that is, the early part of this year--average     6/29-30/99 56   hourly earnings seem to be picking up again to somewhere in the 4 percent range This   obviously puts into stark relief the importance of ongoing improvements in productivity   There is continuing evidence that businesses are investing heavily in productivity-  enhancing technologies The recent shipments and orders data for communications   equipment remain on a steep uptrend, as do the orders and shipments of office and   computer equipment The major issue, obviously, is whether or not this capital   deepening will translate into further increases in the rate of productivity growth On this   issue I think there’s anecdotal evidence on both sides, but the jury is out   Against this backdrop of ongoing labor market tightness, there are a couple of   conditions that may have changed Here I’ll say nothing new but I will reiterate what   others have said One change, obviously, is that the international environment is not as   threatening as it has been for much of the last eighteen months The staff forecast clearly   shows some uptick More importantly, in April our exports posted the first gain in six   months Two industries where weak foreign demand has depressed shipments-­  construction machinery and metal working machinery--both posted sizable increases in   May We’ve already talked a bit about commodity prices, so I will simply echo the view   that it seems as though commodity prices have bottomed out; the evidence is broader than   just the oil side of it   Another perspective that I consider important is to look at how interest-sensitive   sectors of the economy are behaving Purchases of durable goods posted some healthy   gains in May I think the housing market is showing us a little of both strength and   weakness here The information in front of us indicates that sales of new homes and   similarly sales of existing homes fell in May But if one looks at more timely measures,   such as builders’ ratings of new home sales or applications for home mortgages, those   have risen from April through June So in addition to the auto sales that Governor Kelley   referred to, there’s some evidence of strength in other interest-sensitive sectors   As Vice Chairman McDonough indicated, however, we’re not here to slow   growth Nor are we here to destroy jobs or to destroy wealth We should be looking for   the earliest signs of inflation We had a bit of a surprise in the CPI number for April, but   I think we were wise not to put too much weight on that; as the subsequent numbers   indicated, perhaps some of what we saw in April was a bit of a fluke The early     6/29-30/99 57   indicators of inflation are very hazy but all point in the same direction I’ve talked about   commodity prices and average hourly earnings In addition, Mike Prell brought to our   attention the PPI for intermediate materials, which moved up in March, April, and May-­  three upticks after declines in that index in each of the 10 previous months There are a   number of anecdotal stories about faster increases in prices and wages, as we’ve heard   around the table When I put all this together, it does seem to me prudent to take out a   little insurance--to use that phrase--but not to react more strongly than the incoming   information warrants We can debate whether or not we see a wolf or a wolf in sheep’s   or dog’s clothing or even the family dog, whichever it may be But speaking of clothing,   even in a balmy June it’s important that the emperor not be seen in public without clothes   whatsoever! [Laughter]   Me too!   I as well [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, support your   recommendation for a 25 basis point tightening at this stage We are in a period of some   uncertainty and we should weigh the data a little more heavily than the forecast I think   the data support a small move The forecast, with a 50 basis point increase built in, is   perhaps indicative of the need for a further move, but it’s not mandatory today based on   what we know I think there is also some evidence that because of the high wealth-to-  income ratio and also a larger share of imports in GDP that we may have a more   powerful tool here than we thought That is something Alice Rivlin raised when she was   sitting in that seat a few meetings ago   As to the question of the tilt, I have a slight preference for maintaining the   asymmetric tilt I’m concerned that if we raise rates and go to symmetry and then put out   a somewhat hawkish message saying we’re still leaning in that direction, we will create   more rather than less of a tendency to psychoanalyze what the 17 or 18 of us are thinking   Frankly, in my ideal world what we would have is a decision, a tilt announcement, and   complete silence from the Committee We are not going to get there, but I think we at   least ought to continue the process of trying to help markets understand what these tilts   do or do not mean I’m concerned about creating another tool in the form of a well   crafted legal/economic document that will give the market something else to chew over   This is obviously not a strong point of view, and if we go to symmetry with a well-crafted   announcement by Don Kohn, I will applaud Don’s efforts and try to get him something   for his gray hair! But I don’t think that’s the better way to deal with the situation at this   stage  "
6409,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that the questions   before us today are both factual and tactical At a factual level, I believe the issue is   whether or not we really are facing an end to the good news on inflation There are certainly   some reasons, based on the data, to believe that that may be the case Over the past 12   months the core CPI has gone up about 21 percent, which is certainly moderate by anyone’s   measurement But the annual rate of change in the core CPI has moved up from a little   under 1 percent in Q1 of 1999 to about 23 or 24 percent in Q2 of 1999 More significantly,   there may be some potential signs of early inflation, so-called pipeline inflation, in the most   recent PPI But without putting too much weight on that, in the context of strengthening   growth overseas, a commensurate weakening of the US dollar, expected strength in   exports, and a likely rise in both oil and nonoil import prices, I think we can well expect a   further firming tendency in US prices Obviously, this is against the backdrop of labor   markets that are tight by anyone’s estimation Whether or not they are below one’s estimate   of NAIRU is less relevant than the fact that we have seen already some uptick in hourly   compensation figures   As Karen Johnson has already indicated, we are in a period of unusual asynchronous   global growth patterns that have arguably allowed us to enjoy a very benign growth and   pricing picture At the end of this asynchronous period I think we will also see an end to   some of the factors that have allowed us to enjoy benefits of excess capacity and slack     8/24/99 68   demand from overseas That will put a further spotlight on the question of growing   productivity here in the United States Unfortunately, just when the importance of that   factor has become a little clearer to us, the data have become a lot less clear--particularly the   issue of measuring the economy from the product side versus the income side, which I   suspect we’ll come back to during the course of the year   Against the background of this factual uncertainty, I think we’re faced with a very   important tactical question From my perspective there are some risks to the forecast One,   for sure, is that it depends at least in part on a waning of wealth effects And we know from   experience that calling for a slowing of the equity markets has proven to be a triumph of   hope over experience Secondly, we also see in this forecast some expectation that the   desired level of inventories in the private sector, or expectations regarding the relationship   between inventories and projected sales, may have changed a bit I think that may be true   because of some structural changes But we also have to be mindful that in the year 2000   we may see some other forces that cause inventories to be higher than perhaps businesses   would otherwise like to have   Finally, from a tactical standpoint we have to be mindful of the fact that we are in an   unusual period Year 2000 fears do make markets skittish And if the general inclination of   the Committee is that we want to firm a bit as an insurance policy if you will, I suggest we   do so sooner rather than later Whenever we are in the process of raising rates, even by a   small amount, we are about as popular as a skunk at an outdoor wedding reception But if   that is the case, I think we should do a little defensive spraying--at least for the bride and her   mother   We are at least outdoors!   I have to endorse what Governor Gramlich said on all counts  "
6431,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I said at our last meeting, and a number   of people have said again at this meeting, we are clearly faced with the issue of whether or not   inflation has reached an inflection point Or to put it another way, we have to decide whether or   not aggregate supply and demand are out of balance or becoming out of balance Many people   around the table have cited arguments that suggest inflation is reaching an inflection point Those   tend to focus on two things One is that we have tight labor markets, which is normally a precursor   to some inflationary pressures The other is that some of the short-term factors that have held   inflation at bay appear to be weakening Among those are that foreign economies, which have   given us the benefit of some of their excess capacity, are generally strengthening and that the   dollar, whose strength has kept import prices low, appears to be weakening  All of this is occurring   against a backdrop of what is clearly a very strong domestic economy and one in which many   interest-sensitive sectors clearly are showing some strength   However, there are some strong counter-arguments to this view One is that there has been   capital deepening, which is continuing We aren’t sure when the run of productivity growth that   we’ve benefited from thus far is going to come to an end The second counter-argument--and there   are weaknesses in it--is that we’ve had an unemployment rate below 45 percent for most of this   year and some of last year and wage demands have not been excessive We have some new   evidence that wage demands may have changed in some of the union bargaining situations On the   other hand, we’re not yet sure if that is going to flow over into pricing or is simply going to be a   case in which dividends will not be as attractive as they have been With respect to the rest of the   world, it’s certainly true that many economies seem to be healing But Japan, I think, still has a   way to go, and its recovery depends very much on the ability of its government to borrow and   spend And in some Southeast Asian economies the fundamentals certainly aren’t very strong     10/5/99 37   Finally, as a few people have noted, long-term interest rates have indeed trended up Now, one   might argue that they’ve trended up but have had no impact, or very little impact, thus far   Putting all of this together, the risks do seem slightly out of balance On the other hand, we   should be mindful of the fact that there are many things we don’t know and that our models have   been inaccurate for quite a while So I do think we are faced with a very tough choice later today   But at this stage it seems to me that the risks are slightly skewed to the upside   Thank you First, let me say that with respect to your overall   recommendation, I think you’re right on “B” and on some indication of asymmetry I would join   with Governor Meyer in saying--and this goes back to a staff paper that came out earlier--that if in   fact productivity isn’t picking up, then we clearly want to tighten to bring supply and demand   closer into balance If it turns out that productivity in the second derivative sense is continuing to   grow, as Governor Meyer said and as I think the staff paper also indicated earlier, that is consistent   with a higher equilibrium rate of interest So in a sense, as hard as the decision is, in some ways   it’s an easy decision   On the communications issue, let me first tell the Committee what the working group talked   about yesterday because we asked ourselves what we should do in the interim before we complete   our task We started with the thought that perhaps we should simply no longer vote on symmetry   or asymmetry But then we were concerned that we would be doing two things (1) prejudging an   outcome and (2) putting us in a position where we hadn’t really thought through the implications   We would be rushing through something and we wouldn’t be sure how to communicate it and so   forth Other members of the working group can speak to this, but I think we were most   uncomfortable with your third option--announcing that we’re thinking about this and therefore   aren’t voting on symmetry or asymmetry     10/5/99 57   As to my personal preference, I would be inclined to go in the direction that Governor   Meyer indicated, which is to be quite clear that we’ve voted for a bias toward asymmetry If the   consensus is that we don’t want to announce the asymmetry but let words about the balance of risks   cover it, then I would be supportive of that My reason is that, as I think about what happened   when we first went down this path, the market reaction to our announcing the asymmetry was not   particularly jarring On the other hand, the market reaction to a number of statements that occurred   afterwards started to get more jarring So I think we should learn the lesson accurately It was not   being transparent that was the issue It was much more, for lack of better words, a case of needing   a bit of discipline So I think we could manage an asymmetry announcement if we are a   disciplined Committee I have a slight preference for doing that because I know--or maybe I   should say I assume--we will continue to be disciplined Thank you   We can do it   I think we can probably report by the next meeting  "
6454,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting I think many of us   were willing to take a patient but vigilant attitude, recognizing that a great deal of data would   become available during the intermeeting period Now those data have become available and we   seem to be faced with a choice between what I’ll describe as policy optimism and policy caution   On the optimistic side, the most recent NIPA revisions do give a reason to believe that   productivity trends have continued to rise Capital deepening, I gather, is probably the source of   this positive outcome as outlays for equipment and software have been extremely strong While     11/16/99 37   the staff’s new estimate for trend labor productivity growth must be approached with some   caution, I do note that a number of private sector forecasters also have revised upward their   estimates over the last year or so I think we should be open to the possibility that the staff,   though perhaps ahead of others, may have gotten it right   However, policy caution also sets in when one recognizes that even if the speed limit   is somewhat higher, the economy is still at this stage exceeding that limit at a time when labor   markets are already stretched thin While there is evidence of some slowing in housing and, as   others have indicated, in other sectors as well, overall third-quarter GDP barreled ahead at an   estimated annual rate of 48 percent that will probably be revised up And the outlook, according   both to Board staff and private forecasters, is for continued very strong growth that at this stage   is probably above trend and may be slowing only gradually to trend   The major new factors that emerged during the period and that are a source of some   concern I think are both domestic and international Domestically, the pattern of tight labor   markets continues and if anything those markets have tightened even further Unemployment,   which had been stable at around the 4¼ percent level or maybe a little lower, has clearly ticked   down again At the same time, the percent of the population not in the labor force who want jobs   also has declined The labor force participation rate has remained in a tight range around 67   percent since March 1998, which is quite unusual I think in such a strong economy That   suggests that perhaps the supply of available workers is indeed nearly exhausted, and this is   occurring just as aggregate hours data show a continuing uptrend So even if the productivity   trend is somewhat higher, I think there is a real risk that sooner rather than later wage demands   may try to catch up with productivity increases   Now, the tautness in the labor market is continuing just as the strength of the rest of   the world is becoming a little clearer Karen Johnson is right to caution us that there are still   some risks that there could be policy mistakes in some places Japan is certainly a question But   overall, I believe it’s more likely that global healing is actually becoming a bit of a global   recovery which, as someone said earlier, is taking away one of the safety valves that could   prevent a potential overheating of the US economy In fact, that global recovery may be adding   a bit more fuel to the fire I think exports have probably turned the corner and will, I believe,   continue to press on domestic resource utilization Real exports grew at an annual rate of about   124 percent in the third quarter, which is about three times the pace of the previous quarter     11/16/99 38   And the final component, which Mike Prell alluded to in his remarks, is that the IP   picture seems to be showing strength throughout the economy So in a world of stronger global   markets and increased industrial activity at home, I think we are seeing a bit of an impact,   including some early signs of bottlenecks Bob Parry alluded to the Purchasing Managers’   survey, which did in fact show for both prices paid and for delivery times the worst relative   performance in several years--since May of 1995, I believe And while Bob is right to suggest   that one survey does not necessarily present us with a smoking gun, I don’t think it’s appropriate   to ignore bullets being put into the gun, if that’s what is happening   So taken altogether, it appears that we have a tightening labor market, a firming of   industrial and external conditions, and perhaps some early signs of emerging bottlenecks And I   think the risk, if anything, is skewed even more strongly to the upside So, in my view the   choice between caution and optimism is becoming even more stark   Mr Chairman, I can support both halves of your recommendation   Let me say just one thing about the symmetry In a strategic sense I think it’s exactly the right     11/16/99 55   place to be because I do think, for reasons that you and others have outlined, that there is a great   deal of uncertainty about where policy is going to go next year And I would prefer not to build   in momentum in policy inadvertently by adopting asymmetric language that may have the effect   of tying our hands I think we really need to wait and look at incoming data, and I think   symmetry is the right approach at this stage   Let me associate myself with Mike Kelley’s and Ed Boehne’s   comments As you all know, I’ve been working hard with many of you to think about how we   can best do this [Laughter]     11/16/99 59   And this is not how to do it! In a more substantive way, I’ve read   this four or five times as people have commented on it, and without question there are words that   one could change The reality is that if we all try to change those words, we’d end up with   gobbledygook What we have now is a message that is clear We might not like every word, but   it generally reflects what I heard as we went around the table In particular with respect to the   symmetry issue, all it says is that we are going to focus over the near term on being symmetric   To my mind that doesn’t say it’s all over So I think both in terms of process and in terms of   substance, we as a Committee are much better off leaving this statement pretty much as it is   rather than trying to change it Perhaps the Chairman will want to edit it slightly here or there,   but I would be very cautious going down the path on which we seem to be headed I’ve spent   the last intermeeting period trying to think about a way to do this and this is not the way to do it   If you don’t mind, why don’t we get going even though we still   have some food to eat Let me start by saying that what we would like to discuss in this part of   the meeting is the reaction of the entire Committee to the November 10th memo that came from   me I signed that memo on behalf of the whole Working Group on the Directive and Disclosure   Policy and it reflects a number of points of consensus in that group There are a few points on   which there were slight divergences within the Working Group itself, but on those points the   memo may reflect broadly the views of the Committee as a whole   Let me explain what I would like to try to do As the Chairman indicated, this will be   the first chance we have to discuss these issues but not the last So we should not necessarily   look toward trying to reach a formal vote or anything of that sort today This is simply the first   opportunity for the whole Committee to look at what your Working Group has done and give us   some feedback   Secondly, there are some elements in here where we have draft language and, if   possible, I would prefer not to focus on the details of the wording just yet Let’s try to keep the   conversation on a conceptual level for now   Thirdly, we have a number of points of agreement and then a few points on which   there was not clear agreement among the members of the Working Group It would be helpful if   you would just give a general sense of your views on points 1 through 9 where there is   agreement But then if you will focus a bit more on the comments about the wording of the   sentences for symmetry or asymmetry, which starts on page 4 of the memo, that would be useful   Again, I’m not talking about the specific wording but the two concepts laid out   With that preamble, let me tell you where the consensus did emerge I think there is a   strong consensus in the Working Group that there be an immediate announcement after every   FOMC meeting, even if it’s rather perfunctory That announcement would convey the   Committee’s basic thinking and would include some expression about our views going forward;   symmetry/asymmetry is the shorthand we’re using here Secondly, there was a strong consensus   that the FOMC should at every meeting vote on both the intended fed funds rate and the   symmetry or asymmetry, which is exactly what we do today So, those points involve   maintaining the status quo The third point of agreement was that the operating paragraph should   no longer contain any sentence referring to the Committee’s consensus about symmetry or     11/16/99 63   asymmetry The theory in that case was that the operating paragraph is really meant to direct the   Desk and its behavior during the intermeeting period; there is nothing specific in the   symmetry/asymmetry that is a clear directive to the Desk, though it may provide context   The fourth point on which general consensus was reached, as of this meeting of the   Working Group anyway, was that after the FOMC’s vote a draft copy of the announcement   would be passed out to the governors and presidents, with an opportunity for them to offer   substantive reactions That is where we came out We did decide that we should not pass out   any draft announcements prior to the vote The concern was that the focus of the vote on policy   would then be much more heavily weighted to the draft words as opposed to the actual substance   of policy And it seemed as though the focus of the voting should be policy and not the draft   wording   The sixth point on which I think there was agreement was that the directive should be   shortened to eliminate any backward-looking material describing recent developments The   seventh issue on which we reached agreement was that the directive should continue to be   released on the Thursday after the next FOMC meeting and not earlier And I will tie that in   with number eight, which is that the minutes should also continue to be released on the Thursday   after the next FOMC meeting and not earlier The rationale there, just to be very clear, was   twofold One is just that the process of producing the minutes is time consuming, which makes   it very difficult actually to get the minutes out much earlier than we do now Secondly, I think   there was a strong sense in our group that the Committee should speak once during a meeting   cycle, not twice, and thereby avoid having the Committee be too actively engaged, if you will, in   market deliberations during the periods between meetings   The ninth point of agreement was that there should be a clearer way of describing the   Chairman’s latitude to make intermeeting moves The theory we had, after discussing this with   Virgil Mattingly, was that there was some language that the Committee could adopt in its   organizing meeting in late January-early February every year that would clearly outline what the   Chairman’s latitude is for making intermeeting policy moves The reason this becomes   important is that a number of people had looked to the symmetry or asymmetry of the language   as giving some guidance and latitude for the Chairman to act on behalf of the Committee, and we   thought it was better to be clear about that authority Again, there is some suggested wording in   the memo     11/16/99 64   Now, the area where there was slight disagreement within the Working Group was on   how to describe our view of things going forward, if you will Just to remind you, the current   approach that we discussed after our vote today involves issuing a statement that effectively talks   about potential adjustments of policy during the intermeeting period I think most, but not all,   people in the group seemed to feel that that is probably not a good approach, though there are   arguments that perhaps it’s not so bad But within the Working Group we came up with two   alternatives   One approach, and I’d like to focus on it at the conceptual level as opposed to the   wording, is to try to get the forward-looking elements much more focused on what we have   described as the balance of risks The thinking behind that concept was that what the market   really needs to know is what the Committee’s concerns are or the risks that the Committee sees   and what it will be looking at in the intermeeting period but without necessarily jumping to   policy implications   The second approach was that in fact we should proceed further and include a   reference to the policy implications The thought behind this concept was that to do anything   other than that is to stop without addressing the obvious question of “so what?”  The policy   implication is an issue we should speak to directly Those issues are outlined on pages 4 and 5 of   the memo   Now, with that perhaps too long introduction, what I’d like to do is to go around the   table in the usual fashion and get reactions to the memo, since I know you have all read it On   the points where there is consensus in our Working Group if you have a strong reason to   disagree, that’s fine, please so indicate that But more importantly, indicate whether your   general preference is toward having the forward-looking elements of our announcements tied   more to providing a sense of the balance of risks or whether you would prefer something similar   to the current symmetry/asymmetry approach, which addresses possible adjustments in policy   more explicitly Those are the issues on which the Working Group needs some guidance   Let me mention one other process issue We will take your guidance, obviously, and   then go back and try to craft the appropriate wording We have some draft language in the   memo, but I don’t want this discussion to become too heavily focused on the specific words we   used, since we have plenty of time to continue to work on the wording But if we can get     11/16/99 65   guidance from you on whether or not we’ve generally got the consensus right and how you   would handle the future-looking element, that would be most helpful   Yes, we have seven   I think that’s absolutely fine Why don’t we start with the one   who is closest to me, Mike Kelley, and then we’ll go around the table to the others   Okay Larry Meyer   Bill Poole   Mike Moskow   Bob Parry   As you can see, this was a well-managed group!   Ned Gramlich   I was more comfortable with alternative I as well for the reasons   that Ned Gramlich has articulated I think there is a distinction between talking about potential   unfolding macroeconomic developments and trying to link that too tightly to a certainty about   them and, therefore, the policy reaction The experience we’ve had before suggests that markets   often, or at least occasionally, are prone to over-interpret where we are And I would like to give   them fewer words, if you will, with which to do that and, as Ned said, move the finger just a little   bit away from the trigger even though it’s not completely away I think, as Larry has pointed   out, that that movement away from the trigger is very helpful So we ended up with a preference   for alternative I by a margin of 4 to 3 I will say that as we did this many people said they could   live with alternative I Again, with regard to Ned’s point about the group not being as divided as   it might seem, our views weren’t held with such a hard and fast force that individuals could   never see moving to another option So, that’s where we were   Yes   I think the proposal on the table is that one of those three   statements will definitely be made after each meeting There may be a bit of additional prose if   we feel there should be more explanation as to why we voted in a certain way But in terms of   how we view the future, the intention of this working group was that that one sentence would   handle the vast majority of the future statements Now, we did have one experience, which I   think drove us a bit That was in our October meeting when we adopted asymmetry and had a   follow-up sentence that suggested a bit of a time frame There was a sense in our Working   Group that if things were very closely balanced then we might need a follow-up sentence, and   that’s always an option But the expectation would be that this sentence would carry most of the   information on how we might weigh future developments It was our hope--I don’t know if we   can achieve this or not--that we would end up with a situation in which markets are less focused   on future policy decisions and much more focused on the existing policy decision   Are there any other perspectives from those on the Working   Group?  I guess we will do this in the usual way, with a go-around Jerry Jordan   Al Broaddus   You are an optimistic man! Cathy Minehan   Ed Boehne, you were next     11/16/99 73   I was actually pointing in the General Counsel’s direction I think   it is important for everyone to know that the language proposed is Virgil Mattingly’s language   He can continue to work at it, if you think that’s appropriate   I think Tom Hoenig was next   Gary Stern, I have you next on the list     11/16/99 75   Jack Guynn   Bob McTeer is next   Bill McDonough   No, what it says is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   will consult with you   This draft says the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   This would be voted on every year as well The point is that both   would be voted on annually   Yes, after we have decided that This is written with the current   status quo in mind, but if we voted to select a different Bank, then we would make a conforming   amendment in the Authorization Bill, did you have a perspective on alternative I versus   alternative II?   I think Larry Meyer had another comment     11/16/99 77   Let me say a couple of things First, there is no intention to   change our standard procedure And when it comes time to adopt something like this language, I   think the minutes should reflect that this is not intended to expand or contract the authority the     11/16/99 78   Chairman normally has Secondly, Virgil and others can look at this again and see if we can put   more words around it to make sure it truly reflects the sense of the discussion here   Let me tell you where I think we have come out and what I would like the Working   Group to do I have a sense that there was general agreement, since I heard very few exceptions,   on the consensus points reached by our Working Group So I will assume that we will keep   those on the table as they are I did hear some questions or suggestions--though not significant   changes--on the language with respect to the Chairman’s latitude Virgil is here and he heard the   comments too, so we can continue to work on that But I think the sense of the discussion was   that we don’t want to expand or contract the Chairman’s authority and that we do want to keep   the consultative process involved We know we are looking for some consistency of   interpretation And the final thing was to make sure that we have some sense of this being the   exception and not the norm; in no sense are we are encouraging the Chairman to do things that   currently are not encouraged   On the issue of how we talk about the future--for which we will use the shorthand   “symmetry/asymmetry”--while a few people preferred alternative II, the vast majority seemed to   prefer alternative I Therefore, I would like the Working Group to go back and try to continue to   polish those words and then present them to this Committee Depending on how quickly we can   do that, we will distribute another memo, hopefully in the upcoming intermeeting interval, with   the expectation that at the next meeting the FOMC will make a formal decision to adopt the   recommendations of the Working Group That would include a decision on the language, with   the focus on alternative I as the general direction I think that’s where we are  "
6478,1999-12-21," I move that we approve the SOMA Examination Report   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think we are entering a period, as   others have said, that is going to be somewhat challenging for us In the short run, we   clearly do not want to destabilize markets as we go into the Y2K period One always hates   to see a marathon runner trip up at the end, and we certainly don’t want to be the person   from the stands who runs out and trips that runner up In the longer run, obviously, as   others have indicated, we don’t want to lose our ongoing battle with inflation expectations   and inflation, or risk any damage to our own credibility   During the intermeeting period, which has been short, we have received a variety of   data, some benign and some more troubling On the benign side, the latest reports do show   that the rate of increase in core inflation has moderated even a bit more from that   experienced over the previous 12-month period Additionally, productivity seems to have   ticked up again and growth in unit labor costs seems to be, if anything, slowing as opposed   to picking up All of this is, as others have admitted, somewhat puzzling   On the more troubling side, there are clearly growing signs of imbalances in our   economy Others have touched on a number of them I will emphasize just one, which is     12/21/99 38   the large and growing external deficit, a development I view as a sign of imbalance As   Karen Johnson indicated, there is a significant possibility that we will see interactions as a   number of economies start to grow simultaneously While our external balance will, I think,   tend to be redressed as foreign economies return to health, there will be an increased   demand for our exports, which might not be totally welcome from a price stability   standpoint Indeed, taking account of likely Y2K impacts, foreign demand for our goods   does appear to be increasing already As this happens, we can obviously expect some   upward pressure on resource utilization, not just in labor markets but also in terms of   capacity utilization And I think the recent uptick in the latter measure may be just a   precursor   While I recognize that there are some uncertainties in these international forecasts, I   do think the risks internationally are more on the upside than the downside Clearly, there   are some difficulties in Japan But it is instructive to note that comments by individual   members of the Monetary Policy Committee of Japan and the most recent monthly   economic report coming out of Japan both seem to have a much firmer tone to them than   had been the case even a month or two ago Certainly the European economies seem to be   firming There is a possibility that they may start to enjoy some of the productivity   surprises that we’ve experienced, but that is not entirely certain   So, given this changing configuration, I think we would be well served to extend our   cautious and prudent approach to policy We should continue to recognize the benign   effects of productivity improvements on unit cost structures, but we also should not be   afraid to act in a well-modulated fashion in order to maintain our hard fought victory over   inflation and also our credibility Thank you very much   Like everyone else, I think I could live with either I have a   slight preference for the symmetric one because in my mind it really does put the horse   before the cart in that it says quite clearly that first we have the rollover to the year 2000 and   then we have next year And I think it’s important to keep reinforcing that sense of priority   of getting into the year 2000 and focusing then on the next move   Thank you, Mr Chairman I’d like to refer to the memo that I   sent to the Committee dated December 17, 1999 Let me start by simply reviewing the state   of play, if you will   At our last meeting the principal issues we discussed related to whether or not we   wanted to do two things (1) change the directive language used to describe the   Committee’s assessment of prospective developments; and (2) define more precisely the   Chairman’s latitude for making an intermeeting move On the first point, the issue was   whether we wanted to move more toward language about the balance of risks to describe the   Committee’s view of the future and move away from what we call “symmetry/asymmetry”   today And the consensus, though there were objecting points of view, was that we did want   to make that move You sent your Working Group back to consider that language in a more   detailed way, and revised language is now in this memo starting on page 5 That is one   point that we need to discuss further   The second thing you asked the Working Group to do was to consider how best to   express the Chairman’s latitude for an intermeeting move We took a look at the language   that we had suggested and made some slight adjustments That is on page 5, section B   A third question emerged, involving a couple of other recommendations from Cathy   Minehan on how to handle the directive wording That is on page 6 The fourth issue that   emerged as we proceeded was an expectation that we would have some form of public   announcement of this change in January And the latter two pages of the memo describe   what would go into an announcement, though it is not a draft   Let me also remind you that at our November meeting we looked at nine other areas   on which there was a strong consensus within our Working Group, and I got no sense that   there was any change from what we agreed on then That is the state of play   Now, what I would like to do is as follows Though a general consensus emerged in   the FOMC and there was a clear majority in the Working Group that we wanted to move   toward this language that focuses more on the balance of risks and is more tied to our   legislative goals, a few people still clearly felt that we needed to make sure we are   comfortable with that decision So first I’d like to ask President Poole to give his   perspective on why he as a member of the Working Group still feels uncomfortable with the   balance-of-risks language I just want to make sure we have thought this through carefully     12/21/99 60   because, as pleasant as this experience was, I don’t look forward to repeating it again next   year! [Laughter] So, careful thought is important here Then, I would like to call on the   other members of the Working Group to give their perspectives on this issue Also, as we   go around to others, I’d like to hear your thoughts not just on the balance-of-risks language   but on the other elements in our memo, including the language on intermeeting moves,   Cathy Minehan’s proposals on the directive language, and how we should communicate all   this publicly I hope that is reasonably clear Bill Poole, let me turn it over to you; I see Bill   has handed out a memo   Thank you Let me just quickly summarize what I think the   majority of our Working Group believes on this I won’t go point by point, but in general I   think the majority is concerned that if we don’t make a clear break away from the current   language, we still risk the possibility that market participants will overreact, even though   they are perhaps beginning to understand a little better what we are trying to convey   The majority of our Working Group does not suggest that the balance-of-risks   language has no implications for future interest rates or policy moves But we believe that   language more accurately reflects what the Committee actually anticipates about the future     12/21/99 62   because we all recognize that, indeed, the decisions about policy moves have not yet been   made when we talk about the balance of risks They aren’t actually made until the vote   occurs at a meeting or conference call, whichever it may be Therefore, we don’t want to   leave too strong an implication that anything is baked in the cake I think the majority felt   that the existing language does leave too much of that implication   There was, just so you know, some exchange of views on the analytics We ended   up among Bill Poole, Don Kohn, Dave Lindsey, and myself in disagreement on the   analytics I’ll spare all of you the details, unless you want to hear them, but let me just note   that there is some disagreement on whether President Poole has the analytics exactly right   With that brief summary of the majority perspective, let me go to my Working Group   colleagues first--just in the order in which they are sitting--and then we will go round robin   Mike Kelley   Thank you Larry Meyer   Before we continue, let me ask if any other members of the   Working Group want to give their perspectives or elaborate on a majority or minority point   of view Mike Moskow   Bob Parry, do you want to add something?   Thanks Ned Gramlich is next, and then we will open up the   discussion to the rest of you   I’d like to open up the discussion now and we’ll use the usual   approach I would remind you that there are a number of different elements in the memo   and I would appreciate it if you would indicate places where you agree or disagree I will be   assuming that if you don’t indicate a disagreement that you are basically agreeing with   what’s in the memo First on my list is Jerry Jordan   Bob McTeer   Ed Boehne   That is on the table Al Broaddus   Thank you Cathy Minehan   Okay, that’s an acceptable place to be Let me propose the   following It is now 100 pm  Perhaps some food would be helpful as a way to make sure   that we’re still feeling our best Is food available?   Yes, let’s take a brief recess and continue over lunch   [Lunch recess]   Bill McDonough, may I ask you to interrupt your eating to give   us your perspective on the issues on the table?   Thank you Gary Stern   May I speak to that? I think the general consensus of the   majority in our Working Group is that, just as Gary has indicated, even if we adopt the new   language in Option 1 we would provide an explanation of a vote for a bias if we thought that   was necessary There was a clear expectation that we may need to have a sentence or two   that would flesh out our reasoning just to avoid that risk So, I think that was thoroughly   considered by the Working Group Tom Hoenig is next and then Jack Guynn   Jack Guynn   Thank you Let me tell you where we are and then we have to   decide two or three issues   Sure   I’m not terribly comfortable speculating about that   I think there are two ways we might have handled it Again, this   is speculation; what we would have done, I’m not sure We might have decided that the   balance of risks was still tilted toward greater inflation but decided to take a “wait and see”   approach because we already would have made three moves So it is quite conceivable,   Jerry, that we could have said at that meeting that we were not sure about the likely   direction of our next move The risks might be in the direction of greater inflation, but we   would have wanted to be quite clear that we were waiting to see because we already had   made three moves Or we might have taken the view at that time that we had now done   three moves and, in effect, we thought we were out of this for some time and in a wait-and-    12/21/99 77   see posture Therefore, we really thought that after these moves the risks were balanced   Now, where we would have ended up would have depended very much on how close that   call was about where we thought the economy was going to be after the third move That’s   why it’s hard to say One could have made a case either way, if I recall the meeting That’s   one of the complications here   Absolutely   Yes  In hindsight, obviously, we’d know somewhat more   Let me summarize what I have heard and where I think we are In some sense not   surprisingly--though there are some caveats and a few people are in between--we still seem   to have, as we did the last time, four people who feel on the core question of the balance of   risks that the current language is clearly preferable We have one person actually who   would prefer neither Then everybody else seems to feel, though they see some faults or   have some concerns, that the balance-of-risks language is a step forward We have two   alternative courses of action One alternative is simply to vote today on the   recommendations in the memo--and this in some sense depends on the strength of our   convictions on this--which will then set the ground rules for next year That strikes me as a   reasonable alternative, knowing that we have four people who will probably be   uncomfortable about it but that everyone else, generally speaking, is ready to vote The only   other choice, frankly, is to say--and the Working Group may disagree because we have put   in as many hours as we can on this to get the issues on the table--that we don’t want to move   forward on this But if the Committee as a whole thinks we should not, recognizing that   there are four people who clearly agree and don’t want to move forward, then that is a   Committee decision I would be concerned about that decision because, effectively, it   would mean that we are stuck with the status quo, and I’m not sure that that’s terribly   attractive And frankly, after working on this for several months, I’m not sure that further   discussion either in January or at the February meeting is going to help us go any further     12/21/99 78   The only other thing that makes this question complex is that we have to handle what goes   into today’s announcement But I think we should leave that question to one side Larry   Meyer   Well, Larry Meyer has proven himself to be not just a great   economist, but a diplomat   Well, we knew he was that! If that’s the case, Mr Chairman,   could you ask for a motion on this?   It’s clearly everybody I was thinking more of just a show of   hands from all, not dividing it by members and nonmembers   Fine We will go through the memo and basically have a show   of hands on each issue, still being quite democratic Section one dealt with nine general   points on which there was consensus I heard no one dispute those, but let me just ask for a   show of hands on Section one, which deals with the nine points Is there general agreement   for those?  There seems to be no objection on that   In Section two, I will turn your attention to the balance-of-risks language at the top   of page 5, which has been the focus of most of our conversation All in favor of adopting     12/21/99 79   that as the way to deal with our perspective on the future, please raise your hand Okay   And those opposed?  There are four opposed   At the bottom of page 5 in Section B is language dealing with the Chairman’s   latitude for intermeeting moves All in favor of handling the intermeeting latitude that way   and making it a part of the Authorization when we vote on that in February raise your hand   Any opposed?   In Section C on page 6, Cathy Minehan has proposed a slight   rewording of the directive Although Cathy referred to it in our go-around, we did not have   much discussion on it Let me just ask for a show of hands on the language, which is   actually on the top of page 7 in Section C All in favor of that approach?  Those opposed?  I   see none opposed   I think we are clear on what we are going to do with respect to the directive when we   get to February We have a new approach that I think has been determined democratically   Let me talk about the next step and then give some guidance The plan, as you can   see on pages 7 and 8, is that we will issue a press release some time in January that   describes the major substantive changes that we have made The expectation is that   everyone will have a chance to look at a draft of that press release and send comments back   to me or Dave Lindsey or Don Kohn So, everyone will have a chance to review it That   will be the way we communicate to the public what our intentions were in making these   changes Then in February we will start using this new procedure Are there any objections   to that approach?  Hearing none, I assume there are no objections   Now we can turn to the next issue, which is the announcement for today You may   recall that the Chairman pointed out the bracketed language at the bottom of the draft press   release Lynn Fox has now taken away all the copies of that announcement Lynn, could   you just read that bracketed language?   Does anyone have an objection to including that sentence in   today’s announcement?  Yes, go ahead Peter     12/21/99 80   Does anyone have a counterpoint to that?  "
6502,2000-02-01,"  Thank you very much  The first order of business today is to elect   a Chairman who will serve until the first scheduled meeting in the year of 2001  So, let me open   the floor for nominations  Are there any nominations?  Governor Kelley     Is there a second?   SPEAKER(?)  Second    Thank you  I’m glad someone seconded it!  Are there any   objections to those two nominations?  Hearing no objections, I will declare the vote unanimous    Let me congratulate the two of you!      I move that we select the Federal Reserve Bank of New York      I second it     Second    I move that    Second    So moved    It’s hard to follow that, though I might say that as Administrative   Governor I want to find out about these machines!  [Laughter]  The staff and I will discuss that   later   In a more serious vein, at the end of the last meeting we stated that we would review   the incoming data very closely for signs of imbalances  The data we’ve received to date suggest   that the economy is continuing to expand at a faster pace than its potential, even if that potential   has gone up  Mike brought in the most recent data on automobile sales, which are strong  And   the recent ECI data, even though the measurements are flawed as I understand it, suggest that   vigilance is important  Similarly, the latest information regarding personal income and outlays   suggests that consumers continue to be very willing to spend beyond their incomes, giving   credibility to both the optimistic survey numbers and also to the worries that we have regarding   some imbalances  With respect to the recent GDP numbers, I think I have been well educated by   the staff and have done some independent analysis and have discovered that in fact we should be   relatively agnostic about those numbers  But they are not the only ones that suggest some   strengthening of the economy   We had an earlier discussion regarding the forecast, and in that regard I’d just like to   make two observations  One is that the staff does expect both a shortfall in earnings and a   widening in the corporate financing gap, and implicitly some high volatility in equity markets, as   well as noticeably higher interest rates  All that suggests to me that it is not inconceivable that   expected returns on investment might weaken and, in conjunction with that, that the amount of          70  investment itself might weaken  That leads to one small internal inconsistency perhaps in the   Greenbook, though I understand how they got out of it   Similarly, the Greenbook suggested that there should be a significant increase in short-  term interest rates  But it also suggested, in spite of that, that equity markets will tread water in   the sense of ending the year pretty much at the same level as they started the year  I have a   growing concern that a placid surface may disguise some underlying turmoil  I think the   dispersion that we saw among various indices at the very beginning of the year may suggest that   this market is subject to some volatility, including significant downside corrections     All of these considerations are not meant in any way to counter the various recitations   of strength in the economy that we have heard discussed today and will probably hear more of   during the course of the day  I, along with others, certainly do think that the risks to good   economic performance are primarily on the up side and that the equilibrium interest rates are   probably higher than the current market rates  However, as a few others have suggested, I think   we should be prepared to move policy incrementally and to use all of our tools carefully  To my   mind, President Boehne put it correctly  Our goal here is to attempt to maintain maximum   sustainable growth as well as to try to focus on price stability  I believe we are entering a   particularly challenging year, with an economy that may prove to be “interesting” in the sense of   the Chinese proverb  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I walked in here being really quite   agnostic on this issue  I know it is a matter on which some people feel strongly, but I was   interested in hearing both sides  I have come to the conclusion that perhaps the better course is   just to leave well enough alone--not to make a change at this stage--for a variety of reasons  Jack          95  Guynn raised one reason that to me is most important  During the course of this year, I suspect   we will be under a fair amount of scrutiny about core policy matters, and I would prefer not to   have to go into that period having to explain monetary aggregate issues, which frankly are not   terribly important to us right now   Secondly, there is the whole issue, which also has come up, about numerical inflation   targeting  I happen to be one of those who think that the qualitative inflation target that we have   now has served us well  And I see no reason to open that debate, which I think we would have to   do in the course of reaching a decision to change the ranges     The third thing that worries me, as I listen to this conversation, is that it will also force   us in some sense to be more explicit as a Committee about our views on productivity and the   productivity trend  And I’m not sure that I am hearing consistency among the Committee   members on those issues     Finally, I believe there is a lesson to be learned from some of our central bank   colleagues around the world who are in a position of having to talk about and defend their   actions vis-à-vis what is happening to growth in the monetary aggregates  In particular, the   ECB, which has put more weight on money growth than perhaps it should have, is being   lambasted week by week in the newspapers for why it is allowing M3 growth to be above its   target  I think we are in a much better position in that we have clearly said we are not putting   much weight on these aggregates, and so M3 growth may or may not be above our targets  I   frankly prefer to be quite clear in our communications  We have enough other issues about   which we need to be clear  If we just leave this one alone for the course of this year, I think we   will be in much better shape, given the other things we are likely to be doing    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with both halves of your   recommendation  I think we should reinforce markets when they are right and I think they are   right in their expectations  Secondly I, like others, am moved by the uncertainties that we have   talked about, but I also recognize that inflation does not appear at this stage to be on the verge of   a virulent outbreak  So a move of 25 basis points seems to me moderate and appropriate  I think   you're absolutely right in suggesting that over time we can and will continue to look at the   reaction of markets generally, including the asset markets where I do think, as I said yesterday,          134  there is likely to be some underlying turbulence  Finally, on the outlook sentence I believe the   statement that suggests the risks are balanced toward inflation is obviously the right one to use   because it does not take back all the other things that we're doing    It couldn’t run on any better!

6526,2000-03-21,"  Let me just comment that I think what Peter just said is important    And in some sense, responding to Bill Poole's thought, I think we have to be careful not to   collapse both the tactical and strategic decisions here simultaneously  My sense is that the way   we can do the least harm is to handle the tactical issue, which is basically to provide this   temporary extension to Peter while the study goes on  Anything other than that strikes me, and   Peter just said this, as being highly risky and perhaps sending all the wrong messages  At the   same time we should recognize that the study that needs to be done has broader implications, as   the Chairman has indicated  But I would be a little concerned if our broader strategic concerns   forced us to withdraw the authority that is already there, which could send very confusing   messages and have who knows what reaction  So, I think the least harmful action is just to   continue the temporary authority and do the study  And then sometime later this year we will   have to make a broader strategic decision    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the question before us today,   as others have suggested, is whether the data and the forecasts are strong enough to catalyze an   unexpected reaction from this Committee  I postulate that they are not  I believe we should stay   on the same moderate course that has become a part of our strategy for the last several years    Clearly, the economy has continued to exhibit surprising momentum  Reflecting this, the staff   has changed its expectations for four-quarter GDP growth quite substantially, as others have   noted  The engines for this growth have not changed, however, since our last meeting    Consumer spending is still outpacing GDP growth overall, and that includes spending on both   durables and nondurables  In addition, capital spending also continues unabated  While we are   used to seeing this in the tech sector, capital spending outside of the tech sector is also strong  I   sense that we are probably just at the beginning of this productivity surprise  The outcome in the   real economy is driven both by high levels of consumer optimism and by financial markets that   are indeed somewhat accommodative to strong growth  Clearly, in my view, this outlook              - 70 -     embodies the old statement about monetary policy  “Bad news is bad because it is bad; good   news is bad because it might be inflationary”  But the question really is  How inflationary is the   good news?  And in that regard I think there are some important changes since our last meeting   First, while the likelihood is that the unemployment rate will continue to hover near   the lows that we are currently experiencing, I do sense at long last that we are starting to see   some tightening in other measures of resource use  The labor force participation rate and the   capacity utilization rate seem to be ticking up; both had been remarkably subdued  I think they   are both likely to start trending upward  That might be, as I think Mike Prell indicated, a setting   for a stronger upturn in inflation and some accelerating trends in the wage process  Similarly,   inflation expectations have made a bit of a worrisome move in the wrong direction as well    However, I tend to believe that with ongoing vigilance on our part through a “gradual tightening”   program clearly signaled in our statements, we can return balance to the economy  We have   already raised rates about 100 basis points and that has occurred in the last year  And if we   assume that the lags are long and variable, as we say, perhaps some more slowing will come   from actions we have already taken   In addition, central banks in most of the industrialized world are also in the process of   tightening, as Karen Johnson indicated, with the obvious exception of Japan  That would   suggest that those economies are not likely to overheat and, therefore, it is unlikely that more   rapid increases in foreign activity will create a problem from the standpoint of adding to   pressures on our resources  Finally, the main source of higher measured inflation thus far is   current oil prices, which many observers expect to return to a more normal supply-demand   dynamic before having a major impact on inflation expectations here  In addition to those three              - 71 -     factors, most forecasters and the markets do not signal any imminent outbreak of inflation   against the background of a gradual expected tightening on our part   In sum, I would say that tightening at this meeting is probably appropriate  I do not   believe, however, that we are behind the curve, and I do not believe that we have lost credibility    In that circumstance, we should continue to validate market expectations and maintain the   pressure that comes from clear communication  But to me the incoming data and the forecast, at   least at this stage, do not suggest that we should change our approach to policy  The data at the   next meeting may suggest that a more hurried pace is warranted; they may not  I think that   judgment waits for the next meeting  At this stage I believe we should continue to validate   market expectations    I support both halves of your recommendation  And since we are   confessing, I will confess that my heart is pure!  [Laughter]     That is also true I do think a 25 basis point move is appropriate   today As I said earlier, a 50 basis point move may be appropriate later               - 92 -      He has to turn his collar around the other way!  [Laughter]  "
6548,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In light of the time I will shorten   what I otherwise would have said, but I do want to say a couple of things  First, I agree with   others that the incoming data since we last met generally support our ongoing vigilance and   concern on the inflation front, but to me those data do not indicate that the war is lost or that   we have fallen behind the curve  I tend to agree that inflation risks have picked up and I,   therefore, think that we should continue to act, and probably with a slightly greater sense of   urgency, in order to achieve balance in our economy   As for the factors that suggest the risks of inflation are, if anything, perhaps a little   stronger, a number of people have talked about the role of consumer behavior, and I would   endorse that view  We have also talked about a number of other indicators of tightening in the      70  economy that had been very quiet and seem to have suddenly come awake  Let me just put   two on the table that have not come up thus far  Capacity utilization, which had fallen out of   favor as a topic of discussion around this table in the last two years, appears to be reemerging   as an indicator of resource tightness  At about 814 percent that measure has reached its   highest reading in two years  Similarly, the labor force participation rate, which had been   mysteriously quiescent, also appears to have returned to a slightly more normal pattern for a   strong economy, edging up to 67-½ percent, which is well above the average that prevailed   for the three previous years To a degree, therefore, I think strong demand-led and investment-  led growth is forcing some of the usual indicators of resource tightness to return to a more   normal pattern     These elements of resource tightness I think are starting to show through a bit both   in costs and possibly in price pressures  Employment costs did jump 1-¼ percent in the first   quarter, the fastest pace since 1989, which supports the notion that strained labor markets are   starting to have an impact               Some of the survey data, including those from small businesses, also show that   compensation costs are increasing  I view that as important supporting data  More broadly on   the inflation front, the GDP deflator posted its largest increase in three years in the first   quarter  And as others have indicated, short-term inflation expectations have moved up for   the public at large  Purchasing managers also seem to sense a tightening tone in prices     However, I think all is not lost on the inflation front, and I believe there are some   real arguments for a less bleak picture  The CPI number for March was probably a bit of an   anomaly, with much of the uptick in prices in the lodging component, which was a replay of    April 1999 and was an upside surprise then as well  Similarly, if one looks at the retail sales      71  figures, there is a possibility, as President McTeer has indicated, that perhaps we are seeing a   bit of a slowing but it’s too early to say for sure  More importantly in my view, the financial   markets do not necessarily show a major pickup in inflation expectations  I would note that a   few others have commented on inflation expectations and, contrary to what some have said,   I’m not sure that I have seen an increase there  I looked at the yield spread on 10-year   Treasury bills versus 10-year TIPs  And at least on the chart in front of me the spread seems   to have picked up a little starting in October 1998 until about the middle of 1999 and, with   two wobbles, then settled down at around 2 percent  Of course, one can read a wobble up or   down and either weigh it heavily or not weigh it very strongly at all  But contrary to the   staff’s forecast, the markets are not suggesting a strong increase in inflation expectations in   my view  Needless to say, Mike Prell has put on the table the question of whether the market   has it right or the forecasters have it right  And since I am neither a market participant nor a   forecaster, I will let time tell on that one      The second point I would note on this front, which again is not statistically proven,   is that one could reasonably expect that the recent stock market volatility would in fact damp   consumer expenditures somewhat  The third point I would note is that we know corporate   bond rates have increased noticeably since the start of the year, just as the issuance of   corporate debt has also been cut back  So, both developments in the corporate bond markets   have the effect, I think, of amplifying our tightening moves and forcing borrowers back to   banks, where conditions on both loan rates and terms or availability do seem to be tightening    So, I believe there are reasons to think that some of our actions have been noticed by the   market and will be reinforced by the market      72  Finally, I’d underscore a point that First Vice President Stone and a couple of   others made, which is that long-term inflation expectations have not moved appreciably    Given this configuration, I believe that perhaps we should move a bit more aggressively than   in the past, but not signal that we are concerned that the inflation genie is out of the bottle    While the risks may be somewhat heightened, I do not believe that we are clearly behind the   curve  I think the market is helping us in some ways  And I would join with a number of the   Reserve Bank Presidents and First Vice President Stone in suggesting, as President Hoenig   said, that we not have “sweaty palms"" here  On the other hand, I think some action today   clearly will help us to reinforce a market perception  If we can do that without overshooting, I   think we can prove that Mike Prell, while he will be missed, has left the institution capable of   making some good judgments  [Laughter]    Let me step into the staff role here  What we've worked hard   on in developing this language is to try to get in this concept of the “foreseeable future,”   which is clearly meant to be longer than the intermeeting period and longer even than after the   next meeting  As the working group and the Committee talked about this, frankly, I think   most people thought the foreseeable future encompassed something like the lag that you are   discussing  Obviously, it would be a judgment call  But if we thought that we had put in   enough tightening today that we would slow inflation over a period of let’s say 18 months or   so, it would not be unreasonable to say in this statement that we think the risks are balanced   for the foreseeable future  It is clearly longer than three months  I think most people viewed   it as longer than three months and probably somewhere on the order of a year to eighteen   months  Needless to say, we didn’t try to tie ourselves down explicitly    That is intended to be a possibility, yes  It is also quite   possible, though, that we might say we have taken this tightening action but we still do not see      82  the risks as balanced just yet  However, the reason we have not tightened further, obviously,   is that we are waiting for incoming data and a variety of other things so that we can make a   more informed judgment  In fact, since we’ve used this formulation, we have had the option   of both raising rates but also saying that the risks were a little unbalanced  And it is also true,   as you made quite clear, that the market--I think appropriately--interprets statements that the   risks are not balanced or more toward inflation as at least a possibility, though not a certainty,   that we will continue to raise rates  So we should not pretend that we have broken that link   because it is still there, but it is not as strong as it had been before    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both halves of your   recommendation  Let me take just one minute to explain why  I think we are in the business   here of trying to find a mini-max solution, if you will, to minimize the maximum regret we   will have in terms of the effects of our actions on society and the economy  One way to do   that is to support the market when the market is sending us clear signals  As I said in my   earlier remarks, long-term inflation expectations have not gone up  I think the reason is that   the market is expecting us to react today in a way that is consistent with the way they are   looking at the long term  And we have in fact worked very hard during this intermeeting   period to make sure we are not looking in a mirror--that we are looking at the right data and   that the market is as well  This might not always be the case but at this stage the market is   sending us a very clear signal that the appropriate move is 50 basis points with a statement of   continued concern about inflation risks  To me the wisest course is to follow that signal  I   think, as you pointed out clearly, that real long-term interest rates have to go up  In my view   we would be in dangerous territory if we did not in fact support that, because otherwise we   would be anchoring rates in a way that is inconsistent with where we really want to go     I strongly support what President Jordan and President Poole said because I, too,   am not sure how far this tightening process is going to go  But, fortunately, we are in a   position where we only have to make decisions one meeting at a time  And for today's   meeting I think 50 basis points and a balance of risks statement tilted toward inflation is the   right policy  "
6572,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I suppose I'm fortunate that I have   never tried to make a living as a forecaster because it's easier for me to look at the incoming   data as opposed to trying to throw it out  And based on what I've seen, my view is similar to   what others have said in that I believe there are some early signs of slowing out there  They   have appeared in the interest-sensitive sectors of housing and motor vehicles  Also, and I think   importantly, the most recent incoming data suggest that consumer confidence is starting to wane   a bit     To me one of the major questions about the second quarter has come up a couple of   times in this discussion  And that is whether what we are seeing is simply the slowdown that   was to be expected after very rapid growth in the first quarter, whether it reflects some residual   seasonality, or whether something else is going on  One of the things I did during the recent   intermeeting period was to ask the staff to give me at least a sense of any evidence of residual   seasonality  They've done that  And in what they've shown to me, at least looking at this over   longer periods, there doesn't seem to be any systematic trend for the second quarter to be much   slower than any of the other quarters during the course of a year  So I think we can probably           76  rule out any systematic seasonality here  I think it is still possible that what we saw in the   second quarter may have been a bit the result of weather-related changes and some other special   factors that we can't pick up econometrically  But having said that, I'd still put a little weight,   and perhaps others have as well, on the fact that we see some early signs of a slowing  The   other place I would look for evidence of slowing is in the yield curve from the private sector   where--again using a normal mode of interpretation--those in the private sector seem to be   telling us by their behavior that they are seeing some slowing as well     The final thing one might look to for evidence of a slowing is the interaction between   these very high gas prices and what one might expect from consumer behavior  Again, working   with the FRB/US model, it seems as though the increases we've seen in oil prices amount to   somewhere between $40 and $50 billion less money available for consumers to spend going   forward  And the effects of that might start to show up as soon as in the next quarter  So I think   there are two or three reasons to feel that perhaps the beginning of some slowing is actually in   sight here   Having said that, as others have indicated, there also are clearly some signs that the   slowing is not as certain as one might like  Obviously the most recent signals that we've seen   with respect to the housing data suggest some uncertainty about this  Another factor that might   give rise to some uncertainty is that financial market conditions between this and our previous   meeting have become, if anything, a little more accommodative  Net corporate borrowings,   driven by bond issuance, seem to have picked up again during the intermeeting period  Finally,   as others have noted, there doesn't seem to be much let-up in resource utilization, particularly   with respect to the labor market  So we have signs on both sides that I think we need to be   mindful of as we deliberate             77  I have two other points to make here  One is that it does seem, as Governor Gramlich   said, that there is a bit of good news in that most of the indicators of long-term inflation   expectations haven't moved up very much during this period  So I think that gives us some sign   that we have a little time on our side  And finally, as the staff presentation pointed out and as   Governor Meyer also noted, it is unlikely that what we've seen thus far reflects the full impact   of the tightening that has been undertaken  So there is, I believe, a certain amount of tightening   impact still left in the pipeline   In sum, there is a sense that some slowing is in train  It might well continue if one   believes some of the market indicators  While it does appear, as Governor Meyer indicated, that   there is some pickup in inflation, it doesn't seem as though a break out is imminent or that   inflation expectations have gone against us  Nevertheless, since we have worked so hard over   the last year with respect to interest rates, we may have to do some more tightening  But at this   stage I think we could comfortably take a bit of a pause, look at the incoming data a bit more   closely, and judge whether or not the slowing is one with which we are comfortable  In doing   that we should be careful not to signal that we're done, because in fact we don't know for sure if   we're done  Nevertheless, I think we can take a bit more cautious attitude toward possible   further tightening at this stage  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to express agreement with   what I take to be the main message of Governor Gramlich’s remarks and also the Vice Chair’s   statement  Also, I agree with your proposal to move away from voting on ranges for the   monetary aggregates since we haven't really been following them very closely  But obviously,   as you suggest, I don't believe we would be credible central bankers if we didn't all in our own   individual ways look at the aggregates at every meeting  And, in fact, I certainly did look at   them coming into this meeting  So, I think continuing to keep track of them is part of what we   are expected to do   With respect to inflation targeting, I think we should not undercut ourselves    Members have expressed very clearly their support of a qualitative inflation target, which is that   we want inflation to be so low and stable that it is actually no more a point of discussion in   decisionmaking among businesses and unions, et cetera  And through a combination of good   policy and some other factors I believe we have managed to achieve that objective and we are           93  fighting now to hold onto it  But I want to make sure we are clear that we do actually have a   qualitative target; we are not completely without anchor   I agree that it would be useful to have a strategy discussion, as Governor Gramlich   indicates, twice a year  That seems to make sense  I will say on the quantitative target, having   spent some time traveling around and talking to other central bankers, that as you suggest there   doesn't seem to be much evidence yet that it leads to better policy  I recently read a speech by   Lars Heikensten, the first deputy governor of the Bank of Sweden which has a formal inflation   target, that suggests that the Bank is dealing with a couple of problems  One concern is the risk   of losing credibility when they miss that target--either explaining why it was that they chose to   miss the target or alternatively could not bring the economy to hit the target  The second   concern they seem to have is that the public believes there is a bit of bias--that the central bank   will be more willing to let inflation creep up rather than creep down  So they are struggling   with a sense of an asymmetrical inflation target     I am entirely in agreement with you that as we think about this issue we have to be   mindful that perhaps inflation targets have built up credibility where there wasn't any  At this   stage we have pretty good credibility  And the other industrial economies that have adopted   inflation targeting have discovered that while on balance they may like it, it also creates some   problems that weren't expected  So I think we should be very, very careful about going down   that path at this stage  And those problems are in addition to what Governor Gramlich had to   say about a nuance here, which is that if we go too far down this path, we may discover   ourselves handcuffed in a way that undercuts our credibility and reduces our effectiveness rather   than the opposite  So with that, let me stop           94   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I think we have   done a great deal of work thus far and it is not unreasonable to take a pause, given the degree of   uncertainty and the other factors to which you have alluded  "
6596,2000-08-22,"  Peter, with respect to diversification of these holdings overseas, have   you seen foreign governments or foreign central banks moving more aggressively into GSEs or have   they been moving out of GSEs?  I know some of them do hold GSEs  Do you know how they have   been dealing with those holdings?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting we decided to wait   and see whether the 175 basis points of tightening that we had put in place was having the desired   effect on the economy  I believe the incoming data, as others have suggested, are generally   supportive of the wisdom of that posture and do suggest some slowing is in train  Clearly, the   interest-sensitive sectors have shown some noticeable slowing  More broadly, it seems as though the   job market has gone from super hot to what I would describe as sort of warm  The pace of job   growth seems to have slowed from about 240,000 per month during the first four months of the year   to an average of about 125,000 during the more recent four months  And finally, the data suggest       56  that businesses are boosting inventories, which might be an indication that perhaps demand is not   topping supply     If one takes a longer perspective, I am fairly comfortable, as others also have indicated,   with the change that the staff has introduced with respect to productivity growth  I come to that   view for a number of different reasons  First, output of and investment in information   communication technologies continue to be the most robust portions of GDP growth  Secondly, I   too have had some conversations with people from Silicon Valley who have worked very hard to   convince me that more is still to come on the productivity front, as a few of the presidents have   mentioned  Obviously we will have to wait to see if that is the case  Thirdly, venture capital funds   still seem to be flowing into these newer areas, suggesting that the investment community is also   noticing that something special is going on there and they continue to be supportive of it   The staff has worked fairly hard to inform us of the risks surrounding this assumption, and   I think at least one other person has mentioned that  But, like the staff, I also note that the equity   markets have been rising gradually in the recent past as opposed to at a torrid pace, and so perhaps   the wealth effect is not feeding demand as strongly as it had been before   Finally, looking to market data, based on the 10-year TIPS it seems as though   expectations in the market with respect to inflation are relatively subdued, and I think that is also   good news  Having said that, I agree with others that the risks still continue to be mainly on the up   side, and I’d cite two or three reasons for that  First, obviously, consumers are confident and labor   markets continue to be tight by historical standards  Secondly, in that context, I do note that some   analysts think the recent slowdown in private employment growth might be attributable not to an   easing in labor demand but rather to a tightening of labor supply constraints  They support that   contention by the fact that much of the slowdown in growth has come not from interest-sensitive       57  goods-producing sectors but rather from the services sector  But when one looks behind that, one   sees that where the growth has been slow is in the services sector and in FIRE, which obviously   includes real estate, and also in the personnel supply sectors  So, that strikes me as a bit mixed  I   might also say in this vein that the ECI obviously should have given us some pause, but I think the   staff is right in suggesting that perhaps some of that is simply a reflection that this increase in   productivity is being shared with labor as well as with capital   A more serious concern with respect to the inflation outlook, it seems to me, is that   financial conditions have in fact eased a little since our last meeting  Real interest rates fell over the   intermeeting period, and indeed real interest rates for investment-grade borrowers appear to be up   only about 1 percentage point since May 1999  So, in some sense our credibility, if you will, is   leading perhaps to a bit of leakage in our efforts with respect to tightening  However, my concern   about accommodative financial conditions is tempered a bit by the fact that net borrowings from   nonfinancial businesses appear to have slowed in July from the rapid pace of the second quarter    Also, at least compared to June, the composition of that borrowing has shifted back to banks, and   banks are reporting a tightening of standards and a firming of terms on business loans  And, as a   few of you have indicated, it may well be that the demand for loans is skewing back   Finally, I think we should note that there has been in this meeting and certainly in others   some discussion of the NAIRU  And on that topic I’d like to share an observation from a well-  informed citizen about what she described as the “Nehru”  This was in fact my wife  She wants to   know why this Committee continues to focus so much on the style of a man’s jacket that was only   popular for a few years in the 1960s  [Laughter]  I said to her that some economic questions really   can not be answered!  But in a more serious vein, it does suggest that those who want to couch their       58  analysis in the terms of the NAIRU clearly have an extra strong burden of communication  Thank   you very much    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your   recommendation  I feel a bit drawn into the discussion about the communication of the balance of   risks, having spent nine months working with a number of you in trying to sort this out  I probably   shouldn't act on that feeling, but I will  First, I certainly commend and have always listened to the   wise counsel of our Vice Chair, and I agree that we actually have succeeded to some extent in   communicating something here  I am quite sympathetic to what Jerry Jordan just said, though  And   what Tom Hoenig said is also relevant  In my view there are a number of things that are leading us to   communicate that we think the risks over the foreseeable future are toward greater inflation  Some of   the reasons have to do with the labor markets, and one can say that without necessarily being a firm   believer in a particular number with respect to the NAIRU  So, I am comfortable with keeping in that   reference to the labor market  But like Tom Hoenig, I do think that what I am hearing is a broader   range of concerns having to do with other elements of the real economy--and in my case, maybe not   for others, having a bit to do with some financial conditions  I don't at all sense that we should   change our communication tool at this meeting  But in my view Jerry quite appropriately reminded   us that we worked hard to get to this language--not because we thought it was an easy out from a   difficult problem but because we thought it was going to help the public in its analysis of our   policymaking  So, as we go forward during the course of the year--regardless of what we do with   interest rates--I think we have to be clear about what is driving our assessment of the risks  I say that   because doing so will give the market a chance to look at the same things we are looking at  And if   we're looking past the unemployment numbers to other factors, we at least ought to signal that to the   market as best we can  Thank you  "
6617,2000-10-03,"  I’ll move to ratify the foreign exchange activities of the Desk    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like others, my read of the incoming data   is that they do point mainly to a continued moderation in economic growth to a pace that I believe is   below the economy’s potential  In addition to the economic data that have come in, I think the more   forward-looking indicators of real activity also support the notion of some slowing in train  The   purchasing managers’ report for new orders is the most recent example in that category  Also, as I      66  believe Peter Fisher was suggesting, the financial markets, though not unambiguously, certainly do   seem to be consistent with a slowing  They obviously have some concern about its pace, but I think   they are suggesting a slowing is in train   Now having said that, the Greenbook and the economic data point to a number of risks    One we’ve already talked about, which is oil  Like Ned Gramlich, I will restrain myself on that   subject except to observe that the one thing we haven’t talked about is the great risk of an upside   price surprise that comes from either political instability or willful misbehavior on the part of some   of the producers of oil  I think that is still a possibility  Though it doesn’t appear to be the most   likely outcome, it’s one we do have to be aware of     The second risk that I see in the forecast is that the Greenbook assumes that investment in   productivity-enhancing capital goods will continue unabated even as credit conditions tighten and   the pace of growth slows  Given the role that the supply side of the economy has played for the last   several years and the observation that no economy seems to have managed to sustain productivity   increases in the high single digits for several years, this is to me a very important assumption  It   rests on the view that a large chunk of investment spending continues to be done by established   firms with relatively strong credit ratings who are likely to emerge from this mild cyclical slowing in   very good shape  While it is true that most capital spending, at least among the largest companies, is   done by investment grade firms, about a quarter of it is done by firms that are not investment grade    So I see some potential risks there that we should be mindful of  I would also observe that we’ve   seen some negative earnings surprises from some of the major participants in the new economy,   including Cisco Systems which builds routers that are the backbone for the Internet, Apple   Computer, and Intel  That goes back to the semiconductor story  None of those stories is yet   enough to say that this new economy, productivity-enhancing supply shock we’ve had is over  But I      67  think we do have to be mindful that there is at least a risk that the pace of investment in this   expansion may slow, which would lead to unfortunate outcomes with respect to productivity,   employment, and also inflation--a combination of developments that would be challenging for us   In a more positive sense of risk, I was glad to see that the staff included an alternative   simulation with a NAIRU at 4 percent  Like Ned Gramlich, I’ve certainly toyed with the possibility   of a low NAIRU in that area  In the time I’ve been here at the Board we’ve had unemployment   running somewhere between 43 and 39 percent and inflation has been quite quiescent, partially for   special factors  Nevertheless, it does leave open the possibility that in fact the so-called NAIRU is   down at that level  I find it instructive that the staff at least seems to think the probability of a   NAIRU at that lower level is about 20 percent, more or less  Again, I think it’s too early to presume   that’s the answer and too early to base policy on it  But it’s interesting that we can even have a   discussion where the possibility of NAIRU at around 4 to 4-1/4 percent is definitely on the table   When I put all of these certainties and uncertainties together, it seems to me as though the   best policy stance for now is steady as she goes  A slowing does seem to be well under way, not   requiring any further action  I do think that the balance of risk statement should continue to be   focused on inflation  We have tight labor markets  There is some uncertainty about oil  The fiscal   policy situation is a little uncertain  And if it turns out that the economy can maintain   noninflationary growth at an unemployment rate as low as today’s, then a gradual policy will allow   us to discover that truth over time as well  So, I believe we should stand pat as we are and just   continue to monitor incoming data as we have been    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I’d also like to make   one comment  I think Don Kohn did us a great service by getting us focused on this creeping   inflation issue I’m not quite sure what the answer is but I think we will come back to it  I heard   Jerry Jordan also raise some concern about this issue    We spend $2 billion a year more or less and we get back $28 billion a   year    I'd rather do profit sharing!  [Laughter]  "
6643,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start by reassuring all of you   that I am always happy there are 16 others here!  [Laughter]  Ned and I joined the Board at about   the same time and obviously we have always enjoyed the input of our colleagues    On a more serious note, I find myself very much in sympathy with exactly what my   colleague Ned Gramlich just had to say  We started out in June 1999 trying to put in motion a   series of efforts to slow the economy's growth to something that's more sustainable, and I think   the incoming evidence suggests that in fact we have done that  And while the economy has   evolved in a generally predictable and I think appropriate manner, a number of risks have   emerged with greater clarity since the last meeting  It seems to me, as others have suggested,   that the substance of this meeting is primarily about how we should respond to all that and   acknowledge these new risks     On the one hand, as many of you have already said, we do continue to have high oil   prices and continuing tight labor markets  Given that OPEC at its most recent meeting decided   not to increase production and that the Middle East continues to be volatile, I think the near-term   risks with respect to oil--in terms of both the supply not being disrupted and its price--continue to   be primarily on the up side  After the most recent OPEC announcement, the spot price for West   Texas Intermediate went from about $31 a barrel to about $34 a barrel, and that’s where it is   today, I believe    Slightly higher, okay  So, I think the risk related to uncertainty in   the oil markets is showing through in the pricing  I would also say--as I understand the   configuration of output with respect to oil plus inventories plus refinery capacity--that it's really               66      quite possible that once we get through the heating oil season in this country we could actually   see a sharp break in oil prices toward the down side   As others have already noted, labor markets obviously remain tight  As all of you   know, unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, so I think we can expect labor markets to   continue to be tight, perhaps for the labor-hoarding reasons that Dave Stockton suggested  Also,   I agree with others who have said that the most recent data on compensation are at least   somewhat troubling  Average hourly earnings for the 12 months ending in October increased   about 38 percent, which is near the upper end of the range that measure has shown for some   time  And Al Broaddus mentioned the most recent unit labor cost figures, which were certainly   far from reassuring, even though they may have been driven by some special factors  If   productivity growth is starting to top out, we can expect unit labor costs, if anything, to continue   to rise  And, obviously, the questions with respect to benefit costs are not comforting either    The measures of inflation themselves also are in many ways quite disturbing, as others   have mentioned  Moreover, it seems as though we are facing a gradual ongoing rise in inflation   and inflationary pressures in most of these measures, with the baseline numbers already   relatively high     The new developments since our last meeting do involve mostly the downside risks    The slowdown in profit growth, which was just showing through a little at the time of our last   meeting, primarily in the telecom sector, has become much more widespread in the S&P 500     With interest expense rising and compensation per hour also likely to rise, a continuing   slowdown in profit growth should not be unexpected  The current slowing and the expectation   of a future slowing have led creditors to adopt a more cautious stance  As Steve Oliner said in               67      response to a question, the average corporate bond rate, using a weighted average as Steve   described, has in fact gone up  That question managed to steal about three sentences of what I   was going to say!  Similarly, as others have pointed out, the senior loan officer surveys suggest   that there is ongoing tightening  And for those who want to look at financial conditions overall,   a declining stock market and continuing depreciation of the dollar have, if anything, contributed   at the margin some extra tightening   This focus on financial and credit conditions is important because investment, as you   know, has been a pillar of our recent growth  And recent investment has been heavily financed   by external sources  Internal financing now accounts for only 75 percent of overall financing for   investment, and that is I think the largest financing gap we have had in a decade  As I look at the   data on net funds being raised, we are seeing some gradual drop-off, not only from quarter one to   quarter two to quarter three of this year, but month over month as well  So businesses clearly   appear less optimistic  They clearly are finding fewer reasons to raise funds  And banks and   other lenders are being much tighter with respect to providing credit to businesses  So, I do   sense that investment spending is on a bit more of a knife-edge now than it has been for some   time   Finally, the other pillar of our expansion has been consumption, and that is also on a   trajectory for slower growth  Again, perhaps the downside risk is great but it’s not as great as   that for investment  Consumers remain optimistic, but the gap between the growth in real   disposable income and personal consumption expenditures seems to be wide by historical   standards just on the basis of the fact that the support coming from the stock market is waning    Given the high debt burdens of most households, any negative reassessment of future prospects               68      by the American consumer can potentially lead to an outsized contraction in consumer spending    So I sense that there are some real downside risks in that area   To sum up, I would describe the current picture as benign but I believe the future is as   hazy as it has been in the period I’ve been here anyway  There are clearly good reasons to   continue to focus on the upside risk with respect to inflation  But I too sense, as Ned Gramlich   and others have indicated, that the balance of risks has shifted quite noticeably since the last   meeting  Our biggest challenge, I think, is how to communicate that we have an eye on the   upside risk but also recognize that some downside risks have emerged which are much more   noticeable than they were at our last meeting    I'm sorry you got to me so quickly!  [Laughter]    No, I don’t want to pass  The reason I said that is that I’m   actually very sympathetic to the points that Presidents Hoenig and Poole just made  I   think we've worked too hard to be as honest and transparent with the market as possible    So if we really think that the risks are balanced, we should say the risks are balanced   On the other hand, I have to say that I also am sympathetic to the notion that   we don't want the markets to build in more of an expectation of a near-term easing than   they currently have, and they do have some in there  So if I can put it this way, on   balance [Laughter], in thinking through all of this--which obviously I did a bit before we   came to the meeting--the statement that you have introduced strikes me as a very fair   description of where we are  In some sense it's not quite where I am, but I believe it is a   fair description of where we are as a Committee and I think it gets the message across   without creating some uncertain risks  So, I'm supportive of the statement even though I   understand some of the concerns that others have raised  "
6666,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the staff is to be commended for   accurately representing in its baseline forecast what I believe is a preponderance of the quantitative   evidence  The only problem I have is that the baseline forecast in the Greenbook strikes me as a   triumph of hope over reality; I certainly believe that the risks are almost all to the down side  The   relatively sudden reversal in the outlook that has emerged recently from more qualitative data   suggests that the trajectory of the economy may be further downward instead of stabilizing at an   annual growth rate of 2-1/2 to 3 percent  The rise in initial claims and the drop in consumer   sentiment both suggest to me the possibility that consumers are likely to retrench more aggressively   than is assumed in the baseline  Similarly, earnings revisions have been coming in at a pace I would   describe as fast and furious  Since our last meeting, for example, we have seen a significant   reduction in the expectations of analysts for fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500  The year-over-  year growth rate of earnings per share is now estimated at about 09 percent  At the last meeting that   same number was about 44 percent, which suggests a fourth-quarter annual growth rate of minus 8   percent  That is quite a major change  Similarly, if we look at analysts' earnings forecasts for the   year 2001 and adjust them for the usual optimism they tend to have, a number close to 2 percent is      54  what they are expecting for growth in the year 2001 That clearly suggests some greater risk of   retrenchment with respect to capital investment and capital deepening, which have been, as you   know, a major part of the story thus far in our economy   Similarly, we've seen in other areas an ongoing tightening of financial conditions and   what I think someone described as a ""tenderness"" in balance sheets  When I looked at Moody’s   results to get a sense of all of this, their expectation is that between 385 and 400 companies will   default on bank loans, bonds, or other borrowings in the next 12 months  That is more than triple the   number of defaults we've had since December of 1999  These defaults, as I said, are driven by debt   burdens, higher costs of credit, energy, etc     So it seems to me that the risks are primarily to the down side and that the challenge today   is to figure out how best to respond to that  We obviously have two choices  One is to use language,   an option that I think is certainly heavily on the table  The other is to actually make a move with   respect to policy     So why am I not supporting a move in policy as my friend and colleague Governor   Gramlich is suggesting?  For a couple of reasons  One is that I believe some of the first-round   effects of our tightening moves are probably already behind us  Oil prices are likely to fall and the   futures market suggests that  Second, there is a slightly weaker dollar in the forecast, which I think   is probably going to materialize, and that will give us a bit of assistance  And third, frankly, I think   financial markets are ready to react quite abruptly to almost any change, and in my view our role   should be to make sure that their reactions don't end up being overreactions that then force us to take   another action      55  So, at this stage I think language is probably better than action, but I also believe we   should be quite flexible and ready to move if the incoming data suggest that my outlook here is   inaccurate  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation for the   reason you put forward, which in some sense has tended to be forgotten as we've gone around the   table  We are in a period, I believe, of great uncertainty  And I think it's not illegitimate for us to   recognize some uncertainty by saying that we tend to think the risks are in one direction  On the   other hand, it's not inappropriate to wait for a little confirmation  When we originally thought   through this complex set of issues on the language and so forth, we all knew we might get in this   position  And as abominable as that terrible article was in the Wall Street Journal, I think it did get   the concept, and lo and behold the world did not fall apart      82  So I'm actually very comfortable with exactly where you are  It reflects uncertainty and it   reflects the reality of a tough conversation  The markets will not think us foolish for not jumping   based on what is anecdotal evidence, but we are warning them--or in some sense maybe comforting   them--that we are awake and alive and if things work out in a certain way, we’re prepared to   respond  So I am quite comfortable with your proposal    "
6689,2001-01-03,"  Thank you very much  Let me open the floor for nominations for   two positions, that of Chairman of the FOMC and Vice Chairman of the FOMC  Governor   Kelley    I thought you might want to volunteer    Are there any other nominations?  Are there any objections?    Hearing no other nominations and no objections, let the record show that Alan Greenspan was   elected as Chairman and William McDonough was elected as Vice Chairman of the FOMC to   serve until the first meeting of the year 2002  Congratulations to you both    We do not allow for recounts and there is no one on this   Committee named Chad!     1/3/01 2  Now we can turn to the next piece of business, which is the selection of a Reserve   Bank to conduct System open market operations for the coming year  Are there any nominations   for that?  Governor Kelley, if you would like to volunteer, that might help move things along    Why don’t you propose New York for the moment?    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been nominated    Hearing no other nominations or objections, I will also note that the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York has been selected as the Bank authorized to conduct System open market operations   for the coming year  And with that, let me turn the meeting over to Chairman Greenspan  Thank   you    Mr Chairman, this is Governor Ferguson  I would also support both   parts of your proposal  The incoming data, particularly with respect to sales and production,   have indicated an ongoing weakness  To put that in the context of financial conditions, I look at   spreads and other indicators of tightness in financial markets  That tightness is to the point   where I think it will interplay with the real economy and that might lead growth to slow to a pace   that probably would be far below potential and probably totally inappropriate  Your proposal   today seems to be very well focused on the issues  And I hope the press statement can convey   exactly the kind of analysis that Bill McDonough and others have led us through   "
6708,2001-01-30,"  I move to close the meeting    I have a couple of questions, Peter  My first may be   similar to what President Hoenig was asking  Just this morning we had a discussion   about the long term  By doing this exploration of options for the short term, do you see   risks that in some sense you might be front-running the Committee and creating a market   expectation that in fact the potential long-term solution is very much in a particular   direction?  Given what I heard this morning, where almost no option seemed to be off the   table, I’m a little concerned that we may be creating a presumption either at the Desk or   in the markets that this is our preferred long-term solution  In some sense the exploratory   process could be viewed as a cat’s paw in leading the market toward that assumption    How do you think you can manage that?    Let me ask you two factual questions  The Chairman just   said that there is no effective exchange rate risk involved  On page 5 of your memo, one   of the things you say is that the margin needed to protect against both the price risk and     1/30-31/01 69  the exchange rate risk, even for dollar RPs against foreign governments, is uncertain  If   we go down this path, how much exchange rate risk is there really?  Is it zero?  I assume   it can be made manageable    One sense I would like to convey is that if we do this and   the issue of exchange rate risk comes up, I would prefer to give up some return in order   to minimize the exchange rate risk    Okay  My other concern is somewhat of an operational   question  In terms of the short-term aspects of this, if there are clearing issues, settlement   issues, and custody issues, is it your perception that those who run those kinds of   infrastructure operations could easily get through the clearing, settlement, and custody   concerns?  The thought behind my question is that this will effectively be creating a   much larger intermarket in some securities and RPs than had existed before     1/30-31/01 70   Okay    First I want to respond briefly to Jerry Jordan and support   what Don said  If it’s only a question of a few beers and pretzels, then I’d be supportive   of looking at both sides of the balance sheet  If it involves anything more than that, I   would suggest that we stay focused at this stage only on the one side of it     1/30-31/01 90  I’m assuming that implicit in what I heard you say is that you’re going to come   back by when--midyear--to try to give us some sense of your views about the short-term   options?    Okay    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Following the intelligent lead   of my colleague, I also will truncate what I was going to say  I was going to begin by   saying that the circumstances surrounding us seem filled with great uncertainty  But   having listened to everybody who has spoken thus far, in some sense I think the   circumstances surrounding us are filled with great unanimity and certainty, namely that   we do have a risk of what some people euphemistically have called a banana  I don’t   think we are there yet    We may be on a banana peel!  Let me note some of the   reasons I think we’re not fully there yet  First, most of the weakness that we’ve seen   clearly is in manufacturing; it has not yet spread broadly into services, but it’s broad and   deep in manufacturing  Secondly, as we start or move toward the middle of this process   of weakness, the banking sector still seems to be relatively strong, so that sector is   unlikely to add to our problems at this stage at least  A third reason, and others have   mentioned this, is that the real estate markets have been if anything relatively healthy     Having said all of that, obviously I think the risks are primarily to the down   side  We’ve already had quite an exposition on consumer confidence  I, like others, am     1/30-31/01 162  quite surprised and concerned about the very rapid change we have seen in that  And   even if it is a coincident indicator, it does not bode well for consumers actually helping to   shore up the economy  And like Bill McDonough, I would also put perhaps more weight   than others have on the state of business confidence  Obviously, a great deal of the   economy’s strength has been driven by investment behavior  In fact, the staff’s   expectation is that productivity will hold up I presume that it is built into the forecast that   we’ll get back to a situation where equipment and software investment is positive as   opposed to totally flat  In this expansion that kind of investment has been heavily   financed by the markets  The financing gap, as I’ve said before, is quite large by   historical standards, and that means that the tone in the financial markets is really quite   important now  It is true that the markets showed a rebound to somewhat healthier   conditions after our January 3rd move, but as the staff presentation pointed out, the   commercial paper market could be described as anything but healthy  And we also have   from the Senior Loan Officers' Survey ongoing evidence that conditions and standards   with respect to loans for medium size and larger companies continue to be tight   Others have raised the issue of strategy, so let me join in by commenting on   my general sense of what it should be  I think we’re faced with two alternatives  One,   which is bad but relatively manageable, is that associated with the baseline forecast  The   other alternative is far worse and perhaps even less manageable In that case, it does   strike me that the appropriate approach to strategy is to be very aggressive up front,   recognizing that we have a chance later to see exactly how the medicine has gone down,   if you will  I think it’s also important to remember, and no one else has mentioned this,   that we have a number of different things to say in our press statement in addition to our     1/30-31/01 163  decision on moving the fed funds rate  And even if we move it down by 50 basis points   today, having put in 100 basis points of easing within a month, it is far too early to   suggest that the balance of risks is anything other than to the down side  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I also   think that your analysis is absolutely right in the sense that what we’re dealing with is a   high-tech, highly productive economy that is slowing very quickly  We do have to be     1/30-31/01 184  careful because it could pick up again, but at this stage I think 50 basis points is   absolutely the right move and the balance of risks statement toward weakness is also   correct    Bill, does it matter to you if we announce when it’s   effective in your District?     1/30-31/01 192   But it’s not important to you that we announce--    That’s the operative point  "
6736,2001-03-20,"  I’ll also move that nomination    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The baseline in the Greenbook   attempts to paint what I would describe as a middle-of-the-road outlook for the economy,   with some signs--maybe premature--that the bottom has been reached  Indeed, as I’ve   heard others around the table say and as I look at the data myself, it's clear that one could   read some of the incoming information as indicating that perhaps the pace of weakening   in the economy has not accelerated  Retail sales and light vehicle sales still appear to be   holding up fairly well  At least one survey of consumer confidence suggests a   turnaround, though that survey was taken before the most recent break in the stock   market  The housing market continues to show some signs of life  And finally, there is   some evidence that the inventory adjustment, while still in train, may have slackened  So   there is some reason, perhaps, to be cautiously optimistic     Having said that, I have a number of concerns  With respect to the baseline   forecast, I agree with the point that Cathy Minehan made first and a few others picked up    It seems a bit incongruous that growth is forecast to return to a rate very close to potential   and yet the unemployment rate is projected to rise to a somewhat higher number than I   think is consistent with noninflationary growth  So I share some of the unease that others   have felt about the baseline in terms of the interaction between growth, the   unemployment rate, and the monetary policy assumptions in that forecast      3/20/01 69  The second point I’d like to make is that while we certainly can be hopeful that   the economy may have reached a bottom, we shouldn't let hope triumph over some sense   of reality  Beyond my concern about the baseline forecast itself, I am concerned, as are   others, about a number of downside risks to the baseline scenario, and I believe they   eventually will demand a total policy response greater than that envisioned in the   baseline  One of the major risks is that the capital goods overhang is greater than the   Greenbook assumes and that investment, therefore, will slow more significantly and for a   longer period than is currently anticipated  The Greenbook actually states that “In the   staff projection, actual and desired stocks of capital are assumed to be in reasonably close   alignment at the present time,” implying that investment will hold up well   I think that's a rather bold assumption, given these uncertain times  Some   relatively simple work with the underlying models suggests that we may find that not to   be the case  Using some reasonable assumptions, the model equations indicate that the   investment in high-tech goods in the fourth quarter could have been as much as 20   percent higher than target levels  And with the standard model parameters that could   easily produce a scenario in which high-tech investment might grow in low single digits--  below 5 percent--between now and 2003 or 2004  David Stockton indicated in his   remarks that there was a range of potential outcomes  Rapidly downshifting profit   forecasts, combined with less accommodative financial conditions from a declining stock   market and banks that are tightening terms and conditions in the face of monetary easing,   make a slower path of investment a strong possibility in my view  That may not be the   most likely scenario but it is not one that we can reject out of hand     3/20/01 70  Of greater concern, obviously, is that if we do get the slowing in high-tech   capital stock growth, it would undermine the increase in productivity that we've   experienced of late  And it could lead to an even further falloff in the GDP--a result I   think the staff appropriately captures in its productivity slowdown simulation--which, in   my judgment, is a terribly unattractive outcome   A third risk is that the weakness in equity markets might be more severely   damaging to consumer confidence--and ultimately spending--than has been the case to   date  Many of us have noted the apparent disconnect between confidence measures,   which are at close to recessionary levels, and actual data on spending, which are   reasonably strong  If this disconnect continues, how this tension will be resolved is as yet   unknowable  Clearly we are going to need more data before we can assume that the   worst is really behind us  Contrary to the assumption in the baseline, I think the risk is   very real that consumer confidence will be undermined further by a jittery stock market--  which may or may not soon stabilize--and by the specter of unemployment, which is   certainly going to get worse before it gets better  Negative wealth effects will certainly   hold down consumption growth both this year and next, making our challenge even   greater  The Fed of the early 1990s was confronted with banks that were afraid to lend    We may yet enter a period with consumers who are too concerned to spend   If any of these outcomes were to come to pass, the growth rate of GDP would   be well below potential for several years--too long, in my judgment  And unemployment   would rise to levels that are by almost any estimate above the level required to restrain   inflation  In this circumstance it seems to me that the best response is one that I would   describe as both aggressive and cautious  On the one hand, I think we have to respond     3/20/01 71  very clearly to the incoming data  We should not be afraid to do what we think is right   for the real economy because of some concern about disappointing the markets and not   acceding to unreasonable market expectations  On the other hand, we should not be   overly cautious in adjusting monetary policy out of some concern that we may be   perceived to be feeding the markets  In my view we also will need a great deal of   flexibility in the period ahead because, though the incoming data suggest that the   economy may be bottoming out, the evidence is still quite mixed, as many of you have   asserted   Such a policy response is not without its own challenges, as I'm sure we will   discuss  But we must recognize that we are in a risky environment regardless of what   path we choose  We are dealing with both an uncertain real economy and unpredictable   psychology among consumers and businesses  We will have to tread very carefully, but I   think we should not be paralyzed by the uncertainties that we face  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can endorse your   recommendation  I'd like to speak to each of its three parts   First, a cut of 50 basis points does seem to me to be appropriately targeted at   the real economy  Any more would appear to be targeted inappropriately at the stock     3/20/01 96  market--and I endorse your general concept of why that is not the role of a central bank--  and any less would clearly be too little in my judgment, given the risks   On the balance of risks statement, the language is written in the context of our   goals of price stability and sustainable growth  Therefore, if we're seeing growth in the   foreseeable future that is likely to be below our estimate of appropriate trend growth, then   we can legitimately continue with a statement that says the risks are weighted mainly   toward conditions that may generate economic weakness  I believe this is an important   element of interpretation  If in fact the economy were growing appreciably but from a   very low base and we still thought that growth was unacceptably slow because it was   below trend, then it would be legitimate intellectually to say that the risks are toward   economic weakness   With respect to the hint of an intermeeting move in the press release, I am   concerned about adding some new language whose presence or absence could be   something that the market is looking for after every meeting in the future  We did that in   December  I think it worked well  We did not do it at our last meeting and that was okay   as well  So I don't think the market has gotten into the habit of looking for this kind of   language to indicate future policy moves  However, it is always important, and in fact   it’s common sense, to suggest that we are attentive to the incoming data  So, given the   degree of risk and uncertainty, and given the amount of time between now and the next   scheduled meeting, I think it is probably better--though it is not an easy judgment to   make--to include a sentence that suggests we will be particularly attentive to incoming   data    When I spoke earlier, I believe I said this is a judgment   call  Clearly, the tone of this discussion suggests that there are judgments on either side    If we look at this language in the context of the whole paragraph, I think it gives us the   right kind of flexibility without over-committing us  As I said before, I would be very   concerned if we were moving toward having to vote on this sort of additional language at   each meeting, but we are not in that mode  You clearly are not putting us in that mode,   Mr Chairman  What you are suggesting, as the language says, is that conditions are   evolving very rapidly  And I think it is quite legitimate for a central bank to say that in   such a circumstance, with economic conditions evolving very quickly, the financial   situation is quite fragile both domestically and internationally  So, guess what?  We are   going to be vigilant and we are going to be monitoring developments especially closely   Though it seems to me a judgment call, it is not unreasonable to ask the   Committee to communicate that message to the market  On the one hand, it is an obvious   statement in that we're always looking at incoming developments closely  On the other   hand, given the fragility that we've seen and the interplay of various developments to     3/20/01 106  which the statement alludes, I think it is really quite intelligent of the central bank of the   United States to state clearly that we are watching  It does not commit us to do anything    Indeed, as the data unfold, we may do nothing  But it tells the markets that we are indeed   awake  Yes, there is a risk that the markets will look to every number and react to it, but   we can ultimately manage that  If we don't react, then the market will learn from that    So, in some sense I think this gives us the right degree of flexibility  Though obviously   I'm not downplaying the risk on the other side, by and large to me this is the better   option    Yes  "
6757,2001-04-11,"   Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is Roger Ferguson   speaking  I agree that the incoming data since our meeting, as Dave Wilcox and Ned   Gramlich have suggested, have been a bit on the soft side  Obviously, it’s easy to focus   on the good news of the household side, but the orders and shipments data for February   are both softer real numbers that we’ve seen and also the anecdotal reports continue to be   disturbingly weak from my standpoint  One could look at the unemployment numbers as   perhaps a sign of some improvement, but I could also easily find ways to look at those     4/11/01 22   numbers as suggesting that the risks are starting to spread  I’ve noticed that no one has   talked about the nonmanufacturing NAPM survey, which for the first time in a long while   also showed some weakness  I also agree with your evaluation of the profits issue, Mr   Chairman  I am growing increasingly concerned that the outlook and certainly the   expectations with respect to profits continue to be revised down  That would suggest to   me that business people who are closest to the markets are more concerned and not less   so  That might well have negative spillover effects on investment, which I think is an   important point     Putting this all together, while I recognize the consensus is for some pickup in   growth in the second half of the year, it’s really not out of the question that we may   continue to muddle through with downward revisions to the forecast  We could end up   having a longer period this year--several quarters, not just the first and second--in which   growth is at a number starting with one  And even if growth were to pick up a bit in the   second part of the year, there is still a notable output gap  All of this suggests to me, as   others have said, that over the next several meetings we are likely to be moving rates   down as opposed to staying pat  On the question of intermeeting moves, I could line up with everybody else   and say that it’s probably better not to do them  On the other hand, I don’t believe that   our meeting schedule was set with any sort of divine intervention  It’s not as though we   knew that the dates we chose last year would be ideal for making decisions about the   macroeconomic conditions of this year  Therefore, while I would prefer not to move   between meetings, I frankly don’t believe that we necessarily have to wait for a crisis   either  I think we should be willing to move, particularly if the period between meetings     4/11/01 23   is uncomfortably long, as the data start to mount and as a consensus on the outlook starts   to emerge  We haven’t seen all the data coming forth, but I’m very supportive, Mr   Chairman, of your notion that if the information we receive over the next week or so   continues to show an erosion, then we should be prepared to move  It probably will not   be that much of a surprise to the markets  It will certainly be easily justifiable  And   mainly our challenge should be to do what is right for the economy and not necessarily to   try to live by a meeting schedule that we set last year when I suspect most of us weren’t   expecting to be talking about economic growth close to 1 percent  Thank you  "
6775,2001-04-18,"  Mr Chairman, this is Roger Ferguson speaking from   Dallas  I have three points to make  One is that I find much of the recent information to   be really quite mixed  Much of it could be viewed as positive but a number of   developments, even since our last conference call, have been negative  Consumer     4/18/01 12   confidence has fallen off again after apparently flattening out a bit  The most recent   employment and unemployment data were a surprise with respect to the job loss figures,   though admittedly there were some upward revisions as well  Even today’s numbers with   respect to the international aspect of the economy suggest that consumers, one of the   elements of strength to date, may be pulling back a bit  And though activity in the   construction and housing sector is obviously still quite strong, the trajectory may have   flattened  So I would argue that some of the data that have come in even since our phone   call last week, and certainly since our March meeting, suggest to me at least that it is too   early to call a bottom  Indeed, in my view the risks are certainly still to the down side                Secondly, I also have talked to many business people and others in my travels    I do feel that some of them are a bit more optimistic about the second part of the year    But they are not clear, and I’m not sure we are clear just yet, about exactly what interest   rate it’s going to take to support the kind of moderate expectations that seem to be   starting to form  It may well be that the markets have it right in that we’ll have to go   even lower on the funds rate before we’ve reached the end of this easing process     Finally, my third point is that it’s always difficult to make a move during an   intermeeting period  As I said the last time, and as others have noted today, the meeting   schedule obviously is set without any knowledge of what the economy is going to call   for  I believe that when we’re contemplating an intermeeting move we have to balance   the potential loss of credibility and the possibility of confusion--and there certainly will   be some--against the need to respond appropriately and ensure that markets understand   that we are awake and ready to do what is appropriate  Trying to achieve that balance   involves making a judgment call  We may make it differently each time we have a     4/18/01 13   discussion and each individual may make it differently  But I think we should recognize   that there is always a balance of considerations  From my perspective it is quite   reasonable and easy to communicate why we chose to move at this point, namely because   we have a very long intermeeting period, the data that have been coming in are consistent   with a lower federal funds rate, and a consensus has emerged  So I think we should go   ahead and move as you proposed  "
6796,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In reviewing the incoming data and   market conditions in preparation for this meeting I, like others, was struck by the apparent   disconnect between the marketplace and economists  Since our March meeting, with some   zigzagging, equity indices--which are thought to lead the real economy--have in fact experienced     5/15/01     64   growth of 6 to 9 percent, perhaps signaling an expected turnaround in the not too distant future    The dollar also has remained strong, again suggesting that many think the United States is the   place for their funds to be  Finally, fixed-income investors are demanding returns that suggest   they have a more optimistic assessment  And, indeed, businesses are issuing bonds to fill their   coffers  Therefore, one could argue that the markets actually are forecasting a somewhat brighter   outlook than most economists  However, one must also ask what interest rate assumptions are   conditioning market behavior, and for the answer I think one can turn to the fed funds futures   market  That indicator suggests that the markets are expecting a decrease in the funds rate at this   meeting on the order of 50 basis points  So if one is looking to the financial markets for some   guidance on what the future is likely to be, it’s also important to ask what interest rate   assumptions are built in   We should contrast this moderately more upbeat outlook from the markets with our   own dour assessment, based on what I’ve heard around the table  Our economists have talked   about the reductions in the Greenbook forecast and I’ve heard three or four Reserve Bank   presidents suggest that their own forecasts have been marked down  It’s always hard to go   against the markets, but I think in this case the staff who produce the Greenbook and other   economists probably have a slightly better sense of what is ahead of us  It is tempting to think   that the bottom has been reached, but in my view it is far too early to have much of a conviction   that the bottom is at hand or that the future is clear  Therefore, I find the Greenbook quite   credible and I believe the downside risks described in the Greenbook should not be taken lightly   Incoming data seem to indicate that the economic weakness that started with motor   vehicles is now relatively widespread  Although motor vehicle production now appears to be   holding up, there is indeed a risk that production in that sector will fall back later this year if     5/15/01     65   sales do not pick up  But it also appears that the output of high-tech industries and production in   the remaining sectors of the manufacturing industry continue to be restrained by excess   inventories  Indeed, the inventory/shipments ratio is up for manufacturing overall  This   weakness in manufacturing in turn is holding down capital spending and capacity growth, both   currently and probably for next year as well  As long as businesses are suffering from what is   called a classic profits recession and they continue to withhold plans to increase capital spending,   the only engine of growth seems to be consumers  The most recent retail sales numbers, with   downward revisions to February and March, suggest that consumers may well pull in their horns   a bit too, in response to the wealth destruction they’ve already experienced and the drumbeat of   unemployment announcements that they are hearing     By my estimation, the risk around the Greenbook forecast is also clearly to the down   side  With an economy growing--and likely to continue to grow far below its potential--the risk   of a shock, be it domestic or international, pushing the economy into negative territory is, for my   taste, uncomfortably high  We cannot rule out a worse outcome than the baseline forecast,   perhaps one approximating the “weak household demand” scenario described in the Greenbook    Given this outlook and the risk I believe we face, the obvious question is  What is the proper   policy response?  In answering that question, we should be clear about what we are trying to do   and what we are not trying to do  We’re not trying to stabilize unemployment at unsustainably   low levels  Nor in fact are we trying to speed up the investment accelerator, because I don’t   think we can do that  The most I believe we can do is to cushion the economy to allow business   plans to gel more firmly and to maintain some semblance of consumer confidence    While I recognize that we have moved aggressively and have front-loaded our actions,   I think we should not slow our pace of easing moves at this meeting  We must always act in the     5/15/01     66   context of our long-term goal of price stability  But I do not believe that there is a very great risk   of an unmanageable outbreak of inflation during the relevant policy horizon  Indeed, as I look at   market expectations and various surveys, the markets in general are telling us that they also don’t   expect inflation to pick up to unmanageable levels in the near term  However, we do need to   have some guide or anchor and in that regard, like Jerry Jordan, I found the chart in the Bluebook   very, very helpful  What that chart suggests is that with inflation expectations anchored around 2   percent, the current real interest rate is probably just about neutral  Given my outlook, which is   not too dissimilar from the Greenbook’s, and the balance of risks that I see, I think we should be   willing to move to a slightly stimulative stance of policy at this meeting  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation    I’m fortunate in my speaking order because I can agree with some of what the four people who   spoke prior to me had to say  First, I think President Poole is absolutely right to remind us that   the language on the balance of risks has to do with the economy and that we clearly tried to get     5/15/01     90   away from predicting what we might do in terms of policy  I happen to think that as of today the   balance of risks is more toward the down side and, therefore, that the current language should be   retained  I agree with President Stern that there is always some risk of overshooting  And in that   sense I will also join Governor Meyer in that I, too, don’t know what the future is going to be, so I   don’t think we should try to signal one way or the other  Because there is great uncertainty, I   agree with what Governor Kelley had to say, which is that we shouldn’t try to send a message   about the future in our press statement because the future is unknown  Contrary to the fact that   we use the words “foreseeable future” in our statement, it actually is not foreseeable  [Laughter]    I don’t know who suggested that we should use those words!  But very seriously, I don’t think we   should try to signal too much in this statement  And finally, there is a point on which I honestly   have to disagree with you, Mr Chairman  While you should certainly feel free to present your   views in an upcoming speech, I would be very concerned if there emerges a perception that   through speeches we are trying to do anything just yet  There is a desire, I suspect, to make clear   that inflation is a concern  We don’t want markets to think that we aren’t concerned about it  But   given the prevailing degree of uncertainty, I’d prefer that the press statement speak for itself and   then when we get back together have another statement that speaks for itself      I guess I come in on the other side, in that this seems to me an   accurate statement of fact  I think the markets will understand what we saw that led us to make a   move  I also agree with the Vice Chairman that we shouldn’t try to send too many signals  I   believe this statement is a fairly accurate description of our discussion and I would keep it very   much as it is  "
6819,2001-06-26," But, Bill, isn’t part of your point that no capital service is being   gained from this investment and that’s why it ends up looking as though there’s really no   productivity improvement?  That’s because there’s no service that gets paid off from this   investment   It’s creating an expense   So it’s really a problem of service being generated as opposed to   the accounting concept, which is the definition of service here   Back on the tax cut issue You make an assumption--rightly, I   think-- about how much of the spending is going to come out of inventories  But I don't see   anyone suggesting that any of the spending is going to be used for imports, which in a   mathematical sense would be a drag on GDP  How should we think about that?  Is that such a   small number that we shouldn’t worry about it at all? Or has it just not been talked about much   and we probably should think about it?   May I jump in?  I think one of the other points that has been made   in this area--you've made it before but you didn’t make it this time--is that this type of capital   tends to depreciate relatively quickly compared to some other types  I assume that's part of your   thinking as you consider how this gap might start to close  Is that a fair point?   Right   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the incoming   data have indicated to me at least that it is still too early to declare that the economy has     6/26-27/01 120   bottomed  While we knew that the data would be weak, in fact they have been weaker than we   expected The gradual erosion of the national economy appears to be unabated   The manufacturing sector continues to face a daunting environment  With capacity   utilization at a level nearly matching the lows of the 1990-91 period, this sector could   legitimately be described as being in recession  More importantly for the longer term, production   of high-tech goods fell sharply in May and April, and industry contacts suggest that inventories   remained bloated in both the semiconductor and communications equipment industries  And   while computers may have hit bottom, that industry is unlikely to reverse its relatively flat   production pattern quickly Yesterday’s orders and shipments data, while a surprise to the   market, are quite consistent with this general sense of relative weakness in the high-tech sector,   as Dave Stockton has indicated  Importantly, while manufacturing has been the center of this   cyclical episode, the NAPM nonmanufacturing index suggests the possibility that this weakness   may well be spreading   Evidence from the labor markets similarly suggests continued weakness  The most   recent employment report indicates that businesses are still either shedding workers in some   cases or adding workers at a much more gradual pace  In addition, businesses are maintaining   hours of production and nonsupervisory workers at a level below that of the first quarter  Weekly   initial claims data point toward ongoing labor market weakness and, at the mid-400,000 range,   initial claims are at levels not too dissimilar from those seen in 1991   To be sure, there has been some good news  The housing sector continues to hold up   well and consumer confidence appears to be firmer  But these are exceptions in the face of   mainly negative news  As Dave Stockton noted and Governor Gramlich just reiterated,   forecasters in both the Federal Reserve and the private sector have trimmed their near-term     6/26-27/01 121   outlooks While most have faith that the economy will not have even one quarter of negative   growth, I think confidence in that relatively favorable outcome, at least for me, has been tested   with almost every new piece of data  However, as many have indicated, policy works with a lag   and hence we must try to discern the future  Unfortunately, the future is distinctly murky and   some factors are likely to weigh on the economy more than the baseline forecast envisions   In the business sector, analysts expect a rapid rebound in earnings  But given the   ongoing weakness of the economy, it’s hard to have any certainty that these observers are correct    Should earnings disappoint, as seems likely, the appetite of businesses for new investments may   well be slower to rebound than many currently assume  And investors would see some further   erosion of wealth as well, which could weigh on consumer spending   Another imponderable is the effect of the tax cut  It certainly will add stimulus in the   second half of this year and going forward  The question is how much, I think, and that is subject   to some uncertainty  We can make assumptions about the marginal propensity to consume out of   tax cuts and how that consumption will be divided across imported goods, goods coming out of   inventories, and new production But we must also recognize that while confidence appears to be   holding against a backdrop of rising unemployment and in the face of high household   indebtedness, consumers may be reluctant to spend according to any pre-existing model   Finally, in addition to the uncertainties inherent in our own evolving situation, we   should be mindful that our trading partners might also be headed for a period of subpar growth    Just as with the domestic forecast, weaker-than-expected incoming data in many countries have   forced some marking down of foreign growth prospects  Slower growth abroad in combination   with a strong dollar is likely to continue to limit export opportunities  Therefore, in my   judgment, the risks remain distinctly to the downside     6/26-27/01 122   Against this backdrop of a very slow economy, I believe that inflation is unlikely to be   an important factor in the near to intermediate term, and that does give us some policy flexibility    While we have been aggressive in our actions to date, I think our challenge is to decide how to   respond at this point And given the ongoing weakness, I believe that we are likely to find that   our work has not yet been completed  As I said at our last meeting, our goal is not to try to speed   up an investment accelerator, which policy cannot do  Nor should our goal be to stop a   redressing of imbalances, which policy should not do  Our goal, I think, should be to cushion the   household sector and interest-sensitive sectors as much as possible in order to give businesses a   chance to work through their inventories and to return to a period of growth in investment   spending Should the bond market optimists, as Governor Gramlich has described them, turn out   to be prescient, then we may have to retrace our steps very quickly; and we should be aware of   that as a possibility But for today, at least, I think a bit more easing does seem to be the better   course   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I concur with your recommendation    With respect to the issue that President Stern raised, when incoming data are weaker than we   expect--particularly when the economy is as weak as this one is or is growing as slowly as this   one is--I think it's not unreasonable to react to them  If the data came in exactly as we expected, I   don't think that would call for reaction  What has happened is that they have been weaker  And   if the economy continues to weaken, we may find ourselves having to act again  With respect to   the language, I happen to believe that over the foreseeable future the balance of risks is toward   economic weakness, and our language reflects that  Whether or not the futures market builds in   anything I think depends very much on the data between now and the next meeting  "
6849,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the Committee is faced with     8/21/01 45   the question of whether or not to accept and adopt the Greenbook's baseline forecast, which   frankly, given where we are starting is a relatively attractive forecast  It points to a return of the   economy to its downwardly revised potential growth for the forecast horizon, with PCE inflation   remaining contained  Optimists--indeed some people at this table--have already pointed to some   tentative signs that the economy has bottomed  One of those relatively positive signs is the trend   in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, which have fallen below 400,000 for four   consecutive weeks Others have pointed to homebuilding, which as measured by housing starts   rose at the fastest pace in 17 months  It is true also that retail sales came in surprisingly strong   when adjusted for falling gasoline prices  And our own IP data can be and have been read by   some as indicating that industrial production has begun to stabilize    Unfortunately, I do not think any of these data, particularly given the fact that they are   only one month’s worth, have been sufficiently strong to be indicative of a bottoming much less   a likely return to more robust growth  They are certainly not strong enough to give us much   comfort or to support the view that we should do nothing at this meeting  An outcome such as   the baseline is actually more hope than reality at this stage, and in making policy I think we   would be well advised to put significant odds on an adverse outcome for aggregate demand,   particularly capital spending Some of the evidence in that direction includes our own Beige   Book, which indicates ongoing weakness, as well as the staff’s forecast, which was again revised   down in the face of weaker than expected incoming data  Though consumer spending has been a   bastion of strength, as others have noted, mounting job losses and a declining stock market   performance could indeed threaten to weaken consumer behavior  The profit outlook is certainly   not yet firm, which indicates that business investment is unlikely to return to robust growth in the   near to intermediate term and indeed may weaken further  While businesses have     8/21/01 46   opportunistically liquefied their balance sheets, the demand for loans is off, again suggesting that   businesses sense no need to invest for an upturn in future demand  And our earlier concerns   about weakness overseas are clearly starting to materialize, in part due to weakness here and in   part due to the general high-tech retrenchment that is influencing a large number of economies    In my view the forecast of a turnaround overseas is again based more on a question of what   should be as opposed to what appears likely   In the face of all this weakness and the sense that the risks, at least in my mind, are to   the downside, some have argued that we should probably do nothing  There could be a number   of reasons adduced for not responding to the recent data, which have been weaker than we   expected, or for not responding to the downward adjustments in the forecast  One of those   reasons is that policy works with long lags and we might be stoking the fires of future inflation    We cannot be complacent here, but for the risk of future inflation to become an immediate and   overriding policy concern today we must believe that one of two states is going to emerge     The first of those states is that the economy is going to rebound so quickly that we’ll   be unable to adjust policy, which would imply either that we won’t be able to read the incoming   data or that we won't have the fortitude to respond to them  I think both of those things are   unlikely The second state that would warrant favoring no policy action today is that we are   worried that the labor market tightness we have seen is not likely to abate and we believe that   inflation is going to rise even in the face of below-trend growth  Now the extreme version of this   view is so-called stagflation I think we've had only one case of stagflation, and that one case   was driven by a surprise increase in oil prices  So it seems that we are unlikely to face great   stagflation risks because I believe we’re unlikely to get a surprise on the oil price front or any   other shock that would throw the economy way off in terms of creating pressures for a sudden     8/21/01 47   uptick in inflation A third risk is that inflation might pick up gradually over time  At this stage   that seems to me far less of a policy concern than that weakness itself will become more   widespread and longer lasting   Now, there is a second school of argument against responding to the incoming data and   the downward revision in the forecast  That second school of argument says that frequent rate   changes add to uncertainty and that our accompanying statements create a negative psychology    In fact, I think markets have built in an expectation of a Fed easing today and I believe the   uncertainty would be greater if we didn't respond to the incoming data than if we moved forward   and reduced rates I would also say that--rather than adding to consumer malaise--honest   statements of a central bank, even if they are not reassuring, build credibility far more than   would a false sense of optimism  So I think it's quite important that our statements reflect reality   as we see it and the risks as we understand them   A third argument that has been adduced against lowering rates at this meeting is that   reducing rates over-stimulates a few sectors  Again, this is plausible; in fact, it's true  It reflects   the fact that interest rate adjustments clearly work through their impact on interest-sensitive   sectors When we raise rates, housing is hurt; when we lower rates, housing is helped  By   influencing asset prices and activities in interest-sensitive sectors, we influence the entire   economy  We should not refuse to act because we do not like the transmission mechanisms of   monetary policy If we were to follow that approach, we would obviously be tying both hands   behind our backs   I believe the final argument against adjusting rates at this meeting is that we may in   fact find that rates are too stimulative and thus that we are over-stimulating the economy  In that   regard we should recognize, as we think about the range of the estimated equilibrium real rate,     8/21/01 48   that the actual equilibrium real rate would gradually go down as the economy weakens  So the   degree of stimulus actually starts to decrease if we keep rates unchanged in the face of a   weakening economy   Let me conclude by saying that in my judgment the baseline forecast is a hope more   than a reality, the risks are certainly to the downside, and the arguments against moving rates   down at this policy meeting strike me as far weaker than the arguments in favor of moving them   Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation   Mr Chairman, you said meeting dates and location  I presume the   date would stay the same but the location might change if circumstances warrant    "
6888,2001-09-17," Mr Chairman, if I may speak?   This is Governor Ferguson I fully support your   recommendation  I would also say that in many of our statements we have expressed     9/17/01 5   some optimism about the long-term prospects for the US economy and I think it’s   important to reiterate that as well if we have a chance to do so   Second   I’ll tell you what I know  Bill, being physically closer,   may know more and may also want to comment  To be frank, both my wife and I were   watching this pretty closely over the weekend and I’ve had a number of phone     9/17/01 11   conversations I would bring three things to your attention  First, as all of you   undoubtedly have noticed if you’ve looked at your Bank’s balance sheets, particularly in   Richmond, the Bank of New York problem, which had been a major issue on Thursday,   was quite well resolved by the end of the day on Friday  I will commend some of the   staff who are not here because Federal Reserve staff played an important role in helping   the Bank of New York resolve its telecommunications problems  The Bank of New York   has created another backup site for one of its locations at One Wall Street that did not   have a backup site They now have the high-speed connections that are required to make   their system run more smoothly  So that major problem seems to be fixed   Second, the connectivity tests that occurred over the weekend seem to have   gone quite well--I think better than even the most optimistic expectations--for the New   York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ as well  The American Stock Exchange will   open; it is key for a few securities, most importantly for the exchange traded funds, the   ETFs They will open in technical locations that are in New York Stock Exchange   facilities in Philadelphia So, all that seems to have gone well  The important point to   note on this is that the tests conducted were tests of connectivity  They were not tests   with respect to the stresses that might emerge with volume  So, while many people are   hopeful, it’s not clear exactly how everything is going to work with heavy volume   Third, I’ve also been told that some of the concern about physical   infrastructure on Wall Street--buildings in particular--has abated, at least with respect to   the one building that was of greatest concern toward the end of last week  We have in   that regard a situation that is quite fluid and still has to be monitored       9/17/01 12    Bill, that’s generally what I have picked up over the course of the weekend  I   don’t know if you have any new information or corrections you want to make to what   I’ve said  "
6907,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have said, in the   short run we are facing potentially the start of a crisis of confidence both among   businesses and households, which is likely to interact with the pre-existing weak   macroeconomic environment to lead to a slide in economic activity  Both the length and   the depth of that slide are uncertain but they could conceivably be longer and deeper than   in the baseline forecast Therefore, our challenge today is to take actions to attempt to   avoid one of the more pessimistic consumer confidence scenarios     10/2/01 65   Even before September 11th indicators of household behavior were somewhat   troubling Housing activity and particularly single-family starts, which had been a source   of strength, had softened a bit  Consumer confidence was also sliding even before the   attacks occurred, and that slide of confidence has certainly continued following   September 11th Last week’s initial claims for unemployment insurance jumped,   indicating further stress for households With more layoff announcements, especially in   the airline sector, and the likely multiplier effects for related industries, there is ample   reason to believe that last week’s increase in initial claims is likely to be the precursor to   further increases in unemployment  Against this set of incoming data, the Greenbook’s   baseline forecast of unemployment reaching close to 6 percent does not seem out of the   realm of possibility at all  In the context of such a rise in unemployment, it is unlikely   that even the few retailers that saw a return to planned performance last week can be   complacent that conditions in the household sector will support a return to a reasonable   pace of growth     Similarly, indicators on the business sector were also mixed and negative even   before September 11th Declines in business fixed investment, particularly in the high-  tech categories, continued unabated  Informal contacts and surveys of banks and other   businesses suggest that the uncertainty about the consumer response to the attacks is   feeding through to uncertainty among businesses as well  Many banks report a sharp   drop-off in demand for business loans after September 11th, suggesting that small   businesses in particular are less willing to risk capital on expanding investment spending   during this period of uncertainty     10/2/01 66   While the auto industry is struggling to create demand by providing strong   incentives, in a survey that straddled the September 11th date, the NAPM reported that   manufacturing activity fell again in September, marking the fourteenth month of a factory   slump     The conditions leading to a downward trajectory in the real sector have been   reinforced in financial markets  Over $1 trillion of equity wealth has been lost since   September 11th, which will almost certainly lead to a greater retrenchment by consumers    While equity indices have declined 10 to 20 percent over this intermeeting period, fixed   income markets have not become more accommodative  As for the question Cathy   Minehan raised, I think that at least in the government sector the bond market is driven   by concerns about the budget outlook, since the TIPS market doesn’t seem to indicate   any increase in inflation concerns In the below-investment-grade corporate bond sector,   concerns about risks seem to be the predominant factor leading long-term rates to remain   stubbornly high  Additionally, while large banks claim that they have not tightened terms   and standards on business loans since the attacks, they do admit to watching closely for   signs of deterioration Bankers clearly understand that default risk has increased, and   they will certainly act to protect their income and capital positions as much as possible    Unfortunately, the international sector is unlikely to add any strength to the   near-term outlook  Equity markets in almost all industrial economies have been hit by   the same reevaluation of business prospects that has affected our equity markets    Similarly, safe haven flows from the dollar, the euro, and the pound sterling into the   Swiss franc indicate that market participants may be rethinking the short-term prospects   for a number of economies      10/2/01 67   The most positive development from the international sector is that oil prices   seem unlikely to spike higher, which is helpful on the inflation front but indicates that the   supply and demand dynamics in that market are consistent with a future of slowing   growth globally   Against this background, I believe that policy must respond  A number of   speakers have raised questions about the level of the real interest rate  It’s important to   note that since 1960 there have been six periods of slowdown  During five of those   periods, the real interest rate touched zero and during two of those periods it was   decidedly negative So if we allow the real fed funds rate to drop to zero or close to it   through the decisions that we make today, that will not in any sense be unprecedented   The markets are certainly expecting a response today  And I think to disappoint them   risks setting off a global reaction that might be difficult to control  We are, as others   have said, benefited by the fact that both inflation and inflation expectations are well   contained It is right to point out that in the longer run we may confront a potential   interaction between a stimulative monetary policy and a stimulative fiscal policy as our   monetary policy stimulus and more stimulus from the fiscal side are both called upon to   counter the risk of further slowing in the economy  But even recognizing the challenge   that might emerge from unpredictable long-term policy interactions, I believe that we   need to set a priority today on the immediate macroeconomic challenge and the real   downside risks confronting us in the near term  Thank you   I also support your recommendation  "
6931,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our decision today, as Jerry Jordan has   just indicated, comes at a time of great uncertainty  I think our challenge is to minimize the risk   facing our economy in these uncertain times  As we have already indicated around the table, there   are some positive signs that can’t be overlooked  Certainly the strength in light vehicle sales is   attributable to incentives to some extent, but there are those who believe that it’s more than that and   may reflect some positive sentiment remaining among households  Several forward-looking   financial markets, particularly the equity markets and the futures markets--and perhaps even the   level of the US dollar--attest to a market expectation of a rapid rebound  And finally, as has   already been discussed, monetary stimulus is in the pipeline and fiscal policy may well become more   accommodative     However, buried within these potentially positive signs are some negative ones, and we   have already talked about those to some extent  The current strength in auto sales is probably   borrowing from future demand and we can expect demand for autos to fall off  There is the   possibility that the process of finding a fiscal stimulus package that works for all will produce fiscal   action that is too little, too complex, and too late  And finally, the strength in equity markets may   well erode quite rapidly and we could have a negative wealth effect as earnings fail to meet the   expectations that are built into equity market prices     Against the background in which much of the good news in the near term is potentially   bad, certainly there’s a lot of other negative news as well  Labor market weakness is spreading   beyond manufacturing to other sectors  With the specter of growing unemployment likely to weigh   more heavily on consumers, weakness in the labor market will mean, I think, smaller increases in   wages and salaries going forward, potentially undermining consumption as a major driver of   macroeconomic strength this year and next year  While the housing market appears to be robust,     11/6/01 61   there is some anecdotal evidence from building materials firms that suggests some weakening in the   construction segment  One of our contacts noted that for the first time since late 1991 several   construction firms plan to close down between Thanksgiving and Christmas because of insufficient   order backlogs Again that’s a small sign of some uncertainty in an area that has been strong for   some time   More recent data on durable goods orders suggest that companies are hoarding liquidity   and more firms than had been expected are holding off on putting new fixed investments in place    Participants in the bond market tell us that even the record-setting bond issuance, which could be   seen as an indicator of business confidence, is better interpreted as indicating that the free cash flow   for firms is insufficient to cover even existing investment activities much less support new ones    And finally, as I think Dave Stockton mentioned, survey indicators show that manufacturing is   clearly contracting and I gather that our own IP numbers may well support that conclusion     We haven’t put very much weight on the international outlook, though I would agree with   Vice Chairman McDonough that Karen’s forecast seems to be the most reasonable one given the   facts we know now but that the risks internationally certainly are very much to downside  And   insofar as commodity prices tend to suggest the relative balance of supply and demand in global   markets, certainly commodity prices are suggesting further slowing, not a pickup     The question is how to guide policy with this confluence of developments  Recognizing   the risk that we might do too much, I would still err on the side of continuing to be aggressive, which   I think speaks directly to the point Jerry Jordan was just making  The best strategy when confronted   with an ongoing deterioration is to move to offset the worst downside risk and prepare to respond to   the upside in the unlikely event that we’re surprised in that direction       11/6/01 62   While it is true that monetary policy in the pipeline is already stimulative, it’s important to   recognize that we put that policy in place against a particular background of a forecast and outlook at   the time and, if anything, the outlook has continued to erode  Accordingly, I think that does require   ongoing policy response The one mistake that a central bank can make when confronted with the   type of erosion that we are facing, which may indeed include the risk of disinflation, is to move   sluggishly in increments that are too small out of fear of hitting the zero bound too quickly  That   cautious strategy is the most risky because it leaves open the possibility of a much weaker situation   still in the context of little room for policy maneuver     So, while Bob McTeer encouraged us to remember the Alamo, I would suggest that   perhaps the experiences of the Bank of Japan and others might be important to remember as well    Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I support it for the   reasons that you gave   Well, could we say the “appropriate” or the “necessary” diversion of   resources to enhance security or something along those lines to suggest that it is well understood that   resources will be used in this way?  "
6957,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The conversation thus far has indicated that   it is extraordinarily difficult to identify with great certainty turning points in the economic cycle  A   number of people have already pointed to some of the positives that emerged in the intermeeting   period, including retail sales, new orders of durable goods, auto sales, et cetera  I would only add to   that by saying that even our appropriately cautious financial and forecasting gurus here at the Fed have   looked at those data and produced a Greenbook that for the first time in several rounds does not   feature a downward revision to the outlook However, as others have noted, the fed funds futures   markets and market participants in surveys are nearly uniform in their expectations of another easing   move at this meeting  So why is that?  I think the answer is because the turnaround implicit in the   positive data and even in the forecast is still quite tentative  And some of the positives we have seen   may reflect in large part a one-month bounceback from the shock of September 11th and may not   necessarily prove to be a certain precursor to a sustained turnaround  I see the risks in the turnaround   scenario to be quite clear and almost all to the downside     Labor market conditions are continuing to deteriorate, which might have a negative effect   on consumption by households and delay the expected turnaround  Second, I believe almost all     12/11/01 62    forecasts assume some form of fiscal stimulus and, as we’ve already discussed, the state of fiscal   stimulus is very much in play and quite uncertain  Third, there is risk from the international   environment where we have a synchronous global downturn  I think the turnaround internationally   depends much more on whether or not our economy recovers as opposed to our looking to others to be   the engine for recovery Finally, financial markets could easily deteriorate if the expectations of a   return to growth and profitability are not met  And if such a negative event to financial markets were   to occur, that clearly would be a drag on consumer and business plans, not a support for them   A number of issues have emerged with respect to policy  I, like President Stern, will   restrain myself on that subject but not as much as he did  [Laughter] First, some people have   suggested that we shouldn’t move in expectation of a terrorist attack and I would think that is certainly   true We cannot inoculate the US economy from potential or actual political threats  On the other   hand, we can position policy in such a way that we can make the economy as robust as possible, even   in its relatively weakened state Secondly, I’ve heard at least one or two people refer to the risk that if   we move today and then reverse our stance later, that might be surprising to the markets  I find that a   little hard to understand because the markets have already built in an expectation of a turnaround in   policy So were we to move today and then turn, we would simply be validating what the markets   expect   Governor Gramlich stole my thunder with respect to the perfect foresight policy  I know I   don’t have it, but presumably a goal of having a Committee is that we approximate something like   perfect foresight with the consensus-building that goes on here  So I would encourage all of us, before   we get to the policy discussion, to look at pages 11 and 12 of the Bluebook if you haven’t done so   And finally, Harvey Rosenblum’s name was mentioned as a superb economist  I will not   try to bring the views of another economist to the table, but I would bring Samuel Johnson to the table      12/11/01 63    Samuel Johnson demonstrated his wit on hearing that an acquaintance was planning to remarry by   describing that as a triumph of hope over experience  When we get to our policy discussion, I would   certainly expect that this Committee, with perfect foresight, would not let hope triumph over its   wisdom and experience  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation and would   like to associate myself with President Parry’s view  The reason I support it is in large part because of   the uncertainty about how to interpret the incoming data and the outlook  In those circumstances, as   he suggested, insurance is probably a good thing to have  "
6983,2002-01-29," Is there a nomination for Chairman of the FOMC?    All in favor say “aye”    SEVERAL  Aye    Approved without objection  Is there a nomination for someone to    serve as Vice Chairman of the FOMC?   Okay Is there a second?   All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL  Aye   Gentlemen, democracy has ruled yet again  Let me turn the floor   over to the person who should actually run the meeting, our re-elected Chairman   If you feel so obliged!                                      January 29-30, 2002 Page 4 of 194  I’ll move the slate   I’ll move New York   So move   I second it   Second    I have a couple of questions  On chart 8, is the semiconductor   production chart normalized for advances in computing capacity?   Okay What expectations do you have for real prices with respect to   semiconductors?  Presumably that’s a key part of your production outlook   If I may ask one more question, Mr Chairman  The NBER Business   Cycle Dating Committee, when they announced their call that we are in recession, put in an   unusual sentence with respect to September 11 suggesting that they might not have made the call   had the terrorist attacks not occurred Does the staff have a perspective about what the data   looked like before, or in some sense what the Dating Committee was looking at that led them to   put in that sentence about September 11?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have already said, the recent   indicators have on balance been more positive than one might have feared at the last meeting,   and they are broadly consistent with recovery starting before long  Unlike Governor Gramlich,   I’m not going to put much weight on the consensus forecast because, while it is obviously meant           January 29-30, 2002 Page 105 of 194  to be a compendium of a large number of forecasters, I’m not so sure the forecasters have gotten   it right thus far   Actually, I would put more weight on some of the incoming data, particularly in my case   on the new orders for capital goods Given the nature of this slowdown, the place where I   thought I’d first look to see if there’s any turn is in that area  And indeed new orders for capital   goods did firm in the latter part of 2001, especially for computers and semiconductors  In   addition, there’s a variety of survey data that others have talked about, which I think might be   indicative of a turn, as well as the initial claims data  Moreover, there are some forces that will   be at work to give a lift to the economy in the months ahead  Inventory liquidation has been   brisk over the past year or so, and the accelerator relationship bodes well for recovery in business   investment once firms see final demand stabilizing and turning up  In addition, I take some   comfort from the fact that returns on investment in tech goods outside the telecom sector appear   to have remained high, which should bolster investment and continue to keep labor productivity   growing relatively strongly   Having said all that, I think the major policy issue here really has to do with the so-called   balance of risks There are two ways one can look at that  One involves the risk of some   surprise that throws us off the baseline forecast  In that regard I think a number of forces are   restraining the economy and create some downside risks  I’d like to pick up on one that Jerry   Jordan and Ned Gramlich touched on, which strikes me as very important  The most recent   profit reports have been roughly in line with expectations or even a little better, but profits   continued to fall relatively sharply last quarter  Moreover, the scope for improving profits will   likely be affected by a limited ability to raise prices at a time of ongoing competitive pressures    The equity markets do seem to continue to incorporate a fairly sharp turnaround in profits in        January 29-30, 2002 Page 106 of 194  2002 That could, if it fails to materialize, send stock prices lower and adversely affect both   business and household spending I would add to this the point that Jerry Jordan made, which is   that the so-called Enron effect or accounting effect creates some greater uncertainties, which   again add to the potential downside risks there     There are other kinds of risks that one might point to  Declines in energy costs have been   supporting consumption and business profits in the aggregate  But as I recall from the chart   show yesterday, it seems as though going forward energy prices have only a little more room to   decline in a lagged response to the previous drop in the price of oil  The wealth effect that we’ve   talked about is probably still mainly negative, with more drag on household spending to play out    Finally, there’s the entire question of the interplay of the asset and liability sides of the balance   sheet with respect to both households and businesses  If profits remain weak, if unemployment   continues to pick up, and if the ability to increase compensation remains in any sense   constrained, there’s a possibility—in a context where both households and businesses have taken   on a lot of debt in recent years—that debt service burdens may become increasingly onerous    I’m not suggesting that this will necessarily play out in the way that the newspapers or   magazines portray it, but there is still a possibility that debt service burdens will exert downward   weight, if you will, on households and businesses  So from that standpoint, I believe the risks   are primarily to the downside   One way to think about our policy decision—and no one has raised it thus far—is that we   have a dual mandate  The fact that inflation appears to be under control currently and is likely to   remain under control gives us a little more scope to look at the other side of the mandate—to   foster maximum sustainable growth  Here I’d like to point out that in the staff projection the   output gap is persistent and positive during the entire forecast period  If one is to believe the           January 29-30, 2002 Page 107 of 194  staff forecast or others, we will have an output gap for the next eight quarters that goes from   about 18 percent of GDP down to about 1 percent of GDP  One might argue—and this might be   consistent with what Cathy Minehan was saying earlier—that in that environment the easier   monetary policy scenario in the Greenbook, which suggests a bit more easing and is similar to   the “inflation cushion” scenario in the Bluebook, might not be totally inappropriate  Again,   that’s contrary to what Ned Gramlich just said, and I’m not sure my position necessarily is one of   strongly recommending further easing  But I’d like to leave that possibility on the table because   we do have a forecast scenario in which there are a variety of downside risks  Moreover, even if   the baseline forecast materializes, it will mean a very weak recovery with a persistent positive   output gap And I think we should not let the second half of our mandate go unheeded in a   period when inflation and inflationary pressures seem well contained  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Our job is to worry about everything  Good news is good and bad   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both halves of your   recommendation  I will say that, as I listened to Don Kohn’s presentation, my earlier statement   indicating that I could imagine even supporting a cut in the funds rate today was in some sense   reinforced I know Don was trying to give both sides of the argument  He did a great job And I   do think there are some credible arguments for saying that we really should keep the possibility   of a reduction in the funds rate on the table  Therefore, I also was pleased to hear what Governor   Gramlich had to say about this being an issue for a future day  It is just not clear to me that we   are doing everything we should be doing if we are going to tolerate unemployment that appears   likely to be at or near 6 percent for as long as the forecast allows us to see the future  That is   above anyone’s estimate of the NAIRU  Even people who recently left the Committee, I think,   would not accept that the NAIRU is that high  It’s not quite clear what price inflation or price   stability should be, but it doesn’t strike me that 1½ or 1¼ percent is totally unacceptable and   means that we have failed  But for today, I will certainly support your recommendation   Thank you very much This item involves another step on our   journey toward greater transparency, which we started several years ago  The issues were raised   in a memo that was distributed dated January 22  I’d like to put to the Committee three   questions, which are interrelated  One is, Should we disclose the existence of dissents—the tally   of the vote on the target federal funds rate, if you will—after each meeting?  The second question   is, If so, what should we disclose?  On this question there are a number of options  We could   disclose just the vote itself—that the vote was unanimous or was 11 for and 1 against, for   example  Alternatively, we could disclose the tally of the vote and the names of dissenters, if   any The third question, which is related to the first two, is, How should we make this   disclosure?  That obviously goes to the question of disclosing this information shortly after the   meeting  Should we include it in the statement released after each meeting, or should we have   our Public Affairs staff disclose the tally and the name or names of any dissenters in response to   questions from the press?  Our Public Affairs people talk to the press at about 215 pm or so to   release the statement    My recommendation on this matter was a close call in some ways, and in my memo I   tried to lay out the arguments on both sides I’ll just review them very briefly  A number of   reasons exist in favor of disclosing the tally, and possibly the names of any dissenters, around the     January 29-30, 2002 Page 130 of 194  same time that we release the press statement after the meeting  First, the information may be   relevant to the markets in fully understanding our policy decisions  When the existence of   dissents comes out currently, it is certainly noted in the press and perhaps, though it’s hard to   say, by certain market participants  Second, the absence of any disclosure of the vote   immediately following a meeting has recently led both market participants and journalists, on   occasion, to use a proxy to try to determine whether or not there were any dissents  And the   proxy they seem to be using has been the number of Reserve Banks requesting a change in the   discount rate That proxy sometimes is accurate, and sometimes it is not  The third reason for   disclosing the existence of dissents and the names of the dissenters is that we currently follow   that practice with respect to the votes taken by the Board of Governors on discount rate actions    We do indeed disclose the vote tally, and in the past when there were dissents, the names of the   dissenters So this would be conforming the practice for FOMC votes to the practice that we   currently use with respect to the votes taken by the Board on discount rate changes  Also, other   central banks do disclose their votes, and as far as I can tell from talking to them, that turns out   not to have been very disturbing or disorienting to markets     Additionally, we believe that our press office would be obliged to disclose the tally and   the names of any dissenters in response to a direct question from the press  To date there have   been no direct questions, but there is certainly a risk that someone who is either well versed on   Freedom of Information issues or new to the press scene will ask a direct question and will get   this information  That would leave us in the moderately awkward position of trying to explain   why we hadn’t disclosed that type of information earlier  Finally, another argument in favor of   making this disclosure at the same time that we release the press statement is that the Committee              January 29-30, 2002 Page 131 of 194  clearly is willing to let the markets know about dissents because we put that information into the   minutes  So it’s simply a question of timing   Now let me go to the arguments against doing this     Sure   Yes, he does  I’m looking to see if Virgil Mattingly is here   SEVERAL He’s behind you   Yes, that’s the reason I raised the point  Virgil has told me that   currently the situation is as follows  The first time someone asks for this information, the press   officer could say that a FOIA request would have to be filed  But the second time anyone asks   the question directly, we would be obliged to release the information  So our room for   maneuver, if you will, is somewhat more constrained than one might have thought earlier        Virgil, will you speak to that?   My understanding is that once we decided in 1994 to announce any   change in the target federal funds rate shortly after our meetings, it brought this entire FOIA   mechanism into play  So, in response to a question we have to release the vote tally and how   each individual voted   Now we have gotten this legal advice on the table  There are   arguments on the other side, and I don’t know if they outweigh the legal advice  Most of the   arguments on the other side go in the direction of the point that Cathy just raised, which is   whether immediate disclosure might somehow or other feed back onto our decisionmaking   processes in a detrimental way—perhaps by making Committee members either more or less   willing to dissent Another argument one could make is that we are a very consensus-driven   institution, and that has brought us a great deal of credibility and support in the markets and   among the public at large  Therefore, disclosing the vote tally and the names of any dissenters at   the same time that we disclose the statement regarding our policy decision would tend to   undercut the consensus-driven nature of our decision  The simultaneous disclosure of the   decision and the vote would put a great deal of focus on the dissenters as opposed to the majority   view and thereby dilute the strength of the majority view, if you will  The other argument   against immediate disclosure, and it should be very clearly on the table, is that this is a bit of a   slippery slope Once we disclose the existence of a dissent and the name of the dissenter, let’s   say through our press office, some excitement will arise  There will be a bit of frenzy among the   press to arrange to talk to that individual and find out why he or she dissented on the vote    Following our meetings we have a two- or three-day “blackout” period during which we do not     January 29-30, 2002 Page 134 of 194  talk to the press, and that gives us some protection  But once we are outside that period, it’s   going to require a great deal of discipline on the part of a dissenter who wants to respect the   consensus-driven nature of the FOMC’s decisionmaking process to manage what could be a   fairly tough press interaction without undermining the majority view  So, there are very   legitimate arguments on the other side  When I thought about this, I felt that it was an extremely   close call But we do have these legal considerations that we’ve talked about as well     So, those are the issues on the table  I think in part we have a process issue, but as Virgil   has indicated, we also are dealing with a somewhat broader but more focused legal issue as well    I believe the main points have been made  A number of others might emerge during the course   of our discussion At this stage, I think the best approach is to open this up for general   discussion among us and get perspectives on how you think we ought to proceed now that   you’ve been briefed on the matter     Okay President Jordan     January 29-30, 2002 Page 135 of 194  Well, the Secretary always writes the minutes very carefully  And I   say this quite seriously You ought to vote for what you think is right  We can manage the fact   that we had a discussion about ongoing issues regarding transparency  If you feel despite this   legal opinion and other considerations that this is still not something you want to do, then please   be driven by that Don’t be driven by what might happen six weeks or so from now because I   feel certain that we can manage that aspect  President Santomero    Sure             January 29-30, 2002 Page 137 of 194  No, it’s not May I respond to a point that President Santomero   raised? We have a process now of disclosing the existence of contrary views, including the   strength and nature of those views, in the minutes  I do not think anything we’ve talked about   here would change that process  Certainly I am not putting on the table that we do anything   other than disclose the majority consensus view in our official statement  Also, with regard to   the slippery slope issue, as all of you who have been on the Committee for some time know, we   are still struggling with the question of at what point we should release the minutes  So we        January 29-30, 2002 Page 138 of 194  might come back to that question, though not at this meeting  But that could be a way to handle   the issue of when and how we disclose minority-majority positions     There is one other fact that I should put on the table  When we looked into this issue, one   thing we reviewed was the nature of the press coverage—and as far as we could tell the market   reaction—to the release of the vote and the names of dissenters on discount rate actions, which   by definition means Board members  Actually, the press coverage was surprisingly muted    Those votes with dissents were primarily 5 to 1 votes, or occasionally 5 to 2 votes when there   were seven Board members  The press coverage typically just reflected the fact that Governor X   voted against this change in the discount rate or, for example, that Governor X has long been on   record as thinking that rates should not continue to rise or decline  And there seemed to be no   market reaction  So as we think about the frenzy and excitement, it may become muted over   time  The first time it could be quite exciting  But after a while, if an individual has a long   record of perspectives that differ somewhat from the majority view and chooses to dissent, it   could be that the press coverage will be straightforward  It may simply be reported that Board   member X or Reserve Bank president Y—who has long been on record as not favoring whatever   the decision was—dissented  So the evidence does not suggest that there will be an ongoing   frenzy and excitement with a focus on dissents  Past press coverage of dissents suggests that   there will be a passing observation but not too much excitement about them  That’s not a   prediction of the future, but there is some reason to be optimistic that, if we manage ourselves   well, the press will eventually manage itself well   The last time I saw was 1991          January 29-30, 2002 Page 139 of 194  Things certainly have changed   That’s absolutely true But the other side of the coin is that in that   earlier period the discount rate was the only signal about decisions on interest rate movements   that was made public  Everything else had to be gathered from trying to interpret the operations   of the Desk So there was certainly some focus on discount rate actions  The news articles were   as long and as abundant as they are now So it has played both ways  There was certainly a   desire to find out what was going on, and in a sense that was the only signal that the Federal   Reserve gave So the situation was different but not totally different from today  President   Parry, you’re the next one on my list   That’s right President Broaddus   President Hoenig   President Guynn   Chairman Greenspan   Certainly after this discussion I strongly agree with that  What I   think we need to do now, having seen that this issue is in a sense more complex than anyone   thought originally, is to come back with a fuller range of options One option we can consider—   and it’s something I’ve been opposed to until now, but I may have to rethink it—is moving up   the release date of the minutes  We need to see what processes we can change to try to get the   minutes closer to real time, understanding with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York what it        January 29-30, 2002 Page 143 of 194  means to be closer to real time  But I think the mindset we should have going into this is that in   some sense we’re stuck in a very awkward position  We don’t want to be embarrassed later so   we’re trying to get ahead of the game here  However, I do believe that we owe the Committee   between now and the next meeting an effort to develop a fuller set of options and a better   understanding of what we actually can do I don’t understand—well, I do understand what the   Bank of England has to do to get its minutes out within two weeks, and it’s far different from   what we do now So we have to look at this more closely  I never regret having to make a tough   decision, but this tough decision deserves more thought than we could give it at the present time   There are a number of options, and we really do have to think about   them  But we need to realize that we are going to be in a position where we have to disclose   dissenters earlier than we currently do  The message that I’m taking from this discussion is that   we would prefer to do that in such a way that it creates context, reduces the press excitement, and   makes the release of information as contemporaneous to the meeting as possible and not six   weeks after a meeting  But I sense strongly that this notion of just disclosing the tally has left   everyone somewhat uneasy  There are a number of hands in the air  Why don’t we start with   Mike Moskow   We absolutely don’t want to destroy that  President Stern   President Poole   As I said, I think we can manage that  Also, I believe you’re   probably right that if we’re going to maintain credibility and trust, it’s better for us to be ahead of   the game as opposed to being caught in an awkward position  So this is a question of being   thoughtful about how to be ahead of the game, I think   Yes, please   I agree with that  We may look at the various options and decide that   none of them makes us feel comfortable and we will just take the risk of waiting  That’s a   decision for the Committee  Governor Bies   Governor Olson   Well, let me close the discussion if I might, Mr Chairman  I think   we have some marching orders here, to which Don, Virgil, and I—and perhaps we’ll get some   other volunteers—will respond  We’ll have to try to come back to this Committee by the March   meeting with a range of options  If it’s all right with you, Mr Chairman, I may reconstitute in an   informal way that subgroup of presidents and Board members who looked at the last round of   transparency issues and give them a chance to be an early sounding board on what we come up   with   Let me close by telling you about my thoughts when I found myself in the position of   having to decide whether or not to send out a memo on this issue to the Committee  I knew it   was much more complicated than it seemed, and I shared much of Jerry’s perspective in that I   wished I hadn’t thought of this problem without having a solution to it  But I decided to proceed   and put the issue to the Committee as opposed to vetoing it myself, in effect, by keeping it secret    And I think by and large that was the right decision  I think we will, as Governor Olson said,   end up in the right place and do what is good for everybody  I don’t regret raising this, though I   know it’s one of the hardest non-monetary-policy decisions we might have to make as a     January 29-30, 2002 Page 149 of 194  Committee  But I am highly confident that, after the discussion we’ve had today and the one   we’ll have in March, we will get to a very good place  Thank you very much   "
7011,2002-03-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be the fourth in a row, so I’ll be even   briefer than President Minehan and say that I agree with what Tony Santomero, Bill   McDonough, and Cathy Minehan have just said  Particularly since my name is somewhat   associated with this contingency planning, I don’t want anything to stand in the way of getting   that done We’d be extraordinarily embarrassed if we had to implement some sort of   contingency arrangements and discovered that they weren’t ready  While these other issues are   extremely important and I think we should get back to them, I really do believe from a national   interest standpoint that getting the contingency planning done is of primary interest at this stage   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The phrase “March madness” normally   refers to basketball but, as we can tell from the staff’s introductory statements, March madness   this year describes the frustration in the forecasting community as they deal with the changing   incoming data  And I’m extremely sympathetic to that  I was one of those who saw mainly the   downside risks at our last meeting, and I must say that this time it does appear that the risks are   much more balanced   First, on the upside, let me pick up where Bill McDonough just left off  I also looked at   the inventory swing as possibly creating an upside risk  Clearly there are some signs that the   massive inventory liquidation undertaken in the US economy last year is over  The pace with   which rebuilding occurs I suspect will be driven by a number of factors, but some may have to   do with this sense of uncertainty due to terrorist attacks  That might lead businesses to want to   hold more inventories than had previously been the case  And as Bill indicated, the inventory-  sales ratios, instead of continuing to come down, may stabilize and indeed be a little higher than I   think is implicit in the Greenbook     The second area of upside risk has also been touched on, and that is this question of   productivity I, like others, am pleased that productivity seems to have held up quite well during   this downturn We saw just a few years ago that an economy that is enjoying a positive supply   shock is not immune from upside risk or inflationary pressures  And it may well be that the        March 19, 2002 Page 72 of 117  surprisingly good news with respect to productivity may lead to more-robust investment and   consumption than perhaps is built into most people’s forecasts   The third area of upside risk is that the indicators certainly suggest that things are turning   rather quickly Let me just point out a couple of them  One is the ISM, formerly NAPM,   indicator Manufacturing activity rose in February to the highest level in a year  More   importantly and interestingly, the new orders index from the ISM surged in February to its   highest level since 1994, which I think is perhaps more positive news on the orders front than   others may have picked up  Finally and most importantly on this sense of upside risks—and   others have said this—both fiscal and monetary policy would have to be described as being   stimulative for good reasons  But those forces that are built into the system may propel the   economy over the next several quarters and lead to growth that is significantly above trend     That said, there are still four things that I consider ongoing downside risks  One is that,   while the growth rate is likely to pick up, the level of GDP will still leave an output gap for the   forecast period As a result of this output gap, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high,   hanging up above the staff’s estimate of the short-term NAIRU for some quarters to come  That   may weigh a bit on consumer behavior   A second element of downside risk is that not only do we have slack in labor markets but   significant slack in capacity utilization appears to exist as well  That may lead to a reduction in   the incentives for businesses to expand capacity even as demand picks up  I would add to this   the apparent pessimism of CEOs in our largest businesses, which I think creates a further risk for   the investment picture  And unfortunately the CEOs of the larger firms are not the only ones   with an uncertain outlook  The most recent NFIB survey results suggest that CEOs in smaller   businesses also are quite cautious about investment, inventory, and hiring plans        March 19, 2002 Page 73 of 117  The third area of downside risk—and others have said this as well—is that the pessimism    of CEOs seems to be driven by a strong sense of a weak profit outlook  One must wonder what   the CEOs are picking up from their sales forces in particular that leads them to be much more   pessimistic than the aggregate data might suggest  At some point, I think there has to be a   recalibration or a reconnection between what the CEOs see and what the GDP numbers are   reporting And indeed, if the profit outlook of CEOs—built on their anecdotal data and their   order books—turns out to be correct, then obviously that’s a bit more of a downside risk   Finally, many of the forces that have undergirded the economy during the last year,   including decreasing mortgage rates, declining energy prices, and incentives to purchase   automobiles, are unlikely to have a similarly stimulative effect going forward     Putting all of this together, while sympathetic to the fact that we’re facing a great deal of   uncertainty, I would say that the risks at this stage—in terms of the issues that confront us—are   relatively balanced and we should be in a position to respond appropriately to incoming data    Thank you   I endorse both parts of your recommendation   Thank you very much At our last meeting we had a brief and not   fully conclusive discussion on the question of disclosing dissents  The issue on the table was not   only a transparency issue, but perhaps more importantly it involved legal considerations  From   the standpoint of legal advice it appeared that it might be appropriate to disclose dissents earlier           March 19, 2002 Page 97 of 117  than we have historically Since we discussed this last time we’ve gotten further advice in a   memo from Kieran Fallon and Virgil Mattingly, which was sent to you  Also you received   another memo from me regarding a discussion among a small number of us on how to respond to   both the legal issues and the philosophical issues about transparency  Since I’ve sent you a   memo about that, I’ll try to be brief   The group of us who looked at this, which included Michael Moskow, Bob Parry, Bill   Poole, Ned Gramlich, and myself, reached a couple of conclusions  First, we propose that the   Committee make one set of changes in its disclosure policy  Second, we suggest that a number   of other elements of our strategy with respect to communications remain unchanged   The change that we propose is the one that is listed as item 2A in the memo that I sent to   you That is to release the tally of the vote, the identity of the voters, and the preferences of the   dissenters and to release all of that information as part of the press statement  Let me note the   logic for that argument  To be clear, we believe that adopting any of these options has some   risks and some benefits  So there is no option that is without concern  We thought that the   option of putting into the press statement the tally of the vote, including the names and the   preferences of any dissenters, would get us into a position where we are no longer tolerating the   element of legal risk that we face currently  That risk is that we’re waiting for someone to ask a   question, in which case we would have to disclose the vote and perhaps be embarrassed that we   hadn’t disclosed it earlier At the same time, we viewed this as a moderate or middle step as   opposed to some of the other things we might have done, such as trying to create mini-minutes or   to release the full minutes at a point that, while not contemporaneous, would be closer to the   meeting  We are, if you will, feeling our way here, since we have no easy option of returning to        March 19, 2002 Page 98 of 117  our previous practices once we take a decision  So I think our little group thought that the so-  called 2A option that I just outlined would be the best, recognizing that there are some risks to it     Now, we also felt that a number of things should not change  We thought that we should   not change the concept of a blackout period both before the meeting, which was not on the table,   but also after the meeting  We favored maintaining the blackout for the rest of the week after the   FOMC meeting, which is through Friday  We thought it was also important that during the   intermeeting period we not disclose the contents of the meetings—as we currently do not   disclose them—and wait for the minutes to come out  The third element of no change is that we   would hold the release of the minutes until after the subsequent meeting  That recommendation   was driven by a number of concerns, some having to do with the mechanics of trying to get the   minutes done  Others related to concerns about the fact that there is a great variety of   information in the minutes, some of which may continue to be relevant and some of which may   not be relevant Another factor, obviously, was the sense that once we’ve made a decision to go   ahead with something, we can’t go back   There is one other thing that would not be changed  Obviously during the course of each   intermeeting interval, after the blackout period and before the subsequent blackout period there’s   a time when we all give speeches and have discussions, etcetera  We would at that point be free   to discuss the economy or to discuss an outlook but we would still be expected to try to avoid   going over the line of disclosing any actual content of or conversation that occurred at one of   these meetings   So that’s where this group came out, and I hope all of you have had a chance to read the   memo  At this stage I’d like to open the discussion up for any comments, first from the other   members of the group—Presidents Parry, Poole, and Moskow, and Governor Gramlich—to     March 19, 2002 Page 99 of 117  make sure I have summarized our agreement  Then I would turn to others on the Committee   who may have questions or may just want to state a point of view or preference  Shall we start   with Governor Gramlich?    President Moskow   I think that’s true President Poole   Okay, let’s open the discussion now  I have Jerry Jordan next on my   list   Cathy Minehan is next on my list   President Hoenig   President Broaddus   Okay President Guynn   Okay, thanks  Governor Bies   Okay I have nobody else who has asked to speak  I assume that   means that everyone else is—I'm sorry, President Stern   Oh, I don’t know, it depends on our star performer here  Are there   any other comments?  No one else came to my attention   Okay, thank you I think what this means is that while there are still   some concerns—and no one will soft-pedal them or ignore them—we feel almost obliged to go   down this path The second question on the table is that we have the opportunity to implement   this plan today  Today may actually be a perfect time because there were no dissents and, as   someone said, it was probably one of our easiest decisions  So we actually have prepared the          March 19, 2002 Page 105 of 117  same kind of press statement we had but with the added information about the tally of the vote,   thinking that perhaps this would be the way to go     I would call your attention to the last paragraph     Yes, we’re going to change that, as Ned mentioned  We will   conform the discount rate approach to this one  Currently the way the press announcement of a   discount rate change works is that a well-informed member of the press will ask the question   about the vote and the Public Affairs staff will give the answer  So we think we really should   conform the Board’s practice on discount rate votes to this approach for reasons that Governor   Bies and others have noted   As Cathy has already indicated, we’re a mature Committee, and we   will not let these decisions influence our vote on policy  Besides, the vote on the policy decision   has already been taken  Are there any questions or comments?  Hearing no objections, we will   proceed down this path  Obviously, for this meeting after “voting for” the names of all of the   members will be listed; and after “voting against” this time will be the word “none”     All right We’ll say unanimous  That’s what we’re going to do   Okay?  Thank you very much And thanks for your efforts on this one  "
7034,2002-05-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have already noted, the data   and anecdotal information are sending very mixed signals about the strength of the recovery  I   would like to bring another topic into the range of our discussion  This has been a particularly                  May 7, 2002 55 of 81  wet spring here in Washington  And since this Committee deals with liquidity, I will discuss the   various liquidity outlooks if you will   One I would describe as the baseline forecast, which I think of as a nicely running water   faucet We have in the baseline an economy that gradually returns to trend, inflation stays well   contained and, if I’ve got it right, the unemployment rate gradually returns to the staff’s   expectations of the NAIRU In that scenario no one gets too wet   Then we have what I would describe as the water torture scenario, which is the downside   risk that a number of us have already talked about  In this scenario—and the Vice Chairman   recently touched on these points—businesses attempt to increase productivity and to increase   profitability And they do so by continuing to hold down hours and only gradually bringing   furloughed workers back to work While increased productivity should eventually lead to a   higher income for those workers, the fact that unemployment stays stubbornly high and   profitability returns only slowly limits the need and the willingness of businesses to share the   benefits of increased productivity through higher wages  This in turn discourages workers from   spending any expected income gains, and we get a very, very gradual water torture kind of   turnaround in which final demand is very slow to pick up  That’s clearly the downside risk   The upside risk that we’ve already talked about is what I would describe as the water   hose scenario In this model, what we have is highly stimulative fiscal policy, a monetary policy   that is also quite stimulative, and the productivity surprise that we’ve enjoyed all leading to a   much stronger turnaround than is currently built into the baseline     So when faced with a gradually running faucet, water torture, or a water hose, we have   the question, Which of these alternative scenarios do we expect to materialize?  The unfortunate   problem is that at today’s meeting we aren’t really sure  But since we’re not faced with an               May 7, 2002 56 of 81  immediate waterfall of rapidly increasing inflation, I would suggest that we sit tight in the boat   and stay exactly where we are  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation as well  "
7059,2002-06-25," Thanks I’d like to pick up on a point that President Poole made in   passing, this whole issue of the so-called supply shock and the beneficial nature of it  Your point   about why it is that we have benefited from this makes a lot of sense  But then another point you   make is that to some extent the question now is our resolve and how much further we can go    There has been a huge amount of discussion about this so-called productivity surprise  I would   think that at this stage workers are no longer as easily fooled about it  Also, I believe that some   of these changes are structural, particularly the Internet and perhaps developments in help   supply One change you didn’t put in your exhibit is the fact that variable pay had become   important and may well become less important  All these developments might leave this   Committee relatively quickly—no more than the five years that Bill McDonough talked about—   in a potentially more difficult situation of higher productivity growth but still more-rapid   adjustment in wages  I’d like to know if there are any early signs that you look at or if you have   any thoughts about how much time we have here because in some sense we are living on   borrowed time     Absolutely   Well, that’s what I meant by the Internet and help supply and all   those job market developments that tend to allow that competitive pressure to go through more   quickly into wages It’s not just that workers are fooled  Ultimately I guess my question is this    Given these structural changes, aren’t we likely to see a situation sooner rather than later in   which this increase in productivity does in fact play through relatively quickly to wages?  And,   therefore, the one-time benefit that we get from a so-called supply shock will elude us     But this does get to a point that I think Al Broaddus was making,   which is that the opportunistic disinflation that has occurred over the last several years, in part     June 25-26, 2002 43 of 179  because of the productivity shock, is not something that we can be complacent about  And since   in some sense I’ve mortgaged my house based on keeping inflation low and stable, I think it’s   pretty important that we understand that  This is the only job I’ve got! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  My view of the near-term indicators is   that they do indeed, as others have already indicated, paint an economy that is stable—certainly   not contracting—but not yet growing at trend  For example, the initial claims data have come   down from their recent artificially elevated level, but they remain historically high—at around   the 400,000 level that has prevailed since early 2001  Certainly the most recent retail sales data   were weaker than expected—flat in May—and are pointing to a possible slowing in the pace of   increase in personal consumption expenditures  And finally, the data for orders and shipments,   as we’ve just seen this morning, are clearly stabilizing and perhaps turning up some but certainly   are not returning to the pace of the late 1990s     This picture is frustrating, I think, for those who had hoped for or bet on a sharp   turnaround But this Committee should be mindful, as many have already said, that the gradual   growth of the current quarter was anticipated in our earlier meetings  Two of the three previous   Greenbooks this year forecast growth in this quarter within a range of 2 to 2½ percent, and   growth at such a pace still seems to be the case  While expected, however, this slow growth does   leave one wondering what will be the impetus for an upturn or return to trend  If the second half   of 2002 is going to be stronger than the second quarter and lead to a stronger 2003, as forecast by   both the staff and the consensus of external forecasters, we must soon start to see a pattern of   more rapidly improving incoming data  While that pattern of data is not yet in hand, both   housing and autos are continuing to play the important stabilizing roles that they’ve played thus   far for the cyclical episode   Additionally, as other have said, impetus will most assuredly come from monetary   policy, which is accommodative; fiscal policy, which is likely to continue to provide a positive   impulse; and a weaker dollar, which will allow foreign demand to take up some of the slack not     June 25-26, 2002 106 of 179  provided by domestic demand  On the other hand, eroding equity prices, declining consumer   and investor confidence due to a range of factors that Governor Gramlich has identified, and an   uncertain profit outlook in the business community are admittedly creating and likely to continue   to create some drag on both household and business expenditures   All of these forces taken together lead me to believe that the risks to the baseline forecast   are, if you will, uncomfortably balanced  Now, if contrary to most expectations the negative   forces weighing on the economy grow stronger, become more persistent, and undermine   recovery, then obviously we’ll have to react to that  Similarly, on the other hand, if the   turnaround proves stronger than forecast, we’ll need to move rates upward more quickly than   currently built into the assumptions underlying the Greenbook or the perfect foresight outlook in   the Bluebook  Whether such moves will surprise the market is really uncertain  Just as the   markets have adjusted in the intermeeting period to the incoming data by modifying their   expectations with respect to policy in a downward direction, presumably incoming data would   get the markets to adjust their policy expectations up if indeed that were the appropriate   response   Let me comment briefly on the issue that Vice Chairman McDonough discussed and   perhaps take a slightly different tack  I think the issue of preparing the markets is one that is   rather challenging for this Committee  We have the benefit of having the confidence of the   markets that we will attempt to avoid surprising them if we can  That may not always be   possible, but we will try not to surprise them  We don’t want to lose that unwritten but rather   well understood pact between this Committee and the markets  On the other hand, we don’t   want a desire to prepare the markets to lead inadvertently to instability in the markets, which   perhaps was what Vice Chairman McDonough was suggesting  That does leave us in a bit of a        June 25-26, 2002 107 of 179  challenging position here But for now I’d say it’s better just to have a steady hand on the tiller   These are indeed uncertain times, and we don’t want to add to that uncertainty  Thank you very   much, Mr Chairman   I also concur with your recommendation   It looks good   I agree  "
7087,2002-08-13," I’ll move that nomination   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have already noted, during the   intermeeting period we’ve seen a number of indicators, all of which have been a little weaker   than expected Labor market indicators, consumer confidence, manufacturing activity, and   business investment all have led forecasters to shade down their outlooks to one degree or   another That has been true of those who have done our Greenbook, and I have no basic quibble   with their baseline forecast Having said that, I think at this meeting the most important issue   about the economy in some sense is not the forecast per se but rather the risks to the forecast    While the usual etiquette is to leave the answer to that question about the balance of risks until   the end of one’s opening statement, I will actually be more transparent and tell you up front that I   think the risks to the forecast have shifted notably downward    I say that for two or three reasons First, the incoming data as weak as they have been,   while not signaling a so-called double dip, obviously do put into question—more so than I at   least am comfortable with—the basic baseline forecast  Second, the markets—which should be   and most people think are more forward-looking—also suggest that the outlook is less certain   now than just a few months ago  Investors appear to have serious concerns about the continued         August 13, 2002 50 of 92  deterioration in business conditions and subsequently, or consequently, credit conditions  This is   doubly worrisome because obviously a general decline in equity wealth such as the one we’ve   experienced even in the intermeeting period will continue to weigh on households and put into   question to some degree the ongoing strength of consumer spending  It is also worrisome   because the capital required to finance business investment depends on hospitable financial   markets  However, equity issuance has been extremely light  The data I have show that in July,   in fact, the net equity issuance was negative In addition, we’ve seen with respect to bond   issuance and bank loans as well that conditions are far less accommodative than they were even a   short time ago  So the basic building blocks for investment strike me as much less certain than   they were a little while ago   Consequently, on the side of our mission that deals with sustainable growth, I think the   odds of a large shortfall have increased This is summarized in the changed levels of output gap   that at least the Board’s staff has estimated  At the time of the June Greenbook, the staff thought   that an output gap of 2 percent of potential GDP growth in 2001 would come down to   13 percent in 2002 and to 06 percent in 2003 Now the staff estimates that the output gap   started at 17 percent in 2001, a slight improvement, but unfortunately stays stubbornly high at   17 in 2002 and 13 in 2003 So in terms of the sustainable growth side of our mission, I would   say that the risks are clearly that we are moving further and further away from achieving   sustainable growth   The other side of the mission obviously looks to the question of inflation  I’d say that the   risks of inflation, if anything, have receded during the intermeeting period  That’s due in part to   the limitation of pricing power that a number of you have already referred to plus still strong   increases in productivity growth as well as slack in labor markets and capacity utilization, which            August 13, 2002 51 of 92  look as though they will linger on longer than we had thought originally  With those   developments plus sluggish growth abroad and the associated risks that Karen has already   indicated as well as tame commodity prices, it is hard to see that inflation pressures are likely to   emerge during the forecast period  By almost any measure, inflation expectations appear   relatively unchanged   Taken together, it seems to me that the balance of risks has moved from what I described   at the last meeting as uncomfortably balanced to at this stage being much more negative  Now,   this is the part where I will do what Governor Kohn has pleaded with us not to do  [Laughter]   From the question of the outlook I’ll touch on what might be thought of as policy  But since I   believe that the balance of risks statement has very little to do with policy and has everything to   do with the outlook, I will move forth     President Santomero has put on the table some concerns about having the Committee   signal that we think that the risks have changed distinctly to the downside  I’d like to recognize   in all honestly that there are three concerns that one might have in making that shift in language   but, if you will let me do this, I will go through them and reject each one of those concerns   The first is a concern that we might surprise the market  But indeed all the incoming   survey data that I have seen, including some from this morning, suggest that almost all   government securities dealers think that we will probably change the language that we use and   describe the risks as being tilted toward weakness  So I don’t think we would surprise the   market if we were to make that change   The second concern that I think President Santomero raised quite explicitly relates to the   implications of this change in language for real policy, which is the setting of the funds rate—a   topic I will not discuss at this point  I would say that I, as do many of you, get copies of some of            August 13, 2002 52 of 92  these very expensive Fed-watching materials  The one I found most interesting was one I read   this morning that said, and I quote, “Indeed, the Fed has emphasized that the economic risk   statement should not be interpreted as a signal of what will happen at the next meeting but rather   is more an assessment of how it sees the future”  If we in fact have emphasized that and we   believe it to be true, then I wouldn’t let a concern about a misinterpretation filter in since indeed   the real meaning of that language is becoming much better understood by the public   The third issue is one that President Minehan alluded to already to some degree  And   that is, if we should deem it necessary—following, let’s say, the perfect foresight model in the   Bluebook or one version of the forward-looking Taylor rule—to reduce rates over time, then by   definition having suggested that there’s some weakness in the economy would provide some   explanation of why such a move is needed    So I see very few downsides, but I do see a couple of upsides to being clearer about our   outlook One of the upsides is that it would reinforce our view of transparency, which I think is   obviously helpful Second, I think it would allow the markets to focus more fully on incoming   data and not perceive that we are hamstrung in one way or the other with respect to the future    So, Mr Chairman, I do believe that the risks are mainly to the downside  And I think the   Committee ought to have the courage of its conviction and indicate that that is the case  Thank   you   Uncomfortably         August 13, 2002 76 of 92  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I endorse both parts of your   recommendation  I obviously already spoke on the balance of risks issue  With respect to the   question of moving policy going forward, I think I’m somewhere between Cathy Minehan and   Don Kohn On the one hand, the incoming data have been much weaker than one would have   anticipated, but I also recognize that the weaker performance really involves just high-frequency   data so it’s appropriate to wait and see  But if we get evidence of persistent weakness, then we   obviously should do the right thing  At this stage, though, I think changing the language is   sufficient   Ned, I think there are different interpretations, and sometimes being   called a conservative is a compliment  [Laughter]  And I would not say you’re a true idiot  "
7113,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The initial line of the Greenbook   indicates that the tenor of economic reports has been mixed  Obviously that is true  However,   like others around the table, I think the picture that emerges is really quite clear  I see it in three   separate parts, a triptych if you will          September 24, 2002 67 of 115  In the middle panel is the baseline forecast, which—picking up on what Governor Kohn   and others have said—I would describe as not all that bad but also not all that good  As we’ve   already talked about, what we’ll have according to the baseline forecast is growth that continues   to be under potential for most of the forecast period  The result would be a positive output gap   that lingers throughout the forecast period  Resources, particularly in the labor market, are likely   go underutilized for several more quarters, and inflation, if anything, gradually recedes  Even   with an accommodative policy I would describe this as a fairly bleak baseline outlook that may   call into question our resolve with respect to achieving the two goals that the Congress has given   us One might argue with respect to the baseline that there’s really nothing monetary policy can   do at this stage because of the long and variable lags that we all understand exist  However, to   that core part of the picture I add two others that may suggest a slightly more heightened sense of   awareness on the part of the Committee   First, I think some of the assumptions that support the baseline may turn out not to be as   true as they appear to be on paper  If one looks at the household sector, as the staff analysis   indicates, its performance depends on a number of underlying assumptions  Some of them I   think are true I do believe that productivity increases and the tax cuts already passed by the   Congress will sustain consumption growth  However, some of the other assumptions I am less   certain about  For example, the staff seems to be implicitly assuming that house prices will   continue to rise I would argue, based on some recent information with respect to whether it’s   the level of mortgage rates or the change in mortgage rates that drives both house prices and   refinancings, that that’s really not clear  Indeed, it seems unlikely that house prices or   refinancing will continue to go up at the rapid pace they have recently  I would note that some of        September 24, 2002 68 of 115  that is still in the pipeline  But I’d say that during the course of this forecast we’re likely to see it   gradually erode, assuming mortgage rates don’t continue to come down some    Another thing that worries me a bit about the baseline forecast is the assumption that   there won’t be another extended round of negative wealth effects from equity prices  The staff   assumes that, during this forecast period, equity prices will go up  However, during the   intermeeting period we’ve already seen equity prices move down by somewhere between 6 and   8 percent And the implied volatility of stock index futures suggests a great deal of uncertainty   about future equity prices If one adds to this the fact that corporate warnings have tended to   move toward the disappointing side, I think that brings into question some of the basic   expectations with respect to wealth and how that will continue to influence households and   household spending plans   A final element that worries me a little about the baseline is that I think we may be   underestimating the degree to which this nagging underutilization of resources leads to the   possibility of very paltry increases in wages and salaries, which again could have a bit of a   negative impact So I see obvious downside risks to the household sector forecast in the   baseline   I see something similar with respect to business fixed investment The forecast calls for   BFI to turn very sharply from negative 19 percent this year to positive 88 percent next year and   to 105 percent in 2004 The factors expected to support this turnaround include some that are   certain, such as tax incentives and a depreciating capital stock  But again, there seems to be a   great deal of uncertainty with regard to some of the other factors  For example, the forecast   suggests that an increased cash flow and an increased need for capital to meet growing demand   are two elements that will stimulate businesses to invest, resulting in a turn in BFI from negative        September 24, 2002 69 of 115  to positive However, I would say that neither of those developments is at all certain  We’ve   already seen in the most recent indicator, for example, some suggestion of an ongoing slowing in   production, not an increase Similarly, I think a soft job market is another indicator of a soft   production environment  I’ve already indicated that we’ve heard corporate warnings about   disappointing top line growth  So that leaves basically only ongoing restructuring and   productivity increases, both of which are powerful but neither of which is certain enough to   produce the kind of turnaround in business fixed investment that the staff is expecting  So that’s   the second part of the triptych, if you will   The third part of the triptych is the international environment  We’ve already talked   about geopolitical uncertainties, and there’s nothing new I could say there  I must say, though,   that as I represent the FOMC and the System in international meetings I’m struck by what I think   of as the passivity of policymakers in Europe and in Japan with respect to their weakening   situations We’ve already seen the Bank of Japan attempt to do something fairly strong and   interesting, but it turns out, at least at this stage, not to have had much effect  And it’s my   observation—others have said this as well—that the situation in Europe seems to be getting no   better and probably is getting worse We’re often criticized in these international meetings   because we have imbalances within our economy  My response to that is that the problem is not   imbalances within the US economy but imbalances between the US economy and the   economies of Europe and Japan that seem to present the major challenges       As you may or may not know, I am a real fan of modern art  But even I, having looked at   a lot of interesting pictures, can recognize a truly ugly one when I see one!  [Laughter] And I   would describe this picture as moving from moderately unattractive to potentially much more        September 24, 2002 70 of 115  unattractive The question is what to do about that  If I were not a more disciplined person, I’d   discuss that in this round, but I will wait until the next one  [Laughter]   Well, it has to be true!  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I endorse both parts of your   recommendation, including the implicit part about dealing with geopolitical risks in the   statement  Let me take a minute to talk about two or three other issues   One issue that a few people raised was a concern about unbalanced growth  In that   regard, Vincent picked up on a point that he and I discussed yesterday, which is that, by   definition, interest-sensitive sectors move more than other sectors in response to changes in   interest rates One of the Committee’s mistakes back in the 1970s, I think, was being too   concerned about tanking the housing market and, therefore, the FOMC was slow to lean against   inflation Being concerned about stimulating the housing market should not slow us down here   because housing is an interest-sensitive sector  To put the philosophical question on the table  If   the choice is between unbalanced growth that gets the economy back to trend or a perfectly   balanced economy that’s growing infinitely below trend for a long period of time, I know what   my loss function looks like So I would leave that one off our list of concerns     I’d also like to cover two other points that you made  One is the date of our next   meeting, November 6  I would argue that, if the data are clear, they are clear, and we will do   what we should do   Clearly, you didn’t disagree with that  The other point is that it will   be interesting to see if in fact for the first time, at least in my short period on the Committee—   though I know you’ve been looking at the economy on a daily basis for fifty years —the next   two data releases clarify the situation  [Laughter]  If they do, I will be quite shocked  I suspect   that the next time we get together we’ll have a little on one side and a little on the other          September 24, 2002 92 of 115  Those are my comments, but I do support your recommendation  "
7138,2002-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  A number of people have already   discussed the weakness of the incoming data, the step-down in growth from H1 to H2 and the   fact that forecasters have marked down the near-term and intermediate-term outlooks  So I’ll not   attempt to elaborate on those points  Rather, I’d like to focus my few minutes on two   assumptions that I think are important in the baseline Greenbook scenario and that give me some   concern         November 6, 2002 65 of 122  First, the baseline assumes that over the forecast period investment will pick up  Of   course we recognize, as Dave Stockton said in response to Cathy Minehan’s question, that a   number of businesses clearly are investing in some elements of business fixed investment; real   investment in equipment and software is indeed positive  However, there are several reasons for   my questioning whether the level of investment will increase in the intermediate term  One is   that we really don’t know the degree of capital goods overhang and cannot take for granted the   statement that the Greenbook authors make early on that the capital stock is really closer to   firms’ desired levels  As the staff well recalls, a few years ago we attempted to find answers to   this question and, while I believe the work was well done, the conclusion I would say was not   definitive   Another reason for doubting an intermediate turnaround in investment, at least with   respect to the manufacturing sector, is obviously that capacity utilization is relatively low, and   the relationships between investment and capacity are quite clear     The third reason for having some doubts about the forecast of a bounceback in   investment as built into the Greenbook baseline is that we know that business fixed investment,   particularly in equipment and software, is driven by two separate forces—one a substitution   effect and one an income effect  The substitution effect, based on the fact that the price of   capital has come down relative to labor, would lead businesses naturally to want to substitute   capital for labor From that explanation, one would expect to find a negative correlation between   employment growth and investment growth  There’s also an income effect, which I think we’ve   been talking about implicitly here; uncertainty with respect to the outlook may indeed hold back   businesses in terms of making new investments              November 6, 2002 66 of 122  I asked the staff to perform a simple test of these correlations to see if the negative or the   positive—that is to say the substitution effect or the income effect—was stronger  It turned out   that for long periods of time, including the post-1995 period, the positive correlation between   increases in employment and increases in investment was very strong, and indeed statistically   significant  The reason I raise this technical point relates to the implicit assumption in many   comments that it is in fact the outlook with respect to profitability, growth, et cetera, that is   important in business people’s thinking  Indeed, that turns out statistically to be the case  And   since the outlook here is really quite murky, it is not surprising that it has taken some time for   investment to pick up     The fourth reason I have some concern about investment as built into the baseline   forecast has already been noted, and that is that for many corporations the cost of capital has not   become lower during the intermeeting period  Indeed, it has become higher  In addition to that,   we see from the survey of senior loan officers that demand for loans, from banks at least, has   been tepid And that has been attributed in large part to reduced capital expenditures and lower   planned expenditures So we should have at least some concern about the baseline on the   investment side   I’m equally as skeptical with respect to the consumption side for a number of reasons    One is that the income tax reductions from the 2001 tax legislation have for the most part already   played out They are forecast to add I think only 01 percent to GDP growth for 2003 and 2004    Second, mortgage refinancings, while still high, do show a tendency to be inversely related to   changes in mortgage rates and not just to the level of rates  So if mortgage rates do not continue   to come down, then there might not be the support for a continuing wave of refinancings at the   recent high level  And finally, as others have indicated, while there may be reasons to interpret            November 6, 2002 67 of 122  the most recent round of auto incentives differently, the response to those incentives has not been   as encouraging as earlier rounds One might add to that waning consumer confidence   So I put all this together to say that in my personal forecast, though I’m not a professional   forecaster, I would put more weight on the alternative scenario involving weaker aggregate   demand as opposed to the baseline  And that scenario takes the baseline and makes it, to my   mind, look much worse  Now, unlike Governor Kohn, I seek no indulgences  I will not go into   the discussion reserved for the second half of our meeting  I will only encourage the Committee   to look to another alternative in the Greenbook, which is the lower funds rate forecast    [Laughter] I think that’s consistent with the rules   Thank you, Mr Chairman I also support you Let me give my   reasons First, given what we’ve seen in terms of the incoming data, the marking down of   forecasts, et cetera, it’s important for us to maintain the same degree of stimulus that we had   before at our last meeting  If we look at and visually adjust exhibit 2 in Vincent’s handout, both   the top and the bottom charts suggest that 50 basis points is the best way to do that  That, I think,   picks up what Jerry Jordan was implying and perhaps others as well  Second, on the balance of   risks statement, boy-oh-boy am I glad we adopted that procedure! [Laughter]  Having labored   with many of you on it and having listened to Vincent’s interpretation, I am comfortable with a   balanced statement with respect to the risks because of what he has shown in the bottom portion   of exhibit 4 And I was not being facetious about being glad we decided to include the risk   statement in our announcement  I think it’s helpful that we got away from signaling things   between meetings, though I realize it leaves some other kinds of uncertainties  But by and large   I think if we do a 50 basis point cut— looking at the forecast Vincent has shown for the 2003-04   period in the lower funds rate path scenario—one can intellectually, credibly support a balanced   risk statement  I will leave it to you and President McDonough to talk about the market   psychology I can’t disagree with what you both said  It seems credible           November 6, 2002 88 of 122  There’s a slight misunderstanding between Ben Bernanke and me regarding what I was   saying earlier I don’t think I’m disagreeing with you, Ben  I firmly believe that making these   adjustments will help businesses to lower the cost of capital and to get refocused on the need to   make further investments going forward  I’m not sure that we disagree at all  We can talk about   that later Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you I think I’m generally with President Moskow and others    I would put much more emphasis on Ginnie Maes since we understand the legal ramifications   there in that they are public securities  They’re a step away from Treasuries but not that big a   step   I would be cautious about an ACF, and I am very concerned, as all of you know, about   resource utilization Therefore, I would tend to downplay that alternative—not that it’s   unimportant and not that we don’t already have a lot of good staff work done  But I’m worried   about all the other competing resource requirements  So I would agree with the suggestion of   President Moskow and others to postpone further consideration of the ACF                    November 6, 2002 108 of 122  With respect to the contingency ACF, I think two of you have asked the relevant   question Governor Kohn and others have already suggested an answer, which is that given the   general amount of work that has already gone into developing backup facilities, the CACF is not   likely to reach a high priority in our thinking  The contingency planning group has made a large   investment, both physically and intellectually, in a number of other approaches, including the   Lombard facility  So given my general responsibility for contingency work, I would be very   comfortable taking the CACF off the table at this stage  Again, good work has been done on   this; our understanding of it has moved beyond where we were when we put that idea on the   table So in conclusion, I think Ginnie Maes should be where most of the staff work is directed    All the other alternatives I would say can now be delayed for some time      Let me make one other point  I agree with what others have said   about leaving some of the tough judgments to the staff to make  On the contingency issue,   however, we have invested a lot in contingency planning, and I don’t think there’s any reason to   spend another minute on it at this stage  While I would leave it to the staff to figure out how to   proceed on the ACF and other issues, I definitely want the CACF—and I think it is the sense of   the Committee as well—to be taken off the table  "
7164,2002-12-10," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Following on Bill Poole’s introductory   comments, I want to share with you a comment that Ed Boehne made to me when he was on this   Committee  He said that, when we have meetings such as this, the less there is to discuss the   more there is to say [Laughter] So I think I’ll just say my piece   To me the operative question, obviously, is whether the incoming data should give us any   reason to rethink the decisions that we made at the last meeting  I’d say the answer to that   question is “no” Indeed, a cautious central banker could easily say that the incoming data are   not inconsistent with the main theme of slowing but still positive growth in the near term and the                  December 10, 2002 61 of 87  view that the so-called soft spot we’ve described will go away at some point, leading to a gradual   strengthening over the intermediate period   As I look at the incoming data, they are clearly quite mixed, as others have indicated  On   the one hand, we have had some positive news that attracted market attention  retail sales early   on, initial claims, productivity surprises, etc  On the other hand, there was clearly some negative   news as well the recent ISM index, nonfarm payroll data, and the unemployment numbers   popping up slightly So, if one thinks of that as balance, then the question on my mind is, Why   am I as comfortable as I am with the baseline forecast?  I think the answer really is that the way   these data played into the financial markets now makes the financial conditions much more   consistent with the kind of growth, the slow growth, that’s embedded in the baseline   While the equity markets have been somewhat soft of late, it’s clear that several weeks of   solid gains in equity markets should certainly play through to consumers and to those businesses   that depend on the stock market as a source of capital  Additionally, the volatility of equity   prices, while still somewhat high, has declined noticeably from the October peak, again   suggesting that investors have a somewhat greater sense of confidence about the longer-term   outlook in the equity markets  Accommodative monetary policy and, as others have indicated,   likely increases in the degree of accommodation in fiscal policy should also support both the   household sector and the business sector     If one looks more closely at the two major private-sector segments of the economy,   households and businesses, one might also have some confidence that the financial conditions in   each of those two sectors are supportive of the baseline forecast  Recent indicators of household   credit quality appear to be basically stable I would say—certainly not worsening  The still large   positive gap between the average coupon on outstanding mortgages and the current fixed rate            December 10, 2002 62 of 87  suggests that refinancings are likely to continue to be a source of strength for households going   forward Though they may have slowed, as Governor Olson indicated, there’s still some room to   run Subdued inflation and rising productivity should support increases in real incomes as well,   as will the continued health in the housing markets  So, while some concern has been expressed   about the household sector, I think the situation there looks fundamentally sound   I’d say the same is true on the business side  Spreads, while still elevated as Dino   indicated, certainly have come off their earlier highs  Taking advantage of these calmer market   conditions, businesses have reentered the bond market in a very major way and have reentered   equity markets in a much more subdued manner  So clearly businesses have the financial ability   to resume investment as soon as the period of haze or uncertainty that surrounds them dissipates   Finally, with respect to this period of haze or uncertainty, I would argue that the passage   of time and continued gradual improvement in the tone of the economy—absent a large negative   shock or war—should allow risk aversions to recede and the outlook to clear  And with that I   think business confidence is likely to increase   Based on those comments I would say that the risks around the baseline, against the   background of the accommodative policy in place and over an intermediate- term time frame,   certainly do seem balanced  But in line with what President Poole just said, my sense of the   balance of risks is just that—that there are risks both on the upside and the downside  Given   how accommodative policy is—from the standpoint of both current monetary policy plus   expectations with respect to fiscal policy—once this period of uncertainty lifts, there is a   possibility that activity could pick up more quickly than the baseline suggests  On the other   hand, we don’t know how to factor in the issues with respect to corporate governance that may   return to haunt us in a surprising way  And obviously, geopolitical risks still stand  Indeed, a         December 10, 2002 63 of 87  period of relatively slow growth where jobs are not being created has, if you will, its own   downside risk So, similar to what President Poole was suggesting, I think we really should be   prepared to be flexible going forward We  may end up having to be aggressive in either   direction, but this seems like a good time to sit still  Since the markets expect very little out of   this meeting and given the fact that it’s close to the holiday season, if we take no action today—   dare I say it—that would not be a lump of coal from the market’s perspective  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   I support your recommendation and will put aside my two-hour   speech [Laughter]  "
7191,2003-01-28,"  Thank you very much  As all of you know, maybe with the   exception of Sandy, the reason I have the floor now is to organize the election of a Chairman and   a Vice Chairman of this Committee to serve until our first meeting of 2004  So, let me open the   floor for nominations for the positions of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the FOMC  Don   Kohn    All right, those sound like two credible nominees  [Laughter]  Are   there any other nominations?  Assuming not, could I have a vote?  All in favor say “aye”   ALL  Aye    Sounds as if it’s unanimous  Congratulations yet again to you both    I’ll move the selection of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York    Second    Second    Second   January 28-29, 2003 9 of 195     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I’d like to pick up about   where Bill Poole was and focus on the bottom of exhibit 3 in the paper that the Board staff put   out  What that suggests to me is that, if we think the markets have become much more complete   and therefore somewhat more forward-looking, then we’d do very well by working with them or   January 28-29, 2003 43 of 195    holding onto a more inertial approach here  I would argue as a hypothesis that we are perhaps on   the curve  Indeed, while it’s hard to say that markets are somewhere between 09 and 1 in a   forward-looking rational expectations sense, I think it is certainly clear that they have gotten a lot   better in that regard over the past twenty years  In that world, the general approach of   transparency and gradualism or inertia may well be the best policy in some sense because that   way we’re working with markets and not, if you will, surprising markets by making large jumps   in interest rates  That is exactly what Bill Poole was saying  But I would like to ask the staff   whether that is a reasonable interpretation of exhibit 3  Can one say that, because markets have   changed sufficiently, we may actually be closer to optimal than some of the earlier specifications   might have suggested?    Well, give us another red point  [Laughter]    All right  So at least it is a credible theory or a theory that one could   put forward that this approach is indeed the right one because the markets have become a lot   better, we’ve become more transparent, and they understand what we’re doing  So, in some   sense we should validate their expectations    Well, on inflation and output    Right, and that’s where I was going to go with Don’s point—or   maybe it was the Chairman’s point  Well, let me say a couple of things  One is that I think we   January 28-29, 2003 44 of 195    may have been taking advantage of changing perspectives about what level of inflation is   acceptable  Second, I think perhaps we have been taking some risks because of financial   fragility or external circumstances  We just released the 1997 transcripts, which clearly   indicated that the Committee—both before Ned and I joined and afterwards—was taking into   consideration some of the risks with respect to the Asian crises and so forth, even though the   economy appeared to be growing faster than one would have liked  So I think it’s possible—not   to pat ourselves on the back exactly but to square this circle—that we take into consideration   both the earlier concerns about financial fragility and the fact that most of the markets are   functioning better   That leads to a second point, a comment I have for Glenn  I think you’re obviously right   to talk about the markets’ ability to anticipate but not on a six-to-nine-month horizon  This may   be just a different way of looking at it, but I would have assumed that another way to view not   necessarily inertia but predictability is whether or not on the day of—or the week before—the   FOMC meeting the markets pretty much have it right  My recollection is that by and large they   do  We’ve rarely left this room with the knowledge that we’ve surprised the markets   dramatically  Once in a while we’ve had to do that  But I suspect that, if in your chart you used   the expected funds rate path a week or two before the meeting instead of the expected funds rate   path in the middle of each quarter, you’d probably find that the predictability would be higher    Would that be the case?    That doesn’t appear to occur  Okay    Okay, good enough  Thank you  Those are my two points    I want to ask a question about your page 3  When I see a chart like   this that shows spreads of corporate yields versus Treasuries for a short period, the question that   comes to my mind is, What should one consider the norm?  If one had a much longer historical   chart, I don’t know what it would show  Is a spread somewhere in the range of 150 to 200 basis   points about right—I’m looking at the US domestic rates—or is that way off?  Can you give us   a little sense of how this fits in the broad historical scheme of things?  That would pick up a little   on the earlier discussion about risk aversion  That spread has come down some, but has it come   down a great deal by historical standards or is it still elevated by historical standards?    Thank you    Could I make a two-handed intervention here?  I’m rather surprised,   Sandy, that in response to Governor Bernanke’s important question you didn’t talk a little about   developments in the world of semiconductors  If one listens to folks in that industry, they cite a   number of, I think, reasonably credible but yet-to-be-proven stories about their ability to build   larger and larger semiconductors and to etch more capabilities into these semiconductors  They   go on to talk about nanotechnology and other things  These stories are not dramatically different   from the kinds of stories they were starting to tell in 1995 and 1996 that proved to be true  So   while I think the question is a quite legitimate one and, as you say, very important, there are   some indications out there about the basic building blocks of this IT boom that suggest that there   still is some room—    That’s fair, but there are still some in the industry—and this will be   my last comment—who would argue that there’s still further to go    Thank you, Mr Chairman  One of the things I’ve observed in   various committees I’ve been on and in other decisionmaking situations is the difficulty of   knowing what you know and knowing what you don’t know  This meeting strikes me as one of   those cases where understanding that difference is key  Just to review what we know, it is   primarily what has happened in the recent past and, as many of you already described, the data   have been quite mixed  What we don’t know is whether or not that recent past is a precursor to a   further slowing going forward or indeed, as is consistent with the Greenbook forecast, a   precursor to some growth  It strikes me that the risk of renewed slowing is not sufficient at this   stage to warrant any action by the Committee today  To put it another way, although the   dichotomy between the recent past and the forecast for the future is quite palpable, at this time I   would place some reasonable odds on something along the lines of the baseline forecast as being   generally correct     There are a number of reasons for that judgment  One is that monetary policy continues   to be, I think, reasonably accommodative  I believe fiscal stimulus is in the pipeline or soon will   be  Inventories–sales ratios are quite low  We see some anecdotal evidence to suggest that   demand for replacement investment is emanating from various businesses and may actually show   through  That’s the fundamental sense of what we know from the recent past  What we don’t   know is what the future is going to look like  But in that regard I’d say that the staff forecast is   not unreasonable  Obviously, the other thing we don’t know is the impact of the geopolitical   uncertainties  I think the effort the staff has made in the work put forward by Sandy   Struckmeyer is very useful and quite instructive  But we really are confronting a great deal of   uncertainty there     January 28-29, 2003 134 of 195    So, given the configuration of monetary and fiscal policy, financial conditions that have   changed, leading and lagging indicators, and other issues, the key question is what we should do   today  Ned Gramlich quoted a football coach; I’m going to quote the cartoon character, Dilbert,   who says that 85 percent of the time doing nothing is the right response  I will leave it at that    I also support your recommendation  "
7220,2003-03-18,"  Dino, on page 2 you’ve shown us both the two-year swap rate and   the policy rate for various countries  I’m trying to understand if there is any policy implication   or meaning in the relationships we see in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia   versus those in Canada and the United States  Obviously in those first three markets the two-  year swap rate has traded down, and at some points it fell below the target policy rate  In a   couple of cases, we’ve seen that the monetary authority made some policy adjustments  So how   should one think about that relationship, if at all, between the two-year swap rate and the policy   rate, particularly in the cases where the swap rate has traded occasionally below the policy rate?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last meeting we have witnessed   a striking example of the differences between risk and uncertainty, with the latter being an   important factor in the private sector’s economic decisionmaking  The economy appeared to   have picked up its pace of growth in January and then suffered a setback by flattening a bit in   February  The toll of uncertainty on consumers showed through in drops in confidence and also   in a slowing of consumer purchases of big-ticket items  Businesses mirrored consumers by   slowing their orders of new equipment, cutting production, and delaying hiring  Finally,   March 18, 2003 61 of 101    financial market participants appear to be highly uncertain about future stock returns and are   highly averse to that uncertainty  These factors evidenced themselves in a decline in stock prices   that drove the equity risk premium to the highest level in more than a decade while, at the same   time, purchases of corporate bonds drove yield spreads on those assets down further  These   financial market developments are most unusual in my eyes in that they reflect a fundamental   tension and inconsistency in risk appetites across assets pools that look to the same source of   earnings—corporate earnings—for the underlying cash flow to support asset valuations   Now, as we all know, this uncertainty broke a bit last week and a little more with the   President’s speech yesterday  What we’ve seen then is that stock prices soared, the dollar rallied,   government bond prices fell, and oil and gold prices slid  As a central bank, presumably we   should put a great deal of weight on financial market and commodity market input  But in this   case one can only hope that the optimism about a benign outcome to both the war and the peace   that’s embodied in these changes in asset prices becomes a reality     When put in an international context, as Dino pointed out earlier this morning, it is clear   that financial market participants still seem to see the US economy as—if I can say it this   way—one of the least ugly economies on the horizon  Perhaps they’re looking to our longer-  term fundamentals, which I would say are basically sound  Fiscal policy is already   accommodative, monetary policy is by many measures still supportive of growth, the dollar has   weakened a bit on net, and productivity continues to increase  Because of the uncertainty we   have witnessed, it is difficult if not impossible to get a firm view of the forces driving recent   economic developments  It is true that we were shocked not just by geopolitical concerns, which   mounted steadily, but also by severe weather, which played through to higher gasoline and   heating oil prices  However, some of the weakness may also reflect more fundamental   March 18, 2003 62 of 101    difficulties that the economy is having in recovering from the recession  The Greenbook reflects   the forecaster’s dilemma by presenting what is described as a “mean” forecast, thereby I think   putting equal weight on a range of possible outcomes  I do not see this as a cop-out at all but   rather an honest reflection of the fact that nobody can declare with certainty which forces, either   transitory or more fundamental, will shape the intermediate term  As others have already   indicated, in these circumstances a prudent central bank certainty wants to do no harm  That is   best accomplished, I believe, by reflecting honestly the imponderables that the immediate future   holds and also by waiting for greater clarity to return  Thank you    I support the combined recommendation of the Chairman and the   Vice Chairman  [Laughter]    The recommendation and the interpretation  [Laughter]    I would argue two things, Mr Chairman  One relates to your last   point, which is similar to what Al Broaddus had to say  It’s not the zero bound that is necessarily   driving this  Second, obviously on September 11 or shortly thereafter, we saw some of this as   we were pumping a lot of liquidity into the markets  It will be very interesting to see if anything   came out of that because we are talking about exactly that same kind of quantitative activity,   though for a different purpose obviously  "
7271,2003-04-16,"  Karen, you passed by the SARS issue  Do you see any risk that that   could become a broader macroeconomic issue?  It has had an impact on a few airlines, and I   April 16, 2003 7 of 47    understand that the trade show now going on in China has very low participation  How much   risk, if any, should we ascribe to SARS as an impact on Asia in a macroeconomic sense?    Yes    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My read of the data, which is that they   mostly suggest only sluggish growth at best, is not inconsistent with what I’ve heard thus far  I   would say that the forward-looking indicators are very much mixed but certainly do not convey   any sense of being a harbinger of higher growth  As I’ve reviewed our forecast here at the Board   and also the consensus forecast, I would tend to agree with what Bob Parry just said  Almost all   the forecasts seem to show what I would describe as continuing erosion over the most recent   short period in response to weaker-than-expected data  As a result of that erosion I would say   that the forecasts all have tended to push out the point at which a rebound—a pickup with some   element of strength—is expected  Therefore, I think it will be very important and constructive to   April 16, 2003 23 of 47    keep a close eye on the data between now and the next meeting  At that point we can decide   whether or not the stance of policy is consistent with our two primary objectives  "
7296,2003-05-06,"  Could I add one other point based on the work that I’ve done on this?    Two other countries have been mentioned in this regard, and one is Korea, which for geopolitical   reasons obviously is not going to go to the market any time soon  But they have been among the   May 6, 2003 7 of 115    emerging-market countries that were most supportive of the CAC, so the expectation is that   when they come to market they will adopt the CAC  The other country that has been active in   these discussions is South Africa, which had been a little more negative about the CAC, I think    But there were many people who thought that, with the Mexicans having gone ahead, the   resistance in South Africa might change as well  So those two countries are ones that need to be   watched  But I think Bill is certainly right that it’s just not clear yet how all this is going to sort   out    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparation for any FOMC meeting it   obviously seems appropriate to make some judgments about three different forecasting issues    The first is whether the baseline forecast is both reasonable and acceptable  The second is how   the forecast has evolved over a period of time, either between meetings or even going back a   May 6, 2003 59 of 115    little further in time  And the third is what the risks are around the baseline  So let me tell you   how I, at least, look at each of those three issues   On the first, I’d argue that the Greenbook baseline forecast may well be reasonable    Certainly with the end of the military phase of the Iraqi war, financial conditions have clearly   improved, as others have already indicated  Equity prices are rising  Risk spreads have   narrowed somewhat, though they are still relatively wide by historical standards  Reductions in   oil prices, as expected, have become clearer, and we’ve seen an improvement in consumer   confidence and a small uptick in corporate profits  All of those developments I would argue   might well be consistent with the basic contours of the baseline forecast    Taking that baseline as at least a reasonable outlook at this stage, the second part of my   first question is, Is it acceptable?  To that my answer is a resounding “no”!  I don’t think the   baseline growth outcome is sufficient  The output gap envisioned in the baseline persists for   several quarters; it is not closed during the forecast period  Unemployment rates remain well   above any that are reasonable for a well-performing US economy  In addition, the composition   of GDP growth is an issue  At least in the near term, the acceleration in GDP growth is heavily   dependent on government defense spending, and indeed, private demand is noticeably weaker   than one would like  Importantly, as others have mentioned, the inflation prospects offered in   the baseline are a concern  In the context of our price stability targets and recognizing some   uncertainty about measurement, I also judge the inflation outlook to be verging on unattractive    On this point I want to make a slight distinction to explain the nature of my concern  This is not   a question in my mind about deflation per se  It’s certainly not a question of going back to the   experience of the ’30s  This is really much more a question about further disinflation, which is   troubling for a number of reasons  One reason is its implications for the effectiveness of   May 6, 2003 60 of 115    monetary policy  A second is the vulnerability of an already weak economy to any additional   shock that might emerge from either internal or external sources     Also, I would say that having price inflation drop even lower than is currently forecast   increases the possibility of what I think of as some self-fulfilling negative ramifications for both   households and businesses  So I’d argue that even if the baseline is reasonable—as I believe it   is— I don’t think it’s necessarily acceptable and we should be vigilant in that regard   The second issue that one thinks of in terms of forecasts is exactly how the forecast has   evolved  As David already pointed out in his prepared remarks, there have been significant   downward revisions in the staff’s forecast since March  I think Cathy compared it with the   projections of about a year ago  I went back to the September 2002 Greenbook and looked at   each one of the Greenbook forecasts since then  With one exception, the GDP outlook has been   marked down each time  There has also been a marking down in the rate of inflation  That   clearly reflects the fact that the data have been coming in weaker and weaker during every one of   these successive periods, which does at least undermine to some degree the confidence one   might have in the Greenbook forecast    What the staff has done in the context of incoming data that have been weaker and   weaker has been to reduce the expectations for the first part of 2003, reduce a bit the   expectations for the second part of 2003, but ramp up quite dramatically the expectations for   2004  As I read it, they’ve done that but have given exactly the same set of reasons for growth   that at one point was thought to be around 35 or 36 percent in 2004 and is now projected to be   48 percent in 2004  So we do have a bit of a problem in that we’re starting, as Don Kohn said,   from a much lower base and hoping to get a much bigger pickup in 2004  I trust that this is not   the triumph of hope over experience and reality   May 6, 2003 61 of 115    Let me go to the third question, which involves the issue of risks  I would say that the   risks are in some sense balanced, but I think we have to be very cautious in that assessment  In   order to see any upside risks with respect to the baseline forecast, I think two things have to   emerge and they have to do so very soon  One is that the tentative nature of the various   conversations many of us have had with business people has to turn quickly to a revelation of a   great deal of pent-up demand either for business fixed investment or for inventory  I don’t see   that that’s going to come from the structural side of investment whatsoever, for reasons that   several of the Presidents have already indicated  I think President Poole, President Pianalto, and   perhaps someone else raised the question of whether or not investment in another firm’s excess   capacity ends up being a positive with respect to the economy as a whole  So while it’s possible   to argue that there is some upside risk on the real side of the economy, I would say that it’s a   fairly tentative argument    I think there are some reasons to be concerned about the downside risks to the real   economy  One is that conditions are not as accommodative as one might think  In the context of   inflation that has been coming in lower and lower and an economy that has been getting weaker   and weaker, monetary policy in fact is not as accommodative as some have been saying  When   we get to our policy discussion, I’m sure somebody will point out that the little dot on the   Bluebook chart that depicts the location of monetary policy has moved firmly back within the   range of the real equilibrium interest rate  It is no longer below the equilibrium rate, so monetary   policy is not as stimulative as we would like to believe   On the fiscal side, we’ve had some colloquy about that already, and I would only add that   it does seem likely that we’ll have fiscal stimulus based just on the nature of government   May 6, 2003 62 of 115    expenditures that are already planned  It is possible, though not certain, that there will be   additional fiscal stimulus  So we should be careful there   Having indicated the risks I see with respect to the real economy, they seem to me   balanced at best or perhaps tilted a little to the downside  With respect to the inflation picture the   risks seem almost all to the downside  In the context of an economy with so much underutilized   capacity, it is really hard to imagine a case in which suddenly we will have an outbreak of   inflation that we have to worry about  It is unpalatable but not impossible to imagine that we   may have too much price stability and will have to worry about that  I’d close by recognizing   that indeed the market is expecting very little of us in terms of a policy action today, and we have   to take that into account when we get to that part of the discussion  But I would say, If not us,   then who?  And if not now, then when?  [Laughter]    The brilliant new chairman!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also agree with your analysis that there   are some straws in the wind that suggest it might be wise to wait  I asked two rhetorical   questions at the end of my earlier statement  The obvious answer to “If not us, then who?” is us    [Laughter]  The more serious question of the two is, “If not now, then when?”  I am supportive   of what I think I heard you imply, which is that we have a two-day meeting coming up in June   during which we can do lots of things and we also will have seen much more data by then  So   I’m interpreting that—   May 6, 2003 84 of 115       That’s the implication I took from your comments, so I’m glad you   made that more explicit for the benefit of everybody  As for the risk statement, a number of   people served with me on the committee that created the wording of the balance of risks sentence   three and a half years ago, but I will take sole responsibility for it    It’s mine  When you’re the father of something that even at the age   of three proves not to be as attractive as you had hoped, you have one of two choices  You can   still embrace it because it’s yours and wait for it to grow up and become that lovely swan that   you expect  Or you can say, “You know, you’re not as attractive as we had hoped, and maybe   someone else wants to adopt you”  [Laughter]  This record will be public in five years, and my   children at that stage will be old enough to actually have an interest in what their father was   saying in this room  They will be teenagers by then, and they will really resent me!     Now, with respect to the creation of the balance of risks language, the then Director of   Monetary Affairs and I got together and tried to work out the matrix of what might happen over   the longer-term horizon When we did that, I will admit that I did not see that the US economy   would be in a position where we’d have extremely low, and possibly declining, inflation and also   expanding growth with a forecast of above-trend growth  So the language that we used—and it   May 6, 2003 85 of 115    was not his fault, it was mine—didn’t fully pick up the type of situation we are in today  So I   think what you have proposed in the third paragraph of this draft statement will get us through   this period quite nicely  It disentangles the two elements of our dual responsibility  It comes   back with a weighted average  I believe it’s as clear as can be, and I’m very supportive of it    Overall, I think this is a great statement  And in the context of having a meeting coming up in   June, I’m very supportive of your recommendation    Right  I want to agree  But there is a difference between a lower   cost of capital where the markets have lowered it versus your point, Ned, which is a low cost of   capital because the issue is low versus what  I think you’re absolutely right that rates of return   depend on a number of factors and not just asset prices  So I strongly endorse your point    As the Chairman has indicated—I'm sorry to talk out of turn without   being called on    This concept really is very much about a growth rate that is close to   potential  Now, potential growth is in a range that we’ve never been public about, and I’m not   sure we all agree that it’s currently somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent      I believe the staff still considers potential to be in that range, and I   think all of us generally understand that that’s what we mean here  The reason we’ve chosen this   language is that we’ve been using these words for a long, long time  They go back to the era of   the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation  In my view, it’s better for us to stick with those words   rather than to say a growth rate about equal to potential because that clearly begs the question of   what we think the rate of potential is  The word “sustainable,” at least to my ear, has an   implication of a pace of economic growth that, as the Chairman suggested, does not contain the   seeds of its own destruction  It means growth that is not too slow, which is what we have now,   nor so far above potential that we risk a breakout of inflation  Admittedly it’s shorthand  But I   don’t think it’s that mysterious that we need to tie ourselves in knots about it today  To make the   May 6, 2003 95 of 115    point again, this little swan that we tried to hatch a few years ago may need to have some plastic   surgery  But I’m not sure that today is the day we ought to look closely at this because what we   mean by sustainable growth is not the issue that has tripped us up with respect to this whole   concept  At least I would argue that  You may disagree    We could always vote on our loss function    You were?  "
7322,2003-06-24,"  In lieu of following up directly, I’d like to ask a question  The   Chairman mentioned the word “Japan”  Prior to his remarks, we heard two briefings that lasted   about forty-five minutes to an hour, and the issue of Japan did not come up  I’d like to know,   recognizing that Japan has severe problems with its banking system that we do not have in this   country, what mistakes you think the Japanese have made  They’ve executed some of these   policies we’re talking about  Perhaps they started too late, perhaps their communication wasn’t   sufficiently clear and robust, or perhaps they didn’t aggressively stay with any of the policies   long enough  All of us around the table have thought about the situation in Japan for a long   period of time  As you’ve reviewed and examined it, what lessons do you think we need to learn   from Japan about the mistakes that can be made in executing some of these nontraditional   policies?    Right   June 24-25, 2003 20 of 211     So it was a weakness in the commitment part of it?    We need coffee to get through it?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first start with the context, and   here I agree with Gary Stern and others that the context of all this—as I think you’ve just   indicated—is reigniting economic growth  We’ll talk more about that tomorrow, but we   shouldn’t lose track of the point that President Stern raised—namely, that if the economy were   June 24-25, 2003 49 of 211    growing at a 4 percent rate and inflation were as low as it is, we’d have a very different view of   the world     Now let me talk about the issues that are on the table here; and in doing so, I’d like to   divide my comments into two sections  One is what to do and when  The second is what to say   and when  I’m going to start with the latter, what to say and when  In that regard I think that,   first, we should recognize that we already have a great deal of credibility  The fact that on   May 6 we did nothing with respect to interest rates but had a phenomenal impact on the yield   curve should give us some sense of empowerment, if you will, for those who are worried about   reactions to what we say  But going further down the path of what to say and when, I would   argue two things  One is that we should continue to do what we’re already doing—in some   sense maintain the status quo—and be very clear about our intention to avoid this problem of   deflation  Two, without overcommitting or being very specific about it, we should convey to the   public that we have a range of tools that we could use  So I would say that at this stage we ought   to keep doing what we’re already doing   I’d be a little cautious about the approach shown in exhibit 4—using either X or Y—for   the reasons that Ned Gramlich laid out  I think the probability is quite low that we can foresee   clearly what we might confront and thereby have a strong sense of when—based on a time   period or some external event happening—we would move rates back up  So I would think that   the kind of ambiguity that we are so practiced at would continue to be helpful  In that regard I   endorse what Ned has already said  So on the issue of what to say and when, my view is that,   although we may not communicate perfectly, by and large we have gotten ourselves   incrementally into a fairly good place and our credibility is relatively high  I’m not sure even if   we get to very low rates that we’d want to change dramatically the way we communicate   June 24-25, 2003 50 of 211    On the question of what to do and when to do it, let me start with the “when”  I agree   with the comment that 75 basis points certainly is not the point at which we should begin to do   anything differently  I’m not sure if it’s 50 or 25; it may actually be zero  I think we need to   have a better understanding of that, if possible  I am a little concerned about potential   discontinuities if suddenly we get rates down and then we begin using some other approach  I   believe one of the earlier papers on the zero bound issue suggested that there should be some   interplay between the level of rates and trying something different  So perhaps we should not   wait for zero and then make a change  That is my instinct anyway     Now let me move to the harder question of what that different approach should be  I was   very influenced by the nature of the presentations we had from Vincent and Dino in that what   we’re really looking at in all of these relatively unconventional matters is some sort of risk–  benefit tradeoff  As I listened to the discussion, I became more concerned about the risks of   targeting particular segments of the yield curve, trying if you will to put a ceiling on longer-term   interest rates in a very explicit way  The exit strategy issues and the coordination with the   Treasury strike me as very real concerns and not something we should underplay  I am less   concerned, frankly, about the possibility that we may take some losses or those kinds of issues   because I don’t see why a central bank in an environment of fiat money should have a very   serious concern about that     So that inclines me, while not to a decisive conclusion, toward a pure quantitative   approach and a focus on reserves for a couple of reasons  One is that in some sense we have   operated quite successfully that way both in the emergencies of September ll and more broadly    It is something that central banks certainly know how to do, and we can communicate reserve   targeting very clearly  I accept the fact that the interactions between pure quantitative easing and   June 24-25, 2003 51 of 211    the outcome with respect to the real economy are potentially uncertain, but that ties back to the   need to communicate clearly     So I conclude, as Governor Bernanke did, that what we really are thinking about here is a   package of quantitative operations and communications  Though my comments have been   divided into what to say and what to do, the reality is that they work in tandem  Therefore, I   believe we ought to be thinking about using both of those tools simultaneously  I’d compare it to   the way one flies an airplane by worrying about the altitude and the other things that one worries   about in the plane, which obviously I don’t know; so I wish I hadn’t gone down that path!    [Laughter]  Let me close by saying (1) I think we’re not in danger yet, (2) it is important to have   this kind of discussion, and (3) I’d keep all of our tools regarding both what to say and do and   when on the table  But I would lean toward avoiding some of the riskier strategies by looking   more closely at the reserve requirement issues and thinking about quantitative easing in a very   explicit way  Thank you        I was struck, when you were talking about the spreads for   investment-grade credits, that you mentioned the search for yield and expectations regarding   rates but you didn’t say anything about underlying fundamentals  What can you tell us about   market perceptions in the debt market?  You said something about the equity market, but I   wondered how investors perceive the actual risks involved in the purchase of fixed-income   corporate debt    I’ll move to ratify    I have a very brief question on chart 12  You mentioned the concept   that deflation could be self-correcting  The example you gave obviously was productivity   improvements and so forth  Are there broader examples of self-correcting deflation?  I could   imagine perhaps a change in exchange rates and a pretty big pass-through of that  But what else   would one put in the category of self-correcting deflation?      All right, thank you    Right    Thank you, Mr Chairman  You closed our last meeting by using a   legal term, the concept of the burden of proof  You suggested that the burden of proof at this   meeting should fall on those who thought they saw sufficient growth either in the data or in the   outlook that we should stand pat  If I were the judge on the case, I’d say that at this stage the   case is unproven, as the British would say      Well no, sir  The British include England, Scotland, and Wales    [Laughter]   June 24-25, 2003 126 of 211     We’ll split the difference and call it what an island magistrate would   say  Let me proceed with the evidence, if I might  First, on the evidence supporting a sense that   things are looking better, I’d have to say that there are a number of straws in the wind in support   of that assessment  They’ve been talked about here today  Retail sales grew respectably in May,   the labor markets appear to be stabilizing, and the data we’ve just received on new and existing   home sales are certainly a sign of continued robustness in that sector  It’s not surprising that the   household sector seems reasonably strong because the underlying fundamentals for that sector   look strong  Real disposable income has improved for a number of reasons; the stock market   obviously has contributed positively to household balance sheets; and as was mentioned earlier,   there are ongoing opportunities for refinancing  And consumer confidence seems, on balance, to   be firming somewhat  If one moves from the household sector to look at the industrial side of   the economy, again there are straws in the wind  IP has stabilized, as a number of people have   said, and the survey data from both the Reserve Bank regional surveys and the ISM give a sense   of perhaps some firming in the manufacturing sector  Finally and most important, as we’ve   already noted, the financial conditions are quite consistent with a turning  Equity prices are up;   risk spreads are down; and as Vincent and Dino indicated yesterday, some of the forward-  looking indicators of risk also suggest some improvement  So there are a number of reasons for   a bit of cautious optimism  But I would put the emphasis on “cautious”  What doesn’t seem to   be there yet is the type of self-reinforcing improvement that we’d need to see before we decide   not to take out some insurance today     Let me also go through the bits of evidence that perhaps disprove the case  First, I would   say that it’s not really clear what the financial markets are telling us  Normally we could look to   June 24-25, 2003 127 of 211    them to be forward-looking and to tell us something about the real economy  As I listened to the   discussion yesterday and thought about it myself, there seemed to be some question about the   markets’ assessment of the real economy  As someone said yesterday, in part what seems to be   driving the fixed-income markets are a search for yield and an expectation that interest rates will   remain low  Neither necessarily indicates that the market sees the real economy as improving  If   one looks at the equity markets, what we heard yesterday—which is consistent with what I’ve   heard and what I’m thinking in general—is that we are seeing data from the corporate sector that   are not getting worse and may be stabilizing  But the recent data certainly are not consistent with   a rapid turnaround  So I have a bit of a question as to whether or not, as someone said earlier, we   may be looking in the mirror  At least there is a question as to whether the financial conditions   are really supportive or indicative of growth  I would say that they are clearly supportive; I’m   not sure they’re yet indicative of growth     The second reason I’d be somewhat cautious relates to the fact that I spent a lot of time in   the company of CEOs over the past intermeeting period  In my view, they still harbor a fair   amount of pessimism, a judgment that is shared by others who have already commented  I say   that because of both what the CEOs themselves talked about and what they said about the issues   on which their boards of directors are focused  I believe the boards continue to be more heavily   focused on corporate governance issues and leeriness about accounting issues as opposed to   trying to find places to make investments for expansion  Also, I think order books are not yet   sufficiently full for CEOs to have a great deal of confidence in moving forward  I would argue   that the data we’ve seen, which Steve described as mildly encouraging, are no more than mildly   encouraging  That’s not bad, but obviously they do not suggest that activity is really robust  So   June 24-25, 2003 128 of 211    I’d put a question mark on the outlook for the corporate sector and particularly for the investment   side of that     The third area of concern I’d have is the consumer sector  While many of the   fundamentals look good, the fact that the unemployment rate is staying relatively high and job   creation is relatively muted has at least the risk of weighing more on the household sector than it   has in the past  I’m not sure that it will, but it might     If one puts the two sides together and adds to it the stimulus in the pipeline from   monetary and fiscal policy, I can see how the staff came up with the baseline forecast, and I’m   not going to quibble strongly with that  But I do believe that the risks to that forecast are   primarily to the downside     Nevertheless, even if we take the forecast as given and look out past the next few   quarters, we see a number of things happening  One is that the output gap still closes relatively   slowly  Second, the unemployment rate hangs up above the NAIRU through next year  Third,   core PCE even before the adjustment stays at what I would consider to be the very low end of an   acceptable range  Add to that the fact that, even in the context of what some view as a relatively   strong forecast, the staff has lowered its expectations for core PCE over the next eighteen months   or so from the estimate they had in January   The other point I would add is that, in its forecast, the staff normally does not in any   sense lead us in terms of implying a change in rates  This time they chose to put in a 25 basis   point cut and still got to this longer-term outlook that I would call only moderately acceptable if   one thinks about the disinflation picture in particular  On top of that I’d note the information   provided in chart 11 of the chart show about the probability of deflation, given the current low   rate of inflation  I would describe that chart as really quite sobering  I would then pick up from   June 24-25, 2003 129 of 211    where Ned Gramlich was—which is that, when we get to the policy session, the choice is   between a more aggressive or a less aggressive approach  I think there are legitimate arguments   on both sides  I certainly think we need to take out at least some insurance, and I’ll wait until the   policy round to talk about what I think that should be  Thank you very much, Mr Justice    If you went to law school, it’s not so bad!     Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation and I also very   much like the way you got there  I think we do want to reestablish an accommodative policy,   which means the choice is between 50 and 25 basis points  Given the fiscal stimulus in the   pipeline and given some of the incoming data that suggest a pickup in economic activity,   50 basis points may be a bit too much  As I’ve listened to the discussion today and thought   about it, I must say that I would like to have a bit more of a cushion  But if things unfold in a   negative way, I think we will have time to provide more of a cushion  I strongly endorse what   we’re trying to do overall, which is to send a very clear signal that we’re prepared to be   accommodative now and prepared to be accommodative for some time if we have to be    June 24-25, 2003 145 of 211    Working with the risk assessment the way you’ve outlined seems quite consistent with that last   statement; I think it might send that signal  There is some risk that we’ll disappoint the market to   some degree, but I don’t think this action will backfire on us  So I’m very comfortable with your   recommendation and the way you got there    Yes, it’s the primary credit rate  "
7349,2003-08-12,"  I’ll move approval of the minutes of the June meeting    I’ll move both of those    I’ll move to ratify the transactions    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll divide my review of the intermeeting   period into two sections  One I would describe as what we know, which is to say what   happened  The second is what we think, or how we interpret the data  First, what do we know?    As others have said, the data on the real economy during the intermeeting period have been quite   mixed  The labor market continues to disappoint, with a fall in the latest reading on private   payroll employment and a shortening of the workweek  However, many other types of economic   data admittedly have been more positive  On the output side, manufacturing activity seemed to   climb a bit toward the end of the second quarter and is at least holding in the early part of this   quarter  On the spending side, the limited information from July, namely for light vehicle sales   August 12, 2003 56 of 110    and chain store sales, I think indicates that consumers are holding up their end in this nascent   recovery  With regard to business fixed investment, anecdotal evidence from the surveys that we   undertake here and from surveys of capital spending by others have been a bit more upbeat as   well  So what we know about the real economy has been relatively positive but there are still   some negatives as well   What about the financial markets?  I’d say that there’s perhaps a bit of bifurcation there    Equities have turned in a very respectable performance since the last meeting  The S&P is   basically unchanged, but the Nasdaq is up about 2 percent, and that may well reflect some   positive earnings surprises and an improved outlook  As we’ve discussed, however, the fixed-  income markets have had a much less even run since the last meeting, with intermeeting   increases in two-year and ten-year yields that are quite dramatic by historical standards    Importantly, real yields as measured by TIPS rose significantly less than nominal yields on   Treasury securities, which suggests some increase in anticipated compensation for inflation    Similarly, as Governor Kohn has already indicated, market expectations for monetary policy   during the intermeeting period also showed a clear upward shift in the outlook for interest rates     Now, outlining these facts is relatively easy  The hard part, obviously, is for us to try to   interpret them  In that regard, I think there are three important questions  The first is, Are these   facts consistent with the staff forecast and outside forecasts of gradually improving growth,   particularly with growth starting now in the third quarter?  My interpretation is that the facts do   seem to be consistent with the judgment that the economy will experience the much-expected   turnaround in the second half of this year  Admittedly, of course, that growth is still a forecast,   but it seems to me that, since the last meeting, the odds of that growth occurring have certainly   picked up substantially  Even the much-discussed run-up in fixed-income yields, put in a   August 12, 2003 57 of 110    broader context going back to May 5, the day before our May FOMC meeting, does not seem so   outsized     The second question is, Are these data internally consistent?  The answer, as is always   the case, is “no, they are not”  Inconsistencies and questions I think still abound  First and   foremost, why is job growth so sluggish?  Is it a sign of uncertainty on the part of businesses?    Or on the other hand is it just the negative side of a very good productivity story?  That’s hard to   answer; I think it’s probably a little of both  In my view, the productivity numbers should reign   supreme here   Another question with respect to job growth, as it turns around very slowly, is   whether it’s likely to slow down the spending behavior of consumers  My judgment is “no, it is   not”  I believe that the stimulative monetary policy and fiscal policy plus a gradually improving   labor picture are likely to be sufficient to support consumer behavior, which will be an important   part of this turnaround   Again in the category of whether these data are internally consistent, one struggles a bit   with what the message is from the financial markets  Governor Kohn has already done, as one   would imagine given his background, a superb analysis of the financial markets  So I will be   modest and not attempt to replicate exactly what he has said  But I do find the communication   challenge we face with respect to the markets quite difficult to understand  Nobody can   understand fully why market expectations for monetary policy have shifted so dramatically   toward a future tightening by the FOMC  It may be due to the more positive tone in the recent   economic information, as Governor Kohn has suggested, but it may also be that communication   challenges will create a bit of a problem for us going forward  So I’d say we still have to be on   the lookout in that regard     August 12, 2003 58 of 110    The final issue with respect to interpretation of these data is what they mean in terms of   the various risks to our dual mandate  On that I’d have to say that I recognize, as President Poole   suggested, that there might be some upside risks  A quick turnaround in inventory accumulation,   for example, could hit us in the third or the fourth quarter, though that would not be a negative   development  But by and large my concerns about the risks tend to be much more to the   downside, particularly with respect to the price stability issues  If one looks at any of the   forecasts—and certainly our staff forecast of economic growth is high among them—for the next   six quarters they all imply a still large pool of underutilized resources at the end of the forecast   period  In all of the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook, particularly the most optimistic ones   with faster structural productivity growth or the lower NAIRU, we end up having far less of a   cushion in terms of the inflation rate  In the two most optimistic scenarios, the core PCE   inflation rate drops far below 1 percent, well outside the bounds of what I would think of as price   stability  So I have some concerns about the risks going forward, which I see as being primarily   on the downside  And I think this is really quite problematic    If I go outside the context of the Greenbook and look at other forecasts, my concerns, if   anything, are heightened  As a number of members already have pointed out, our staff is   probably at the high end of the consensus outlook for GDP growth as compared with the Blue   Chip forecasts  This suggests to me that there may be some risks to the downside with respect to   the staff forecast  I think the risks are somewhat asymmetric, with the greater probability of an   outcome that is perhaps somewhat weaker than the staff envisions  That weaker outcome may   emerge from three different types of surprises that are possible, though not certain  The first is   that the export picture may be a little weaker; other economies may not turn around as quickly as   the staff forecast and Karen have suggested  The second—and one that certainly shows up in the   August 12, 2003 59 of 110    more pessimistic outside forecasts—is that the recent change in financial conditions may have a   stronger impact on refinancings than anticipated  Again, that’s not a certainty, but it is a risk that   is not picked up fully in the Greenbook  The third, as implied by President Pianalto’s comments,   is that the usual multiplier–accelerator effects may not work as envisioned; and as we get into   2004, there’s a real risk that some of the strength we see in 2003 may not be translated into   business decisions to invest     So where does that leave us?  Frankly, given the relatively positive tone of the incoming   data and given market expectations, I think it’s probably prudent today to sit tight with respect to   monetary policy itself  On the other hand, the absence of a policy response today makes it even   more important that we maintain a vigilant posture in our written statements, particularly with   respect to the price stability part of our mandate  I will stop there and leave the rest of my   comments until the second part of the meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It was the Stone McCarthy one      It was the Stone McCarthy survey, but part of the challenge is   interpreting the words that were used  It says no change in the balance of risks    Right    Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I will   say to your broader philosophical question that I’m still struggling with whether or not being in a   new world of greater uncertainty suggests more caution or more aggressive behavior, given   where the price measures are and the outlook for inflation  But for today I think your   recommendation seems to be the sounder one    May I speak?    I think the statement looks good  It’s quite consistent with the last   statement, which I gather from our survey is what the markets expect  So in that sense I think   this is a good statement  I wouldn’t change anything about it    That last sentence comes directly from the Chairman’s testimony, I   think    Mr Chairman, may I speak to this?  I see others want to comment as   well    My sense of the last sentence, Cathy, is that it’s actually rather   important, given what we’ve seen in terms of changes in fed funds futures  It’s not that I think   we ought to attempt to micromanage markets because I know we can’t  But in terms of the   communications challenge, I do believe that it’s quite important for us to say as best we can that   we expect to maintain an accommodative policy, whatever that might be, recognizing that   growth will probably pick up and has to pick up eventually  I think it would have some very   beneficial effects to say that we can remain accommodative for a period of time, though again   I’m not sure what that period of time is  But my read of the last sentence in the last paragraph is   that in some sense it is the key response to the very volatile and uncertain markets we’ve seen  I   think it would be helpful after this meeting for us to be quite clear about it  It’s not news in the   sense that the Chairman has already said it once in his testimony on the semiannual report on   monetary policy objectives  Moreover, I think it is consistent with what the markets are   expecting and more helpful than not in terms of being far less likely to create uncertainty  On   the other hand, I don’t think it commits us to anything that we don’t want to commit to   because—by definition, if you will—if the data come in stronger, we’ll respond to that     I’m not suggesting that we try to target anything  I just want to try to   be clear about what we know and what we in this room are sensing  I think the outside world   probably hasn’t picked that up   August 12, 2003 88 of 110      I think that’s right    August 12, 2003 95 of 110     Well, it’s a procedural recommendation  I think we could easily have   a dinner meeting the previous night, and we could treat it as we do any other intermeeting   discussion      Yes, we announce it the way we did it after—    Well, we could have a conference call  Either we could have a   conference call to discuss communications, or we could do it in person  But in either case, we’d   announce the fact that we met for an intermeeting discussion in the same way that we announce   conference calls    Yes, I think we’d want to discuss this issue in person  But I would   say—and frankly I don’t know if you’d want to handle a breakfast meeting this way—that   theoretically we could argue that we would treat a breakfast meeting as though it were any other   intermeeting discussion  And we would announce that in the usual way, when we release the   minutes of the previous meeting    The breakfast would be from 730 to 900 am, and then the regular   meeting would begin at 900 am    Well, it’s legal in terms of our definition of a meeting, [laughter] but   I think it’s easier to handle the dinner meeting in that way    No, that’s why you don’t need lawyers!  [Laughter]  I would suggest   that we have the dinner meeting; it’s easier to bifurcate that from the regular meeting and treat it   the way we do any other intermeeting discussion    Yes, it also gives us more flexibility and time    You need to announce the date of the next meeting before we close   today  "
7374,2003-09-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me pick up where Tom Hoenig left   off and discuss what I think you and Vincent were suggesting  First, I do think there will be   some benefit in trying to standardize or routinize the so-called risk assessment  I’ll leave out the   September 15, 2003 41 of 78    issue of the “considerable period”  To me that’s rather close to policy  But as a general matter, I   believe our risk-assessment language has evolved to where it seems as though it would work for   a long enough period of time, and I think it ought to be routinized—and disclosed in the   Bluebook in the way you and Vincent were talking about    I would disagree with Tom on the content of the statement  In my view, we do owe it to   the world, once we make a decision, to attempt to find the broad middle ground that supported   that decision  To explain why we did what we did—in I don’t know how many sentences,   maybe two, or three, or four as we do now—I believe is extremely valuable and, frankly, quite   doable We should put this problem into a broader context, as you suggested, and be a little   careful not to be blown off kilter by two months of experience  After all, the Federal Reserve   now has ninety years of experience  The FOMC may have made some horrific mistakes over the   years, but I would say that, over the last twenty-four years or so, by and large the policy setting   has been right and our ability to explain it has been good  So let’s not get thrown off by two or   three months when a number of technical factors plus some communication issues created a   problem  What you suggested in terms of changes to the process strikes me in concept as a step   forward because it gets the Committee involved in the right way in the wording of the statement   without undercutting some of the things we want to do     To go further and address a point that Tom made, I feel pretty strongly—and by the end   of this discussion I may be alone on this—that we shouldn’t move up the publication of the   minutes  I have two reasons—one involves process and one, substance  First, we have to be   very careful because, once we take such a step, we can’t walk back from it  Second, I think we   would find that many times—as has occurred even with the minutes released on the timetable we   use now—there is a phrase or sentence in there that the market latches onto  The thought   September 15, 2003 42 of 78    conveyed may have reflected a view expressed at the meeting, but even with the passage of two   or three weeks it may no longer be accurate or it may never have been an accurate reflection of   the central view  So, given the fact that I don’t think we’re in such horrific shape with the   statement the way we do it now, I wouldn’t jump to a new approach—assuming we can improve   the process of formulating the statement—because I think the risks by and large outweigh the   benefits  That’s all generally a process issue  Let me talk a bit about the content     As I’ve already indicated, in my view where we’ve ended up with this ad hoc approach   with respect to the balance of risks is not so bad  With regard to the question of sustainable   economic growth—I’m looking at exhibit 3—its meaning has evolved over time, and I think it   has come to mean growth that doesn’t create imbalances  It was originally, years ago, growth at   close to potential, but it didn’t contain any level concept or notion of imbalances  It has started   to move in the direction of the latter, and I have no objection to that   Vincent asked whether the word “risk” has a negative connotation  We got into this   language, as you may recall, because we’d go out and make speeches and be asked—at least it   happened to me often, and others may have experienced this, too—what the balance of risks was    So the answer was that we would tell the public about the balance of risks  I don’t have a strong   sense that risks for a central bank are all negative because there’s an upside and a downside    There are risks in some directions that some people think are good but that we as central bankers   think are not so good  So I wouldn’t worry about that  But if the Committee feels strongly that   we shouldn’t use the word “risk,” so be it     Vincent’s fourth question was, how long is the foreseeable future?  I give the same   answer we always give—it’s this [Laughter]  How the record is going to demonstrate the gesture   I just made with my hand, I’m not really sure!  In any event, it’s an elastic concept, and I don’t   September 15, 2003 43 of 78    have any problem with that  I think the markets have gotten used to it  I won’t at this point   answer your fifth question about whether we should make a commitment that policy will remain   accommodative for a considerable period     In sum, what I would say is that we need to clean up the process here  We need to create   a way to use the Bluebook so the Committee can get more involved in the wording of the   statement  But I’d be a little cautious about doing dramatic surgery on the substance based on   two to three months of experience that we wish had been a little better  In the context of what   we’re trying to do, I think what we have been doing is not so bad  While taking a step forward   from here may look nice on paper, I think it has more risks than benefits  Finally, somewhat   surprisingly for me, I’m relatively conservative on this matter  In my view we’re not far off   from the proper approach  We just need to clean up the process    And how many members of the MPC are there?   SEVERAL  Nine    We have nineteen    What could be clearer!  "
7395,2003-09-16,"  Mr Chairman, I would suggest, given this discussion, that we not   change the wording    May I raise my hand in lieu of President Minehan?    I know I’m not being very helpful—and I agree that we can’t edit as   a group—but I have a slight concern with the last sentence because of the words “members   recognize that going forward they should consider some changes”  I’d like to propose that we   say that the Committee “may well consider some changes”  If we tell the public that we should   consider some changes, my expectation is that Michelle’s phone will ring a lot, we’ll be   questioned almost incessantly on exactly what changes we are considering, when we are going to   introduce them, and whether we creating another subcommittee to look at this    Right  So I would change that to “may well consider” because we   may well do that  We’re a lively, vibrant group    Michelle has given me some wording here that may help  It reads   “Nonetheless, members recognize that going forward they could consider changes that might   improve the Committee’s communication of its assessment of the economic situation”  It’s the   same sort of concept  I don’t have a strong view about the precise wording  Michelle’s words   seem absolutely fine to me      Michelle, would you read it?    Yes, I think “may” is a little better      Why don’t we say “may from time to time consider,” which conveys   that point?   September 16, 2003 7 of 106     So it’s Michelle’s sentence with “may from time to time consider   changes,” etc      There’s a general nodding of heads    I’ll move approval of the minutes     I’ll move to ratify the open market transactions    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The key question at this meeting is   whether the incoming data from the real economy, market developments, and ultimately the   outlook are sufficiently changed from our last meeting to warrant a change in either our policy or   our tactics  I’ll discuss each of these in turn but—not to be mysterious—have concluded that no   midcourse correction seems called for at this meeting   First, from the data, one sees that signs of economic acceleration are indeed more   widespread and probably firmer than at our last meeting, but with some important exceptions    Households continue to be the basis of this expansion  Sales of consumer durables and retail   sales in the control category are both consistent with a growing economy  This is important   because many had thought that the household sector might eventually falter  In that regard, I do   take note of the conversation that Dave Stockton and the Chairman had with respect to questions   September 16, 2003 62 of 106    about the impact of the recent tax cuts  But given the basic strength of the economy, I also   believe that we’re likely to see increases in income that will be sufficient to support the   expansion going forward    However, the important question has been when, if at all, the handoff will take place   between households and the business sector  I would say at this stage that the household sector   still is the bulwark, but businesses may be in the initial stages of picking up their portion of the   burden  Orders and shipments for capital goods have firmed, and anecdotal reports and surveys   have both become a bit more upbeat  However, thus far the participation of businesses in the   turnaround is very uneven  Anecdotal evidence suggests that we’re seeing only replacement   investment and not yet expansion  Similarly, business investment in inventories has yet to pick   up, and one is hard pressed, I think, to support the notion that all the drag from inventories is due   to improvements in supply chain management and some permanent lowering of the desired   inventory–sales ratio  I believe that businesses still face some lingering uncertainty about sales   that seems to be weighing on their decisions with respect to rebuilding inventories   Finally, and already much discussed, labor market conditions are clearly not consistent   with the kind of well-established firming of activity that our economy has experienced   traditionally  Of course, the issue in this regard is that labor market conditions may be likely to   firm only slowly in this environment of improved structural productivity and that the past may   not necessarily be prologue     So if the data indicate ongoing but still uneven firming, what can we take from the   financial markets?  I conclude that financial markets are certainly supportive of a continued and   more rapid expansion of the US economy  Several indicators—including bond issuance, flows   to mutual funds, risk spreads, pricing of credit default swaps, and valuations of high-tech   September 16, 2003 63 of 106    stocks—indicate that risk appetites have increased somewhat  Additionally, the much-discussed   backup in long rates does not seem to be a limiting factor in the turnaround  Indeed, I think it is   really more a signal of an expectation of a turnaround  However, the absence of truly robust   expansion plans on the part of businesses is clearly seen in the relatively lax demand for C&I   loans  The commentary from banking sector contacts such as FAC members indicates that, at   most, bankers expect only demand for replacement investment and not expansion just yet  As   with the data on the real economy, therefore, I think the financial markets are painting a picture   of an improving but still uneven economic backdrop and outlook     Finally, let me turn to the outlook itself  I have no strong quibbles with the baseline   forecast  However, I note—as did President Broaddus in the Q&A session after the staff   report—that since the previous Greenbook the staff has marked up real GDP growth for the   forecast period while also marking up the unemployment rate for the next five quarters  At the   same time, they’ve left the inflation rate basically unchanged or actually down slightly This   clearly is a reflection of the fact that they have taken some of the productivity surprise into   structural productivity increases  I also note, however, that the output gap remains an important   element of this forecast into 2005, suggesting to me at least that deflationary pressures have not   lessened and are not likely to do so quickly    While I have no major quibbles with the staff forecast per se, I must say that I do see   some risks on both sides with respect to the growth outlook  First, as I think a few others have   mentioned, there’s the fact that our staff’s forecast seems to be somewhat above the Blue Chip   forecast but still below the most optimistic of the outside forecasters  I think we should give at   least some weight to the views of those more optimistic individuals  But I’d also observe that   there might be some downside risks around the staff’s current forecast  First, I fear that the   September 16, 2003 64 of 106    inventory–sales story is not fully understood and that the ratio of inventory to sales might not be   as out of line with business desires as the staff seems to think  If that’s the case, the bounceback   in inventories might not be as strong as in the baseline  I also have some concerns that the fixed   investment story, which depends very much on the so-called lifting of gloom that also plays an   important part in the equipment and software story, might not emerge as quickly as the staff   assumes  This issue obviously should be resolved in the near term because we’re in the period   when businesses are planning their budgets for next year, so we should have some better sense of   equipment and software plans by the time we meet again  Given that configuration, this seems to   me to be a good time, as I said in my opening remarks, to maintain as unchanged a policy   posture as possible        2  Governor Bies    Let me continue the usual tradition by commenting first on your   three-part recommendation and then I’ll talk about the statement  First, I think you’re right that   we shouldn’t move the funds rate  While I am always influenced by the chart that shows the   current funds rate versus the real equilibrium rate, I think financial conditions actually have been   rather accommodative  Also, a change in the funds rate would surprise the markets  I don’t   think we should move the rate  With respect to the balance of risks, I support your   recommendation to stay pretty much with our tri-partite statement  In my view it has worked   well  You added another component to your recommendation for the press statement, and I want   to focus on that next  I think it is important, as Vincent suggested and as you also implied, that   we move from chronological time to economic time because what is going to drive our policy   decisions is not the passage of months but what we see happening     Then we get to the question of what we want to see happen  Obviously, it seems right to   talk about that in terms of containing disinflationary forces  That is a key economic issue that   worries us, and it will be the issue that we will continue to focus on  I rather like your addition   of this concept of fostering the containment of disinflationary forces  My son’s seventh grade   English teacher probably would not be ecstatically happy with the resulting sentence, but then   he’s not in this room  I like what you’ve proposed here because it gives a sense of an ongoing   process, and I think it will give us some flexibility when we start to see things coming together    September 16, 2003 82 of 106    That is, when we feel we have succeeded in fostering the containment of disinflation, that might   be the time to make a policy move, and we can all decide when that point has been reached  So   while this is not necessarily beautiful English, to me it is a good description of when a   responsible Committee might think about changing its policy  That’s really all I want to try to   signal this time  So, in light of my view that nineteen people can’t redraft a press statement very   readily and my sense that we want to move from chronological toward economic time in our   statement, I can support all three parts of your tripartite recommendation  "
7420,2003-10-28,"  I’ll move the minutes of that meeting    Could I move us from Japan to the subject of page 2, where you gave   an impression of some concern about what I’d call financial stability?  You commented about a   lack of fear with regard to the dramatic drop in corporate debt spreads  I would say that what   you were pointing out is certainly factual and correct in the fixed-income markets  In the equity   markets, however, the risk premium seems to be quite consistent with what it was before the run-  up in the ’90s  We had a bit of discussion about that yesterday with the staff here  So I do   wonder if you’re right to talk about the lack of fear in fixed-income markets or if that is simply a   reflection of the fact that interest rates globally are relatively low  Could it be that what we’re   October 28, 2003 11 of 126    seeing is what one naturally would expect to see in a low interest rate, low inflation   environment?     Right    Good, thank you    I’ll move to ratify the domestic open market operations   October 28, 2003 12 of 126     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At every meeting we have to do three   things (1) assess the economy and risks to the outlook, (2) decide the policy implications, and   (3) talk about communication  Recognizing that the third topic is going to be exciting today—  one hopes—I’ll try to be brief on the first two     On the assessment of the economy, it’s clear that the third and fourth quarters seem to be   extremely robust  One recognizes obviously, as Ned Gramlich just mentioned, that the pattern   particularly with respect to real PCE growth did slow a little in September  But that doesn’t   leave me with any great concern  I think the overall pattern of PCE growth is still well   maintained  Similarly, I would point to the demand for both new and existing homes as being   very strong; and this morning’s data on shipments and orders also suggest that the third and   fourth quarters are likely to be very robust  Fortunately, it also appears that the sources of the   turnaround seem to be broadening somewhat  The industrial sector is starting to show some   signs of strength  Industrial production appears to have expanded in the third quarter, and it’s   possible that capacity utilization is also starting to firm somewhat  I’d say that the labor market,   which is the biggest question mark we’ve been dealing with, does seem to be giving some early   signs of stabilizing  We haven’t talked much about it in this room today but when the September   jobs data came out, that got quite a bit of attention in the press, and we shouldn’t forget that the   news was positive  Similarly, the revisions to the job declines in July and August were all in the   right direction and were consistent with a gradual bottoming of the labor market  The four-week   moving average of initial claims declined a bit, and the household survey data suggested that   layoffs might be subsiding  So overall I’d say that the Greenbook was right in terms of moving   up expectations for the third and fourth quarters     October 28, 2003 65 of 126    That leads to the second issue, which is how one assesses the future  In that regard I can   understand and generally feel reasonably comfortable with the logic of the Greenbook forecast    The Greenbook assumes that the step-up in productivity will continue, though it hasn’t taken in   all the increases recently as permanent  The stimulative policies plus some assumptions about   multiplier and accelerator effects all result in an economy that grows at about 5 percent per year,   creates jobs and wealth, and then has the unemployment rate falling gradually  As President   Broaddus said, the Greenbook forecast is certainly easy to love  If I were from the Dallas   District I’d probably have a catchy tune about how easy love may be fleeting love  [Laughter]     Let me talk about the risks that are associated with this forecast  I think it’s easy to see   risks on the downside, as Cathy has pointed out  One of the risks is that so much of what   happened in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter seems to have been driven by policy   stimulus  Real pre-tax income was essentially unchanged during the summer months of the year    As that effect starts to wane, there’s a possibility that we won’t get quite the kind of uptick that   the Greenbook expects  And while David and Vincent gave us a number of stories, if you will,   about why demand for C&I loans has been very slow to turn around, the bankers I’ve talked to   certainly are worried about it  They seem to think that it may really be a sign of slower growth   than the Greenbook forecast suggests  I recently had a meeting with the real estate roundtable,   and across the board that group was quite subdued  So some anecdotal information suggests that   our staff forecast is a bit more hopeful than many people, at least many in the real world, are at   this stage  Add to that the fact that the Greenbook forecast is already above the Blue Chip   consensus, and it seems that some concern about the downside risks is warranted   On the upside, though, I think one must say that rarely at this stage of an expansion has   the economy seen this kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus—with interest rates extremely low,   October 28, 2003 66 of 126    prices stable, the dollar coming off, productivity increasing, financial conditions turning, and   earnings relatively strong  Those and a variety of other factors could lead to some upside   potential around the forecast  So I’d say that even around our relatively optimistic forecast,   while love may be fleeting, the risks are relatively balanced   With respect to policy, I suspect that, when we get to that point of our discussion, there’s   not going to be very much to say  With respect to communication I, like others, will restrain   myself as best I can except to say that I believe the interaction between policy and   communication today is such that the Committee would be very well advised to take a fairly   cautious approach  We have a great deal to discuss, and I’d hate for us to get ahead of ourselves   in the statement that we make at 215 today  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I concur with the recommendation    First, I want to start with a quote, go on to make some points, and   then answer Vincent’s question  Vincent opened with a quote from William of Orange, and I’ll   start with one from Winston Churchill, who said that in matters of communication “victory is   never final, and defeat is never fatal”  So I want to encourage us to keep going because whatever   happens we will not get to the end point     Second, I come from a background in consulting, and one of the first things I learned in   consulting was to define the nature of the problem  That leads me to discuss a little survey that I   found  The question was, Does the Fed disclose enough information about interest rate policy?    Thirty-four percent of the respondents said that they felt well informed; another 34 percent   October 28, 2003 91 of 126    answered “yes, there was enough information but it was a little too confusing”; 27 percent said   the Fed is “too secretive”; and a surprising 5 percent said that the Fed provided too much   information  I don’t suggest that this survey was scientific and, obviously, if it didn’t support my   point of view I wouldn’t have brought it up!  [Laughter]  But the reason I raised it is that I think   we have to be very careful here  Although we’ve suffered criticism, boos as well as cheers, I’m   not so sure that we need a dramatic change in our communications  We need a change for sure,   but I’m not convinced that we need a dramatic change that may again throw the markets into   uncertainty about what we’re trying to do  I would caution us, as we go through this exercise, to   recognize that our communication policy is not perfect by any stretch of imagination but it’s not   completely broken  So I would encourage us to think about incremental changes, if you will     That said, let me get to the answer to Vincent’s first question regarding a clear preference   as to the basic structure of our statement  On this I pick up from where Tony Santomero was in   the early part of the meeting  I believe it would be very helpful in the forward-looking part of   our statement for us to separate the two issues that are now combined  One part would literally   be an indication of how we think the economy is likely to evolve or change—whether we think   growth is picking up or slowing down and whether inflation is picking up or slowing down  That   would involve just a factual statement, if you will  The second part would give some sort of   value judgment or welfare assessment, whatever the term may be  I think whoever said that the   nine-box matrix in the Bluebook seems to combine those two concepts was right  In my view   our communication needs to disentangle them  One of the weaknesses in the earlier risk   assessment—it had several weaknesses that we discovered over time—was that too many things   were entangled into a relatively small number of words  So in terms of my preference as to the   October 28, 2003 92 of 126    structure, I’d like a structure that clearly breaks out our sense of the outlook as a factual   statement versus the value judgment relating to our goals     A second preference I have is to avoid language that is too precise in terms of specifying   a variety of goals or targets  We don’t have collectively a well-stated goal on unemployment, for   example  I’m not sure we all share the same point of view regarding potential  We don’t   necessarily have the same point of view about the desirable level of inflation  We all think it   should be low, obviously—probably in a range between 1 and 2 percent on certain measures—  but we don’t have a target that is well defined by the Committee  So I’d be quite cautious about   going too far down the path toward language that implies that we have specific targets or that   forces us to continue to answer questions about what exactly our goals are or what we deem   acceptable  I think we have to maintain some vagueness in that regard   The third rule I’d have in my preferences as to the structure is that it be stress-tested,   perhaps using some of the nine boxes in the matrix approach that Vincent suggested in his   memo  One of the problems with the earlier language was that, although we did attempt to   stress-test it, we didn’t foresee a period with a large output gap, inflation falling, and growth   rising dramatically above potential  So the tradeoffs that were built into the old balance of risks,   though they lasted for about three years, didn’t last into the most recent period  I won’t blame   the previous director of Monetary Affairs for this!  [Laughter]  It would inappropriate to do such   a thing  But let the record show that he’s nodding his head, supporting my comments in one way   or the other!  In any event, I do think that we need to take some more time and do some stress   testing     That said, for reasons the Chairman alluded to, I must say that I was drawn to Vincent’s   language in his memo of October 22 as an approach that perhaps could work  The last thing I’d   October 28, 2003 93 of 126    say about my preferences, having gone through this three-year period or so with the statement   structured the way it is now, is that if we do make another change, we need to recognize that it   probably won’t be the last change  So I think we really should be aiming at enough stress   testing—and maybe it’s implied in the stress testing—to allow us to stay with the new language   for longer than a three-year period  We may never succeed in doing that, but the goal of stress   testing is to think of as many potential permutations as possible  I thought Vincent’s nine boxes   did that to a large degree  So that’s my answer to the first question in terms of preferences  I   have these two or three preferences, recognizing as I said that we’re not in a horrifically bad   position, though obviously we do need to continue to move forward on communication issues    Thank you, Mr Chairman    May I ask President Poole a question?    I agree with you, but do you not foresee a period where the risks   could be unbalanced but not so unbalanced that the Committee felt it had to move immediately?    In such a situation the tilt is not a hint about policy, but a sense—and this is what I think we’ve   been doing for two years—that the risks are weighted in a certain direction though we’re not so   strong in our conviction that we feel we need to move policy     Right    I think that’s true    Right  "
7444,2003-12-09,"  I’ll move the minutes of October 28    My nomination for a new Vice Chairman of this Committee is   Timothy Geithner, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York    May I ask one?    We had a brief discussion yesterday at our Board meeting about the   equity risk premium  It seems to be relatively wide, even somewhat wider than historically   normal  It’s not on your charts, but you mentioned the equity markets  Do you have a point of   December 9, 2003 6 of 133    view about why it is that the equity risk premium seems relatively high now and how it might   evolve going forward based on your experience with the markets and from people you talk to in   New York?    Okay, thank you    I’ll move ratification    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A few months ago the nation embarked   on an important and interesting experiment in macroeconomics  Most of us had confidence that   the stimulative policies being put in place would have the desired effect, but the timing and the   magnitude of that effect were a bit uncertain  The question was how stimulative the set of fiscal   and monetary policy changes might actually be  The answer today, as many of you have already   said, is that the combination of historically low interest rates, the home refinancing boom, and   this summer’s tax cut does seem to have succeeded even better than earlier expected  The   incoming data since the last meeting clearly indicate that household consumption and residential   investment have remained robust  Importantly, I think the data indicate that the participation of   the business sector through business fixed investment is also starting to become firmer  In short,   as I think the consensus has emerged here, the turnaround seems relatively firmly entrenched    The Greenbook takes on board the strength of the incoming data by raising the forecast for the   December 9, 2003 75 of 133    next year, and I must say that I find the baseline forecast acceptable  While I suppose there is   still a slight possibility of growth stalling out, that prospect is certainly much less palpable than   just a few months ago and seems to recede with almost every data release   With the growth forecast seemingly reasonable, the major question appears to be the risks   around the baseline inflation outlook, given the already low level of inflation and the size of the   pool of underutilized resources  I must admit that I concede, as do others, that there are both   upside and downside risks around the baseline inflation outlook in the Greenbook  On the   upside, the risk is that the economy will heat up and interest rates will remain inappropriately   accommodative for a little too long, allowing inflation expectations to build as in one of the   alternative scenarios in the Greenbook  That scenario is not completely without validation;   inflation compensation has ticked up recently, though the reasons, as we discussed earlier, may   be subject to some questions  And labor compensation may well have to play catch-up if you   will, given the fact that wages have lagged the increases in productivity for several quarters now     On the downside, however, there is some risk that inflation might soften even further   from this point  While there is some validation for the upside risks, I would say that in fact the   downside scenario still carries slightly more weight  Now, we may have underestimated the   degree to which trend productivity has increased and overestimated the willingness of businesses   to hire new workers  But the ambiguity, shall we say, of the relative weakness of the most recent   employment report compared with both expectations and with earlier reports suggests that we   cannot discount this prospect completely  The steady erosion of unit labor costs, which President   Broaddus referred to earlier, and the rise in the markup over unit labor costs also gives some   further weight to concern about the downside risk  Moreover, recent research has shown that, as   inflation has been brought down over the past two decades, the sensitivity of prices to the level   December 9, 2003 76 of 133    of resource utilization has also fallen  Consequently, I think the faster structural productivity   growth scenario in the Greenbook deserves some attention from this Committee     All in all, recognizing that the inflation call is much more balanced now than it was even   a little while ago and that the risk of a pernicious downward spiral seems to have been removed   completely, I would still put admittedly marginally greater weight on the downside inflation risk    Given the low level of inflation, I hope that when we get to the policy discussion we can give   some due regard to the balance of risks in this key area   Finally, since a few have already raised the question of the last sentence of our statement,   I will say that my preference is to move away from it gradually  As I’ve tried to convey in a   couple of other meetings, I think perhaps the best way to do that at this stage is to make it much   more conditional and much more closely tied to economic reality as opposed to just to the   passage of time  I won’t go any further into that topic, but I thank you all for your attention    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a Committee of nineteen people,   and I think we’re in the area of a judgment call as much as anything else  If I were doing this   individually, I would have retained the summation sentence and not changed it very   dramatically, but I would have made the other changes you recommended  I don’t feel so   strongly about it, however, that I couldn’t support what you’ve proposed  So I am supportive of   your recommendation  And I don’t want to lose sight of the fact that your initial   recommendation is that we keep the funds rate at 1 percent, which I also support  3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start by saying that this is merely   a progress report from your working group on communications  How long we discuss this today   is up to the Committee  I have some comments that will take about five minutes or so, and we   can stop there  But there will be time for substantive comments later  The working group, as   you know, asked for contributions from members of the Committee on how to handle the balance   of risks statement or the risk assessment    Okay  My colleagues on the working group are Governor Gramlich,   Governor Kohn, Governor Bernanke, President Stern (who’s not here today), President Moskow,   and President Parry  Our group was asked to consider what Cathy Minehan has described as the   headache part of the statement, which is the risk assessment  We recognize that the original   language worked for two to three years but that circumstances have caused it to outrun its   usefulness  We received from various members of the Committee eight or nine different   recommendations  Some of the proposals focused narrowly on the risk-assessment paragraph   itself  Some were more broadly focused on the overall process in terms of how we put together   the statements and how that might interact with other possible changes to our communication   policy, such as an earlier release of the minutes   As you know from a memo that I sent you earlier, the members of the working group   think that the overall Committee will benefit most from our efforts if we remain focused   primarily on the risk-assessment paragraph  We may look at the slightly broader issue of how                                                   3 The materials used by Mr Ferguson are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)      December 9, 2003 103 of 133    the risk assessment would interact with the first substantive paragraph in the statement but not go   much beyond that into thinking about the minutes and when they are released, and so forth  We   believe that any decision on the minutes should be viewed as a separate issue and should be   debated by the Committee as a whole  We don’t necessarily, as a group of seven, add a   particular value to the process of helping to think through the issues involved in that     So in the context of focusing on the risk assessment, it turns out that the   recommendations that came in basically had three different approaches, or flavors if you will,   that differed in three basic respects  One difference involved the specificity with which the risk   assessment was given—in particular the question of whether it had some sense of a benchmark   associated with it  The second thing that seemed to divide the various options that were   presented was how they dealt with the discussion of levels and changes in output gaps or   inflation gaps  Some mixed them, and some tried to divide them very neatly  The third   difference was the specificity regarding the length of the time period  Some of the proposals   favored a fairly vague time frame, and some retained the language of “foreseeable future”  Other   approaches recommended to us supported specific time frame references measured in terms of   quarters, months, or even years  So we looked at those three elements and basically came up   with three archetypes, if you will, of how to put together these various components; and that’s   what we’re going to focus on for the remainder of the life of this working group     What you have before you after the first page, which gives an overview, shows three   types of proposals  I’m not going to ask you to comment on them or vote on them  I have   provided them just so you can see what they look like, recognizing that the Committee itself will   have plenty of time to work on the language     December 9, 2003 104 of 133    The first proposal—just in terms of the elements that I talked about but not looking at the   detail of the language—basically merges levels and changes  We had several suggestions that   fell into that category; they merged levels and changes and alluded to benchmarks  There were a   number of people who wanted to do that in the overall risk-assessment sentence  As you can see,   in referring to long-run goals of price stability or long-run goals of sustained economic growth,   the time horizon used in this approach is a very elastic notion of the foreseeable future  So this   proposal represents that cluster of approaches to deal with the risk assessment  Notice also that   this is only a risk-assessment paragraph, so that’s what we’re going to stress under this option   Proposal B is somewhat more explicit about levels but addresses them in the first   paragraph  This is an example with references to such things as inflation remaining well   contained or slack remaining considerable  So it includes a discussion of levels, but that’s   separate from the discussion of changes  This one puts our judgment regarding changes in the   second paragraph, reflecting a certain style that seemed to come through in several of the   recommendations we received  It alludes again to benchmarks in the overall risk assessment but   in a somewhat less structured or less quantifiable way, with terms such as “long-run sustainable   pace,” et cetera  But it uses a much more specific time frame—the next few quarters—than the   elastic concept of foreseeable future  So this proposal reflected another cluster of thoughts that   we received  Again, you can see that this one works primarily with the risk assessment but does   leave a clear expectation that the first paragraph would tend to have some language that deals   with levels  So that’s how we handled the levels versus changes dilemma     The third proposal is much more focused on the whole statement  It again is explicit   about levels, primarily in the first substantive paragraph, leaving the changes basically to the   second paragraph on the risk assessment  This one alludes to benchmarks in the first paragraph    December 9, 2003 105 of 133    It doesn’t talk about inflation necessarily being contained just in and of itself but puts that in a   broader context  This proposal moves us, frankly, very much in a direction that we’ve never   traveled  It is in some sense the most radical of the options we are considering because it does   talk about a forecast  It refers in the second paragraph to the Committee’s assessment of the   risks to the outlook in terms of its forecast of economic growth over the coming period  It is   explicit about the forecast period—the next two years in this case—and references some   potential developments that might change the forecast  Some of you really wanted to see us   move in this direction  This would be very new territory for the Committee   Importantly, if we go in the direction of proposal C, I think that really does imply a   broader set of changes in our Committee dynamics  I say that because to get us talking about   forecasts at every meeting will take more time and will be quite different from the risk-  assessment discussion  So if the Committee were to adopt this approach, we ought to recognize   the likely effect on the Committee dynamics—that it will require more time to look at the   statement and more time to think through what our outlook might be  This in some sense is a   logical progression from where we’ve been since the risk assessment was originally intended to   have a forward-looking tone  But this puts much more weight on the forward-looking aspect and   involves a forecast type of statement from the Committee  Going in this direction, I will repeat,   reflects the desire of enough Committee members that our working group thought it was at least   worth considering   Those are the broad types of statements we are looking at  I would discourage you from   getting terribly focused on any specific set of words but would ask that you really think about   whether or not the mixture that we’ve put together is one on which you might like as a basis for   our further discussions     December 9, 2003 106 of 133    The second point I’d like to make in my part of the time allotted to this issue today is that   we intend to stress-test these various options  A combination of Reserve Bank and Board staff   will look at the six scenarios we’ve identified, including some of the recent episodes that have   proven most challenging  Our goal here, as is always the case, is to try to see how these various   types of risk assessments stack up against whatever developments are likely to occur or whatever   curves we think the economy might throw us  Again, we’re not going to be any more prescient   than anybody else, but one hopes that with the six scenarios we’ll cover most of the things that   are likely to happen—or certainly all the scenarios that we think are most likely to be   problematic  So when we come back in January we’ll have the results of those stress tests, and   we’ll see which ones seem to work and which ones seem to fail in certain circumstances     Recognizing that we have had some phone calls and letters asking us to think about our   communication policy more broadly, the Board’s staff will prepare some memos dealing with   other suggestions such as expediting the release of the minutes  The staff also will look in   general at going even beyond the types of statements I’ve outlined today and enhancing the role   of forecasts, since some people have suggested that as an approach  Again, that is not something   on which the working group is going to give you a proposal or recommendation, but it will be   provided as input for the discussion we’re going to have in January     Finally, this material is going to be sent to everyone in advance of the two-day meeting in   January so we think there’ll be plenty of opportunity for level setting, if you will That will give   us the chance to talk about the risk assessment and the statement more broadly and even expand   the discussion to the questions of the interaction of the minutes and of forecasting becoming a   fairly normal part of the Committee dynamics   December 9, 2003 107 of 133    So that’s what we propose  As I said, at this stage the working group is not seeking   specific comments on the language—though obviously you can do that if you want—but rather   just an affirmation about the process I’ve outlined  We seek your views on whether the varieties   or flavors of the statement that I’ve shown would be sufficient, as we think they would be, to   give you the kind of thoughtful input that will allow us to have a focused and intelligent   conversation at the two-day meeting in January  That’s my six or seven minutes of time, and   now it’s up to you how much further we go today  Cathy Minehan    Okay  The Chairman wants to speak, and then I want to respond to   your comments  Also, I have a list of people from the last meeting who wanted to speak on this   issue but we ran out of time    No, you did not speak out of turn  I recognized you, so by definition   you didn’t speak out of turn!      Let me say a couple of things  One is that the Committee can   collectively decide that this is more trouble than it’s worth and that we are communicating more   than we need to communicate  We can conclude that none of these options feels right for a   variety of reasons  We can merely say that this is all very interesting but, having looked at the   stress test results and everything else, we as a Committee think that we no longer want to try to   provide anything in our public statement that is forward-looking  We may reach that conclusion   for process reasons or for substance reasons  We may decide that we like having meetings that   last only from 9 am to 1 pm  So nothing in this precludes, Mr Chairman, the Committee’s   ultimately deciding that this whole risk-assessment approach or forward-looking approach that   we’ve worked on is not worth a candle    We’re leaving it to the Committee to decide whether or not we   should have a risk-assessment or a forward-looking element in our statement  I don’t think we   felt that it was appropriate for our little subgroup to do anything more than to say that it is clearly   an option not to have that in the statement  We’re not taking that option away from you  We can   follow a process in which we first side with those—if it is the majority view—who want us to try   to work on this approach  We can certainly do that  But nothing in taking that step precludes the   Committee from ultimately deciding that it doesn’t want to go down this path  I do agree,   however, that some of these options would imply a meeting that starts earlier or goes later than is   currently the case, and I’m not sure that the Committee wants to do that    I have one thing to do here because I have some notes from the last meeting that four   members—Governor Bies, and Presidents Santomero, Hoenig, and McTeer—weren’t able to   speak on this topic because it was close to 200 pm and we had to adjourn  I don’t know if any   of you four wants to jump in at this stage, but I will call on you in that order  I also have   Governor Gramlich and President Parry as indicating today that they want to say something  But   as a matter of courtesy and organizational discipline, I think we owe to those who were   precluded from speaking last time an opportunity to comment today if they wish  Therefore,   Governor Bies, President Santomero, President Hoenig, and President McTeer, in that order, if   you want to say anything please do so     I have President Santomero next on my list    Tom Hoenig    Okay  I have Bob McTeer on my list from the last time, and then I   have Ned Gramlich, Bob Parry, and Bill Poole  I think we still have the same dilemma we had   last month of having to end our discussion by 200 pm    Ned Gramlich    Bob Parry    As I say, this is a judgment call, and obviously, we have nineteen   different judges  Bill, what’s your view?   Well, I guess I’m going to have the last words because we have only a   few minutes left  Here’s what I’ve noted  I heard a range of views about these three options, but   I don’t think I heard anyone say let’s not stress-test them  Some of you may ultimately say it’s   too complicated and let’s not go to a new type of statement, but I didn’t hear anyone say “please   stop the process now”  So I think we need to continue this process, perhaps broadening the   stress testing a little, to make sure we pick up a range of situations that we know have occurred   over the last five years  I’m not sure we have to do that for every meeting because one can recall   that there were a series of meetings when inflation looked as if it was picking up and a series of   meetings when it looked as though inflation was falling off  So as long as we cover that wide   range of circumstances, I think we can respond to the issues raised about stress testing   The second thing I heard clearly was that we have to keep on the table two options that   aren’t specifically set out in this material  One is simply to cut back on the press statement   altogether and minimize the forward-looking aspects of it  So we’ll include that clearly as an   option to be discussed, but there’s no stress testing to do on that—or no more that our little   working group can do with regard to that option     I’d say the same thing with respect to the focus on the minutes being released early   That’s clearly something that people want to talk about  We have to leave enough time in our   two-day meeting to cover that, though it’s slightly independent from this other aspect of our   communications policy  We already had planned to discuss expediting the minutes and, as I   said, I think that requires some input from Board staff on how they think the market may react,   and the pros and cons of taking that step, et cetera  Those two issues—what to do on the   statement and the minutes—do interact a little  As Michelle has warned us a few times, if we   appear to be stepping back from transparency in the statement but are giving something else in   December 9, 2003 117 of 133    its stead, that will make a difference in the public reaction  So those two decisions are   interrelated to a degree  While I in some sense share Bob McTeer’s frustration about the bias   statement—had we never voted on a tilt we’d never have to disclose it—our problem is that   we’ve voted on a tilt for many years  So eliminating that would lead to great market   consternation  So, of course, we can’t wind the tape back to whenever it was that the Committee   decided to first vote on the tilt     Those are the three things I hear  The fourth is that, as Ned Gramlich said, in some sense   the length of our meetings is a relevant factor in all of this  I don’t know what the right answer is   to that  But I would say that it’s certainly something we are going to have to consider  If Ned is   right, and I think to some degree he is—we’re setting interest rates at least for the world’s largest   and most complex economy if not for the world—the attempt of nineteen people to do that in   three hours may be more than we can manage  We may no longer be at a stage where we can do   that  We may decide that we’re no longer just setting rates but we’re talking about the economy   and setting up the implications for policy in the future  We’re setting rates, we’re trying to figure   out how best to explain it, and we’re looking forward  That’s a lot for nineteen people to do in   three hours      No, I’m suggesting that one of the things that may come out of the   January meeting is a general consensus that we need to start our meetings a little earlier  I don’t   know  I’m just saying that that’s part of the discussion we’re going to have to have  I’m not   putting that as an option to be traded off against some of these other things   December 9, 2003 118 of 133     Well, in fact it’s now 200 pm  [Laughter]  I was trying a filibuster   to that  No, I did say that those two issues are not interchangeable  We may decide that we want   a different length of meeting independent of what we decide about the statement  That is an   issue that has bubbled up and has to be decided  Now, our Chairman may not be in agreement    It’s up to you how to proceed  "
7469,2004-01-27,"  Thank you  The first order of business is to elect a Chairman and   Vice Chairman of the Committee to serve until our first meeting of 2005  The floor is open to   nominations for both of those positions  Maybe Governor Kohn would like to make a   nomination  [Laughter]    We can’t have a primary, though  Why don’t you put forth your   nominations so we can move on?    Any objections?  Any other nominations?  Hearing no objections and   no other nominations, by acclamation we have a newly elected Chairman and Vice Chairman to   serve for the year  Congratulations!    Democracy moves quickly    I move that we select the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to   execute transactions for the System Open Market Account     Thank you  I’ll be very brief  Vincent is going to do most of the   heavy lifting in terms of describing a number of different options and conclusions—both on   January 27-28, 2004 11 of 238    issues that the working group looked at and on a number of issues that I asked the staff to   address in the memos they prepared  In my introductory remarks I’d only point out that as we go   into this it would be nice,  of course, if we were to find a consensus  But frankly, if at the end of   our discussion today there is no obvious consensus, then by definition the Committee can decide   to come back and think about this topic further  Or as someone said to me before the meeting   started, the subject of communications is probably going to be on our agenda in some way,   formally or informally, for a long time to come  If we can resolve some of the issues today, that   would be great  But if we can’t, then we’ll move on  I will try to be sensitive to the fact that we   also want to move on to other elements of the agenda  So at some point I’m going to suggest a   go-around—I don’t know how long it’s going to take—but ask that we leave time for Dino’s   presentation on the Desk’s activity that goes with the discussion for tomorrow  Vincent, why   don’t you pick up from here with this document that was distributed?    Thank you, Vincent  We know it’s not the beginning of the end    Having done this a few times, I know that there will be deep emotion, short speeches, and long   speeches, which is all fine  That’s what democracy is all about  To help us try to figure out if   we have a consensus, though, Vincent has given us what he describes as a Chinese menu here  It   would be very helpful if in your comments you could at least touch on each one of these three   topics—as I’m sure most of you will—so we can keep a record as we’re going through this    With that plea, why don’t we open it up for discussion and see who wants to start  Chairman   Greenspan, do you wish to start this round?    Yes, so much for democracy!  Chairman Greenspan is recognized,   and then my list says there are others who wish to follow    It’s in there somewhere! [Laughter]    I think I would describe that, in terms of the options Vincent has laid   out, as gradual evolution    It gives us greater flexibility and involves using the Bluebook to   provide alternative wording for the statement     Since you have the floor, do you wish to go on to the other two topics   on the menu, earlier release of the minutes and the role of the projections?  Or would you like to   hear more discussion?    How they all work together    Okay  This being a committee, people will either accept or reject   that approach  I have President Hoenig next on my list    That’s the very last one on the list—to discontinue the assessment of   the risks  I’m not sure if you’re saying you want to go with that one or with something else    Okay  Do you want to stop there, or do you want to address the other   topics?    Okay, why don’t we keep going in this mode  We seem to have   fallen into focusing mainly on the risk assessment  President Santomero    I must say, Tony, as I listened to what you said, it struck me as not   very dissimilar from the gradual evolution approach because you want to talk about the future   You used some phrases that dealt with whether or not the outlook was problematic, which I think   January 27-28, 2004 23 of 238    is what was intended by the gradual evolution option  But I think I understand where you are    The next one on my list is President Stern    I have Governor Gramlich next    I have President Broaddus next    Governor Bernanke   January 27-28, 2004 27 of 238     Thank you very much  President Minehan    President Parry    President McTeer    We’ll come back to those issues and explore them  President Guynn   January 27-28, 2004 31 of 238     Okay  President Pianalto    Governor Bies      President Poole   January 27-28, 2004 35 of 238     Governor Kohn    President Moskow    Vice Chairman Geithner    I’m glad you asked because I was going to try to summarize the   discussion and be more explicit about where I think we are  I’ve listened and written down some   notes  Clearly a number of you—though not a majority—would like us to discontinue anything   that looks like a risk assessment  I’m interpreting that even more broadly, which is that this   group doesn’t want to give what might be perceived as hints about future policy  That said, as I   listened, most people seemed to evolve to the following view  Pre-set formulaic language at   some point will fall apart  The formulaic language we used previously lasted for a few years    January 27-28, 2004 40 of 238    This language may last, but it will never cover a very subtle and complex situation  However, I   sense that most people also agree with Governor Kohn, President Moskow, and a few others that   either for practical reasons or for theoretical reasons we do need to provide something that is a   bit forward-looking  In part that’s because it may help explain our policy and in part because it   may help us communicate to the markets—not in the sense of giving hints about policy but of   fostering an appropriate mindset in the markets with respect to the incoming data and what we   are worried about  That has been described as a balance of risks assessment, but it doesn’t have   to be     So what I think we’re agreeing to here is a commitment among ourselves, and frankly   with the market, that we will continue to provide some forward-looking language that may have   the flavor of indicating that the Committee tends to be more worried about X than about Y  And   how we say that has to be tailored a bit each time to the particular circumstances  If we are far   away from what the Committee generally thinks of as an acceptable level—it could be a growth   rate, but let’s say level—then presumably we’re concerned about that gap, whatever it is  On the   other hand, if we are close to whatever we view as the right level, then presumably we are   worried about the point at which things may change and veer away—and we would be likely to   move  So I think what we have agreed to here in this gradual evolution approach is that each   statement will have something that is forward-looking but it has to be tailored to the particular   circumstances that are prevailing at that point  The language may or may not include a   summation—what used to be the old balance of risks—indicating that we are more worried about   X than Y or that we are equally worried about both  There may be times when we clearly are   more worried about inflation going lower or rising higher than we’d like  But we don’t   January 27-28, 2004 41 of 238    necessarily have to commit to exactly when we are going to tie together our assessment of the   risks     The other thing that I detected was a strong sense that, because we’re giving the staff   greater room to maneuver in drafting the language—not reducing it to a formula or to choosing   from column A or B—it’s important for various alternatives to be shown in the Bluebook    We’re not talking about forty pages, but there should be explicit examples of how the forward-  looking part might emphasize one current or potential development more than another  I think   those are the things that we agreed to  Another point, which I believe Vincent mentioned, is that   being flexible by definition means that we also have the option not to include a forward-looking   element in the statement if we simply can’t come to a common point of view   I think what I   have outlined here reflects the general consensus, though there are some outlying points of view   for sure  I believe that’s what we’re agreeing to, and that strikes me as not a very bad outcome    That’s my own summation  Is that helpful?    Okay, that is the broad consensus  Let me say one other thing    Though the Chairman introduced the subject and got us somewhat focused on gradual evolution,   from some previous discussions I think that is also a reflection of the broad middle view among   the Committee members after having looked at the pros and cons of the formulaic language  I’m   not at all surprised that we came to the sense that we want to be forward-looking but not tie   ourselves to a formula     Now I’d like to introduce the second topic, which is the release of the minutes  What I   propose to do is to call on you in exactly the same order as before in lieu of asking people to   January 27-28, 2004 42 of 238    raise their hands again  This topic was covered in one of the memos that were distributed, and I   think that memo lays out very clearly the pros and cons  This strikes me as an area in which we   are once again balancing a lot of considerations  My view on this is that, if we decide to release   the minutes earlier, that is a decision we cannot adjust—unlike the risk-assessment issue that we   just discussed, where I believe we can choose to include a risk assessment or not  If we move up   the publication of the minutes, we are stuck with that decision—not just for this Committee but   for a very long time  Therefore, as the Chairman indicated in his opening remarks, on this one   we have to be very, very careful  If we were to decide to release the minutes early, in all honesty   I think it would be roundly applauded by many people—academics, perhaps other central banks,   and even the markets  I had a discussion on another issue with the board of directors of the Bond   Market Association, and a number of them independently came up to me afterwards and said,   “Release those minutes earlier”   Having said that, I have come to the conclusion that, on balance, doing so may not be   well regarded in the long run  The reason is that I firmly believe that there would be an obvious   interaction between that decision on the minutes and the discussion at our meetings  One of two   things would likely happen over time  One, the discussion itself would become less thorough   and rich  The members would express fewer opinions about what might happen should some   development emerge  I suspect the conditional statements we often make would not be   expressed so fully, and I think that would limit our ability to share our views and understand   each other  Or two, which is equally bad, the minutes would become a less accurate reflection of   the discussion that took place at the meeting  That is, we might have these forward-looking   conditional discussions, but they wouldn’t be captured in the minutes out of anxiety that the   markets would react negatively  Vincent’s chart points out that, in fact, our minutes have served   January 27-28, 2004 43 of 238    us quite well because they are very full and complete but they really haven’t moved the market,   with one noticeable exception  I’m afraid that if we accelerate their release so that they are   closer to real time we would find ourselves intervening with the market more often     That leads to my second concern, which is the announcement effect of the minutes  I   believe it is far better for this Committee to speak once contemporaneously with the decision and   then let the markets look at the incoming data and react as opposed to coming back two or three   weeks later with another round of Fed interaction with the market  I think that doing so, if   anything, will limit our ability to read the market fully  The reason I chose to speak first on this   topic is that I believe that it’s extremely important to think of this in a risk-assessment context    While many people would argue that the benefits outweigh the risks, I am firmly of the view that   that is not necessarily the case  So before we move headlong down this path, we need to think   about it very, very carefully  Having had my intervention first, let me go next to President   Hoenig    President Santomero    So you come out with trying the mechanics of this without going to   the last step of releasing the minutes?   Okay  President Santomero has laid a third alternative on the table    President Stern    Governor Gramlich    President Broaddus    Okay  Governor Bernanke    President Minehan    Oh no, you caught me!    Thank you, Cathy  I always make it a practice of calling for a coffee   break whenever anyone says something nice about me  This seems like a good time to have a   coffee break   SPEAKER(?)  Now I’ll know in the future!   [Coffee break]    President Parry    Thank you  President McTeer    President Guynn    President Pianalto    Thank you  Governor Bies    President Poole    Governor Kohn    Thank you  President Moskow    Vice Chairman Geithner    Governor Olson    Sure   January 27-28, 2004 62 of 238     Let me give Governor Olson a chance to speak, and then I’ll try   another summation—or the Chairman may want to speak, and then I’ll try another summation    Chairman Greenspan on the early release of the minutes    Thank you  Let me first disclose what I think the tally is  There are,   I believe—it’s hard to get all the nuances right—seven or maybe eight people whom I would   describe as not enthusiastic  The remainder apparently feel that they’ve weighed the pros and   cons and on balance are more comfortable going ahead with an earlier release of the minutes   The obvious middle ground is to undertake some form of testing as best we can, understanding   that what Tim Geithner said is true—the ultimate test will not occur until we actually release the   minutes  However, I suspect we all believe, since no other approach immediately comes to   mind, that we ought to try a bit of a dry run  That’s one thing to do   Another thing we can do, which I have done, though maybe a lot of you have not, is to   read some of the minutes from other central banks  We can ask the staff to circulate them, and   you’ll see that some look familiar in terms of being consistent with what we do  Some, such as   those from the Bank of Sweden, are very much in the mode that Tony Santomero suggested    One member said X, another member said Y, and when you’re through what you get is a one-  paragraph version of the transcript  So there’s a range in the way the minutes could be   formulated  I propose that we circulate some examples so people can see what minutes from   January 27-28, 2004 68 of 238    other central banks look like  I would propose also that the staff go back and develop a way to   work through Tony’s thought of having a bit of a dry run for long enough to test some of the   concerns we have raised  Doing a dry run for just one or two meetings this year may not prove   to be much of a test because the probability—though I can’t predict it fully—that we’re going to   be in a mode where we’re talking about contingencies and potential changes in interest rates   doesn’t seem so high  On the other hand, if we conduct dry runs for a year, I think we will get to   a position where we are at least having more serious discussions of changes     So I think we could conclude by saying that we should go forward with some sort of   concept of a dry run, with the staff trying to give us an idea of how the minutes would look and   how this process would work  We could proceed down that path, recognizing the concerns that   have been raised and the fact that, as Tim has picked up, this is a very close call  Even those   who are enthusiastic see some risks, and a number of other people clearly are not enthusiastic    Does that seem like a reasonable place to end this discussion, knowing that we’ll have to come   back to make a decision on how to do the dry run and then once the dry run is done we’ll look at   this again?  Cathy Minehan    I think the staff needs to help us figure out if there’s a way to look at   the content of the minutes at the time they are completed as well as the incoming data since the   meeting and judge what the market reaction might have been  We need to try to get an   approximation, though admittedly a very rough one, of how the markets might have reacted    Oh, we’ll learn that        Could I suggest in the interest of time, unless someone has a burning   issue here, that we move on to the third topic, which is the role of projections  That is also very   important to a number of people  Can we start our go-around on that?  Would you like to start,   Mr Chairman?    You always have the floor!  You can exercise that prerogative    President Hoenig      Okay  President Santomero    We’re theoretically on the role of the projections  You have the   floor    President Stern    Governor Gramlich    President Broaddus    Governor Bernanke    President Minehan    President Parry    President McTeer    The McTeer rule!   January 27-28, 2004 78 of 238     President Guynn      Your head is unbowed!  President Pianalto    Governor Bies    President Poole    Governor Kohn    President Moskow    Vice Chairman Geithner    Governor Olson    Let me give you my perspective on this issue  I am in the camp that   says we have a range of skills with respect to forecasting, but my observation over the years that   I’ve been here is that we are mainly consumers of a range of forecasts  We are looking at   forecasts to see whether we agree or disagree and to assess what the risks are, and so forth  I,   January 27-28, 2004 84 of 238    like the Chairman, have observed a number of meetings where the forecasts and the commentary   seemed not to be closely intertwined  Also, just to pick up on Mark Olson’s point about what we   know that others don’t know, I don’t think this Committee has ever forecast a recession  I can’t   quite imagine how it would work  If we’re going to be very transparent and forward-looking, in   the sense of what do we know that they don’t know, would we say that the FOMC’s central   tendency forecast was for a recession?  That never happens  It never would happen  We’re not   very good at foreseeing a recession, and if we did, we’d conduct policy to try to avoid it  If you   think about it, I suspect we’d always forecast something that looked pretty much like trend,   which I frankly think we do anyway  It would certainly undercut any sense of credibility around   these forecasts     On some of these smaller changes  the core PCE, sure; add six months, possibly; survey   for revisions, I’m not sure, partially because that gets to Michael Moskow’s point that doing that   starts to convey this sense of great real time validity about the Committee forecast  So I’m not   really sure where I stand on those     Let me now step out and try to summarize what I think I heard  There were no votes, as   far as I could tell, for substantially changing the way we think about or use the forecasts  There   was a range of views expressed on some of these small fixes—the core PCE, adding a few   months, et cetera—and some people did not address those issues at all  I would propose, since   we don’t have to decide any of this until July, that I or the staff send around to everyone a list of   two or three options for a simple yes or no vote  I’m not sure it requires a lot more discussion    We can then report back to you on how the vote came out on core PCE—do we add it, do we use   it as a substitute—adding six months or a year to the forecast horizon and revising our forecasts   closer to the time of the Chairman’s testimony  I think those were the three issues that came up    January 27-28, 2004 85 of 238    We’ll see if there’s an obvious yes or no, up or down, and then discuss all this when we get   closer to the next forecast round, but we have a couple of meetings before then  Governor   Gramlich    Yes, just in the report  There have been times when the Chairman   doesn’t refer to them    Well, that’s why we have it  That’s how we got into it   January 27-28, 2004 87 of 238    SPEAKER(?)  It’s a legal requirement    Let me close this because we want to get on to something else  It   strikes me that the sense of the group is retaining the status quo in terms of this last question    We have a long history of doing forecasts  I’m not sure that we’d be better served by not doing   January 27-28, 2004 88 of 238    them  There may be some room to do some tinkering on the edges, and the staff will do a survey   on the three or four or five ideas that have come up here  I think that’s it  I thank you all for a   productive discussion  I got through a number of semi-brilliant conclusions!  [Laughter]    No comment    I move approval of the domestic operations    This last exchange actually was my question  The assumption you   seem to have made is that in fact the relationship between house prices and rents will converge   back to the norm  We’ve talked about some of the risks  Are there other risks that it won’t   happen that way and that something else is going on—perhaps in the direction the Chairman   mentioned or in other directions?     I gather from what you’ve said that you have another real-factors   model, if you will, suggesting that house prices will go up more    Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  The incoming data, as almost   everyone has noted, appear to validate the confidence that emerged at the last meeting that a   January 27-28, 2004 157 of 238    sustainable expansion seems most likely to be under way  Almost all components of domestic   final demand seem to be on a relatively firm footing  Household consumption is clearly   benefiting from stimulative policies and the effects of rising stock market and housing wealth as   well as improved consumer confidence  Residential real estate investment also is on a solid   footing, with recent declines in mortgage rates most likely to support a strong housing market for   some time to come  Importantly, the expansion seems to have broadened out, as others have   indicated  In the business sector, incoming data on new orders and shipments, when combined   with survey and anecdotal data, do suggest that businesses are likely to increase their investment   in a widening range of capital goods as opposed to retrenching  Finally, the firming that is under   way domestically also appears to be occurring overseas    Of course, this good news must be tempered by a clear understanding that firms are not   yet creating jobs as quickly as we would like  However, even in the labor markets there are a   few positive signs  Aggregate hours rose in the fourth quarter as a whole, which I think was the   first quarterly increase since 2000  The unemployment rate has declined, and initial claims also   seem to be shifting downward  The other small fly in the ointment is that core prices seem to   have drifted somewhat lower during the intermeeting period, I believe in large part because of   strong productivity growth—a theme to which I will return shortly  Given my reading of these   incoming data, I think I can accept the contours of the baseline forecast in the Greenbook, which   for me implies the desirability of ongoing patience with the current stance of monetary policy    However, even against that benign outlook, there are a couple of risks that confront us,   and I must say that they are in some sense inconsistent  On one hand, I have some concerns that   the baseline Greenbook forecast has assumed a fairly large drop in the growth rate of structural   labor productivity for 2004 and 2005 from its estimated level in 2003  I fully agree that   January 27-28, 2004 158 of 238    productivity growth cannot pick up indefinitely  Trees don’t grow to the sky, as they say    However, if the rate of change in structural productivity were to come closer to maintaining its   2003 level instead of falling as in the baseline forecast, the outcome would be better captured by   one of the two faster productivity growth scenarios in the Greenbook  Both call for somewhat   lower inflation  I think that echoes the point that President Broaddus has already touched on and   that we in fact discussed earlier today in the question and answer session right after President   Minehan’s question  Now, it’s obviously very hard to know exactly what is going to happen to   productivity, as the answers that Dave Stockton gave indicate  But if one looks at the special   survey of Beige Book contacts that many have referred to, it’s quite clear that one of the major   factors behind the capital goods spending plans for this year is the desire to replace either IT or   other capital goods  Therefore, businesses will again have the possibility of capturing some   efficiency-enhancing improvements that come with the technological capabilities embedded in   some newer generations of equipment  If they do so, we may well find that productivity growth   is stronger than in the baseline forecast; and against the backdrop of inflation, which is already at   the low end of the range that I find acceptable, that clearly calls for some important discussion   about what our policy should be     On the other hand, I have another kind of concern, which has to do with the state of   financial markets  During the intermeeting period, we saw quite a run-up in the prices of   equities, as businesses proved that they indeed have a great deal of earning power if not much   pricing power  Nonetheless, during that same period, interest rates dropped quite significantly    Risk spreads have come down, which is a good thing as Governor Kohn suggested but also may   indicate an underappreciation of the risks that may be embedded  Frankly, to put it mildly, I   think that the dollar carry trade has become extremely well entrenched and that the markets are   January 27-28, 2004 159 of 238    looking to us perhaps more than they should be  One small piece of evidence in this regard is   that the flows of the funds and the behavior of multifamily investments strike me as being   somewhat out of touch with the fundamentals  This suggests to me that perhaps we are   anchoring the yield curve more than we’d like, and in my mind we need to try to do two things   simultaneously  One is to suggest that inflation risks, while they have receded from corrosive   disinflation or deflation, still tend to be tilted a bit to the downside  The other is to suggest that   markets should be looking at and calibrating more fully the incoming data and the underlying   risks to the economy  I’m afraid that at this stage, given the high productivity possibilities, the   fixed-income markets in particular are not in fact doing the appropriate job of pricing risks  We   need in some sense to remove the anchor that we have placed on those markets  With that, Mr   Chairman, I’ll stop and look forward to the second half of our discussion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support both elements of your   recommendation  As I said in my earlier remarks, I’m somewhat torn between two kinds of risk    But as I think about the outlook for this year, it seems to me that the economy could unfold very   much the way it did in ’95, ’96, and ’97  In that period we started to get a better sense of the   productivity story and its implication that real equilibrium interest rates should rise  I want to be   set up for that possibility  But I also want to be set up for the possibility that we won’t want to   do anything  Given the degree of uncertainty that I feel about the appropriate strategy for this   year and maybe next year, I think gradually starting to get to a position of greater flexibility is   without a doubt the right thing to do  Nevertheless, I would not in any sense want to suggest that   we’re eager to move  So, keeping the inflation balance a little to the downside and leaving the   rate unchanged while starting to remove the “considerable period” commitment by modifying the   language strikes me as the best way to give us the degree of flexibility we’ll need this year     January 27-28, 2004 182 of 238     Here is the issue that has come up  The press and people in the   market know that we had a Working Group on Communications and that we were going to   discuss communication issues today There was no secret as to what we would be talking about   at this meeting  The press I suspect will be interested in knowing what came out of the   discussion today  So Michelle would like us to consider what we want her to say about that  She   has some thoughts of what she might say  Do you have other copies of this note that you have   given me, Michelle?    Okay  Here are some thoughts about what Michelle might say  I   think we all want to provide a consistent message in our public comments  One question is   whether we are going to be making some changes  Michelle proposes to say that the Committee   considered a range of issues and has no new formulation to announce, which is the case, and that   we decided to adapt the statement gradually in response to changing economic circumstances  I   think that is a fair assessment    The second question is whether today’s discussion was related to the study of the   working group mentioned in the October minutes  In lieu of trying to tie this to anything, I think   it is best simply to say that we’ve been evaluating and will continue to evaluate communications   January 27-28, 2004 189 of 238    in response to changing circumstances but announce that the working group has disbanded  That   group doesn’t have more to do        Or has been shot?  [Laughter]  Okay, it has completed its work    Finally, the hardest question is the one about releasing the minutes earlier  I think the safest   thing is to say that we have made no decision on early release of the minutes because, in fact, we   haven’t yet made any decisions on that issue  Does anyone have any strong objection to that   approach to dealing with what I think is going to be a pretty frenzied interest in what happened?    Oh, it has?  I don’t recall that being in the press      Well, I think the answer is that we decided not to increase the   frequency or change the time when we release the forecasts  But I think we can say that our   policies will continue to evolve as we go forward with regard to exactly what we forecast  I   think that’s a fair statement of where we came out  Is anyone uncomfortable with that?    Well, I think just the opposite occurred    That strikes me as very much a question in intra-Committee   dynamics, not a question of external communication  I’m not sure about the degree to which the   markets are focused on what gets voted on and what doesn’t      And I thought the way we handled that was to say that it just   happened   January 27-28, 2004 191 of 238     Yes      I would hope that we can get this draft redone and circulated to   everybody relatively quickly    Well, I presume that decision, which was taken yesterday, is covered   by all the security and confidentiality rules that cover all these kinds of issues    So that’s the point in trying to be clear about what we are saying and   what we’re not saying    "
7498,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my intervention here, I’ll talk about   three things  first, what has happened during the intermeeting period and how I interpret it;   March 16, 2004 64 of 107    second, why it has happened or what the hypotheses are; and third, the implications in this room   for policy   First, as all of you know, what has happened is that the data have been distinctly mixed,   as I think David said, but somewhat on the downside or at least below expectations  Three or   four things have caught my attention  Obviously, the labor market numbers have been somewhat   weaker than we anticipated  Importantly, though, demand for new vehicles has been a little   sluggish  Dealer inventories seem to be rising a bit  I’m going to come back to talk about that a   touch  And housing activity, while still strong, is also somewhat below expectations    I think someone mentioned that there are those in the private sector who put together   something called a “surprise” index  They’ve observed that, during the second half of 2003, the   surprise index tended to be positive, which is to say that the data came in higher than   expectations  Since December of last year the data, generally speaking, have come in below   expectations  So I think there is some warning sign there that either expectations are far out of   the line or the economy, while still strong, is not quite as strong as people had thought  The staff   has taken this on board by marking down their forecast  The output gap is probably up, and the   employment gap is up  The main focus there, obviously, has been the question of job creation,   which has been quite sluggish   So why is it that, years after the formal end of the recession, we still seem to be dealing   with what appears to be yet another jobless recovery?  That leads me to topic 2, which is why it   has happened  There are a number of theories and hypotheses, and I’d like to go through them   quickly  One is that the rapid increase in benefit costs has discouraged businesses from bringing   on new workers  I tend not to put a lot of weight on that since I think, by and large, benefit costs   are relatively small compared with the overall costs of hiring workers  But there probably are   March 16, 2004 65 of 107    some industries where that factor is important  The other hypotheses that I’d like to spend a little   more time on have already come up, with one exception  One is that structural productivity   growth may be higher than we had thought before  I tend to put a little more weight on that   argument  Having looked at some other periods of increases in productivity growth, I think   we’re in the middle of one of the strongest of those periods compared with the others    Historically they have run up to twenty years or so, and this one started about nine years ago, so I   suspect there may be more to come here  One of the things we may be seeing with regard to the   story on structural productivity is that it’s a little stronger than we had originally thought  That   said, obviously it will have to come off a bit for cyclical reasons in order for job creation to pick   up  So I lay that out as one option Tony mentioned another option, which is a bit of a mismatch   in skills, and that again may lead to slower job creation     But the third possibility—one that hasn’t been talked about much—is this so-called   business gloom  I find that gloom frustratingly psychologically driven, but I think there’s an   analytical underpinning to it that we at least ought to take a moment to focus on  I have a   concern that one of the reasons businesses are somewhat gloomy is that they are aware that much   of the increased consumption they’ve seen has been driven by stimulus and that stimulus is   undoubtedly likely to wane during the course of the year  That is certainly the case for fiscal   stimulus, though it’s hard to say with respect to monetary policy at this stage  But since the   expectation is for no further decreases in interest rates, I think most people would say that the   stimulus from monetary policy also will start to wane a bit  In the context of that uncertainty, I   think businesses are concerned about how sustainable the growth in consumption is going to be    They have been holding down hiring and also labor income  No one has focused on it yet, but   while real labor income increased in the fourth quarter of last year by about 2 percent over the   March 16, 2004 66 of 107    previous period, that was the slowest quarterly rise in labor compensation last year  The rate of   increase has been slowing gradually during the course of 2003, and that, I think, is a bit of a   problem  I believe that has played into the relatively weaker, though still strong, demand for   consumer durables—both autos and housing—that I noted earlier  Auto inventories are starting   to build, and housing activity, while still strong, is slowing somewhat     Another point I’d make here is that the other factors that have been holding up   consumption, including equity wealth and home prices, may start to soften over the forecast   period  So while consumption for households is still on a relatively strong footing, I don’t see it   strengthening  I think there’s a risk that it may weaken a bit because I suspect that all of the   factors that have been supporting it are going to be weaker and not stronger going forward   That said, it’s clearly the case that businesses continue to fix their balance sheets  And   we’ve seen an increase in capital investment, which I think is part of the productivity story  So I   don’t expect things to fall apart completely from the business side  But I do believe there’s a bit   more downside risk than perhaps others in the room feel there is, at least as I interpreted the   comments I’ve heard  Don introduced the concept of announcing how we’re lining up  I guess   I’m lining up with the Kohn–Broaddus view that there’s perhaps a little downside risk   Now, let me go to the third topic—the implications of all this for policy  As I listened   today, I heard two or three different themes mentioned that I’d like to discuss  One is the issue   of inflation and pricing pressure  I heard a number of stories about bottlenecks, speed effects,   and so forth  It struck me that primarily what we’re hearing about are a few minor imbalances in   supply and demand in a small number of industries that may not have the ability to change their   output as quickly as others  But I’m not sure, in the context of a widening output gap, that those   problems are likely to feed into inflationary pressures that we really have to worry about  I’m   March 16, 2004 67 of 107    not denying that pricing pressures may be picking up in some areas or that there are important   markets where supply and demand imbalances may be leading to price increases  But I’m not   sure at this stage, in the context of a squishy—that’s a technical term I sometimes use—  [laughter] labor market, that we’re likely to see a big pickup in inflation   A second theme involves the question of whether or not we are at risk of overstaying our   welcome at these very low interest rate levels  Don obviously has done a superb job in going   through the technical elements of that, which I will not in any way attempt to mirror  I would   associate myself with those comments because Don, after all, is a great former member of the   staff and now a distinguished Governor  But having said that, I would point out something that   hasn’t come up yet—that, in the staff’s most recent assessment, the real equilibrium interest rate   has come down somewhat  So while rates are at historical lows, monetary policy may not be as   accommodative as we had thought  As I noted, some imbalances may be building up with   interest rates this low, so we shouldn’t be complacent about it  But we should recognize that   monetary policy may not be as accommodative as we thought   The third theme relates to communication  The point I’d make is that markets are   expecting very few changes  Given how fragile the markets are and given my view that perhaps   there’s more downside than upside risk, I would again caution that we be very careful about   making any significant changes in our statement  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  While I am sympathetic to the concerns   that others have expressed, my view is that we shouldn’t make any changes, and I’d keep this   slight shading in the balance of risks language as it is  I have that view for a couple of reasons   One is that the market seems to be expecting very little change and I see no reason to surprise the   market by doing something else at this stage  Last time we made what to everyone in this room   was a relatively small change—moving to the “patience” language—to give us some flexibility    The market reacted quite strongly  I’m not quite sure why we have to do anything like that this   time around  For reasons that you pointed out, Mr Chairman, we’re not exactly starting on a   new path just yet   Second, I would find it hard to explain, in the context of data that have been weaker than   expected, why the Committee would alter its view of the inflation picture in the opposite   direction  That seems inconsistent with some of the other language changes we want to make   Third, a point I made earlier, I think one’s assessment depends to some degree on one’s   view of where we’re starting in terms of the inflation dynamics  As I said, I’m sympathetic to   the concerns expressed about rising inflation; we’ve heard a lot of stories and anecdotes about   markets where prices seem to be picking up  But I’m not sure we need to start signaling a   greater worry about inflation at a point when our own forecast is for output growth to slow and   for the output gap to widen  Again, that seems internally inconsistent  Therefore, I would leave   the wording in the statement as it is, at least at this stage, and wait to see if the incoming data tell   us how the forecast might change  If we wait until May to make this language change, I don’t   March 16, 2004 83 of 107    believe people will think that we are behind the curve  So, for those three reasons, I would   support your recommendation    Thereby making the Chairman’s recommendation seem terribly   moderate!  [Laughter]  "
7522,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, as has already been talked   about, several pieces of incoming data put the question of rising inflationary pressure squarely on   the table before us at this meeting  We’ve heard anecdotal information from almost everyone who   has spoken  The March CPI number obviously has been on the table  Monday’s ISM prices-paid   index rose 2 points, to 88, which I think was the highest for that index since 1979  So there are a   number of pieces of information that give us reason to be actively discussing upward pressure on   inflation at this meeting   Against that backdrop, I think there clearly are two important questions  One relates to   where we are starting  Is the level of inflation that we’re starting with as low as we originally   thought?  The second is, What is the outlook for inflation?  The first question basically comes down   to whether we overestimated the falloff in inflation over the last several quarters  I think the staff   here and at the Atlanta Fed—and many others—would say that a number of transitory factors   affected the inflation picture in 2003 and led us to believe that underlying inflation was lower than it   actually was  That may well be true, but I think the basic contours of the picture really haven’t   changed dramatically  If one looks at the variety of measures of slack in the economy—at what   happened to unit labor costs, measured productivity, unemployment, labor market inflation, et   cetera—they all suggest that there was a significant amount of slack last year in the economy and   that underlying inflation did, in fact, come off some  That is, we didn’t get the picture totally   wrong, though we might have overestimated the degree of the falloff in inflation somewhat  That is   May 4, 2004 64 of 112       obviously comforting because it does mean that we are starting at a relatively low level of inflation    We are not close to reaching the kind of inflation that, under any reasonable view, would be   considered inconsistent with price stability   The second and more important question is whether the pickup in inflation that we’ve seen   recently, as we’ve heard in this room from anecdotal information and other sources, is such that it   would likely require a relatively rapid policy response starting in the very near future in order to   maintain a rate of inflation that’s consistent with price stability  Here I would come down, though   somewhat uneasily, to the general view that the Greenbook probably has it about right—that   inflation has clearly stabilized and may pick up somewhat but not to the point that we should fear   falling behind the curve   Let me first talk about the easy part of that assessment  I think the March surprise in the CPI   is likely to be adjusted somewhat in the forthcoming data  All of us are well aware that some of   what we saw in March reflected transitory effects on the upside, offsetting some relatively noisy   data in components such as apparel and lodging away from home  I’m not trying to underplay the   March surprise, but I think we should be cautious about putting too much weight on that since it   may be adjusted going forward  More fundamentally, though, the question is whether or not the   outlook for inflation has deteriorated so much that we need to signal a dramatic change in our   views  I would admit that that is a tough call  There are a number of different models of inflation,   but by and large I come down again being generally comfortable with the range of outlooks   described in the Greenbook   If one thinks about these various theories of inflation, one must say that some would perhaps   lead to some upside concern; the issue of the pass-through of commodity-price increases could   again surprise us on the upside  It is true that markets expect commodity prices to come off a bit, as   May 4, 2004 65 of 112       the Chairman and Karen were discussing earlier, but we have been surprised on that score  It is also   historically true that the commodity-price pass-through has not been an important part of inflation   dynamics  But again, one should be cautious   In my view, more worrisome than this issue about commodity prices—where by and large I   think the standard wisdom is likely to hold—is the question of inflation expectations and inflation   dynamics  Some of us are concerned that a consistent series of upside surprises on inflation might   start to become embedded in inflation behaviors and inflationary expectations That is something   certainly to be aware of  Ned talked about mistakes that this institution made in the ’60s and ’70s  I   think many of those mistakes can be traced back to some misunderstandings about the dynamics of   the economy but also to a willingness of the Committee at that point to buy into special stories to   explain almost every upside surprise  So we should be very careful not to quickly reject this whole   negative scenario with respect to inflation and the inflation dynamics that come from upside   surprises   While putting some weight on those things, my general view is that the greater probability is   that inflation will pick up only relatively slowly from this point  I would still say that I tend to focus   more on the more traditional views of what drives inflation  I think there continues to be a great   deal of evidence of some slack in the US economy, though it may be less than we thought it was at   the previous meeting or the previous several meetings  Labor markets clearly have not completely   recovered  It is true that we’ve had one good data report, but we have to be careful in interpreting   that; we’ve had a few head fakes in that regard in the past  I would say that the rate of hiring still is   showing only some early signs of picking up  The ECI seems relatively well contained, but we   probably want to exclude some one-time effects  Trend unit labor costs also, it seems to me, most   May 4, 2004 66 of 112       likely will be increasing at only a gradual rate  Finally, I would say that the structural productivity   story is still in place, while obviously the cyclical components of that will clearly wane a bit     So, at this stage I come down—admittedly somewhat uneasily—agreeing with the general   sense of the Greenbook that inflation is likely to pick up only gradually going forward  This   suggests to me that, when we get to the second round of our discussion today, there may be two or   three ideas that I would hope we could all agree on  One is a clear recognition that the risks   obviously have become balanced with respect to inflation and that we’d lose credibility if we   weren’t ready to say that  But I don’t think that they necessarily have moved to the upside  Second,   I think we should continue the process of clearing impediments to raising rates to more neutral   levels  We have moved from “considerable period” to “patience”  Like Governor Bernanke, I   endorse the proposed new language in the Bluebook, and I’d suggest that we continue to move on   that path  And third, I think it is very important that we signal as we move forward that a moderate   pace of moving rates back to neutral is most likely  By definition, we’re going to be driven by the   incoming data  But given the range of uncertainties we face now, I think it would be a mistake to   lock ourselves into any particular path of rates going forward, implicitly or explicitly Thank you,   Mr Chairman    But I had to say it nevertheless!  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support your recommendation  We   are obviously deep into the question of how we communicate with markets, and we have a general   view, I think, that this is not the time to actually move up the funds rate  So let me focus on the way   I think about our communications with markets  My sense of it is that we want to reinforce market   expectations if we believe they are about right and we want to change market expectations if we   think they’re wrong  And we use communications to do that     As I look at exhibit 4, it is hard for me to say at this stage that market expectations are   fundamentally wrong compared with the judgments I heard expressed in this room—namely, that   inflation is relatively low but it might be picking up, though we aren’t really sure and so we have to   give ourselves a little more time  I believe that this proposed language is helpful in saying to the   May 4, 2004 89 of 112       markets that we wouldn’t want to work hard to disabuse them of the expectations that have been   built in at this stage for a modest tightening probably starting sometime in August  That doesn’t   mean that that assessment can’t change  It may change as the data change, and we may move more   aggressively than we anticipate  I’m not sure  But I would definitely say that the word “measured”   will help us to avoid triggering any real snapback in expectations in the context of what I continue   to view as an economy that is still working hard to get rid of slack  So I’m very supportive of this   language   My second point relates to Tom’s question and others about what we can do here  As I read   this language—putting on my English major hat—it says basically “at this juncture”  So as of   today, contingent on the conditions that Ned pointed out—low inflation and slack in resource use—  our belief is that the pace at which we will remove policy accommodation is likely to be measured    I sense that to be an accurate reflection of where we are at this stage  If over time, based on a   number of data releases that come in, it turns out at some future juncture that this assessment is no   longer relevant, I don’t think our hands are tied  In my view we can move if we have to move in   June  I actually think the markets probably understand that—or at least that seems more likely than   not  So I think this language is—I know Ned used the word “brilliant,” but I thought we had moved   away recently from declaring our statements to be brilliant—certainly extremely good  [Laughter]    But supportive  "
7545,2004-06-29,"  I move approval    Thank you  I’d like to take us back to a point that Linda made in   passing because it’s one that worries me a bit  There is the sense not just that an adjustment   between the consumption of foreign-produced goods and the consumption of domestic goods is   involved but also that there would be a switch in the nature of goods, with a move toward fewer   investment goods and perhaps more final consumption goods  As you’ve looked at this—  particularly you, Karen—have you thought very much about what the implications would be for   the US economy before we get to the disorderly type of situation—in an even less benign case   than described in the list of implications in exhibit 4?  I suspect one of them would be less   investment and potentially slower productivity growth here over the long term  Linda, maybe   you could start by picking up on the points you were making just in passing to Governor   Gramlich about investment goods versus consumption goods  How might that adjustment play   into it, and more broadly, what are the implications of that?    But I think to some degree the conclusion from all of this, Karen—  your point that exhibit 5 suggests that it’s more the rest of the world’s problem than ours—is not   quite right  There’s obviously a reason for all of us to be worried about the outcome from even   an orderly adjustment  As you indicated, depending on the way the adjustment starts, we as a   society might be relatively unhappy with the outcome or relatively happy with the outcome  So   let’s be cautious about saying it’s no wonder that representatives from other countries ask us at   various meetings we attend what we’re going to about our external deficit  It’s something we   have to be asking ourselves as well   June 29-30, 2004 32 of 203           I have two types of questions  First, on the inflation topic we’ve been   talking about, I was struck that in chart 10 you are arguing that the inflation we’ve seen derives   from primarily two sources  One involves a gap-type analysis that you’re evaluating in terms of the   NAIRU, and the other involves elements of pass-through  You have not put forth any concept that   what we may be dealing with is basically some sort of fundamental speed effect, maybe indirectly   related to the NAIRU  Essentially a speed effect versus a potential growth rate concept hasn’t come   through in your analysis  And in some sense, a simpler view of inflation as purely a monetary   phenomenon also hasn’t come through  You have chosen the three sources of uncertainty shown in   the chart, I think, because they reflect recent history  But as you consider other ways of forecasting   and thinking about inflation, do these other theories or approaches to predicting inflation or   understanding inflation have any role in your models or in the way you think about inflation going   forward?    The other question I have deals with chart 3, on housing prices  My   question is about the footnote, which says that the rent–price ratio is adjusted for biases in the trends   of both rents and prices  Is that where you pick up demographics and lifecycle factors?  What are   these biases in the trends, and how does one think about changing demographics and the relative   attractiveness of owning a home versus renting?  Give me some sense of whether or not the shape of   the curve that you show here is likely to reverse, as you imply, or likely to stay relatively low    Thank you, Mr Chairman  During the intermeeting period I have been   struck mainly by the surprises that have come in  Unfortunately, this time around the surprises have   been somewhat contradictory  We have already had some discussion of what the downside   surprises have been, so let me try to be fairly brief  The first, obviously, was that first-quarter real   GDP growth was revised down about ½ percentage point  In addition, the new orders and   shipments data in May, while strong, were weaker than expected, and the staff has already indicated   how that affected their thinking  More recently, consumer spending, while also strong, was   noticeably weaker than expected  And finally, if one does a quick review of the Greenbooks over   this year, it is clear that, for almost every forecast round, the staff has been revising down its outlook   for both 2004 and 2005   So, why this litany of downside surprises for the real economy?  It is not because I doubt   that the economy is on a self-sustaining growth path  I do not  Other elements of the economy—in   June 29-30, 2004 131 of 203          particular, strong job growth and consumer confidence—seem poised to provide the underpinnings   for momentum in the economy  And perhaps this short list of downside surprises only reminds us   that economic growth does not follow a smooth monthly or quarterly pattern  However, I must   admit that this pattern of downside surprises leaves me with some concern that the path of the   economy may be shallower than originally thought and perhaps even somewhat below the growth   rate of potential  But, as I think Don and Ned both indicated, the fact that the unemployment rate,   the labor force participation rate, and the capacity utilization rate have all remained stubbornly low   or high—depending on how you think about it—suggests that, indeed, we are not closing the gap as   rapidly as some had feared  This recent softness and this shallower path out of 2004 and into 2005   are somewhat worrisome to me because they seem to be emerging just at a point when fiscal policy   is falling back from noticeably stimulative to slightly contractionary  So in short, at least in   comparison to the original Greenbook projection, I put much more weight on the downside   possibilities, and therefore I’m more comfortable with the new forecast the staff presented this   morning   Now obviously, on the other side of this surprise index, there have been surprises on the   upside with respect to inflation  I find these surprises not terribly troublesome in that I think we still   are most likely to end up being in what I would describe as the zone of price stability  But I must   admit that we’re probably at the upper end of that zone at this stage  What is probably more   troubling about these surprises on inflation is that they are relatively hard to explain  There are   some who argue that the real surprises on inflation were so low last year that we are now just   dealing with the natural catch-up  Many argue that the pass-through for oil, commodity prices, and   import prices in general is higher than historical norms, though we saw yesterday that some would   argue that we are simply returning to the norm  Finally, some would use the upside surprises in   June 29-30, 2004 132 of 203          inflation to argue that the most commonly held view of inflation dynamics—namely, that inflation   pressures remain subdued as long as resources are slack—is wrong  Others looking at the same set   of data would argue that we really don’t have a very good understanding of slack resources or how   large the slack is in the economy  In any event, while I think that inflation is not yet a pressing   danger, we clearly must consider for the first time in a long time an upside risk as well as a   downside risk around our core or baseline forecast  These surprises also remind us how   unfortunately little we know about inflation dynamics, as I think the staff indicated in their   presentation  The models that we have on price level changes I think have an r2 of somewhere   around 05 or 06, suggesting that humility in this regard, as with other things, is very important   So very briefly, recognizing the time, what are the implications of these surprises and   uncertainties for monetary policy?  As Ned has already indicated, we’re obviously about to embark   on a phase of tightening  That is an action I will fully support  Policy rates are clearly too low for   an economy that is growing as ours obviously is  And as the economy normalizes, the policy rate   should also normalize  However, given the uncertainties that I at least feel about the outlook for   both price stability and output stability, I would encourage us to follow a very pragmatic path  I   believe we should make as few changes as possible in the general message we have been sending,   while maintaining our credibility and our commitment to our mission  We should also continue to   hold open the option that we can adjust our plans as incoming data warrant on either side  Forty   years ago, Barry Goldwater made a comment that I’d like to use now  “Gradualism in the face of   uncertainty is no vice  Undue haste in defense of credibility is no virtue”  [Laughter]    Forty years ago, I was thirteen!  [Laughter]  "
7576,2004-08-10,"  So moved     So moved     I don’t want to prolong this discussion too much  The Chairman made   the point I wanted to make—that how the marginal cost of energy is determined has moved from a   secure low-risk environment to a very high-risk environment  One of the things I think we’re seeing   with the news regarding Yukos and other developments that are moving the market around is that   many people in the market—in a situation where I believe supply and demand are actually pretty   closely in balance now—are looking to Russia or Venezuela or other places as the marginal   producers and no longer to Saudi Arabia, for example  The latter always has a lower cost of   production but a higher risk profile  Is that a possible explanation?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the last meeting, I expressed some   concerns about the uncertain outlook, and unfortunately, most of the incoming data have verified   those concerns  At this meeting, I think President Moskow opened by asking the right two   questions  The first is, Are we witnessing an emergence of another period of subpar growth that is   likely to last for several quarters, or are we watching a soft patch that in all probability has come to   an end or will do so very soon?  While obviously the answer is not clear, for this purpose I am   willing to buy into the most recent staff forecast  However, I must admit that I put much greater   weight on the downside risks than on the upside risks  I do that even knowing that some recent   anecdotal data, some survey data, and even some high-frequency data suggest that perhaps things   are turning   August 10, 2004 56 of 103          So why do I put greater emphasis on the downside risks, even against the new downwardly   revised forecast?  There are three reasons  First, I find that for this entire year the trend in all of the   forecasts we look at—both those of the staff and those in the private sector—has been downward    Forecasters have been confronting a great deal of fog and uncertainty and almost every time have   been forced to revise down their forecasts  If one goes back to the January Greenbook, the most   negative scenario called for growth in the first half of 2004 of 46 percent, and it ended up being   almost a full percentage point below that, at around 38 percent  The staff was, I think, close to   correct at the beginning of the year on the employment call, projecting an unemployment rate of   57 percent at the end of the first half, which was not far off  And as we know, the inflation forecast   at that time called for a core PCE inflation rate of about 1 percent, but we’ve had a number of   upside surprises there  On balance, I’d say that this has been a very, very difficult economy to call,   and since even some of the more negative outcomes have turned out to have understated the   downside, I think we still need to put some weight on the downside risks   The second reason is that, in periods when we have a great deal of uncertainty and difficulty   in forecasting activity, it’s obviously instructive to look at business signals and at financial market   and credit conditions, which are all meant to be forward-looking  On balance, I think that   businesses, and consequently markets, are indicating at least some skepticism regarding the   consensus forecast of a pickup that may be emerging now or will emerge shortly   Looking backward, as we saw in the staff presentation here at the Board on Monday,   second-quarter earnings per share did continue to rise, which should be taken as good news—and it   was  However, the bad news is that momentum in earnings growth appears to be slowing  In the   second quarter, the difference in positive surprises and negative surprises was markedly smaller   than for earlier quarters  In addition, a number of high-profile firms provided a more cautious   August 10, 2004 57 of 103          outlook for further earnings growth than investors had been expecting  Taking all of this on board,   financial markets have become less positioned for—and I think show less foreshadowing of—  robust growth  Every major domestic stock market index has been down from year-end 2003 and   from the last FOMC meeting  The drops range from about 5¼ percent to 12½ percent   Financing conditions suggest some softness as well  As one example, real interest rates for   Moody’s A-rated corporate bonds have fallen, depending on how we adjust them, either to   296 percent if we use the Michigan five- to ten-year survey or to about 35 percent if we use the   Philadelphia Fed’s ten-year survey  In either case, those are numbers that we have not seen for   about a decade or so  This suggests to me that there is clearly slack demand for financing, as   companies’ investment needs have not kept pace with productivity-enhanced cash flow   It is true on the other side that C&I lending has moved up somewhat, but that seems to be   due as much to easier terms and conditions as it does to rising financing needs for accounts   receivable, inventories, and capital expenditures  Reflecting the weakness in consumer spending,   the growth of consumer credit also slowed noticeably in June, although I’ve received some   anecdotal evidence from major credit card issuers that suggests that at least revolving credit demand   may have increased at a more rapid pace in July  On balance, I see all of these financial market and   credit indicators, while they are not free from contradiction, as suggestive of some uncertainty that a   near-term rebound is in train and perhaps more consistent with a very extended soft patch—in fact,   a longer period of subpar growth   The final reason I have for siding more strongly with the downside scenarios is that I find   the conditions required for a return to more sustained near-term and longer-term growth not yet   convincingly in place  First, the forecasted turnaround in the near-term outlook is driven heavily by   the expectation that sales of automobiles will support higher production in that key industry, and I   August 10, 2004 58 of 103          noted with interest President Moskow’s commentary on the August motor vehicle numbers    However, President Moskow also pointed out that auto manufacturers have an inventory overhang,   and it is quite possible that incentive-induced sales may not achieve their goals   The staff also points to brisk IP outside motor vehicles to support the baseline forecast  But   I worry that, as has been the case for capacity utilization, much of that increase in IP will be in so-  called upstream industries that reflect a few special situations and not a broad-gauged pickup that is   consistent with a fully self-reinforcing positive dynamic in the economy  The inventory situation   and earnings guidance from major high-tech firms suggest that some caution is indeed in order for   industries other than automobiles   The longer-term outlook depends on an increase in the pace of consumer spending, which   may well be challenged by a number of factors  First, the energy prices that consumers face may   not decline, as assumed in the baseline  Second, we may see weaker wealth creation, as the rise   both in housing prices and in equity wealth slow  Third, and this has been addressed by others, we   may have a return to a more normal saving rate  And fourth, the effects of prior tax cuts are waning    The longer-term outlook for business investment must also be questioned, to a degree, by the lack of   a very strong response to date to the partial-expensing tax provisions, which are due to expire at   year-end  The ongoing increases in productivity gains and the state of the financing gap both   suggest that perhaps businesses are still finding opportunities to use more fully the current stock of   capital, without investing heavily in new capital  All these downside concerns are only intensified   by the interaction effects among rapidly rising energy prices, heightened geopolitical turmoil, and   cautious consumer and business behavior  We have seen often in the past that the macroeconomic   implications of that combination can be outside the smooth adjustment process that is built into the   models    August 10, 2004 59 of 103          I realize that I have spent most of my time discussing growth  Obviously, we have a dual   mandate in which keeping inflation low and stable is certainly the major component  The upside   risk to inflationary pressures that we feared earlier does seem to be abating  All scenarios in the   Greenbook recognize this and point to inflation that remains subdued; and at least in my reading,   market-based indicators of inflation and inflation expectations corroborate that expectation With   economic slack if anything slightly increased and with unit labor costs and productivity still   performing well, it seems to me that a significant upside outbreak of inflation from this level is   unlikely  Finally, we also recognize that the impact of oil prices has tended to be somewhat   asymmetric  So I think those prices are unlikely to be the major source of an inflationary impact as   opposed to an output impact     The implications of all this for policy it seems to me are pretty clear  If a so-called   measured move was proper at the last meeting, it is certainly proper at this meeting  As to future   meetings, I know only that markets expect us to pause at some point  It is far too early to assume   that outcome, but I think it is also far too early to reject the possibility of a pause going forward    Obviously, the data will help us to decide  Given the uncertainties that we confront, I hope that at   this time we do not limit, either implicitly or explicitly, our options    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation for this   meeting and with your defense of the statement as outlined in alternative B  I won’t go into all the   issues about energy prices, et cetera     To some extent I am both following Governor Kohn in sequence and agreeing in intellectual   approach here  I agree with you that the principle should be a desire to move toward neutral, but I   worry about setting up a hurdle that is uniformly higher now based on nothing in particular other   than the desire to move to neutral  I do think, as you said at one point, that each meeting should be   handled idiosyncratically  And to me that means that we really have to continue to be driven by the   data and forecasts  From my perspective, given the unusual nature of the slowdown—the range of   shocks that the economy has faced and may continue to face and the fact that the forces holding   back consistent above-potential growth that will close the output gap are all rather mysterious to   us—I’d be a little cautious about a willy-nilly declaration that the hurdle rate for a pause in   August 10, 2004 84 of 103          removing policy accommodation has become much higher  And as I noted in my earlier statements,   whether or not we pause at some point has to depend very much on the data; but I think the market   also has given us some signals that a pause would not be completely unexpected, so we shouldn’t   worry too much   Finally, without piling it on, I don’t think it’s appropriate for us at this meeting just to decide   that part of our dual mandate is unimportant  I’m not sure we have the right or the authority to do   that, and I’m not sure that—    No, I’m not suggesting that we are  I’m saying that a few members   have suggested that perhaps we are  But I know you would not tolerate that!  [Laughter]  I am   doing what a Board member should do, which is supporting the Chairman in reinforcing the law    People have laughed about it, but to me it’s pretty clear that we have to be relatively symmetric in   our concern about both sides of the mandate  Thank you  "
7601,2004-09-21,"  I’ll pass  Governor Bies just said what I wanted to say    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have indicated, the US   economy appears to be poised to pick up gradually from the soft patch that afflicted it over the   late spring and early summer but, as others have also said, perhaps more gradually than we had   thought at the last meeting or earlier this year  In response to that reality, the Greenbook has   undergone another makeover, with the new forecast pointing to a more subdued growth outlook   while still featuring stable inflation  The staff has extended the forecast period, and we now see   that the output gap does not close until late 2006  I have no strong objections to this new   forecast, and unlike the last two meetings when I was very anxious about the downside risk to   the baseline, the risks around this baseline seem to me somewhat more balanced, although the   range of uncertainty is still quite large   I might give a litany of the risks or list why I buy into the forecast, but I’d like to move   on to the question that Janet and others raised  Why, with all the stimulus in the pipeline, is the   economy facing a prospect of very low inflation and a resource utilization gap that closes only at   the end of 2006, when the so-called recession was extremely mild and so many years behind us?    I, of course, don’t have the answer to that question, but I’m going to offer a few hypotheses   One I’d like to reject is the oil price spike  I think Governor Bernanke and others have it   right that that seems to have been part of the negative supply shock in the early part of the year    But with oil prices waning, I think that seems unlikely to be the real source of the problem that   the economy is facing   Let me mention two or three more likely options  One is that the bursting of the asset   bubble and the series of shocks that have hit the United States since early 2001 may have been   more problematic than we originally thought  And here I disagree a little with the tone that Ned   took  As we’ve learned from the Japanese experience, it can take many years to counteract the   September 21, 2004 71 of 100          fallout from the bursting of an asset bubble  And it may be, even with the better policy mix   we’ve had here than in Japan, that it still could take longer than anyone originally expected to   deal fully with the fallout of both the bursting high-tech bubble and the series of subsequent   shocks, all of which I think have been fairly significant  We’ve seen this reflected in the   phenomenon that’s being called “business caution”  I, maybe more than others, think that   there’s something to this  As I’ve read the views of Reserve Bank directors that you have   communicated in your letters relating to their discount rate decisions, a number of boards of   directors have at least some members—in several Banks, many members—who buy into the   view that there’s a sense of caution among businesses  If one looks at various surveys such as   the NFIB survey and the survey from Duke University of 200 CFOs, they all talk about a malaise   story  The survey of CFOs indicates that they expect growth to be only 28 percent over the next   four quarters, noticeably lower than even our staff forecast  I think this business malaise issue is   very important to watch and, as firms go into their capital planning cycle, I believe we’ll get   some more information on it  But I do not think it’s something we can reject quickly   A second factor affecting our economy is what has been described as “global   imbalances”  But the imbalances are not between this country and the rest of the world  I think   the imbalances are within the other economies, and Ned picked up on some of this  First, we’ve   seen that the financial indicators in almost all of the major industrial economies have been   marked down or have shown some expectation of slower growth going forward, just as ours has    Market participants in Japan, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia—in the   industrial economies around the world—have been marking down their forecasts of economic   growth  The second point to make about the rest of the world is that domestic demand has been   incredibly weak in almost all of those economies  I think Ned covered this quite well, and I   September 21, 2004 72 of 100          won’t take the time to repeat all of it except to note something that no one else has observed—  namely, as was pointed out very clearly in the Greenbook Part 2, domestic demand in the euro   area was growing only 06 percent  Net exports there accounted for almost all of the growth    And obviously we’ve seen a marking down of growth expectations in Japan, which again has   been driven primarily by net exports  So we really are the only engine of economic growth in   the world  And we are in this interesting dichotomy with China and the rest of the world, which   may in fact play into some of the issues that Karen was talking about earlier   The third possible explanation is that investment in new capital goods, such as high-tech   goods, may be less urgent than we had thought  This could be for two actually quite different   reasons  One is that there may be a deeper pool of productive capital than we had envisioned   and one that is also longer lived than we had originally thought  The combination of both more-  productive and longer-lived capital would support highly productive and profitable businesses,   which we have seen, but would also reflect an environment in which demand for new investment   is not so great  One important finding in this regard is from some work that two staff members,   Rochelle Antoniewicz and Erik Johnson, did at my request  I asked them to divide up the entire   Compustat data base into six or seven non-overlapping industry groups and to examine the   financing gap in each  They found that the gap in each industry group except oil and gas has   declined over the 2000-04 period  The overall drop in the financing gap in this analysis was   $291 billion, which is really quite a big swing across the industrial sectors they looked at  So it   may well be that businesses view their existing capital goods as fully adequate to deal with the   outlook that they see    The other aspect of this possible explanation is that the slow growth in capital   expenditures may indicate that the new high-tech investments now coming on board are not   September 21, 2004 73 of 100          nearly as attractive as the prior generation of such equipment  One piece of evidence that   supports this theory is that both our staff and the BLS have estimated that the deflators for   various classes of high-tech equipment, such as desktops, servers, and laptops, have all fallen   relatively little since 2001  For example, our staff estimates that the deflator for desktops has   shown only a 10 to 20 percent decline year over year from 2002 to 2003  That seems like a   fairly large decline in the deflator, but in fact if one goes back to 2000 and 2001, that number   was 50 percent  All of this suggests that there may not be, as I’ve said many times, a “killer ap”   out there  In more technical terms, there’s not a technological advancement that might catalyze   new investments  So we may be confronting a phase where some of the positive supply shock   that we experienced before has worn off and businesses see that and aren’t so eager to invest    That may explain why one of the areas of weakness that we are dealing with is equipment   software    So those are two or three different hypotheses  But whatever the explanation that   ultimately proves true—and it may not be any of those—I think the macroeconomic result is the   same  In a textbook sense, the IS curve seems to have shifted down toward the origin, which   gives both a lower effective equilibrium real interest rate and lower income  Overall, we seem to   be confronting a new, less attractive set of interactions or dynamics that include growth in final   demand but relatively slow growth compared with potential, low investment in both high-tech   equipment and perhaps inventory, and some slowing of growth in the demand for labor and in   hours worked  While all of this is still positive, it’s slower—more punkish if you will   How should we handle this range of outcomes?  I think here the Greenbook and the new   interest rate assumptions the staff has made may give us the appropriate hint  I’ll just pick up on   the same words others have used by saying that I’m “quite comfortable” with moving rates up   September 21, 2004 74 of 100          25 basis points at this meeting  But going forward I think we should be more “pragmatic”—if I   can use a word that’s not so attractive in this community—or more “flexible,” to pick up on   Don’s word  We have to let the data and changed outlook lead us going forward That may   imply a pause at some point in the not-too-distant future, or it may imply a pickup in the pace of   our policy moves at some time in the foreseeable future  It also may imply some change in   language—not at this time, but at some point in the not-too-distant future  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I support your recommendation  I would note that if we get to the   end of this year and feel we have to take a pause then, we actually may want some of that   refinancing if that’s going to help consumers  So let’s not be afraid of getting all the help we can   get to keep the economy growing as long as inflation is under control  "
7626,2004-11-10,"  I’ll move that nomination  2  While the upside risk from dollar depreciation is clear, the possibility of a more persistent   pool of underutilized resources creates a more complex set of risks, and that’s what these charts that   are being handed out now address  Even considering the October employment surprise, the   changes in payroll employment have been remarkably subdued during the course of this turnaround    This observation led me to ask Andy Figura and Bill Wascher to prepare an analysis to explore   labor market developments—I don’t know if it explains them—in the recession and postrecession   period  In particular, I was interested in the question of whether this labor market performance is   more easily explained by increased productivity or a shortfall of demand  The first step of the   analysis I called for was to identify the industries that have had unusually poor labor market   performance since the 2001 business-cycle peak, measuring both absolute net industry employment   changes and net industry employment changes relative to changes for a period of comparable length   preceding the business-cycle peak     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m having some materials handed out   here; and while that’s happening, let me say that I am in broad agreement with the baseline forecast   in the Greenbook  I find it a reasonable basis for making policy judgments at this meeting and   going forward  Having said that, however, I think the risks and uncertainties around the forecast are   quite large, and I find them very difficult to reconcile  High on the list of upside risks is one that   Dave Stockton has already highlighted in his presentation, which is that the dollar may continue to   depreciate at a pace faster than in the baseline  Since Dave spent some time in his presentation   discussing that, I won’t pursue it in my prepared remarks   Four industries at the two-digit NAIC level ranked as noticeable underperformers in both   absolute and relative terms, and these are highlighted in table 1  They were durable manufacturing,   information, transportation and warehousing, and professional and technical services  Now, it is   2The materials used by Mr Ferguson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   November 10, 2004 68 of 107    well understood that one of the unusual features of the recent downturn is the sizable and persistent   increase in the share of layoffs that have been permanent  Job destruction increased during the   recession and then fell back, while job creation fell during the recession and has remained low  The   four underperforming industries that I just highlighted more than accounted for the overall increase   in the average pace of job destruction between 1998 and 2000 and in the years 2001 and 2002,   whereas job creation was more equally spread across industries  Tables 4A and 4B highlight the   relative rankings of various industries with regard to job creation and job destruction  The most   interesting question is the following  Is the slow net job creation, particularly in these four   underperforming industries, due to demand shocks, which would be a negative?  Or is it due to   supply shocks, which would be a more positive development in these industries?  If you turn now to   the next page, chart 5 clearly indicates that there’s a strong positive correlation between changes in   value-added share and changes in employment share  The actual correlation coefficient is 077, and   it is significant at a 5 percent level  The four underperforming industries—and here we have   divided them up into the three-digit level, and they are designated by the “Rs” on your chart—all   tend to be clustered in the lower, left-hand quadrant  That indicates that these industries   experienced losses in both employment and output shares     On the other hand, if you turn to the next chart, labeled chart 4, you’ll see that there is not a   strong relationship between the change in employment share and the change in productivity growth   There’s a mild, very small negative relationship; it’s significant only at the 10 percent level  And   importantly, the underperforming industries are not strongly clustered  There are a few outliers,   which are mostly high-tech service industries  I must admit, though, that this analysis is somewhat   incomplete since we have productivity data only through 2002    So, based on this analysis of these four underperforming industries, what do I conclude?    First, obviously, the weak labor market performance in this turnaround is more than explained by   November 10, 2004 69 of 107    just a handful of industries  Second, I tended to conclude that the slow growth of employment in   these industries is due mainly to a negative demand shock—and not a positive supply shock—at the   industry level  Negative demand shocks at the level of the industry identified, combined with the   slow pace of overall job creation, have led to a large pool of underutilized resources  So far, so   good  But then the question is, What is the implication for policy?  Here, unfortunately, things get a   lot more confusing   Some analysts would interpret this configuration of relative demand shocks as being   equivalent to an aggregate negative supply shock—a change in the optimal allocation of labor   resources across industries  Unfortunately, this type of aggregate negative supply shock can be   problematic and ambiguous for the outlook for inflation and for monetary policy  On the one hand,   it is possible that the process of reallocating labor resources is particularly sticky and reflects   structural changes, which could confront us with some upside risk  To put it another way, it’s   possible that the short-term NAIRU could be somewhat higher than the long-term NAIRU and,   therefore, we could be confronting some upside risk of inflation  On the other side, it could well be   that we have a very large pool of underutilized resources that will decrease only very slowly, and   that phenomenon is perhaps undermeasured by the unemployment rate  This is a point that I think   Governor Bernanke has made a few times  And that would cause us to face the possibility of   continued downside pressure on inflation as household incomes do not keep up   Now, it’s a little hard at this stage to know which of these risks will prevail  But I would   say, if one looks at the relatively benign performance of unit labor costs and at other signals from   the labor markets more generally, that it seems as though we aren’t really confronting the upside   risks  I think we’re more likely confronting the downside risks  In either case, it seems to me that   as we go forward, labor market indicators broadly defined—not just the unemployment rate but also   job creation, unit labor costs, and other measures of both resource utilization and cost pressures—  November 10, 2004 70 of 107    are likely to be a reasonable sign of economic health and also an important indication of emerging   risks  Therefore, I will continue to repeat the usual statement that Ned Gramlich referred to, which   is that I think our policy approach should be heavily influenced by incoming data, with a particular   eye on the broad range of labor market developments   Having said all that, I would also note that, like a few others in the room, I recognize that as   we go forward we are going to be confronted with the need to take a pause  I agree with Ned to   some degree in that the question of pausing also gives me some pause  But I’m also certain that as   we get new data—and if we’re careful about what we say—the markets will soon come to   recognize that their expectations and ours may not be fully aligned  How this will get resolved,   obviously I cannot foresee But I am really quite comfortable with the relatively modest upward   trend in the federal funds rate that is built into both the markets and the Greenbook forecast  Thank   you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendations on both   the 25 basis point move today and also language that doesn’t hint very much one way or the other   about future policy  There are a couple of other things I’d like to add, though  One is that I don’t   want to forget what exhibit 2 in Vincent’s presentation showed or what President Yellen talked   about, which is that, if we move to 2 percent today, we are well up into the range of estimated   equilibrium real rates historically  So while, yes, the rate is low, let’s not get ourselves too wrapped   up in the thought that we are outside an acceptable range  We may be in the low part of it, but we   seem to be in the range   Second, obviously having thought about this issue of a slowdown in productivity and in   high-tech investments—I’ve talked about it here and publicly—I’d make a couple of other points    One is that what we do with respect to the possibility of a slowing of productivity growth depends   very much on how quickly the market picks it up and it is reflected in asset prices and other things    If, in fact, the market doesn’t pick this up and if asset prices continue to rise inappropriately, we   have to do something to slow aggregate demand down to the new expectation of slower increases in   aggregate supply  On the other hand, if the markets pick it up relatively quickly, asset prices won’t   move up as quickly, aggregate demand won’t be out of line, and we still may be in a mode where   we want to raise rates for a variety of reasons, but we may not feel as pressed because of the   productivity uncertainty you talked about  So I think in both cases we need to recognize the   probable direction, but I at least am still very much open minded, as I think President Poole   suggested we should be, about the pace at which we’re going to move in this direction  In essence,   I don’t think that the market necessarily has it wrong, nor do I think that the Greenbook has it   wrong either  So I am very much of a pragmatic view about what our policy stance next year might   be  "
7651,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data have provided sufficient   reason for the staff to raise the baseline forecast  Real consumer spending, excluding motor   vehicles, has increased at a solid pace of late, and yesterday’s retail sales report reinforces the notion   that households are still ready to propel the economy forward  On the investment side, housing   sales and starts have also remained at elevated levels, and orders and shipments of nondefense   capital goods have been trending upward  Internationally, the dollar has fallen, and once we get   past the usual J-curve effects, that should give some impetus to the export sector  And oil prices   have moderated, reducing a potential drag on future growth  Inflation expectations, as measured by   the TIPS market for the five-to-ten-year range, are well contained  Frankly, if that were the entire   story, one could indeed settle in for a long winter’s nap     Unfortunately, in many ways that is not the entire story  While the data have been, on   balance, better than many had expected at our last meeting, there are some signs that we should not   discount all the risks  For much of this fall, I have been particularly worried about both the pace of   December 14, 2004 48 of 118           technological change and the actual amount of slack in the labor market, with the related   implications for productivity growth and inflationary pressures  As Dave indicated in his opening   remarks, the staff has captured this range of concerns in a scenario entitled “greater cost pass-  through with lower structural productivity”  Giving some credibility to the scenario, I note, as Dave   did, that the staff has marked down the forecast for growth in real high-tech investment to only   about its 1980-96 average  This downshift in the forecast is reinforced by the current orders survey   indicating that two major manufacturers of productivity-enhancing equipment characterized recent   increases in orders as falling well below expectations  At 30 percent, the percentage of NFIB   survey respondents planning to make capital expenditures is near the low end of its ten-year range    I’ve also heard from a private-sector contact of my own of a sudden weakness in demand for   cutting-edge automated machine tools  This contact has an 80 percent market share for a key   component that is used in nearly all automated machine tools, and he has experienced an   unprecedented 30 percent cancellation for deliveries of that critical part in Q1 of next year and is   expecting softness through almost all of 2005  Finally, I believe that the slowing in Japan and   emerging Asia, as I think Karen suggested, is indicative of the slowdown in the productivity-  improving high-tech sector    Just as we may be experiencing a slowing in capital deepening, unit labor costs in the   nonfarm business sector experienced a pickup in the most recent four-quarter period, after having   put in several successive four-quarter declines  Additionally, the data show quarter-over-quarter   increases in unit labor costs of 19 percent in Q2 of this year and 22 percent in Q3, both at an   annual rate   Market signals, as well, may be consistent with some worry about both a pickup in inflation   and a moderation in productivity growth  Two developments may be noteworthy in this regard    December 14, 2004 49 of 118           First, for reasons that we do not fully understand, while longer-term inflation expectations are well   contained, inflation compensation over the next five years has moved up noticeably since its low   point in 2003  Some of that is an unwinding of the disinflation concerns of 2003  However, the   level of inflation compensation for the next five years, at 26 percent, has already equaled or slightly   exceeded its levels of 2000 and 1999, when we were concerned about inflation risks  Given the   limited role of foreign buying in the TIPS market compared with the nominal market, the five-year   TIPS is probably a relatively pure measure of domestic expectations for inflation compensation    The other interesting phenomenon for the markets is the flattening of the yield curve  While the   level of rates is also generally lower than in the period between 1995 and 2000, as Dino indicated in   the opening remarks, the two- to ten-year nominal spread has fallen from around 250 basis points to   around 120 basis points now, which is the lowest level in three years  The more steeply sloping   earlier curve indicated bad times leading to good times  The flattening of the slope recently might   indicate okay times leading to okay times, which is basically a continuation of growth at or around   trend  But the fact that the level of the rates is lower, as I think Don was implying, might indicate   that the expected trend growth in the economy is also lower   Now, I put all this together to conclude that the baseline forecast is a reasonable basis for   policymaking today  Incoming data and the changed forecast, as well as market expectations, all   seem to suggest that we should continue to move policy from its current accommodative stance at   the previously announced measured pace  In addition, conditions are not so dramatically different   from the last meeting that they warrant a major change in our statement  Janet Yellen, in her   remarks, gave a very reasonable explanation of why it is that productivity growth might, in fact,   increase, with a particular focus on multifactor productivity and some risk to inflation on the   downside  However, based on my read, I also still put some weight on the slowdown in capital   December 14, 2004 50 of 118           investment and capital deepening, which suggests that we should be vigilant to the risk of slower   productivity growth, higher unit labor costs, and a higher pass-through  The data and the market   both seem to support that prudence  Recognizing the uncertainty around this general topic but also   the importance that growth or a slowing of growth in productivity might play, I’m sure we will   return to this discussion again in 2005  Thank you    I’ll simplify things again and just support your recommendation    I’ll speak first, partially because I’ve spent five years working with   Vincent on getting us to this happy place, and I don’t share his sighing about it  I think expediting   the release of the minutes is a useful step for the Committee to take  My views on this, I must   admit, have changed  The last time we discussed this, I was opposed to early release  This time—  though I agree with Bill that it is a very close call—I have moved slightly to the point that I think it   is, on balance, a good thing to do   The benefits are ones that I think Don has pointed out  The minutes will be more   contemporaneous in time with the relevant meeting  They are a more subtle, nuanced, varied   representation of what transpired at the meeting than we can possibly provide in a one-page   statement  They also have the benefit of giving us a touchstone on which to review other   commentary; they may actually in some sense drown out some commentary and highlight others  I   agree there will be costs  I’ve worried a great deal—and I continue to worry—about the high   attention that is likely to be paid to these minutes, particularly since I think of them primarily as a   reflection of historical relevance not necessarily a predictor of the future  But they do talk about   December 14, 2004 80 of 118           what has happened  I also worry about a point that Bill made very clearly, which is the risk that   these minutes, since they will be an “event” where the Committee is involved in the markets   between meetings, would drown out other news when in fact—in terms of future policy   deliberations—that news might be more important than anything that was in the minutes  There are   some costs that I think we can manage without much difficulty  For example, on the question of   whether or not the minutes gradually will become smooth and polished and not be an accurate   reflection of what transpired at the meeting, I think we and the staff can manage that     So given the close call, why did I move from thinking this wasn’t a good idea to thinking it   is, on balance, a reasonable idea?  The answer ultimately is just the reality of life  We already are in   the markets between meetings  Currently we have to be in the markets between meetings with an   old set of minutes as opposed to a more relevant set of minutes  Unfortunately, in spite of our   efforts to educate the markets that this document is historical and does not relate to what has   happened in the past six, seven, or eight weeks, they still react—perhaps more than they should,   though sometimes appropriately—to the information that’s in the minutes  And they get it wrong, I   think, about as often as they get it right    So recognizing that we are in a position—contrary perhaps to the position I’d like to be in—  where we’re interacting as a Committee both on the day of the meeting and then whenever the   minutes are released, on balance I think it makes sense to have those minutes be a little more   contemporaneous and a little fresher, as opposed to being very much out of tune  I say that because   in either case the markets treat them, sometimes appropriately and at other times inappropriately, as   a reflection of the Committee’s views  So my views on this issue have changed; I’ve moved to   preferring, on balance, to release the minutes earlier  And I think this experiment has been very,   very useful in that regard   December 14, 2004 81 of 118            Mr Chairman, either we are going to do this or we aren’t  We can’t   start out by immediately saying, “Oh, well, that date is not very convenient”    "
7678,2005-02-01," Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  At the first regularly scheduled   Committee meeting of every year, our first obligation is to elect a Chairman and a Vice Chairman to   serve until the election of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the next year    So let me now open the floor for nominations from among our members for Chairman and Vice   Chairman   And do you have a nomination for Vice Chairman?   Is there a second to those nominations?   SEVERAL Second   Any other nominations?  Any objections?  Any comments?  Well, we’re   not in an era of great democracy  [Laughter] Let the record show a unanimous vote for Messrs   Greenspan and Geithner to be Chairman and Vice Chairman of the FOMC until its first regularly   scheduled meeting of 2006  Congratulations   And we have a turnout of 100 percent!   Well, consistent with the odds and tradition, I will nominate the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York   Thank you, Mr Chairman  To start, as I’ve told a few of you, I’m struck   by how easily one moves in this Committee from being a brash “young Turk” to being part of the   “old guard” So, as a former young Turk and now a member of the old guard, I will speak for the   status quo   You’ve raised a number of questions, and others have too  The first one, obviously, is Does   one believe in the core mission of price stability?  By definition, I take the easy answer of “yes” I   would note that we’ve gone around this table and, as you and others have pointed out, there is no   one who, after many years of experience, would say anything other than “yes”  To me that’s   extraordinarily important, because one of the reasons that people get excited about this question of   inflation targeting—or what has now been redefined by our staff as adopting a quantitative price   objective—is some anxiety that people in this room will “use or lose” some of their historical   memory  But I am firmly of the belief that whatever may happen going forward, and whoever may   sit in whichever chair in this room, the experience that we’ve had in the past 20-plus years has   created on this Committee a strong sense of price stability as a key element of our responsibilities    And that, I think, is a bedrock that we shouldn’t ignore              February 1-2, 2005 48 of 177  Now let me turn to some of the questions that have been put on the table  First, how does   one define price stability?  The staff has done a very, very good job in many ways, but I think   they’ve given us a little false dilemma on how to define price stability  I actually try to define it both   ways—both qualitatively and quantitatively The qualitative definition is It doesn’t seem to be   affecting the way households behave You put that definition on the table, Mr Chairman, and I   think that is not irrelevant to us Second, like everyone else, I’ve learned in the time that I’ve been   here that perhaps the core PCE at this stage is the better index, but that’s not to say that in five years   we won’t go officially to a chain CPI and that may become the better index  So, at this stage, core   PCE seems to me slightly better in terms of how one thinks about inflation   Should the objective be in terms of the rate of inflation?  I think the argument there is pretty   clear On the point estimate versus range, I think Janet, as always, with her background, has noted a   number of reasons why a point estimate might be useful  On the other hand—again, learning from   experience—I end up where Ned Gramlich was, in that I believe it’s probably wiser to think of this   in a range Now, having said that, then we get to the staff’s point that if we announce a range as a   zone of indifference, in some sense there’s a question of what we have added to what the public   already knows   That brings me to my third point, which is Do we need to have, in addition to this internal   discussion, a broad external discussion?  And here I start where Gary Stern started but end up in a   different place Gary asked the question, in some sense, “Is it broken?”  And my answer is, “No, it’s   not broken” I think most observers of this Committee would recognize the bottom end of our range   as 1 percent because we’ve been very clear about it I believe many would say that they’re not sure   where the upper end is but that it’s probably in the 2 to 2½ percent area As I listen to our   discussions, I think that is, in fact, not far off  So, in terms of anchoring expectations or   communicating our views, somehow or another we’ve managed to do that, broadly speaking  So, I   don’t think we need to push further on this element                 February 1-2, 2005 49 of 177  Now, let me proceed to the question of announcing a target  I’ve noticed that a number of   people did think that we’d want to announce somehow this very soft price objective  And I, in my   role now as a member of the old guard would raise a number of cautionary questions that I believe   we should consider at some point—if not today, maybe later  First, if we do proceed and we   announce that the Committee defines price stability on, let’s say, core PCE in a very tight range, I’d   view that as the beginning of a soft inflation targeting regime  And I believe it would be unwise for   us to think that we can stop there I believe it would be the beginning of a slippery slope There   would then be a number of questions we’d have to answer, going forward, that I haven’t heard fully   fleshed out today, though some have come up  So let me just put them forward    One, obviously, is the numerical objective for maximum sustainable growth  I think we   actually have in this room right now a soft view of what we believe potential is  I’m not sure that   we’ll agree on that same number a few years from now  We have been quite cautious about giving   an estimate of potential—giving at most a soft range—knowing the uncertainties involved in   measuring maximum sustainable growth and, therefore, measuring the output gap  We’ve also   learned from the work of Athanasios Orphanides how dangerous it could be to try to use real-time   estimates of the output gap as a guide toward inflation or toward policymaking  So there’s another   reason why we’ve been a little cautious in that regard But if we decided that we wanted to   announce even a general quantitative target for inflation or a quantitative range—I prefer not to use   the word “target”—I think we would be forced to explain how that view about inflation is or is not   consistent with achieving maximum economic growth     I’d say the same thing about unemployment  Yes, there are a number of reasons that Vincent   has talked about that would explain why it would be unwise for us to try to be too explicit about   what we consider to be full employment  On the other hand, the concept of the NAIRU [non­  accelerating inflation rate of unemployment] is very much out there  There are people in this room   who, in the period since I’ve been here, swore that the NAIRU was 56 percent Those people, two   months later, also would have sworn that it was 54 percent  So, I think the evidence suggests that if               February 1-2, 2005 50 of 177  we’re going to try to quantify one element of our mandate, we’ve got to be very, very firm in our   ability to explain why we haven’t quantified the other elements   The second question that would emerge, if we go down this path of quietly whispering a   numerical goal or objective, is What are we going to do if inflation is outside the range?  And I   think on that point we’d face a number of questions  How quickly are we going to move?  Are the   edges around that range hard or soft?  What exactly does it mean when we say that’s how we define   price stability? Are we going to move aggressively if we’re outside the range?  We will give that   famous economist’s answer, “It depends”  Are we then going to get the third question “Why don’t   you give a forecast of inflation that really means something, as opposed to what you do now?”   Well, then we’d have to explain that   Don Kohn, I think, raised a very important issue  I don’t think we can quietly do this   without going to Congress and the Administration  As I read the information from countries   overseas, in almost every case the government had a role in establishing an inflation objective  And   I agree with what others have said As soon as we go down this path, we are going to be confronted   with questions from the more astute members of Congress   And then, finally, I think the question will come up, “What is the problem?”  It’s a little hard   to say exactly what the problem is right now  I think Cathy appropriately pointed out what a number   of us have said many times, which is that inflation targeting is not inherently a bad concept; it has   worked very well in a number of economies  It just happens that it may not be the right concept   here   So I would be proudly in defense of the status quo I do think there are some things we can   do to improve our communications  A number of us have suggested that looking at the Committee’s   behavior gives a general sense of what we find to be acceptable We can augment that by talking   about our individual views And I hope it doesn’t occur, but there may be times when we will need   to talk about an unacceptable pickup in inflation, along the lines of what we did in anchoring the           February 1-2, 2005 51 of 177  bottom end  So, I think some opportunities to explain our intentions have presented themselves and   we’ve shown that we can use them   Finally, being part of the old guard, let me just leave, for the consideration of those who want   to make changes, this thought  You may end up being right in the long term, but I would be very   cautious about moving too quickly today unless you’ve answered at least half of the questions that I   and other people have raised Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy, to me at least, seems to be   safely at what I would describe as a mid-cycle sweet spot, with inflation generally contained and   growth at about potential The staff’s outlook and the consensus forecast—the Greenbook baseline   and the central tendencies on chart 15—were all consistent with that kind of benign outlook going   forward                       February 1-2, 2005 115 of 177  While fourth-quarter GDP may have been mildly below expectations—due to the vagaries of   national statistical authorities in other countries perhaps—the underlying growth of domestic   demand in the most recent release was, I would say, relatively encouraging  Final sales to domestic   purchasers, the broadest measure of domestic demand excluding inventory investment, grew at a   solid 43 percent pace, which I think Tom Hoenig already pointed out  Both PCE expenditures and   E&S expenditures contributed Importantly, the private sector contributed almost all of the growth,   as government consumption rose less than 1 percent and contributed less than 02 percentage point   to the GDP growth, according to the most recent report  This growth was supported by a number of   underlying factors, all of which I think are consistent with the very positive outlook Real disposable   income managed an impressive 62 percent increase, even excluding the Microsoft dividend  I’m   surprised that from the Twelfth District we didn’t hear more about the dividend, since most of the   recipients apparently live in Washington State   Orders and shipments of durable goods excluding aircraft rose briskly in December, perhaps   undercutting to some degree the staff’s pothole outlook but reinforcing a general sense of balanced   growth Weekly jobless claims edged up most recently but still remain below the recent trend    Consumer confidence and business confidence surveys are all off a bit, but, again, for the most part   the gains in the last few months are being maintained  And our own survey of capital spending plans   reinforces the notion of gradual business expansion So, against this relatively benign mid-cycle   backdrop and the number of data sources that suggest a continuation of this outlook, should we   adopt a “What, me worry?” attitude?  Here is what differentiates us, perhaps, from some of   Governor Olson’s contacts We, indeed, are in it mainly for the pain!  [Laughter]   But what are the things that should be causing us some pain as we look forward?  First and   foremost, the drag from net exports appears likely to continue and, I would say, is disturbingly   stubborn Even after the glitch in the statistics from Canada has been taken into consideration, the   trade deficit hit a record in November and averaged $576 billion in the first two months of Q4 last                     February 1-2, 2005 116 of 177  year, well above the Q3 average of $518 billion Given the amount of dollar depreciation that   we’ve already experienced, why have we not seen a more balanced net export picture?   I think we fully understand that this is a phenomenon that is due to a number of factors  One   is the relative strength of the growth in the US economy versus the rest of the world—the   Houthakker-Magee effect The initial imbalance between imports and exports, as Karen has pointed   out, means that exports have an awfully long way to run just to catch up with imports  And there is   the rise in oil prices Another reason that imports appear to be relatively exchange-rate inelastic may   be the limited pass-through, which fell from about 05 in the decade of the 1980s to about 01 in the   decade of the 1990s Some also believe the fact that the recent dollar depreciation has been against   some currencies and not others may explain the size of the trade deficit  But I suspect our staff is not   in sympathy with that particular argument   In focusing on chart 14, though, what stands out is the degree of dollar depreciation that is   called for just to get a very, very small change in the baseline—to try to offset even a little bit of the   trade imbalance  I think that is really quite disturbing for a number of reasons  One is that I don’t   have as much confidence perhaps as others do that domestic demand overseas is going to be   stimulated  The Japanese have a very severe problem to deal with  The Europeans, as I meet with   them, continue to discuss a very low potential growth rate and the need for structural changes  The   ECB, for a variety of perhaps legitimate reasons, I think feels quite constrained about trying to   stimulate domestic demand  So, I think the domestic demand situation externally is not particularly   attractive   We’ve already talked about, in Karen’s response to Governor Gramlich, issues relating to the   high-tech sector, where I at least see some questions, as Larry alluded to in his remarks  So, I sense   that the position with respect to the drag from exports is likely to be with us for a long time, is   unlikely to change very quickly, and will probably require much more dollar depreciation than is   built into the staff forecast, even in the alternative simulation  Therefore, I think that’s an issue that   is going to be perilous for the country and perhaps for us                          February 1-2, 2005 117 of 177  The other risk that I think one should be focused on is an upside risk having to do with the   pace of growth in unit labor costs That has quickened recently, rising at a progressively faster rate   over the four quarters of last year and leading to a slowing in the growth of unit profits  Should   businesses try to reassert the more rapid growth in unit profits that we saw earlier, they will need to   attempt to raise prices  The “flat markup and higher compensation inflation” scenario has, to my   mind, a small but nonzero probability of happening  The ratio of nonfinancial corporate profits to   GDP has risen about 5 percentage points and now stands at about 11 percent  The staff forecasts that   the profit share will fall off a bit, and, I must say, history does support that forecast  In five of the   previous seven cycles since 1960, the profit share also rose above 5 percentage points—as it has   now—and then did come off, as the staff has forecasted for the current cycle  However, there is a   little worry in all this, because in the last cycle the profit share reached about 13 percent of GDP   before falling If businesses now condition their expectations on that most recent experience, then   the scattered stories of the exercise of pricing power that we’ve heard around the table could   potentially become more widespread  Whether or not that actually will occur depends on a number   of factors that have been discussed already, having to do with competitive forces both in labor   markets and in output markets  Issues having to do with slack and with import prices clearly come   into play here   At this stage, I’d say that all of this is clearly worth watching These are the worries of   central bankers, if not politicians  Whether any of these risks or some other ones not named will   come to pass obviously will be the subject of this year’s meetings  Until that time, I think we should   continue to execute our planned strategy of a gradual removal of policy accommodation, but review   it really quite seriously at each meeting  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman   I support your recommendation, but I must say you leave us all feeling   like a frog in water—[laughter]—with the temperature of the water gradually rising  The water gets   hotter but it’s not so hot that it’s boiling You have to let us know when it really starts to get too hot  "
7703,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the last meeting, I described the economy   as being in what I called a mid-cycle sweet spot, so the obvious question is What has happened   since then?  I would say that, in general, my headline is bifurcated  One is, “so far so good;” and   two is, “there are a number of caveats”   Let’s first look at the “so far so good” part of the headline As all of you have already   pointed out, the economy seems to be gaining momentum  Households continue to be in good   shape The saving rate is, unfortunately, low, but that is supporting consumption  Households are   also being supported by an increase in compensation per hour that continues to look quite robust   As the Greenbook has pointed out, there seems to be no pothole on the investment side, so   the business fixed investment component is also kicking in  Nevertheless, as a number of you have   already indicated, some concerns have arisen recently on the inflation front  But I think we should   also recognize that long-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored  And importantly,   while a number of costs have gone up, unit labor costs themselves continue to be, if anything, quite   moderate  All of this suggests to me—though I will point out some caveats—that the incoming data   are not flashing a signal that we are clearly behind the curve   So what are the caveats that seem to be important?  Both of them deal with some   uncertainties regarding the supply side of the economy  First, we have a question about what is   going on in the labor markets  As all of you know, several meetings ago, and then at the AEA   [American Economic Association], I put forth some relatively rudimentary analysis that suggested   that some of the decline we’ve seen in labor force participation rates may not turn around very   quickly The staff has done some much more sophisticated analysis and has come to a not too   dissimilar conclusion  So I think we do have an obligation to mark down our expectations of the                             March 22, 2005 62 of 116  increase in labor hours that can go into overall potential GDP The staff has done that, and I support   that conclusion   The second uncertainty with respect to the supply side has to do with productivity growth   This, I think, will be an ongoing question for us for some time to come  I recognize—as do others,   including President Yellen—and applaud the fact that there appear to be many positive signs with   respect to productivity growth We had a discussion in this room, for example, in a meeting with the   SIA, suggesting that Moore’s Law continues to be in shape, which is obviously a very positive thing    And we have seen some upside surprises in income and productivity growth, which, again, is a very   positive development   Having said all of that, the staff takes into consideration the net debt financing of financial   firms and the financing gap information, both of which show that firms have a great deal of room   left to invest; the staff views those as positive signs that there is some potential upside to   productivity I would say that we should at least be a little cautious in that assessment because those   developments may involve some negative signs  So I think there’s a little question mark on the   capital deepening component of productivity increases  At this stage, I’m generally willing to   support the consensus that has emerged around the table, and in the Greenbook forecast, that   productivity probably is in good shape But we need to monitor that    Another caveat has to do with this issue of energy prices  I, along with Governor Bernanke,   realize that energy prices play a relatively small part in inflation in the US economy, particularly   against the backdrop of well-contained unit labor costs However, like others, I recognize that the   increases in oil prices seem to have had a dramatic impact on market psychology and may be the   thing that could undermine the relatively well-contained inflation expectations that have been   beneficial to us So, with regard to oil prices, I’d agree with others that the supply and demand                          March 22, 2005 63 of 116  dynamics are such that not only are oil prices likely to be in a higher range, as indicated by the far-  dated futures, but also that the surprises are more likely to be skewed to the upside  In my view, the   recent increases in oil prices reflect some real concerns that world supply will not be able to keep   pace with demand growth, as a few of you have already said  In particular, I think the cushion of   spare production capacity has narrowed significantly   In preparation for this meeting, I asked the staff to do an options-derived probability density   function of WTI prices  I don’t have the results to hand out, but when one looks at the December   2005 function, there is a particularly large skew to the right-hand side I think this is telling us that   there are significant market concerns that prices could surge in the event of supply disruptions    These concerns have pushed up both futures prices—which to me can be interpreted as a mean   expectation for future spot prices—and also spot prices today, reflecting, I think, some heightened   precautionary motives for holding inventories  So there is a real risk that with very low short-run   price elasticity of demand, a supply shock could lead to very big moves in price and potentially   unhinge the inflation expectations that we have benefited from  So I think that is another caveat to   worry about   Finally, President Geithner has raised a few times the question of whether or not the   predictability of our language has been the source of a reduction in either implied volatilities or   spreads over Treasuries I had the staff do some basic historical charts to look at this issue  We first   introduced in the Chairman’s congressional testimony in 2003 the notion that we’d keep rates low   for a considerable period, and that showed up in our press statement for the first time in August   2003 Since then, obviously, we’ve gone through other terms such as “patience,” “measured pace,”   et cetera All of that I think has played to some degree in the reduction of implied volatilities and   spreads over Treasuries But, in fact, if you look at a chart that shows the movement down in                             March 22, 2005 64 of 116  implied volatilities and in the spreads over Treasuries, both started to decline many, many months   before our original focus on using the kind of language we’ve been using So while I don’t   necessarily disagree that there are carry trades and that some real risks have emerged, in my view we   should not take too much of the blame for that upon ourselves  I think a number of market dynamics   have driven that, along with predictability and transparency at the Fed   That leads me to the final point What does all this mean for monetary policy?  First, I would   say, at bottom, that I find the baseline outlook to be credible and reasonable  But it is surrounded by   a range of risks that I believe, as do others, are primarily on the upside  Against that background, it   seems prudent to continue to execute our pre-announced strategy  The economy is growing well and   needs less and less stimulus; therefore, continuing to remove our accommodative policy at a   measured pace seems to me reasonable   Second, given the stage of the cycle, the skew in the general risk assessment that I outlined,   and the need to manage market expectations, I think we should use our statement to signal our   awareness that inflation pressures may have picked up  The incoming data are indicative of that  If   we are wrong on the upside risks, both we and the market will adjust  On the other hand, if we fail   to reflect the existence of these upside risks, we could easily be perceived as being behind the curve,   with negative consequences in terms of inflation dynamics and, potentially, our own credibility   Finally, I think the statement, as drafted in the last meeting, clearly links the concept of a   measured removal of accommodation with a general sense of the incoming data  And I believe that   gives us the kind of flexibility that we need Therefore, I’m not terribly supportive of removing the   “measured pace” concept at this stage  I think we have sufficient flexibility using that phrase, when   it is linked to the incoming data, to move more quickly if we had to or to pause if we needed to see                                     March 22, 2005 65 of 116  how things were evolving So I would caution against making that kind of change in the statement   today Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation of 25 basis   points and I support alternative B On the broad issues, I think we have to continue to attempt to   have in our statement some forward-looking language, as painful as it may be  I did not support the   move toward having the minutes come out earlier as a tradeoff  I know that was in some people’s   minds, but I think in the statement itself some forward-looking language about the economy is   useful It is sort of modern-day central banking practice, and anything other than that, I think, is a   step backward and is likely to have a detrimental impact not only on our credibility but also on the   market functioning   On the word “measured,” as I said earlier, I think that’s conditioned upon the expectation of   inflation being relatively well contained And if that condition in fact turns out not to be true, then   we could move more quickly, and I don’t believe it would be undercutting our commitment, if that’s   what it is, to “measured pace”  To me it would just be a way of interpreting the measured pace   On the process of getting this language out to us earlier, I look forward to seeing how the   Secretary manages to do that, and I will attempt to be as constructive and helpful in that process as   possible It does remind me that this year—many of you didn’t follow this sport—there was a   snowboarding championship won by a 23-year-old woman who did her world famous patented step   called “the crippler” I expect to see a “crippler” coming to monetary policy as Vincent attempts to   get this language out that much earlier  [Laughter]   All requests for changes of 25 basis points  "
7728,2005-05-03," Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  Like everyone else, I’ve noted   with some concern both the incoming evidence of a soft patch with respect to growth and a rough   patch with respect to inflation However, I also believe that the Greenbook has taken these incoming   data on board with the usual wisdom and aplomb that I would expect from the staff  I, therefore,   think I can easily support the baseline as being a reasonable basis for policymaking today   Having said that, I’m also quite certain that the baseline will be wrong; I just don’t know in   which direction As many have already pointed out, the range of risks is really quite large  I would   say that if one looks at the alternative simulations, one can see many of the elements of those risks    Given the fact that I’m the last speaker, I will not go through a recitation of the data  Instead, I’m   going to move to the implications of that   First, I think the outcome of today’s meeting is in some sense a foregone conclusion    Anything other than a move of 25 basis points would be folly, and I don’t think we want to go down   that path Second, with respect to what we say today, a number of people have raised some   questions about whether or not we should keep the word “measured” in our description  Frankly,   given the range of uncertainties that we are facing now, to do anything other than to say that policy   will be moved at a measured pace, I think, would create more uncertainty than certainty  So inertia   in terms of the language might well be a smart move   Thinking beyond that, though, to the rest of this year and focusing a bit more on strategy, I   note that the markets have now marked down their expectation of where the fed funds rate will be   toward the end of the year and much of next year to a number close to 375 percent as opposed to 4   percent That leads me to think about exactly what has been driving the unusual data we have seen   coming in  Here I pick up a point that the Greenbook raises The writers hypothesize that there are                                    May 3, 2005 70 of 116  two reasons for the softness in the recent data one is higher energy prices, and the second is that the   tightening of monetary policy may have taken a greater toll on the economy than we had anticipated   Many have already explored the energy price issue and its implications for inflation  Let me   now go to the other side, which is the question of whether or not the tightening of monetary policy   has had a greater toll on the economy than we had expected  This obviously is another way of   saying that the equilibrium real interest rate is somewhat lower than we might have thought   previously, and I’d like to explore that possibility   I think the markets clearly have the view that the equilibrium rate or the neutral rate may   have come down somewhat  The Bluebook table indicates that the TIPS-consistent measure on a   core PCE basis would put the medium-run equilibrium real rate at about 2¼ percent  Obviously, we   cannot observe the rate that would be called for to keep the economy growing at potential without   inflationary pressures, but perhaps we can approximate this unobservable by looking at the long-run   averages The average real rate during the period 1991 to 2000 was about 2¾ percent Thus, the   market seems to be signaling that the equilibrium real rate has come down to a level about 50 basis   points below what it was in the last decade David in his remarks indicated that there is obviously a   wide band of confidence around that, but it may be somewhat lower as well as potentially somewhat   higher   So let’s look at the question of why the rate might be lower or why it is that the market and   the Greenbook might be right to suggest that the trajectory for the rate might be somewhat lower   than we had thought earlier I think we all know the litany the restraint imposed on domestic   consumers from the increase in the cost of energy, the lingering hesitancy of businesses to make   commitments, and the drag on domestic production from the excess of imports over exports  All                                 May 3, 2005 71 of 116  these factors represent forces that are pulling the equilibrium rate down below its perceived long-  term rate   So what are the facts? First, with respect to the first explanation on energy prices, the staff   yesterday showed us a simulation that indicates that the run-up in oil prices since December 2003   may have taken ½ percentage point off growth in 2004 and ¾ percentage point off growth this year   I have nothing to add to the simulation, but it clearly suggests that there is some damping of   domestic demand that’s coming from these high and consistently high energy prices   Let’s go to the second point, which is the issue of business hesitancy It’s certainly true that   equipment and software spending has been growing relatively strongly  However, by historical   standards, both nominal high-tech and non-high-tech E&S [equipment and software] expenditures as   a share of GDP are somewhat lower than average  I don’t have the exact numbers, but as a rough   approximation it seems as though non-high-tech spending has accounted for somewhere between 5½   and 6 percent of GDP since 1980, and now accounts for something lower—close to about 5 percent    High-tech spending has also been trending up for some time, but perhaps it should be about 4¼   percent of GDP now and it’s actually about 3¾ percent These are obviously rough estimates, but   they all suggest that there has been a lingering drag on investment following the 1990s   The third explanation for why the real equilibrium rate may be somewhat lower, obviously,   is the drag from trade  That topic has already been well discussed I won’t add much more except to   say that in a recent discussion with the ECB [European Central Bank], their policymakers seem to   have some concern that the risks to their economic growth are primarily to the downside, suggesting   that we should not expect a pickup in demand for our exports overseas   So the question then becomes this  If, indeed, the markets are right and we are closer to the   end than to the beginning of our move toward the equilibrium rate, what happens if we get all of this                                                                    May 3, 2005 72 of 116  wrong?  I realize I’m trying to do something here that Gary suggests we can’t do, which is to   achieve a brilliant policy, exquisitely executed But if we aren’t able to achieve that, what happens?   I asked the staff to run a rough simulation from FRB/US to see what would happen if we continue to   raise rates 25 basis points today and at each of the following four meetings—in June, August,   September, and November  That simulation suggests that we would wind up at the end of 2006 with   real GDP growth down at about 31 percent, the unemployment rate would have risen to about 55   percent, and core PCE inflation would have fallen to 16 percent versus the 17 percent in the   Greenbook baseline I don’t have a longer-run forecast, but I would expect that over a longer time   horizon we’d find inflation trailing off even more   The reason I’ve gone through the simulation is to suggest that as we think about the rest of   this year, we should probably take on board the fact that while we have to continue to tighten—as   both the market and the Greenbook suggest—this concept of measured pace is very, very important   And the issue of exactly when and where we stop is also quite important  To put it another way,   while I’m comfortable with the strategy for today, I think we’re really entering the neutral zone    And for those of you who are Star Trek fans, you may recall that when you enter the neutral zone   that’s when the aliens are most likely to attack  [Laughter]   It is quite clear to me that we have executed one exit strategy, but unfortunately I think we’re   entering a mode where we need a new exit strategy from the exit strategy!  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve already said I support 25 basis points I   also support your broader perspective that we should try to keep the language pretty much   unchanged Given what has already been said, let me just make three or four comments   First, on the word “measured”  I already talked about that, and I agree with your sort of risk-  management approach  Second, on the role of the statement, I think the statement is meant to be, as   best as it can be, an explanation of what we did and why we did it I think Cathy said that But it   doesn’t have to reflect all the uncertainties noted by the 19 people as we went around the table I   think it is not inconsistent to have minutes that suggest a lot of back and forth and uncertainty and   then to have a statement that reflects where we all coalesce—with different degrees of comfort, but   we coalesce I’m not as anxious as others seem to be about the fact that the statement doesn’t reflect   the give and take and the back and forth, because that’s not necessary to explain what we did and   why we did it   With respect to dropping the sentence on the balance of risks, though—unfortunately I’m   speaking before Janet and I would love to hear her views—I would be a little cautious at this stage    It’s not because I’m in love with it; actually, I think it has outlived its usefulness in this particular   mode  There may be better ways to convey our sense of the balance of risks, but I don’t think we   have a better way right now And given the uncertainties in the current situation, I think the fewer   changes we make in the statement, the better, for the reasons you pointed out   And, finally, you made some points about where we might go with policy  I know it’s   impossible to avoid that inevitable overshooting—doing one or two moves too many and regretting   it But I think this really is the time when we have to try very hard to avoid overshooting, because if   the outlook is anywhere close to the forecast in the Greenbook, all we’re trying to do is to get rates   back to neutral We’re not trying to be terribly restrictive  So what I was suggesting earlier was that                                    May 3, 2005 92 of 116  overshooting by 50 basis points—while it’s not the end of the world and we can come back from   it—would be unfortunate I think we have to start being very sensitive about each one of these   moves and be prepared to take a pause and restart, if we have to, though we obviously can’t signal   that   On process, I won’t take up too much time  Jack suggested longer meetings  I had told   David yesterday—and this may surprise you—that while these meetings work extremely well under   leadership that has 18 years of experience, we may now be in a position where we need to spend a   little more time together  I’m not proposing that formally, that’s for sure  Certainly, I’ve been told   that the Bank of England meeting for two days with seven, eight, or nine people—or whatever the   number—is a pretty painful process  So with 19 people, it’s unlikely to be less painful [Laughter]   But I think your point is well taken that these meetings have become much more interesting and   interactive And trying to do all we need to do in a short period of time might not be the right way to   go I wouldn’t propose that as long as you are the Chair, but I suspect we may at some point want to   spend more time together as we go forward  I guess that’s my range of wisdom on the very wise   comments of my colleagues today  "
7754,2005-06-29," I’ll move that nomination    I guess my question is addressed to Glenn and John  Obviously, the   United States is unique, but we’re not the only country where a central bank has been trying to deal                                               June 29-30, 2005 32 of 234  with this issue  We’ve seen recently that monetary authorities in the United Kingdom, Australia,   and perhaps the Netherlands are all talking about the possibility of using monetary policy to try to   deal with the house-price issue  So, what, if any, lesson can we learn from overseas?  I recognize   that our particular situation is unique, but we’re not the only ones dealing with this problem   But have the results, generally speaking, been positive or neutral?  I   know this policy is in its early days, but is there any judgment one could make even at this early   stage on whether or not more jawboning—or, in the case of Australia, actually moving rates—has   been helpful?   The answer is obviously “yes”  [Laughter]   I’ll continue to plow that ground just for one minute  I’m struck a bit by   the fact that the stories on the run-up in commodity prices and oil prices are all about China and   India  You have a forecast here where China’s growth falls off fairly dramatically  Growth in the   rest of the world I would describe as maybe more of a downside risk  You point out the uncertainty   in Europe and Japan and you’ve even marked down economic growth in the United States  Yet   your commodity prices tend to be rather flat  All this run-up was associated with China, India, and   global growth  You have global growth dampening, but we don’t seem to recover much in the way   of these commodity prices—oil being one, but others in general  I’m obviously missing something    What is it?    You’ve told me in the past that the supply response in copper tends to   take a year or two  The price has not been high enough necessarily, but one would have thought   we’d start to see some supply response, getting these prices to come down even more quickly   I think that’s a fair point   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The issues before us at this meeting are two    The first is Are we going to be dissuaded from the announced strategy of another modest tightening   in monetary policy?  And second Is there palpable need to adjust market expectations of policy   going forward?   We might be dissuaded, or feel obliged to change market expectations under one of four   circumstances; and I will go through each of them in order  The first is if we thought the baseline   forecast itself, which I think is built basically around the announced strategy, was unacceptable  I   find the baseline forecast basically acceptable, although I am somewhat concerned, as are President   Lacker and a few others who have already spoken, that the inflation drift seems to be upward  So I   think there is some risk there, but by and large it’s basically an acceptable forecast   The second reason I think we would change strategy or change policy in terms of our   announcements is if the incoming data made a basically acceptable forecast seem highly unlikely    And here I’d say that the incoming data, at least on the real side of the economy, are pretty much                       June 29-30, 2005 141 of 234  consistent with the baseline forecast  Consumption is likely to hold up well, as outlined in the   baseline, because labor markets do appear to be gradually improving  As David Wilcox indicated,   not only has the unemployment rate edged down a little but, more importantly from my standpoint,   the broader indicators of labor market conditions seem to be consistent with improvement    Economic conditions have strengthened enough to bring some individuals back into the   labor market, as evidenced by a gradual rise in the labor force participation rate  There is also a   decline in the share of individuals working part-time, for economic reasons, as shown on exhibit 4   in the chart show as well  And I think the tone in the survey data from both businesses and   households has been relatively positive  Moreover, I continue to believe that low interest rates are   likely to support wealth creation in the housing market, as we discussed extensively yesterday, and I   have very little concern about a sudden fall-off in that regard  And, finally, with respect to business   fixed investment, I would say though the investment-to-GDP ratio has been relatively low—a point   I will return to later—I agree with the assessment in the Greenbook that the fundamentals are at   least consistent with ongoing business fixed investment     On the inflation side, I would say that David handled the incoming data well in terms of   why one should not put too much weight on some of the data  The one point that he didn’t touch on   was unit labor costs  They rose quite dramatically in the fourth quarter of last year, but I think the   good news is that in the first quarter of this year the increase in unit labor costs on an annual basis,   quarter over quarter, seems to have subsided somewhat  So there may be less inflation pressures in   that regard So by and large, in terms of the second reason, I’d say the incoming data are consistent   with a pretty good outlook     The third reason that might force us to change our views is if the market signals indicate that   our read of the economy is likely to be flawed  And here, as others have indicated, the work that                         June 29-30, 2005 142 of 234  Vincent and the staff have done I think firmly outlines at least some of the issues  The fixed-income   conundrum has been much recognized  Additionally, risk premia in the fixed-income universe are   also quite low In the equity markets, I think the signals are somewhat contradictory  And here I   pick up a little from exhibit 8  One thing that’s not shown there is that the implied share price   volatilities of both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are really quite low, and yet the risk equity premium is   relatively wide—toward the wide end of the norm that we’ve seen over the last decade  So in lieu   of decrying these conundra with which we are confronted, let me at least do what Michael wouldn’t   do, which is venture a hypothesis on why some of these things are true   With respect to the fixed-income markets, I have reached the conclusion—from these   various observations of low rates and the flat yield curve—that the explanation probably relates to   the fact that, at the global level, domestic absorption has fallen  I’m not trying to sort out   investment versus consumption  Overall I think it has fallen below what it would have been   otherwise  This suggests to me a fall in the neutral rate, not a global slowdown—to cite the two   choices that were in Vincent’s model  I am heavily persuaded by the work that we saw on Monday,   which Janet mentioned, about the number of real-side factors that may be holding back the economy   and therefore reducing the neutral rate    I’d also say that the investment-GDP ratio, which has been quite low, has fed into fixed-  income market performance because it has led to a change in the corporate financing gap  Between   1991 and 2000, the financing gap rose from less than $35 billion to a peak of more than $300   billion That rise reflected the very sharp increase in capital expenditures that we saw and have   talked a great deal about in the telecom, high-tech, and transportation sectors, etc  But the important   thing is that the financing gap fell abruptly in 2001 and 2002, turned negative in 2003, and stayed   negative until the fourth quarter of last year  Due to the Microsoft dividend and the expiration of the                      June 29-30, 2005 143 of 234  accelerated tax depreciation, the financing gap returned to slightly positive territory in the first   quarter  But overall the negative financing gap, which has been widespread across industries,   indicates to me that the business sector as a whole is generating enough cash to purchase capital   expenditures without borrowing   It is also true that the dividend payout ratio has been relatively low  The dividend payout   ratio as a percentage of S&P operating earnings turns out to be, based on a report that I’ve just   received, about 29 percent versus the 48 to 50 percent it has averaged over the last 40 years or so    So it’s clear that corporations are really sort of hoarding this cash    Since corporations do not tend to invest in equities, they do tend to invest in a number of   fixed-income securities relatively short term  I think that’s one of the things that have been driving   these relatively low interest rates  And just to put a final point on that, since the beginning of 2003,   liquid assets in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose from about $310 billion, or more than 30   percent, to a total of $13 trillion  While the rate of accumulation of liquid assets has slowed, I think   the ratio is still a factor that has been driving this relatively low interest rate   In equity markets, my read of the data is that the low volatility is telling us a better story   than the rise in the equity risk premium we’ve seen  As Steve pointed out, or at least implied, the   earnings-price ratio part of the equity risk premium really hasn’t changed very much over long   periods of time It is still in the 5½ to 6 percent range  So it really is the fixed-income side that has   been driving the slight widening of the equity risk premium   The final market signal that I think would be important to us is the read on interest rates    Some people have already talked about the interest rate signals we’ve seen  I won’t belabor the   issue I will pick up a point that Janet made, which is that there are a number of different measures   of inflation that come not just from the markets but from others  Our Greenbook turns out to be one                                       June 29-30, 2005 144 of 234  of the best forecasters of inflation  It’s not the only reasonably good one  From the Philadelphia   Federal Reserve District, for example, the survey of professional economists also has a fairly good   track record on forecasting inflation  And as Janet pointed out, a random walk—or at least looking   back to recent inflation history—has been a good forecaster  The good news for us is that almost all   of those forecasts fall in a range that’s very close to the Greenbook forecast, which gives us perhaps   some comfort that the Greenbook has the forecast on inflation about right    The final point I’d make—if you remember, there were four reasons—is  Would we be   dissuaded from raising rates or would we change the signal if we thought it would create some   financial instability?  In this regard, I asked the staff to do a very quick simulation of the effect of a   rapid 1 percentage point rise in the fed funds rate over what is in the Greenbook forecast  It turns   out that if we were to be so rash as to dramatically raise rates by 1 percentage point over the   baseline forecast, that would create by the end of 2006 a rise in the financial obligation ratio of only   about 6 basis points  I won’t go through all the math of it, but obviously it has a fair amount to do   with the fact that a vast majority of the mortgages in this country are fixed-rate mortgages  And   second, by definition, if we were to raise rates so dramatically that it would result in a slowing in the   economy, we would see individuals take on less debt  But the bottom line is that I think the strategy   we’ve outlined, if executed in a reasonable fashion, should not create financial instability   Let me conclude by saying that I think the strategy we have is about right  I don’t believe   there’s a reason to change market expectations quite dramatically  I do think there’s some   downward pressure on the neutral rate, and I think the Greenbook has picked that up  So, by and   large, I think the appropriate course is full steam ahead  Thank you, Mr Chairman   I support both parts of your recommendation  "
7785,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data show broad-based   support for growth, with inflation—at least in the most recent readings—relatively well   contained Final demand seems to be robust, with consumers, housing, and to some degree   business investment spending, all making contributions  No doubt some of these data have been   helped by the surprising success of the latest set of incentives from the auto companies, which   boosted consumer spending and led to an unexpected slowdown in inventory investment    However, underlying financial conditions, the creation of wealth and jobs, and both consumer   and business confidence I think provide a more lasting, sustainable basis to growth going   forward   While it’s hard to have a great deal of confidence in the saw-toothed quarterly pattern   that we see in the Greenbook, I think the baseline forecast in the longer term is amply supported   by the facts And in my view, a continued execution of our announced policy of a gradual   removal of accommodation is in order   However, there were a sufficient number of surprises in the intermeeting period—and, as   David said, a sufficient number of moving parts in the Greenbook—to warrant a closer                                                                                    August 9, 2005 73 of 110  examination of a number of issues  Given the time, however, I’m going to focus my comments   on only one of those I think the most important issue from a policy perspective is whether it is   reasonable to accept, as a basis for today’s decision, the staff’s forecast of inflation stabilizing,   albeit at the very upper end of what I believe is this Committee’s acceptable range   The baseline staff view of this relatively benign inflation dynamic can certainly be called   into question, given a range of sources of uncertainty and inflation pressures  Those   uncertainties and inflation pressures come from a number of factors the mixed data that we’ve   seen of late on labor compensation; the upward movement in the price of oil; the recent changes   over the last several quarters in unit labor costs; and our new understanding that PCE prices were   on a steeper upward trajectory and that structural supply-side growth may have been slightly less   robust than we had thought before the NIPA revisions   To attempt to answer this question, I sought to validate the Greenbook inflation forecast,   and I’d like to hand out some tables that indicate the results of this work2  What I asked the staff   to do was to assess the historical performance of several alternative measures of inflation as   predictors of one-year-ahead inflation—CPI inflation in particular  And here I think I owe a   slight apology to Gary, because I came to some statistical conclusions that were somewhat   different from his instinctive conclusions   If you look at the table I’ve handed out, the first page shows what is called the root mean   squared prediction error of alternative forecasts of one-year-ahead CPI inflation  The set of   forecasts that I looked at is pretty obvious  the Greenbook, the SPF [Survey of Professional   Forecasters] CPI forecast, the CPI random walk, and the median CPI random walk using the   Cleveland median CPI  In the second to leftmost column you’ll see that over a long period—   2 The materials referred to by Mr Ferguson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                      August 9, 2005 74 of 110  from the third quarter of 1981 to the first quarter of 2004—our Greenbook forecast has turned   out, at least on this relatively simple measure, to have been the best of the forecasts  The random   walk forecast tends not to be so good, but other forecasters externally have also done pretty well   You can look across the various periods and see that, by and large, the staff forecast tends   to be the historical winner Curiously, as you get to the far right column, which covers the   period beginning in 1999, we can add in important information—the compensation from TIPS    Again, I think it gives a relatively good forecast of inflation  And then the one measure here that   is not self-explanatory is the adjusted TIPS There, our staff has adjusted the TIPS to eliminate   the best estimate that we have of the liquidity premium and inflation risk premium based on a   term structure model  And if you look at the adjusted TIPS, at least in the short period of 1999 to   2004, you can see that the adjusted TIPS measure tends to be somewhat better than almost any of   the others So, by and large, we’d say overall that the market seems to have a really good   forecasting record in the short term  And in the longer term, our Greenbook forecast seems to be   the best and is probably somewhat better than the random walk   Turning to the second page of the handout, given that background of what we can trust, I   think the good news here—again, I had to do this on the CPI forecast—our staff’s CPI forecast   seems to be pretty much in the middle  We are not an outlier  The other good news, particularly   if one trusts the adjusted TIPS information, is that it also seems to be quite consistent with the   Greenbook forecast So I took this to basically say at the end—and I want to be relatively short   here, given I’m the last speaker—that we can be reasonably confident in basing our policy today   on the Greenbook inflation forecast  There clearly is an upside risk to that forecast, I think  But   as both other forecasters and a variety of market-based indicators all signal, it would be very   hard for us to find at this stage a better inflation forecast than the one the staff has given us  So                                                                                     August 9, 2005 75 of 110  while there’s obviously some uncertainty, I’d say let’s build our policy approach around the   baseline forecast, and let’s continue with the market-accepted approach that we’ve already   announced of a gradual removal of our accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Just one Brian, you had on exhibit 4 an interesting simulation in the   scenario with a higher term premium  But an alternative you didn’t simulate is what happens if   the relatively low term premia that we are observing now stay in place for some time  There are   a number of people who think that that has short-term implications for policy  I’m not sure about   that It might over time, but I’m not sure it has implications for the next several meetings                                                 August 9, 2005 80 of 110  Okay So in some sense, the Greenbook scenario covers the current   situation, and then a very, very gradual movement up in the term premium   That’s for a slow reversion, right?  The other one that you have here   involves a very rapid reversion   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  With   respect to the language, I think the most important set of changes here is not in paragraph 3 but                               August 9, 2005 92 of 110  in paragraph 4 And I actually think having the language read the way it is written now in   alternative B, as opposed to President Poole’s suggestion, emphasizes the most important issue,   which is that the pressures on inflation have stayed elevated  In my view that’s really—   Yes, leaving it at the end  That is the policy-significant story here,   and I think that picks up the general tone around the room  So I’m weighing in fairly strongly on   not making this change  I understand the grammatical point that President Poole made  But in   terms of the policy message, if we end with “pressures on inflation have stayed elevated,” I think   that’s a significant enough change It tells the market that we are awake and vigilant, and I   believe that will help us to keep the inflation expectations pretty well contained, but President   Geithner is closer to the markets than I am    "
7809,2005-09-20," Two points—a comment and a question  I’m actually somewhat   surprised at the answers you got on your last question, Mr Chairman, because staff members   from both R&S [Research and Statistics] and Monetary Affairs did a series of memos for me on                      September 20, 2005 23 of 117  just this question, and I talked about the results at the last meeting  We found, in terms of root   mean squared prediction error, that the staff forecast seemed to be the best forecast of one-year­  ahead inflation But in the last four or five years, trying to control as best our staff could for   some of the liquidity effects and risk premium effects that Vincent talked about, our finding was   that TIPS compensation turned out to be a somewhat better predictor even than the staff model    The other forecasts turned out to be much worse than either of the two I just talked about  So I   think we don’t know a lot, but we know a little bit  Maybe we could get that material circulated   again   My question, though, is not on that point Dave, you threw me off a bit on the question   of where we now stand on compensation because in the Greenbook you said that the downward   revision in the P&C [Productivity and Cost] measure of compensation per hour was smaller than   expected and, “we now view more of the surge in 2004 fourth-quarter compensation as having   been permanent and less as a reflection of transitory factors such as stock options”  I thought   what I heard you say in your oral presentation was that the pendulum had swung back a little     Great Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Beyond the tragic and sobering   consequences of Katrina that we saw, the effect of Katrina with respect to monetary policy I   think has been to create greater uncertainty, not just about the near term but also the intermediate   term  Katrina clearly has become more policy-relevant than the previous natural disasters that   we’ve seen, because it hit energy-producing regions of the country at a time of high and   potentially rising energy prices driven by global supply and demand factors  It also came at a   time when resource utilization was clearly tightening and the output gap was closing because the                   September 20, 2005 78 of 117  economy—supported by a particularly strong housing market and accommodative monetary   policy—appeared to be growing above potential,    Additionally, core measures of inflation, while not deteriorating recently, had been   running a bit high for my taste  Near-term inflation expectations were also rising; and longer-  term expectations, while still being described as contained, were somewhat less contained than   they had been at the last meeting, as Dino’s chart showed   I think the staff has done an outstanding job of calibrating the effects of Katrina and the   subsequent rebuilding on the economy, including a careful assessment of the loss of and need to   rebuild the capital stock  I accept the baseline forecast as the basis for discussion today and note   that its contours are similar to those of private sector forecasters as well However, the range of   uncertainty around the baseline forecast is large  The plunge of consumer sentiment reminds us   of that fact, as do the rise in inflation expectations in the most recent survey data and the ongoing   jitters in spot and futures energy markets   Faced with such uncertainty, we might be guided by our history in dealing with other   periods of shock to the economic system  During previous episodes of shock and uncertainty,   we have often lowered rates or at least temporarily refrained from raising rates to wait for the   range of uncertainty to narrow Therefore, before deciding to raise rates today, we have a burden   of examining why we are not following the same reaction function we have in the past   I see at least four reasons why, unlike in the past 20 years or so, the uncertainty that we   face now should not be a precursor to a pause  First, the relative impact of a natural disaster on   growth and inflation is ambiguous and not easily comparable to the shocks that we have   experienced in the last two decades  Importantly, those shocks—9/11, the stock market break of                         September 20, 2005 79 of 117  1987, and even Y2K—were clearly, or at least primarily, demand shocks, working through   confidence effects and unsettled financial conditions, either actual or potential  Now, as others   have said or implied, we are facing a shock to both the demand and the supply side of the   economy  This is obviously an important distinction  Katrina is likely to elongate the period of   high and rising energy prices that we were already confronting before the hurricane struck   In the longer run, theory tells us that a persistently high energy cost, exacerbated by   occasional shocks, reduces both labor productivity and potential output over time, as the amount   of energy used per worker declines  This effect is only partially offset by the installation of   energy-saving devices If households and firms recognize the impact of high energy prices on   potential supply, all else equal, they should lower equity prices and also damp aggregate demand   through expectational effects The possible reduction in aggregate demand does not, however,   ipso facto match fully the reduction in potential supply  President Lacker suggested that a naive   policymaker might put greater weight on the demand effects, but I also think that a reasonable   policymaker would certainly recognize the need to set policy to help maintain a balance between   aggregate supply and aggregate demand And that does not inherently imply reducing our target   funds rate   Second, as already indicated, before Katrina we were seeing conditions of gradually   rising inflation pressures  Staff estimates that seem reasonable to me indicate that the persistent   energy price increases have contributed and will contribute ¼ to ¾ percentage points annually to   core inflation between 2004 and 2007  Importantly, the staff forecast for inflation has been   gradually rising from Greenbook to Greenbook as well  If we were to pause today, in my   judgment we clearly would risk allowing the pass-through from headline inflation to core                      September 20, 2005 80 of 117  inflation to become embedded in inflation expectations, making it difficult to regain control over   the inflation process and losing some of our hard-won credibility   Third, the effort to rebuild parts of the United States will undoubtedly require massive   federal expenditures in addition to transfers from insurers to households and businesses  As the   staff forecast shows, this will be highly stimulative to the economy next year  I won’t elaborate   on that, as a number of others have already discussed it   And I think the final reason for not following a pause strategy here, as a few others have   said, is that it won’t be clear when we can restart again  It is not clear to me at all that the data   over the next few quarters will be free from the disruption of Katrina, but it is pretty clear to me   that inflation pressures will continue to build  So, therefore, the staff forecast strikes me as a   reasonable approach  That forecast manages to allow these various effects on growth—actual   and potential—and inflation to end with a stable inflation outlook, in part by assuming that this   Committee raises rates from the current accommodative level  This assumption seems warranted   to me  In my judgment, we have sufficient reason not to follow our historical response of   pausing   The one counterargument to all of this is that there are also clearly a number of drags on   the US economy  These drags include drags from the export sector and relatively slow growth   of business fixed investment  These show through, in my judgment, in the form of a lower   equilibrium real interest rate, which implies that at some point we certainly should discuss when   we want to stop raising the funds rate or at least be clear that we’ve moved past the neutral level    That may be, as I think Tom Hoenig suggested, in the not-too-distant future  Be that as it may,   I’d say for today that we should continue to tighten Thank you                September 20, 2005 81 of 117  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I agree with you on   the indeterminacy of the supply and demand considerations  And I think your analysis of the   ’70s and our understanding or lack of understanding of productivity growth at the time is   important   I’ll close with one other thing, the central banker’s anxiety, which is “Good times are   bad because they could turn out to be bad  Bad times are bad for obvious reasons”  [Laughter]  I   think you’ve given us a lesson in why these extremely good times are unlikely to be good for us   in the long run  "
7831,2005-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like others, I am somewhat, though not fully,   reassured by the incoming data  The economy clearly appears to be on an expansionary track, not   having been seriously damaged by the seriously damaging hurricanes  Additionally, readings of   core inflation have been surprisingly benign, given everything we know from our models and the   anecdotal data we’ve heard from others on the cumulative effect of the rise in energy prices  More   importantly, during the intermeeting period, inflation expectations for both the next five years and   for the 5- to 10-year horizons are little changed  At least they have not changed much since the last   meeting and could reasonably be described, as they were at the time, as being contained                                         November 1, 2005 75 of 114  As the earlier dialogue between Vincent and the Chairman indicated, I did ask the staff to give   me some information on how inflation expectations and energy prices interact  Let me summarize   just three points from that data  First, of all the categories of energy prices—spot crude, gasoline,   far futures, natural gas, and heating oil—it seems that spot crude is the one that drives inflation   expectations most firmly  Second, as Vincent indicated, across the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year   horizons for inflation expectations, the 2-year horizon is really the one that is most heavily   influenced by spot crude oil prices  And third, as I think Vincent said, even there the impact on   inflation expectations of spot crude in the 2-year horizon is relatively muted A 1 percent increase in   spot crude oil prices, at least in these models, tends to go to a 07 basis point increase in inflation   expectations  So while we’re aware of the importance of energy prices, it turns out that in terms of   driving inflation expectations, there are many other things that are equally important   Having said all of that, let me now turn to the broader issues of import at this meeting, which   are what to do and also what to say  Someone quoted Yogi Berra  I’m going to quote that equally   famous poet, Archilochus, whom some of you may recall from the 7th century BC  [Laughter]   He famously said, “The fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog   knows one big thing”  The reason that’s important here is that while the various readings we’ve had   on the incoming data are extremely important, in some ways they are in the category of “many little   things” And the one big thing—the big thing that Dave noted in his opening remarks—is that the   staff now has a forecast for the next 18 to 24 months of an economy that, with just one or two more   tightening moves, is likely to enter a phase of growth below trend, with inflation pressures gradually   subsiding I think this is really the first time in this period that the outlook shows, after the long and                              November 1, 2005 76 of 114  variable lags, the impact of the cumulative tightening that we’ve undertaken  And the forecast does   indeed show that the economy is likely to slowly respond to our tightening regime   I find this actually quite credible because I believe, as does the staff, that the funds rate is   probably within the range of its equilibrium real level and will certainly be within that range with   one or two or more tightenings  I think it’s fairly important to put that on the table While I fully   respect Don’s view that one can’t put too much weight on these point estimates, I think it is   important for a Committee of our sort to have some sense of whether or not we’re in the range of   equilibrium   Having said that, I do think a number of forces are pulling and pushing against the economy   and leading us to this level  Here I would pick up on a point that President Lacker made—and I   certainly agree with him—that the impact of these hurricanes is more likely to have been on the   supply side than on the demand side  However, I would say that that’s a partial equilibrium   analysis  And ceteris is clearly not paribus in this case, because there are a number of forces that are   also driving the demand side independently of the hurricanes  Let me just highlight two or three of   them  One I continue to be worried about is the mystery of what it is that’s driving businesses   Dave raised in his opening remarks the point I’ve made a few times—that the investment/GDP ratio   still seems relatively low, certainly compared to its level in the last decade There is some survey   evidence that CEOs and CFOs still have some uncertainty  Anecdotal discussions that I and some   others have had suggest that some of this uncertainty has to do with whether or not to invest in the   United States or overseas  And the second part of the uncertainty is still, I think, a lingering concern   that these elevated energy prices will eventually play through to lower demand   While others may disagree, I think the large negative net equity issuance and the willingness   of businesses to repurchase shares or to engage in cash-financed mergers, against the backdrop of                                      November 1, 2005 77 of 114  ample liquidity, is primarily a sign that businesses are somewhat skeptical about their ability to   reward shareholders with a reasonable future return on internal investment  And, therefore, they   may be holding back on investment  I’d also say that the slightly negative guidance from businesses   during this earnings season reinforces this view that there’s some downward pressure that shows up   in a slightly lower equilibrium rate than we would have had otherwise   Second, I would pick up on a point that both Don Kohn and Sue Bies made having to do with   developments in the housing sector, and why for households in particular there is a sudden fall-off   in the demand for HELOCs [home equity lines of credit]  Again, I think that creates a little bit of   downward pressure on the neutral rate   We may also see during the next couple of years an increase in the saving rate, both for the   reasons that the staff talked about and also due to continuing uncertainty about pensions, which has   surely been very much in the newspapers  I think that, plus the ongoing discussions about Social   Security reform, will perhaps drive households to save more     And finally, to pick up on Karen’s point—a point that we haven’t talked about much today—I   think net exports during the forecast horizon are likely, if anything, to continue to be a drag, if I can   use that word, though I understand your mathematical point     They will be an arithmetic subtraction from measured GDP in the US   economy I think all of the conditions that have driven that in the past, including foreign exchange   rates, relative interest rates, and most importantly the productivity story and an absence of domestic   absorption overseas, are likely to result in the external sector being an arithmetic subtraction from   GDP more so than an addition                                                      November 1, 2005 78 of 114  In my view, all of those things lead to a credible story that says we are, or soon will be, in the   range of the neutral rate  But what does all that mean?  I think it means that we should clearly be   vigilant about inflation because there are some upside pressures, but I agree with Cathy and others   that we don’t have to be vigilantes about inflation  To put it another way, I think the scenario in the   Greenbook that has us going to an interest rate of 5 percent, driving the economy to a growth rate   that’s far below potential, opening up an output gap, and having unemployment of 55 percent, is   not something that we need to embrace  In fact, it’s something that we need to be cautious about   So that’s my view on what to do  The implication, obviously, is that I’m quite comfortable   with a 25 basis point move today, and I won’t preclude future discussion by suggesting what we   ought to do going forward  But I don’t find the Greenbook implicit assumption terribly unattractive   The second question then, obviously, is what to say  I applaud Janet for opening that topic  In   my view it’s important for it to be on the table  I come out at a different place from where Janet   comes out and also from where I think Don comes out  I’m not comfortable keeping this language   until we think we’re done, because I’m not sure we’ll ever really know that with enough certainty  I   think the language does need to evolve  I agree with Tim’s view that it seems a little stale at this   stage  I would very much be in the camp of favoring some forward-looking language of one sort of   another  The sort that I prefer is the kind of language that deals with the outlook in terms of our   dual mandate, with respect to both growth and inflation  I know that in the period I’ve been here   there were times when growth and inflation were not pointing in the same direction or when the   risks to our growth and inflation objectives differed substantially  So I think we need to separate   them   I recognize that the market only wants to know what’s going to happen with regard to interest   rates  From years of discussion around this table, I think most of us, myself included, are perhaps a                                                                                                                 November 1, 2005 79 of 114  little uncomfortable going that far with our forward-looking language, because we know that there   are many factors that can change the outlook between one meeting and another  So I’d be very   cautious about that   I do encourage us to have this discussion in an orderly fashion between now and December,   and maybe again between December and January  But having said all of that, Mr Chairman, I think   what to do and what to say today are fairly clear  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of 25 basis points  I   support the language in alternative B  On the issue of what we should say about the minutes, I   would caution all of us to be very careful because the real answer is we don’t know  To say much   more than “ongoing discussion” perhaps is signaling more than anyone wants to or should   On the question of whether or not we should wait until we’re fully done tightening before we   change the language, I think that will create an incredible gong reverberation that says, “Boy,   they’ve changed the language  They must think they’re really done”   In my view, the reality is that   if we change the language before we think we’re really done, then the language can evolve in a way   that may be more helpful   Having broken my sword on this issue over several years with the help of Don and then   Vincent, I, too, look forward [laughter] to seeing the wisdom of Vincent  And I admire the way he   will bite the hand that feeds him  [Laughter]  "
7853,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The concept of the known unknown came to   the national consciousness about a year or two ago, and I sense that it’s very much in this room today    The baseline forecast calls for a very nice, soft landing to potential growth with contained inflation if   we just tighten our policy one or two more turns  I’m certainly prepared to accept that forecast for the   purpose of today’s meeting, but the uncertainties or the known-unknown factors around it are to me   quite obvious  To me the risks are clearly to the upside with respect to growth, but surprisingly may   be more balanced with respect to inflation   It is easier to see an upside growth risk than a downside one, in large part because the   incoming data have been surprisingly robust, making a slowing just a quarter or two away seem a   little bit of a stretch  Much of the waning wealth effect on which the baseline is built is due to a   slowing in the housing market  It is true that some of the indicators suggest some moderation there,   including a slight edging off of mortgage applications and a souring of home-buying attitudes  But                                        December 13, 2005 56 of 100  when lined up against the actual strength shown in home sales themselves, both existing and new—   and also prices, which have continued to appreciate at a double-digit pace through the third quarter—   it is hard to say that the housing market is anything but robust   A second element of the wealth effect that the Greenbook assumes is that the equity price   appreciation will be no more than needed to keep the current level of the equity risk premium about   stable  But again, it is easy to see some upside potential here  The equity risk premium is now above   average  The recent run-up in equity prices, coupled with sustained high levels of productivity   growth, an attractive profits outlook, and healthy corporate balance sheets all make it perhaps a little   more likely that equity prices will rise rather than fall, and indeed, rise more than expected  If this   were to occur, the earnings-price ratio would decline and the equity risk premium would return to the   normal range, and in doing so would provide more equity wealth impetus to the economy than   perhaps the baseline assumes   Finally, global growth is a surprise to the upside  As Dino indicated, equity prices have   shown remarkable strength globally  Monetary policy itself has in many cases been somewhat   stimulative and generally financial conditions have been supportive of growth  All of this suggests a   bias toward faster global growth due to accommodative financial markets broadly   On inflation, I judge that the risks to the baseline forecast are perhaps a little better balanced    While the upside growth risk would certainly pressure resources with inflationary consequences, that   is not the entire story  For one thing, inflation has come in a little softer recently than we had   expected Secondly, energy prices seem to have flattened, and market participants expect them to   moderate even further, providing a rapid diminution of the upward momentum to headline inflation    Thirdly, import prices seem likely to remain contained; and for both energy prices and import prices,                         December 13, 2005 57 of 100  pass-through has been relatively low  Finally and importantly, longer-term inflation expectations are   moderate   I would also add in this regard something that has not been much discussed here Labor   compensation itself has been on the weaker side, even as resource utilization has tightened  And   finally, the productivity growth story, I think, has shown continued robustness  In this regard I’d   point out that we talk a great deal about the upward adjustment to the structural productivity growth in   the staff forecast, but all they’ve really done is just to maintain what has happened from 2001 to 2004    So maybe we’ve put too much weight on the temporary downward movement as opposed to just   recognizing that things haven’t changed very much   So given this view of the risks around the forecast, why do I propose that we accept the   baseline for purposes of today’s decision and communication?  First, I am mindful that policy works   with long and variable lags  While the risks for us are not totally balanced, the greater weight of the   evidence, I think, is still for a good outcome, given that we have moved rates up quite considerably    And with inflation expectations still well contained, I think there’s no reason to adjust market   perceptions of what we’re likely to do going forward  If those two facts did not adhere, my judgment   might be different   Secondly, one would have to say that while the housing sector story is yet to come, there are,   as we’ve heard around this table, a large number of anecdotes all pushing primarily in the same   direction—supporting, I would think, the baseline   Third, I take some comfort in the fact that the baseline forecast is shared roughly by most   outside forecasters  The Greenbook does not seem to be out of the trend  The Blue Chip consensus is   that after more than two years of above-trend growth, activity in 2006 is likely to moderate to its trend   rate and perhaps a bit below by the end of the year  Importantly, the fed funds assumptions that                                 December 13, 2005 58 of 100  underlie the Blue Chip are not distinguishable dramatically from the Greenbook forecast  President   Moskow has already talked about what happened in Chicago at their outlook symposium  Again, the   consensus seems quite consistent with our forecast from the staff  And the NABE members we met   with in this room not too long ago also expect growth to be in the range of 325 to 35 in 2006   Finally, I am willing to take the baseline as the basis for policy today because I recognize that   our language will convey the proper sense of caution to reflect the risks and leave us with the   flexibility to respond to other changes  I will delay any further comment on that, as you have   suggested, until the second part of our discussion   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I accept your recommendation for a 25   basis point move  On your analysis of asset prices, I think it is notable that over the last ten years—or   more than ten years—we’ve had a great moderation in both GDP and also inflation, but at the same                                           December 13, 2005 81 of 100  time, as you point out, asset volatility hasn’t come down  Actually, the price level with respect to   equities has gone up  This supports your thought that going forward we’re likely to be talking about   asset prices more, without targeting them   To the point of today’s discussion, I rather like alternative B, after the back and forth, as it sits   on the page  I think it is no longer fair to say that policy is accommodative  I believe we are close to   or well into the neutral range  In my view, most of the data that we’ve seen tend to support that   notion  If we take the reference to accommodative policy out, I think we do need to consider what is   appropriate for section 4, the forward-looking language  And, in particular, the phraseology “some   further measured policy firming is likely to be needed” strikes me as getting just the right balance, as I   think you were saying as well  The word “measured” I think has come to mean 25 basis points, and I   believe it’s important to hold on to that notion if we take out “accommodative”   Secondly, on the issue of how much more we have to do, I tend to think it may be one or two   more moves, similar to the expectation built into the Greenbook and the market, which strikes me as   appropriate in supporting the concept of “some further”  So, even though it’s a mouthful, I like the   “some further measured policy firming”   On the “may” versus “is likely,” I think it’s important to hold on to “is likely” because that’s   actually our best judgment—that further tightening is likely  If we get into January and we are much   less certain, then we can dial it back to “may”  But I think “is likely” is a more accurate signal and I   would support that wording   And finally, though people don’t focus on it too much, we have the escape valve that you just   talked about, the last sentence  We’ve gone through lots of iterations of this statement back and forth    One of our colleagues feels as though he’s been in a great tragedy or a comedy of errors  [Laughter]                                     December 13, 2005 82 of 100  But I think we’ve ended up in a reasonably good place, and I’d like to stick with the language of   alternative B as written, as you proposed  "
7875,2006-01-31,"  Thank you very much  I will do what is right  [Laughter]  Let me open   the floor now for nominations for a Chairman and a Vice Chairman of this Committee      Now, you’ll see what happens  [Laughter]  Don’t presume anything    Governor Kohn    Thank you very much  Is there a second?   PARTICIPANT  Second    Fine  Is there any discussion?  Is there any objection?  Hearing none, it   is unanimous  Congratulations  [Laughter]  Before democracy moves too quickly, [laughter] we   also have to move to plan for the election of a new Chairman  So let me, again, turn to Governor   Kohn    Thank you  Is there a second?  I do need a second on that   January 31, 2006 3 of 106    PARTICIPANT  I second    Thank you very much  Any objection?  Any discussion?  None  So we   will plan to do as Governor Kohn has suggested and hold a notation vote when a new Chairman is   sworn in for the Board of Governors  Mr Chairman, I now turn the floor back to you    Well, I’m actually not in full swing, because I don’t have the documents   in front of me  [Laughter]      Thank you  I need someone to move those names for election   PARTICIPANT  So moved    A second?   SEVERAL  Second    Any discussion?  Any objection?  So, again, those are elected   unanimously  Congratulations    I’ll move that nomination    So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Greenbook baseline presents a   relatively positive scenario  But as the 90 percent confidence interval given in the Greenbook   clearly indicates, there is considerable uncertainty around this baseline  In a theoretical world of   certainty equivalence, that range of uncertainty would not matter  But as you’ve taught us many   times, in the world of practical policymaking, how that uncertainty is resolved will matter   importantly for policy judgments   As a mere cadet, if you will, sitting next to the monetary policy Yoda, [laughter] I will   attempt to look at some of these uncertainties and to understand how they may unfold in their   implications for policy  Yoda, of course, is a complimentary word in my household  [Laughter]    One particularly salient aspect of uncertainty relates to the way that inflation expectations are   January 31, 2006 58 of 106    influenced by energy prices  As we’ve seen recently, despite spiking oil prices in December, near-  term inflation expectations remained stable or edged even somewhat lower, reversing the run-up   that we saw in the fall  As the presentation this morning showed, preliminary January Michigan   survey results for median inflation expectations for the coming year ticked down, and median five-   and ten-year inflation expectations also moved lower  Rate spreads from TIPS also indicated   remarkably contained inflation expectations despite oil price shocks   This stability is both remarkable and quite important, because, in my view at least, the   optimal course of monetary policy at this juncture depends critically on the fragility or stability of   inflation expectations in the presence of the oil price shock  I judge that, for now at least, this   important element of uncertainty supports a continued execution of the strategy we are following to   date, with no need to fear that we’re falling behind the curve, even as energy prices have spiked   again  Of course, with the slight rise in the near-term inflation outlook and, in fact, slight   deterioration in near-term inflation itself, prudence will require close monitoring of these variables   as we go forward  But thus far, I judge that the announced strategy is consistent with maintaining   our credibility   Second, as we discussed earlier, there is great uncertainty about why long-term rates are low   and what the shape and level of the yield curve may imply for us  As we saw in yesterday’s Board   briefing, forward nominal rates fairly far out in time have moved down over the past year, both here   and abroad, and are low today by historical standards  As we know, long-term rates are low today   partly because inflation expectations are low  If this were the whole story, short-term rates would   not need to depart from the historical terms or norms in real terms  But while this is part of the   story, it isn’t the whole story  As we’ve already discussed, if the shape of the yield curve and low   January 31, 2006 59 of 106    rates both indicated that market participants expected some further economic weakness, then the   proper response would be to run a looser-than-average monetary policy   But I agree, and I think most of us agree, with the staff assessment that the low real long-  term interest rate and a flat yield curve are not precursors to a global softening and an expected drop   in rates but rather are due to an unusually low term premium  In my judgment, part of the reason   for that low term premium is an increased assessment on the part of global investors that the future   looks like an environment involving less risk than usual  This was borne out I think in Dino’s pie   charts earlier on and also in the global equity markets  I’d also say, based on various conversations   I’ve had with central bankers in January on the various committees that I attend and others I attend   with the Chairman, there is a general sense in the world of policy that this low-risk assessment is   approximately right  However, I continue to think that these lower rates reflect some forces that are   holding back investment demand globally  And, for the United States, I think they also reflect a   drag from the external sector  However, with corporate balance sheets in good shape and global   growth firming, I don’t expect a sudden reassessment of risk and a rise in the term premium to result   from these sources   I do have some concern that we may see a snapback in term premiums from another source   that we’ve touched on a bit already, and that’s the third and final uncertainty I wish to look at, which   is the housing sector  Here I’d say that President Santomero’s comments in some sense preceded   and introduced mine  I don’t doubt that the housing market is slowing somewhat, but I do wonder   about the impact of a slowing of house prices and wealth extraction on household saving and   consumption  Here I pick up where Dave left off, which is that the models take a historical norm    Let’s say we’re at about the 3 percent that Dave indicated  I think there’s possibly a greater risk, for   reasons that Dave has already indicated, that we may find a much stronger impact on the global   January 31, 2006 60 of 106    economy, certainly on the US economy, based on a slowing of housing prices  And here, though I   recognize their economies are different, I am still somewhat troubled by the experience in the   United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands, all of which had an unexpectedly large impact,   from a GDP standpoint, from a relatively slow flattening of house prices  I recognize that these   other economies are different from ours, but I’d also say that we’ve seen even in our own economy   some nonlinearities that have emerged—for example, as asset prices moved down relatively   rapidly—that might have surprised us in the past   So what’s the implication of all of these uncertainties?  I’d like to put three things on the   table for this meeting  First, I continue to believe, as I think the Greenbook or the Bluebook does,   that the equilibrium real rate has, in fact, moved down somewhat on average, to lower than it was,   let’s say, over the past ten years, with the exception of the recessionary periods of 2001 and 2002    Second, I firmly believe, as do many of you, that we are well within the range of neutrality at this   stage  And, third, since I would say there’s a great deal of uncertainty here, I want to make sure that   what we say, both in word and in deed, reflects a great deal of flexibility  I heard Vice Chairman   Geithner suggest that we want to put out some words that say it’s probable that we’ll move at the   next meeting  I suggest that we be a little more nuanced and put out some words that suggest it’s at   least possible that we move at the next meeting   Having said all of that, obviously, I, along with everyone else, think that what happens   going forward will be extraordinarily data-dependent  All the more reason for us to keep, if you   will, our powder dry and our options open  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    Do you want to go around first?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation of 25 basis   points  I rather like moving the operative forward-looking language to “may” as opposed to “may   well” because I think it frees the markets to look much more at the data, as they would do naturally   January 31, 2006 73 of 106    anyway  I do think it’s at least 50–50, as Governor Kohn said, maybe a little bit more, but I think   “may” covers us well enough for March   On the procedural point, I obviously agree with the consensus in the room that we should   postpone this until the March meeting  I must express some uncertainty about how we vote on an   entire statement and directive as a group of nineteen  So I would have a tendency toward the status   quo, but that just may be because I’m inappropriately conservative and not appropriately   imaginative  So let me stop at that and move on to the next person  "
