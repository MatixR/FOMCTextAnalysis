  No, I don't think there is unless you pin down--    2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  John and I will be sharing  our briefing this morning, and we will be referring to the material that was handed out  earlier entitled “Board Staff Presentation on the Implications of the Zero Bound on  Nominal Interest Rates”  This afternoon, we will report on work that we have  undertaken in the past few years on the implications for monetary policy of the zero  bound on nominal interest rates  In these efforts, we have benefited from research  carried out by others at the Board, the Reserve Banks, and economists outside the  System  With short-term interest rates unusually low and the economy still weak, the  question arises as to what might happen if further deterioration were to set in   Specifically, might the Committee find itself pushing the funds rate to zero in the near  future, and wishing it could do more, in an attempt to combat rising unemployment  and falling inflation?  Your first exhibit presents one scenario illustrating how this  might occur     We start with the extended staff outlook that appeared in the Bluebook, shown as  the solid black lines in the panels In this baseline, as the economy continues to  recover past 2003, the need for monetary stimulus gradually diminishes, and so the  nominal funds rate rises to 4 percent by mid-decade  Now suppose share prices were  to drop almost 50 percent by this summer—a big drop to be sure, but one that would  still leave the P-E ratio for the S&P500 above its historical average  If the Committee  aggressively responded to weakening activity and the implied fall in the economy’s  equilibrium real rate, the nominal funds rate—the red line—would fall to zero  quickly Even so, and assuming the funds rate remained at zero for two years, the  FRB/US model predicts that the unemployment rate would still continue to climb  through 2003 and would not fall below 6 percent until late 2004  In response to such  heightened labor market slack, the downward trajectory of core CPI inflation would  be more pronounced than in the baseline As indicated by the first bullet in the  bottom panel, this scenario highlights a current vulnerability of monetary policy  In  some plausible future situations, you may not be able to take the nominal funds rate  as low as you would like So, while some deterioration in economic performance  following a stock market crash would be inevitable, the zero bound accentuates the  damage  This point is illustrated in the top and middle panels by the blue lines, which  show what would happen if it were possible to drive the funds rate below zero  In  this imaginary world, the nominal funds rate turns negative for a time, yielding a  smaller increase in the unemployment rate and less of a decline in inflation   2 Materials used by Mr Reifschneider and Mr Williams are appended to this document (appendix 2)                   January 29-30, 2002 Page 12 of 194  The fact that prices fall more rapidly when policy is constrained by the zero  bound has important consequences The reason is that declining inflation with the  nominal funds rate stuck at zero causes the real funds rate to rise—as the red line in  the middle right panel shows for late 2002 through early 2004  This unintended  policy tightening exacerbates the rise in unemployment and under extreme conditions  can become self-reinforcing  Still, the economy in this example does eventually  recover because the baseline outlook embodies strengthening demand and tightening  monetary policy, so that after a time the nominal funds rate is high enough to enable  policy to be quite stimulative if necessary—even if not quite as much as you might  like in all circumstances  But if the baseline outlook were for a much weaker  recovery and instead showed the nominal funds rate, say, remaining flat at its current  level, then the ability of the economy to right itself in the event of a major disturbance  would be called into question   Your next exhibit takes a more general look at the economics of the problems  posed by the zero bound In conducting our research, we have made three important  assumptions  First, we assume that monetary policy affects real activity in the short­ to-medium run primarily through its ability to move the current and anticipated level  of the real funds rate and, therefore, real bond rates and other asset prices through  arbitrage Second, we assume that the so-called quantity effects of monetary policy  are not that important; in particular, changes in the monetary base have little or no  direct influence on real activity or inflation  (I should note that Marvin will have  more to say on this subject) Third, we assume that inflation displays considerable  inertia and depends on inflation expectations and the level of resource utilization,  among other factors     As noted in the middle portion of the panel, under these assumptions the zero  bound has three main effects  First, it limits the monetary stimulus that can be  employed to offset a contractionary shock  If the nominal rate can go only as low as  zero, the real funds rate can be driven only to the negative of the current inflation rate   Second, the constraint on policymaker action causes resource utilization and the  inflation rate both to move lower than they otherwise would in the wake of an adverse  shock As was noted earlier, if the situation is severe enough, this can become a self- reinforcing downward spiral, with falling resource utilization pushing inflation down  further and falling inflation pushing real interest rates higher, putting yet more  downward pressure on resource utilization  Under extreme conditions, this  unintended erosion in the real funds rate will continue unchecked to produce a  deflationary trap   The practical importance of this threat to stability depends on several factors,  which are listed in the bottom portion of the panel  First, the less responsive are  output and inflation to changes in the real funds rate, the greater the amount of  maneuvering room needed to offset any disturbances that might come along  Second,  the greater the magnitude and persistence of shocks hitting the economy, the greater  the range of funds-rate variation required to maintain stable employment and                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 13 of 194  inflation Third, the slower a central bank moves to head off excessive economic  weakness, the greater the risk that a deflationary spiral will develop  Lastly, the  lower the average amount of room to adjust the funds rate, the greater the risk of  being constrained by the zero bound In part, the size of this average cushion is  outside your control, because it depends on the real interest rate consistent with stable  inflation and full employment in the long run—our so-called r*  However, you can  influence the cushion’s size through your choice of how low to drive the average rate  of inflation   Your next exhibit provides a quantitative assessment of the implications of the  zero bound for economic stability  This assessment closely follows the approach that  we took two years ago in the paper that we prepared for the System conference on the  subject and that was distributed to you last week  As noted in the upper panel, our  goal is to estimate the effect on average economic performance of lowering the target  rate of inflation which, as I just noted, influences the relevance of the zero bound   Our approach to estimating these effects is to simulate FRB/US, subject to random  shocks similar to those experienced over the past thrity-five years  In these  simulations, we assume that households and firms form their expectations in a  forward-looking manner that takes full account of the systematic behavior of  monetary policy By simulating the model over and over, we can compile a large set  of pseudo “histories” of the economy, from which we calculate statistics on average  performance  We run each of these simulations under the assumption that monetary  policy responds to changes in economic conditions according to the Taylor rule, in  which the nominal funds rate, denoted by “I”, is set equal to the sum of four terms—  the equilibrium real interest rate r*, the rate of inflation, one-half the current output  gap, and one-half the difference between actual and target inflation    Two main lessons from this exercise are summarized in the middle panel  First, at  low target rates of inflation, the funds rate falls to zero frequently  This can be seen  in line 1 of the table at the bottom of the page, which shows the percent of time the  funds rate is at zero for three different core CPI inflation targets—0 percent,  2 percent, and 4 percent Our simulated policymaker puts the nominal funds rate at  zero nearly 30 percent of the time with an inflation target of zero, but only about  10 percent of the time with an inflation target of 2 percent and only 3 percent of the  time if the target is 4 percent  Returning to the middle panel, the second lesson to  come out of these simulations is that economic performance deteriorates in our model  when the inflation target is below 2 percent or so  One manifestation of this  deterioration is an increase in the variability of the unemployment rate, shown in line  2 of the table As the target inflation rate rises from zero to 2 percent, the standard  deviation of the unemployment rate drops sharply from 18 to 15 percentage points   But a further increase in the inflation target to 4 percent has only a small effect on the  standard deviation of the unemployment rate  A similar break in performance at an  inflation target of about 2 percent is evident in line 3, which shows the frequency of  deep recessions Here, the number of major downturns expected per 100 years falls  from 5¼ to about 4½ when the inflation target is raised from zero to 2 percent but  then slips by only a small amount if the target is raised further to 4 percent  Although                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 14 of 194  these numerical results are specific to the FRB/US model, other models yield  qualitatively similar findings  John Williams will now continue our presentation    One of the unnerving things about working on this is exactly   the problem that you pointed to at first, which is that we have models that were fit over a period   where we didn’t hit the zero bound at any point in time  Now we’re running simulations in   which we drive the nominal fed funds rate into a region where there’s a very pronounced   nonlinearity, the zero bound When we run the model—and as you said, it’s a mostly linear   model, although we can run it in ways that have certain nonlinearities in it—at that point it’s not   linear, and all sorts of odd things start happening  We worried a lot about how far to push these   results and how generally applicable they are because certain changes to the model can make the   problem less severe and certain changes to the model can make the problem a lot more severe    We listed some of those at the beginning of our remarks     If you think that the economy in terms of real activity is a lot more interest sensitive than   we have built into the model, then you’d be more sanguine about the zero-bound problem  In   that regard I’m fairly confident that we’re probably okay because interest sensitivity in our   model, if anything, tends to be on the high side of what a lot of people think  The area in which   we often get into the most discussion with other people about whether we’ve got it right is   inflation dynamics in the model  If you think that inflation dynamics don’t work this way and   you believe that some other mechanism comes into play—and one possibility here is that   increasing the growth in the monetary base would have a direct effect on inflation expectations—   that’s a very different world than the one portrayed by the model  In terms of expectations—   how people would respond to rates hitting the zero bound and what they would think about   where policy is going—we have agents behaving very rationally in the model  Under some              January 29-30, 2002 Page 25 of 194  conditions, these rational expectations stabilize the system, and under some circumstances they   actually lead the system to instability because people look at the situation and say “Oh my   heavens, policymakers are getting themselves into a problem that they can’t get out of”  In   running the simulations, in order to keep the model from crashing into “great depression”   scenarios when expectations become this pessimistic, we have to have operating in the   background the assumption that under very extreme conditions the fiscal authorities come to the   rescue   Under other expectational assumptions it is possible to have a situation where the   problem would be less severe because people don’t realize the trouble they could get into  They   don’t realize the implications of the situation, and that particular form of ignorance or rule of   thumb behavior is actually stabilizing  One can envision other examples where people   extrapolate forward and don’t see the potential for getting out of this difficulty in some of the   ways we discussed, and as a result things are a lot worse    So my general remark on this is that we did the best we could, though we’re extremely   uncertain about what would actually take place at the zero bound  Our only real guide is to look   back at either the Great Depression of the United States or at the more recent experience of   Japan Taking the Japanese experience, we at least know that if we hit the zero bound it leads to   a poorer macro performance than we would like  So in that sense we think it’s a real problem    Whether it’s as severe as it becomes in some of our simulations is something I’m not so sure   about    I think I agree—I’ll speak for myself and John can chime in—   with everything you said One point we deliberately didn’t emphasize in our presentation is that   following the generally more aggressive rule produces behavior for the last year that looks   remarkably like the decline in the fed funds rate that actually occurred  Now, I’m not saying that   that’s how monetary policy was made last year  But it just so happens that if you had been using   that kind of rule and you thought that was how policy behaved, you wouldn’t have been   surprised by the speed at which the fed funds rate came down in 2001  So in that sense, your   view is broadly consistent with the model we presented     Second, the Committee probably would never want to go as low as the zero inflation   target for core CPI shown in our example because of the bias in it and for all sorts of other   reasons And if you thought that core PCE inflation of 1½ percent seemed okay, well that’s   equivalent to the 2 percent that we were talking about  So that’s the same  Finally, I don’t know   how enthusiastic we really are about the promise to run higher inflation down the road that we   show as one strategy I think our view would be that it certainly wouldn’t hurt, and at least it     January 29-30, 2002 Page 32 of 194  would be better than some of the public statements made by Bank of Japan officials when they   assured the public that they weren’t going to let inflation get out of hand  I’m not sure there was   much point in saying that I suspect it was counterproductive, although it may not have done any   great harm  In any event, it’s not wise for the central bank to say that it is in favor of staying   with a zero inflation target under those deflationary circumstances    So a ten-year bond would be pricing in a deflation rate of   5 percent five years out, but it would also be pricing in an inflation rate that would be back to   zero ten years out    That’s why that never actually occurs in a simulation  While   you could be driving down expected long-run rates on a riskless security close to zero, for   private investment these endogenous risk premiums are going up because the health of the   economy is not good in that state of the world  So I think in principle, if you could somehow get   rid of that risk, you could mitigate these slumps by quite a bit in that world  But what   exacerbates those slumps in the world that we’re simulating here is that the risk premiums on   private assets—the default premiums—are rising  And that’s not a small effect, actually    It might even have been more than one-for-one because the   expected default risks might have been dropping under those conditions
