7677,2005-02-01," If the Committee chose to specify a numerical price- related objective, it would need to resolve a number of operational issues—the  subject of your next exhibit The top left panel of the exhibit presents a checklist of  these issues The first item is the choice of a price index  We favor consumer prices  on several grounds shown in the top right panel  On the practical front, indexes of  consumer prices are probably the most familiar to the public and the best measured  From a theoretical perspective, the costs of inflation relate to many different sorts of  prices But because inflation rates generally move together in the long run,  anchoring some measure of consumer price inflation would, for the most part, pin  down other broad measures of inflation as well   The second item on the checklist is the choice between inflation control,  where “bygones are bygones” with respect to inflation surprises, and price-level  control, where such surprises are eventually offset  I will not review the pros and  cons of these approaches here, but simply repeat our conclusion in the paper that, if  the Committee were to go down this road, an inflation-based strategy probably  makes the most sense at this point   The chief factors bearing on the third decision on the checklist—the average  inflation rate—are highlighted in the middle panel  One consideration is  measurement bias  The Board’s staff estimates that the CPI overstates changes in the  cost of living nearly 1 percentage point per year and that the change in PCE [personal  consumption expenditures] prices is biased upward about ½ percentage point per  year In framing your objective in terms of a published index, you will want to take  this bias into account Turning to true inflation, the rationales for aiming for zero are  simply the traditional costs of inflation, including money illusion, relative-price  confusion, and imperfect indexation of the tax code  The chief rationales for positive  true inflation are downward nominal wage rigidity and the zero lower bound on  nominal interest rates                             February 1-2, 2005 10 of 177  Analyses of microeconomic wage data suggest that individuals have a special  distaste for nominal wage cuts, raising the possibility that lower inflation could lead  to a higher equilibrium rate of unemployment  Yet, such downward rigidity has left  little imprint on macroeconomic outcomes, at least so far, as low inflation over the  past 15 years has not been associated with elevated unemployment  However, this  phenomenon might matter more in the future if productivity growth slows or  inflation moves even lower, because either of those developments would push a  larger share of equilibrium nominal wage changes below zero   Another cost of very low inflation is that the equilibrium nominal interest  rate could decline to a level that would limit the Committee’s scope for cutting rates  The table in the bottom panel presents illustrative estimates of the effect of the zero  bound based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model  For these estimates,  we assume that monetary policy follows an updated Taylor rule with a larger  coefficient on the output gap that better matches the responsiveness of the funds rate  to output movements since the late 1980s    If, as shown in the rightmost column, the bias-adjusted inflation objective is  2 percent, the funds rate equals zero just 6 percent of the time, and the standard  deviation of the output gap is 22 percentage points As the inflation objective falls,  the funds rate is constrained at zero an increasing percentage of the time, causing  economic performance to deteriorate at an increasing rate  For example, with a bias- adjusted objective of zero—in the left column—the funds rate is pinned at zero  16 percent of the time, and the standard deviation of the output gap rises to  25 percentage points To be sure, there are alternative ways to implement monetary  policy if the funds rate becomes stuck at zero  But these alternatives are much less  familiar than traditional policy actions and therefore less predictable in their effects   To sum up our analysis of the optimal long-run inflation rate, we read the  admittedly scant evidence as suggesting that a cushion of 1 percentage point on true  inflation would provide sufficient insurance against the costs associated with the zero  lower bound and downward nominal wage rigidity without imposing a high cost  through the other effects of inflation However, the results from the literature are not  so precise as to rule out other figures in the neighborhood of 1 percent as  representing a sensible balance between these competing considerations   The last item on the checklist is the choice between a point objective and a  range One virtue of a point objective would be its simplicity; there could be little  confusion about where the Committee preferred the inflation rate ultimately to be  heading On the other hand, the Committee might prefer a range for several reasons  to communicate the variability of inflation, to allow for uncertainty about the  appropriate numerical value, to encompass divergent views among Committee  members, or to express a “zone of indifference” about the inflation rate  As we note  in the paper, the economic consequences of announcing a range rather than a point                          February 1-2, 2005 11 of 177  objective would depend on why the Committee chose a range and how it explained  that range to the public   Your fourth exhibit considers the accuracy with which the FOMC could  achieve an inflation objective Because inflation is volatile and because monetary  policy influences it only indirectly and with a lag, the Committee could not hit a  point objective precisely or guarantee to keep inflation within a narrow range To  assess the likely accuracy with which inflation could be controlled, we use stochastic  simulations of the FRB/US model   The table in the middle panel shows results for a variety of alternative  assumptions  The first row uses the shocks that are estimated to have occurred  between 1968 and 2004 Under these conditions, total PCE inflation averaged over  four quarters could be held within plus or minus 1 percentage point of the desired  rate 59 percent of the time, and core PCE inflation could be held in the same interval  64 percent of the time  If the volatility of economic shocks were lower—in line with  the 1984 to 2004 experience—the Committee would be able to control inflation  somewhat more precisely, as shown in the second row  Indeed, total PCE inflation  on a four-quarter basis has been within 1 percentage point of its average level almost  70 percent of the time since the mid-1980s and nearly all of the time since the mid­ 1990s   A key uncertainty about the inflation process, and thus an important risk to  these figures, is the nature of expectations formation  The first two rows of the table  assume that expectations follow a simple vector autoregression [VAR] in which the  public’s long-run forecast of inflation responds gradually to actual inflation and is  not influenced by FOMC announcements  Row 3 just repeats the results from row 2,  with the label emphasizing that expectations are VAR-based with imperfect  credibility surrounding any announcement of a long-run inflation objective  In row  4, we continue to assume that near-term expectations are formed using a VAR, but  we assume that long-term expectations are perfectly pinned down by the FOMC’s  announced objective In this case, four-quarter total PCE inflation stays within a 1  percentage point band 80 percent of the time   The Committee could tighten its control of inflation, relative to the results  discussed so far, by responding more aggressively to movements in inflation and  output However, as shown in the paper, this effect is fairly small  All told, as noted  in the bottom panel, the Committee could likely keep four-quarter total PCE inflation  within a plus or minus 1 percentage point band about two-thirds to three-quarters of  the time  "
