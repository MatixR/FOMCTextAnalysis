 Mr Chairman, I favor alternative II for 1995 and alternative I for 1996 In terms of the last point that we were just discussing, assuming that we will have to respond to some type of legislative initiative, I think it would be desirable for us to try to get ahead of the curve, as you were anticipating in your earlier comments Perhaps we could have staff work done to identify some options and some specific language that we could plan to consider at a special meeting or at an extended meeting as you suggested     Mr Chairman?  I congratulate you, too, Vincent, but may I make one   minor suggestion?
